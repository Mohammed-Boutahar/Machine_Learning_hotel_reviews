We stayed at the Ameritania for our first trip to New York for a week! The Deluxe King is definitely spacious enough for two people! We stayed in room 915, upon check in the receptionist (forgot his name) mentioned that next door at the bar there is a comedy night every night and we decided to check if we had any noise from it. It was actually pretty okay the comedy night was only from 20:30 till 22:00 and we didn’t mind but if you are a light and early sleeper than I would suggest asking for a different room. The only thing we missed but knew about was the coffee and tea facility in the room, but you are able to get coffee in the morning in the lobby!  We enjoyed our stay very much and the hotel has an excellent location! But please go to Hell’s Kitchen for dinner options as we;4
Arrived late last night, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, my room was upgraded to a bigger one, and had a deliciously hot shower and tumbled into the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Though it's on a noisy street I couldn't hear a thing (third floor). It's right by Carnegie Hall, the Ed Sullivan Theatre and MoMA. recommended!;5
This hotel is well located and the staff is the best, the check in was perfect and they upgraded our room. If you are looking for a safe hotel in NYC, you can go with no hesitation. A special thanks to JEFF. He gave us the best advices and was always available to help. MERCI Ameritania Hotel, we will come back soon.;5
The hotel is old but it’s clean and hospitable staff, especially the bellboy JEFF and other guys, polite staff, even the housekeepers, hotel is very accesible to all , thank you! I’ll invite/ refer to other frienfs;5
Just writing this whilst waiting to fly home from Newark airport, we stayed at The Ameritania after a recommendation from our travel agent and reading TA reviews, the hotel sits nicely in between Central Park and Times Square so we found it to be quite nicely placed, we had room 417 which was quiet as far as the noise of NYC although there was a constant hum from the air conditioning unit outside (ear plugs worked a treat) and our view was shocking (a wall) !, the room although dated was clean and had all we needed, a comfortable bed a decent shower, clean towels, safe, iron and ironing board even an umbrella to use, it could have done with some more storage for your clothes, there was no breakfast at the hotel which suited us as we wanted to eat out, there was complimentary tea;4
This hotel is very well situated, near to Times Square and Central Park. We really felt safe and considered in this hotel : from the checkin to the check out, everything was perfect. A very big thank you to Jeff that welcomed us so well, and booked our taxi to go back to JFK Airport. He answered all the questions we had, and was always available. A very big thank you to the reception team too, that has been so nice to us, and welcomed us very well. The room was clean and confortable. We slept very well on the bed, and the pillow was very comfortable.  We will go back to Ameritania at Times Square for sure !!! Thank you once again to all the team of this wonderful hotel !;5
Stayed for 3 nights. Room size was ok, working desk and small fridge  were really helpful and the barhrokm was great. Service was good, helpful staff, and the location is great. Only problem was the noise from outside as windows do not block it.;4
My partner and I stayed for one night to celebrate our new jobs. The staff was wonderful from the first time we walked in, all the way to check out. Special shout-out to Hugo, who was super attentive and accommodating! He elevated our experience.;5
Cute little boutique hotel.   Great location.  Very close to Times Square. Room was very small but it was fine as we were hardly in it.  Would stay here again as the location was perfect for us.  The hotel is attached to the Steven Colbert show building.;4
We recently had an overnight stay at the Americana at Times Square. We had a great experience! Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. One stand out employee was Iceiz, at the front desk. She was smiling and friendly, and answered all of our questions!! We will definitely stay here again!;5
とても良いホテルでした。女性ひとり旅でしたが、ホテルが安全な場所にあるので深夜でも安心して過ごせました。スタッフも親切で、特にMajid さんには助けていただき、感謝です。部屋は広くて心地よく、ベッドもシャワーも最高でした。ロケーションはマンハッタン中心地ですので、地下鉄もシアターも近いし本当に便利です。しかもビートルズ全米デビューで有名なエドサリバンシアターが隣にあります。 次回ニューヨークへ来たときにはまた必ず滞在したいです。すばらしいサービスに感謝いたします。 I had a great vacation .The hotel was very clean and accommodating.  I stayed here all alone, but I was relieved even in the   middle of the night because this hotel is located in a safe area.  All the staff were very helpful, Especially Mr.Majid helped me a lot , I really appreciate his kindness.  The room was warm, cozy and clean, The bed and pillows were fabulous and comfortable , and the bathroom was a great size.  The location is great and very easy to walk to many attractions. Close to all subway lines and theaters. Furthermore its next to;5
I will stay here again. And again. Great location, friendly people, Room was small (I booked a small room) but very nice, modern in a New York  way, Great bathroom. And all the action and restaurants you could wish for just out the door. For the price this is the place to stay. Next to Colberts theatre and Gallaghers Steakhouse.;4
This review is for Iceiz and Shay. These ladies are the epitome of great customer service! We had recently taken a trip to NYC for the holidays and it was unexpectedly extended due to the whole Southwest Airlines debacle. These wonderful ladies not only gave us a great rate because of the issues outside of our control, but they let us check into our room early so we could make our sons basketball game!! The whole staff is great but these two went the extra mile and it was very much appreciated! I love the Ameritania and is my preferred hotel when we stay in NYC!;5
So I can't lie the hotel pictures online are much nicer,they were clearly taken when it was first refurbished, it's nice enough but the place has wear and tear now,if your from UK it's premier Inn vibes,but it was clean and a absolutely fantastic comfy bed which you need as new york is alot of walking,but the one thing I can say with my chest is the staff are all amazing, welcoming and friendly with great advice and honest opinions, Iceiz and Jeff where the best ever and helped us navigate NY with ease and every suggestion they had didn't fail us, Jeff even drew us out a map of what to do and how to navigate the subway, the two of them made our trip and I couldn't thank them enough, lovely people and professional with such nice vibes,this hotel is such a great location it's;4
The hotel is conveniently located in Times Square South and very easy to get to by train. You’re walking distance to many attractions in midtown. Leaving the hotel, it took us only 10-15mins to walk from one side of Times Square to the next. The hotel itself was a bit worn. The windows in our room were covered in grim from the outside, making them opaque. There were loose tiles in the bathroom, rips in the wallpaper, and many of the installations like the towel racks kept falling off the walls. I also hate when a hotel uses a top sheet, instead of a fitted sheet for the mattress. This leaves parts of the mattress exposed. But, all of these issues were mostly aesthetic. The shower and bathroom were huge. The ceiling, super high. The rainfall shower head was so luxurious. The bed;3
Me and my friend came here from Long Island looking for a fun weekend, we had a lot of stuff coming since we planned on doing a bunch in the time we were here. Majid at the front desk was an absolute amazing help. He made staying in this hotel a full 5 star experience with everything he accommodated us with. Couldn’t ask for a better experience;5
Great location, super helpful staff, very clean and comfortable. Not fancy and a little dated but economical and just perfect for us - walking distance to everything but at the same time a few steps away from the mayhem of Times Square. Satisfied customers!;4
"Location, location, location — Ameritania was the perfect base camp for my wife and I to see three Broadway plays in two days. We also had tickets to watch a live taping of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was around the corner from the hotel. And one of the plays was on the same block! Add a real bargain of a rate; a comfortable, modern lobby and room, and a friendly and professional staff, and we were thoroughly pleased. Bravo!";5
Cozy, clean room and great front desk service!! Shay took good care of us!  Can’t beat the location if you are interested in staying in Midtown.  Close to all subway lines and theaters.  For restaurants, go over to Hells Kitchen and check out the plethora of choices on 9th Avenue.;5
Best sleep ever! Best staff ever, especially Majid, but they all made us feel at home. Best shower. Very nice amenities and decor. Perfect location. AND very reasonable. Have already recommended this hotel to friends . 👍🏻;5
Hotel was near to the central attraction!  10-12 mins walk to times square and the 5th, also near to the central park..   The room was tidy and clean,  they have a very great staff in concierge, receptionist and also the Helpful and Handy Mr. JEFF him self.   You can get the daily hot milk and tea during this winter season, everything was so exciting and definitely i’ll be back someday.  It’s fun to celebrate NEW YEAR EVE in this hotel.;5
We stayed here just this week for three nights and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location to many of NYC key sites and several awesome places to eat.  Just blocks away from Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and other key locations makes it a good choice for anyone wanting to visit NYC. The room was plenty large for the 2 of us.  The bathroom was modern with awesome water pressure and great fixtures - the rain showerhead was sweet.  The bed was a little soft for our liking but not uncomfortable by any means. Typical NYC noises were noticed but again, nothing that was annoying or bothered us at all.  The room/hotel decor is a modern mix of colors and textures that make it fun compared to some of the often times stale chain hotels. I'd asked the hotel to;4
Amazing place, quirky interior, warm inside, staff really friendly and helpful. Jeff is great, ask him anything and you will be sorted.  The hotel is in a great location on Broadway half way between Times Square and Central Park. Loved it.  Great place.  Amy and Pete;5
Our experience at the Ameritania was phenomenal! The people were extremely friendly and helpful! A special shout-out to Mikey, Majid, and Hassib! They made sure our stay was wonderful and went above and beyond! We especially appreciated the food suggestions in Koreatown! The hotel was very conveniently located and easy to get around the city. The room was clean and housekeeping made sure we had what we needed and that our room was clean. The doorman (who briefly lived in Minnesota) was very friendly and helpful as well and we really liked that we were able to store our luggage before and after check in so we could enjoy the city! If we make it back to NYC, we will definitely stay again!;5
We stayed the week before Christmas 2022. We found the hotel to be very conveniently located between Times Square and Central Park, each less than half a mile away and a subway station across the road. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Jeff the doorman. The hotel itself was very good, with nice rooms and a great view of Broadway from our bedroom window. I can’t fault it in any way, would definitely recommend.;4
"We stayed in the ""Ameritania at Times Square"" on the corner of W 54th Street and Broadway, for 5 nights in December 2022, the hotel is well situated for the Metro (nearest station entrance is on W 53rd and Broadway) and about 4 blocks from Columbus circle (Central Park).   The hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable - especially the beds - could do with a matrass like that on my bed at home! the only issue was the lack of heating in the bathroom - if you can, leave the door ajar and the heat from the bedroom will sort it out :) our room was on the 8th floor, had a fridge along with a TV and a safe, I read somewhere that it doubled as a ""laptop safe"" but it wasn't big enough, the rooms are safe but if you are nervous and you have a laptop you could always invest in a";5
Loved this hotel! Very central location for Times Square and it had a lovely Christmas feel with the decorations and music playing in the lobby. The doormen were fantastic and couldn't praise them enough so friendly and helpful! Special mention to Jeff for his assistance throughout our stay. Will definitely book next time we are visiting!;5
If you travel to NYC frequently, you know that hotel rates can be high and rooms can be small. In the case of the Ameritania deluxe king, the room was a very generous size for NYC and the price (during festive season) was reasonable.   The room itself has correct amenities for a three star property (for example, don’t expect slippers) and I was especially grateful for the mini-fridge to store insulin. I also appreciated that it had an overhead light as well as lamps—so many hotels don’t actually have lights in the ceiling. There were also lots of hangers in the closet, another wonderful surprise in an era of Euro-“design” hotels who think you don’t need anything more than a couple of pegs on the wall. There was also a huge full length mirror as well as heavy curtains and good;4
This hotel had the perfect location. I took my boys to NYC for 5 days earlier in December and they were able to navigate to Times Square and around the area no problem. Being right next to the Ed Sullivan Theatre and the Colbert added to the cool factor. The room wasn't huge, but we didn't expect that in Manhattan.   We got a decently priced clean, lovely hotel right in the middle of all the action as far as they were concerned. And Jeff the doorman saved me a fortune by teaching me how to use the Metro lol. He was so helpful! He arranged our transport to the airport and made us feel so welcome!  Definitely a great launching point for an action packed holiday.;4
Thank you Sedik, Majid & Anabelle for going above & beyond to make our stay so special. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. The staff is helpful & friendly. Rooms are clean & comfortable. I will stay at Ameritania in the future!;5
The Ameritania is my favorite hotel in NYC. It’s location is unbeatable, the rooms are lovely and most importantly, the staff is the friendliest you will find! I want to personally thank Sedik, Majid, and Anabelle for their amazing customer service. Anabelle gave us a beautiful room on the 10th floor that was nice and quiet. Sedik and Majid always take such good care of me. It almost feels like family! Warm, welcoming and relaxed energy, from providing me with bottled water, hot tea and extending my stay last minute - this staff is top notch! I had such an amazing stay, I brought my Mom back one month later! Thank you for making us feel welcome and at home Ameritania. We look forward to seeing you all again soon!;5
Great service by desk staff and concierge, Jeffrey.  Jeffrey set us up with transportation and great advice on nearby places to eat, etc. The room met our needs, bedding was great. Location was perfect.;5
Seems to be the only hotel in NYC that hasn't bothered at all with decorations. No lights outside, no Christmas tree, just one menorah and a couple of flowers in the lobby. Really depressing returning here after seeing all the other hotel frontages and lobbies, would not recommend for a festive vacation.;1
We had a great stay in NEw York. The hotel is clean and perfectly situated for discovering the city. Near to Central Park, subway station. In the same street you have a Starbucks and the three monkeys and the black iron burger such are great affordable cafe and restaurant.   “The guy” at door, a true gentleman called Jeff gave us great advise and saved us money, expensive taxi rides and time in sorting things out on our day of arrival. He was at the door, and at our service a the time. 🍀;5
The hotel experience was amazing overall! It really was a home away from our home during our stay in NYC. Amazing location, free coffee or tea in the morning. Staff super helpful. The bed so comfy! I’m confident to say we had the best sleeps ever there!  Shower amazing too! And so many amenities including complementary water, toiletries, iron and ironing board.  Also we can not mention Jeff! So helpful! He helped us with our luggage after we checked out and booked us a taxi to the airport. Saved us some dollar as we meant to book an Uber and he found a cheaper solution! It’s a great place to stay if you’re traveling to NYC, would definitely recommend. Very good price for what you get too.;5
The Ameritania completely exceeded our expectations! A well decorated Queen sized room was perfect as a base for my daughter's 21st birthday trip to New York.  The lobby looked  like the photos but probably looked more classy in person with ample seating and was beautifully decorated.  Coffee was served in the mornings between 9 & 10am. At the time of our visit the bar wasn't open.   The bedroom was beautifully decorated and the wet room was enormous! A fantastic double shower provided plentiful hot water and the central heating could be personally adapted to suit the individual's needs depending on who was staying in the room.    There was a safety deposit box and the queen sized bed was honestly like sleeping on clouds.    Shower gel, body lotion and shampoo/conditioner came;5
I'd like to say a huge THANK YOU to Majid, who was very respectful and understanding, he helped us find what we were looking for and i couldnt thank him enough! He even gave us recommandations of where to eat and what we must see!!   From Julien.A;5
Where should I start, we arrived at the hotel early in hoping we can leave our suitcases there before heading out for lunch with our friends. No one from the valet team assisted us with our luggage and we had to take care of ourselves, carrying everything to the front desk.  The first lady who checked us in when we arrived early at 2pm before the hotel’s standard check-in time have a very bad attitude, was very rude, no smile on her face. I tried my best to take a deep breath and ignore her poor behavior and go out for lunch with my friends.  We returned to the hotel after lunch around 6 pm to complete our check-in and get settled in our room. The second man who helped us was very rude, with no smile on his face and no simple greeting words such as “Good afternoon” He seems to;1
We have been  in ameritania for 1 week last month,  the people at the front desk were very kind especially Mr majid and Mr saddik, they were very responsive to our  needs and request,  regarding the location of the hotel i found it to be perfect and close to all the interesting places to visit in Manhattan, the room was very clean, the sleeping experience was outstanding.  i will surely stay in this hotel  if I visit new york next time.  Said from Casablanca;5
The staff was outstanding.  In particular Jeff was very helpful in all areas.   The best shower I have ever had hands down in any hotel.  I want one of those shower heads!  The room was nicely decorated and roomy.  The room darkening shades kept the room pitch black.  The beds and pillows were fabulous.  I only stayed one night but I wish I could have stayed much longer.  So happy with this hotel.  Highly recommend.  5 Stars!;5
Good hotel at an excellent location.  MY EXPERIENCE  Stayed there comfortably for 5 days in Oct 22.  Very comfortable, clean and  well kept rooms .   SOME TIPS @ Tap the good eateries closeby on 9th Avenue just a block away or tap the well rated Deli @ Take travel tips from concierge Jeff esp the free visit to Statue @  If new to NYC, tap HopOn HopOff close by or the subway (single line stations)  @ Take the king bed / bigger room if you have luggage.;4
I downloaded and made an account on TripAdvisor just to leave this review. The concierge, Majid, is a world class gentlemen and a true professional at his job. He was extremely accommodating and respectful from beginning to end. He truly made me felt like I was staying at a 5 star hotel. I had a tiny minor issue beyond his control and he went above and beyond to fix it immediately. Other than that, the hotel is clean and the room was nice. Ambiance is cool and location is 10/10. I will be returning AMAZING.;5
Amazing staff and location. Lobby and main entrance currently under renovation, but it did not interrupt our stay at all. Our junior suite was clean and roomy! Jeff was super kind and helpful during our departure. Looking forward to staying here again.;5
Very nice stay had no issues perfect spot right in the middle of everything easy access in and out room was clean jeff helped us alot with the many questions we had first time in NY coming from California  and will definitely recommend to friends;5
Had an amazing stay Jeff was very helpful. He helped with our bags and provided all the information we needed to know about our stay. Even willing to help us coordinate transportation. Will return again.;5
We stayed for a week as a family and were really happy with the hotel. The room was great, the staff delightful and the setting was ideal for getting around New York. The hotel is just close enough to Time Square without being too close. All the staff were super helpful and we loved our stay. Couldn’t have been better I would highly recommend it.;5
Very comfortable, clean and safe for a woman traveling on her own in NYC.  Jeffery was very friendly and helpful with directions, suggestions and setting up transportation to the airport. His greeting and smile each morning as I walked out to my conference was a bonus!;5
The Ameritania was everything I had hoped for and more. The entire staff there, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping, went above and beyond to make our first trip to New York City a memorable experience.  They must have made some big steps forward when it comes to hiring (which, when attempting to fill any public-service type position, has been a Herculean task since Covid) because we enjoyed daily housekeeping during our week-long stay there. When we travel, we usually leave notes with our daily housekeeping tips, but the Ameritania’s housekeepers were the first to write us notes back—a wonderful touch that we very much enjoyed. :)  Again, everyone was friendly and approachable and quick to answer our myriad of questions. In fact, housekeeper Sophie saved me from;5
My first time in New York and was so looking forward to staying here , but found the attitude of all the staff very poor which was a real shame , in fact the only person there that even bothered to talk to us was Jeff the doorman that I couldn’t speak more highly of , the only asset to the hotel I feel   Rooms were very dated and only got cleaned once in the whole week we were there and that was only because I went and asked !! Totally unacceptable in this day and age   In spite of the hotel my daughter and me had a fantastic holiday and made some amazing memories , the hotel is situated near Central Park ( which was beautiful)  although to close Times Square ( lovely if you like the smell of weed )   I would advise anyone going to New York to get a go city pass which we did;3
If it wasn’t for the location I wouldn’t have stayed at this hotel. That’s the only going for it.  Scaffolding was put up outside our windows and guys could look right into our room. No prior warning of this was given and no discount offered for the inconvenience of opening my blinds in my pjs with a workman outside my window staring right back!  The hotel keys don’t work every time you leave the room. Excuse given was that they are too close to mobile phones but mines wasn’t and it still didn’t work!  Heating. Room was frozen and when asked for someone to look at the heating I was told that they don’t switch heating on till November! As a guest paying over £250 per night I would expect a better attitude than this. Some others must have also complained because next day it was;2
The people, the ambiance, and the location of this hotel is just amazing. It’s close to basically all the touristy areas and main subways (I.e, Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, Rockefeller, etc).   The one thing that also made this hotel the best and most comfortable was the customer service. Rajiv, Sedik, and Jazleen have exceeded in their level of thoughtfulness and truly showing how much they care for the people that stay at Ameritania. They are very welcoming and answered any questions that I had. I cannot thank them enough for being so caring and thoughtful to us. I would highly recommend staying here!;5
Avoid this hotel at all costs.  It is shockingly bad and not remotely as advertised.  No bar, no restaurant so no room service or breakfast.  No coffee or tea facilities in the rooms.  Room as not cleaned once during 3 night stay.  When I requested a room clean I was informed that rooms don't get cleaned every day.  The entrance to the hotel is closed and under plastic wrapping and the reception is disgusting.  The reception staff don't care but i guess it isnt their fault.  Its not like the hotel is cheap either.  The pictures on the website are not a reflection of this hotel.  It's like a down market hostel.;1
I cannot believe how bad a hotel in midtown can be. Not quite sure where to start: dreadful bed - mattress down to the wire. No cleaning for a 3 day stay. Front desk staff who would rather be on their phones than helping. No coffee in room, no fridge in room, no bar in hotel, no breakfast. Frankly its a hostel with 3* pricing. Just an unmitigated disaster from start to finish;1
Without the location this hotel sits in and Jeff the door man, the hotel would be pretty terrible. The price of the hotel is pretty good for New York, but there are certain things I expect when I still pay over £250 a night for a hotel room. 1) room cleaning service or at least new towels every day, 2) room cards that don’t deactivate themselves every time you go out and come back to the hotel, it is so frustrating going to your room EVERY day and having to go back down to reception for a new key card 3) reception staff because these ones are APPALLING, every single one of them has a bad attitude. This morning I ordered Uber eats and had photo confirmation that it had been left at reception, when I went down to collect it it was nowhere to be seen.. 4) the bar isn’t open 5) the;3
Great location,  but not the best hotel. We had 2 rooms, 1 was cleaned once in 4 days , on day 3 , the other was not cleaned until we complained. Covid was used as an excuse for the lack of cleaning!  On a more positive note, , whenever we called the reception,  they were very prompt at delivering towells or toiletries or dealing with a faulty safe;3
Hotel is in a great location, minutes walk from Times Square. Some staff at reception could be a bit more cheery. Beds were really comfy. Rooms were clean, great shower. Just ask reception if need towels or shower gels. On first night cistern in toilet kept making a noise. Reported to reception, resolved quickly. There was a bar in reception but never saw it opened. There was one doarman who was really helpful (didn’t get his name)   he booked our taxi for going home and told us how much to pay, on leaving a doorman who we had never spoke to helped put bags in taxi, actually said when in taxi what about tip. We did give a tip but I feel you have to earn a tip. We did have the money ready for the person who did book our taxi and who had been helpful. I hope they do share tips.;4
The hotel's location at 54th and Broadway is walking distance from theaters, scores of restaurants, Times Square and Central Park.  Our room was not lavish but extremely comfortable and perfect for a couple.  But I am writing because of the friendliness of the staff.  At the reception desk, Majid was so friendly and accommodating, did everything he could to assist with a special request, and his attitude was emblematic of every single staff member we met from front door to housekeeping and everyone in between.  They made our visit a pleasure.;5
This was the perfect location for what I needed (walking distance to Broadway shows and close to multiple subway stations). There are tons of great restaurants within a few blocks. The staff was friendly and helpful. The doorman, Jeff, arranged my car to LaGuardia for my departing flight. The room was clean and housekeeping came on the 3rd day of my 4-night stay, which was fine with me. I appreciated the small fridge in the room. The only complaint I have is that the air conditioner is SO LOUD. I slept with earplugs the whole time, but it still woke me up during the night when it would turn on. In reading other reviews, it seems this is a common complaint. Overall, I would stay here again, though.;5
If you’re looking for something that won’t break the bank in the heart of NYC, this is the hotel for you. Only a 10-15min walk in either direction for Times Sq and Central Park, with lots of bars around.   Beds comfortable, air con works very well. The only reason it wasn’t a 5-star review is for the fact that the bed frames are fairly larger than the mattress, so there were a few occasions where one of us would stub our toe walking around the bed.;4
There was a mouse in our hotel room. We were sitting on the bed when we saw a mouse run across one side of the small room, to the other inside the AC unit. We immediately freaked out and notified staff. The engineer opened up the AC unit and found a hole. The mouse or even mice use the hole to enter that room for who knows how long! We were mover to a different room however I could not sleep. I was so uncomfortable. This incident happened on the 3rd night of our 5 night stay. Knowing that mouse was in and out of that room makes me sick. We paid over $1300 for 5 nights, and for this to happen? The rooms are old and dated to top it off. It’s a small hotel with a small budget clearly.   I spoke/emailed management to ask about compensation and I’ve heard nothing back even though a;1
Small hotel but nothing to complain for the price. Wifi is kind of inconsistent. The location is good. Short walk to Time's Square. A bit longer walk to Fifth Avenue. Due to their covid protocol, I think they clean the room once every 3 or 5 days.;4
Booked via Expedia.  Good rates for location.  Room furnishings- clean Space good. We had 2 double beds + bench  Very attentive staff- I had an issue with the AC on the 2nd day and they came to resolve it within 10 minutes- simple solution and fixed within 5 mins. Grateful for the AC given summer in NY. We were on the 4th floor so did not hear street noise.   Housekeeper checked on us daily.   Best subway station for this hotel is the 7th avenue station (7 th and 53rd). Walk up 7th avenue to 54th street and the hotel is just on the corner. Managed this with kids and luggage.   Hotel really perfectly situated for a walk to all major attractions in NY.   We didn’t have breakfast there but would recommend Angelina’s for pastries.   Overall super happy and would stay there again.;4
Welcoming staff, great beds, modern minimalist decor, bathrooms very clean. Rooms have complimentary water but no snack tray. Bar not open, both forgiven. Very comfortable! In the heart of Midtown. Recommend highly.;3
Ok, so we booked a deluxe with two queens here. The beds were comfortable, but there are things anyone should know about staying here.  A. There are two sized rooms under the same category. We did not get a choice and for the smaller 205 sq ft. This does not look like the first picture on the website. It's the second, without the bench. It is tiny. Comically tiny. They would not move us to the slightly larger one with bench, on request.  There is no place to put your suit cases or anything else. So you are climbing over them the whole time. The desk is away and is not usable because the chair can barely be moved. It is small. So factor into your budget that it is not a place you will want to come back to to regroup from a day of sightseeing.  That sucks because it is HOT in the;2
good quality and reasonable price for an hotel really close to times square and to subway. room was clean and with enough space for a family with 2 small daughters. really nice view on the city and friendly staff.;4
This hotel is a bit thin on services, but the location makes up for this. We walked almost everywhere we went for 5 days. Hundreds of restaurants within a short walk.  Rooms are a good size in comparison to other NYC hotels. Be aware there is no room service or breakfast. In our 5 day stay the room was only cleaned once, by a rather surly maid who appeared at 3pm......the front desk were pretty useless, but doormen excellent.;4
We had four nights in NYC to see some plays and eat good food. There were four of us in our room, and we met up with eight friends for fun and activities.   The hotel is perfectly located. You are close to Times Square ( but not too close), to a number of subway stops, and best of all, to the theaters!  The rooms are not too big, but big enough for the four of us to be comfortable between activities. The decor of the hotel is very nice and modern.   But what makes the hotel great are it’s people! All of them are wonderful. From the moment you arrive and man out front helps you in, you are treated like an old friend. The desk staff are great and there always seems to be someone in the lobby just waiting to see if you need anything.  This will be our hotel for all our visits to;5
Vi stayed at Ameritania for 9 nights. The location is perfect for visiting New York. The rooms are rather small, but okay if you are busy experiencing the city. The staff is very friendly and helpful - especially Majid.;4
Dont stay here. The aircondition system in the room was SO loud we had to use earplugs all week. And it was running all the time to exchange Air, so could not be turned off.  We travel a lot and have never experienced something like this anywhere before. Also only cleaning 1 time during a week! And we had 1 Roll of toilet paper so had to get more at the reception several times - we go one Roll every time…? Great location, But really disappointing hotel.;2
We loved this hotel! The lady who checked us in (didn’t get her name) was super lovely and welcoming. The room was really nice, clean & exactly what we needed for our holiday (thank god for the air con 😂). We had housekeeping on days 3,5 & 7 on a 9 night trip and that was enough to be honest. Didn’t really notice the noise outside and there’s a blackout blind and curtains too. The location of this hotel is perfect - so close to Times Square and in walking distance of lots of other attractions. Subway stations not too far away to go further afield. We have to shoutout Jeffery who was just the kindest, funniest guy! He took the time to highlight his recommendations on a map for us to keep and each morning stopped & had a chat with us. He told us what subway we needed to get or;5
We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. Ask for Franchesca when you're there. I don't think she could be unfriendly even if she tried. Other staff was kind too. Make your reservation thru a travel agency, it proved to be much cheaper.;5
This Hotel is well located near Times Square, Broadway/Theater district and Central Park. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfy and bathroom is huge and nice. All staff was friendly but no housekeeping due to Covid/lack of personnel unless over 3 nights stay.  Also, there is no breakfast/food/bar available but plenty of options around.  Would stay here again.;4
The hotel location is awesome, only few blocks for the Time square, it's very clean and neat. The Staff make you feel welcome as soon as you enter the hotel starting from the gentleman who open the door to the front desk to the house keeping . The room is very nice and the bed is very comfortable , also I have to mention that the city park next to the hotel gives a discount for the guess stayed in this hotel , The front desk young girl (Shay) helped us to keep the luggage in the hotel after we finish the check out because we wanted to finish the last minute shopping before we leave NY.;5
Well before anything else, at around 7pm staff members barged into the room without invitation shouting that they were ‘looking for someone’ - we were asleep due to jet lag, there was no warning or anything they literally just flung the door open! Baffling and wholly unprofessional. Overall the hotel room was…Just pretty gross. The room clearly hadn’t seen a vacuum cleaner in a good few weeks, the bathroom wasn’t very clean, there was hairs of the previous occupants up the wall in the shower, the toilet flush and door handle were hanging off.  At check in they took the deposit (expected) and then another $175 which I wasn’t told about, when I queried it at check out the guy behind the counter didn’t have a clue what it was, went and asked someone then when he came back he;2
NYC is an expensive place now, but this hotel stood out as good value when booking. Mostly I think it still is, but the staff were notably very good. A tip though, the rooms at the back had no views bar air con units so get front facing. Our air con unit was very loud & rattly, kept us up a lot at night. It was clean & comfortable, but no room cleaning “due to Covid”. The cynic in me thinks they’re just cutting costs. Good location for times sq & Central Park.;4
Had such a positive experience with the staff at the front desk, wanna thank Franchesca and gentlemen for such great customer service!  Will definitely be back:) The room itself and the view from our window was beautiful. The room was clean and neat, everything was super close to the hotels location.;5
We are 2 friends travelling from the UK and The Ameritania has been a home away from home for a full week. We were welcomed by the amazing Jeff for whom nothing is too much trouble. Our room was clean and comfortable with super cozy beds, air con and a great view of the city. Considering it is so central it is still quiet at night and we slept well. Note there are no food or drink facilities in the hotel but the ladies at Starbucks opposite looked after us all week! As two women travelling together we felt safe here, comfortable and well looked after. The Ameritania is a fantastic find, and one that truly added to our holiday.;5
Justin at the front desk was very helpful and a MVP. I wish there were more Justin’s in this world. We came at 3 in the morning on a busy 4th of July weekend,after a hotel canceled on us at the very last minute, and he gave us two rooms with reasonable price. Thank you Justin!!!;5
The hotel is in the perfect location. Lots of restaurants and food choices surrounding this hotel. It was an easy walk both to Central Park and Times Square. The staff here is super friendly and Jeffrey gave us some great tips for getting around NYC. The hotel rooms are clean and a good size for NYC. I am very happy with this hotel and would highly recommend.;5
まったくセキュリティ体制のないホテルです。入り口はスタッフが常駐しておらず、エレベーターのルームキーシステムはどれも壊れているため、誰でも簡単にすべてのフロアに上がれます。部屋の Wi-Fi は極端に遅いかまったくつながらないため、部屋で仕事をすることはできません。若いスタッフは比較的まともですが、中年以上のスタッフは全員が無礼・無教育で、NYのホテルとしても最低水準でした。同価格帯のホテルはこのエリアに他にたくさんあるため、ここを選ぶ理由はないと思います。  This hotel does not have any kind of security check at the entrance. Elevator security is broken. Cheap male staff is always rude and stupid.   The room's interior is old and filthy. Wi-Fi is very hard to be connected with or incredibly slow. This place should have been closed during the pandemic forever.;1
The staff, especially Petrena we’re amazing!!! They went out of their way to accommodate us. The place is gorgeous, the decor is glamorous. Great location! We loved all the little shops and bakery’s near by. We will be back:);5
"Clean, modern, close to everything if you are visiting as a tourist. Jeff was the concierge and probably the best we've ever encountered! He gave us great information and my ten year olds confirmed that we should give him a ""million"" stars for how great he was.";5
We stayed twice during May. On our first visit a warm welcome greeted us on our arrival after our flight from the UK. However our room was not what we expected and so after a quick word we were looked after by Majid who ensured that everything was well organised for us during our time there. Majid assured us that on our return the second visit would be a bit special. It certainly was special with a very large comfortable corner room at the top of the building with wonderful New York views. An excellent end to an excellent holiday. We have stayed in this hotel three times now and we plan stay here whenever we return to New York. The staff are all wonderful and eager to ensure you have a great stay. Thank you.  We will be back.;4
Average boutique hotel in a fantastic location! Helpful staff, good restaurants close! Starbucks across the street. Easy walking to subway,central park, broadway theatres. Hotel bar was closed, looked  like they had an on-site restaurant but it was shut down also, but the location is so good you don’t need those things!;3
The staff here make it so special. Kamal, Andy, Majid, Shayanna, and Paulette...really care for their guests. The bed is comfortable! I should know I have been recovering from surgery and laying in the bed all but a couple of hours a day. But when I need food or medical supplies or anything under the sun, it is so easy to get the best of everything within steps or have it delivered in minutes. The hotel is next to the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and is surrounded by the best restaurants and fast healthy food late into the evening. The lobby is large and very hip looking. My room 303  is small, but NYC size, and it has all I need. It is in a beautiful old building and they make it comfortable. I plan to come back!;5
I had a very good stay in this hotel in midtown,  very good location to go anywhere. . All the staff were excellent, always helpful for every need. The  room was very clean. A special regard for Shay  and Francesca, they were like friends. From Italy, .... CIAO;4
The hotel’s location is fabulous for anywhere in midtown…we managed to walk over 50 miles around the area from our base at The Ameritania. It’s clean, functional with helpful, friendly, honestly staff. I realised that I had lost a diamond and sapphire earring after we checked out. Our maid handed it in to housekeeping … I was delighted 😀. Highly recommended;5
My toes really did not like the room.  High threshold to the bathroom and exposed feet of the bed stubbed my toes several times.  Odd velveteen cover over upholstered headnoard was odd, just not done properly.  Shower was nice, but without a tub edge, you really need more than a 4 inch triangle shelf.  Really missed common amenities like coffee (none in room or lobby) and ice (only available  in lobby).  Was there for 3 nights and never got housekeeping.  The most annoying was no information in the room, portfolio was empty.  Nothing telling me to put trash in the hall to empty, or the need to ask for fresh towels.  To top it all off  the TV was out for 2 nights, unsuccessful attempt to fix it, had to ask for them to come again, 2nd person got it done.  Next time I will pay the;2
The rooms were very poorly cleaned. Quite unfriendly front office staff.  Even things like toilet paper wasn’t replenished. No access to gym contrary to what’s being promoted.  Room wasn’t cleaned everyday. Even only day they cleaned during my 5 day stay , they hardly did clean the room.   Avoid at all costs.;1
Firstly, the location of this hotel is fabulous, easy walking distance to many places that you are there for.  Room and bed were clean and comfortable, we had an early issue with the A/C not working but a call to reception and 2 maintenance guys arrived in no time to fix this. Some of the fixtures in the room are old and need replacing but as a base for exploring NY we were quite happy with our choice. There was no bar and no food available, we don’t generally eat in the hotels we stay in so this was not an issue for us. One thing - there is no concierge and reception was not very helpful with directions and assistance for those new to the city. If you manage your expectations in regard to this, then this hotel would suit just  fine;4
My mom and I stayed at the Ameritania for our 5 day trip to New York this May. We chose this hotel because the price was incredibly reasonable for the location. The location could not be beat. It was an easy walk to Central Park, Time Square, and Rockefeller Center. We also walked to the High Line and Greenwich (although those were more of a walk).  There is a bar, restaurant, bagel shop, pharmacy, a 99cent pizza place, and little grocery store, within a block of the hotel, too. The staff were all very pleasant, especially Salah. Our room was actually large for New York standards. We were in a 2 double bed room and had tons of room to maneuver. Not much counter space in the bathroom, but a huge table and 2 chairs in the bedroom provided plenty of space. We had some troubles with;5
Great location. Great staff. Clean room and comfortable bed. What more do you need in a hotel room? Location. Oh yea, Ameritania has that too. Walk out the door and head east about half a block. Walk north from there and you'll be at the entrance of Central Park.  Turn south instead and you are just a few blocks from Times Square. There was no mint on my pillow and no one tucked me in, but I was comfortable in a clean comfortable bed and close to all that NYC has to offer.;5
Spent 7 days stay at Ameritania and were more than happy with our stay.  Well located close to Central Pk and Times Sq the hotel was what we expected with a 3* hotel.  Restaurants, diners and deli's were aplenty with all tastes covered.  It was a short 3 min walk to the 7th AVE subway to allow you to explore Manhattan and beyond.  We can only speak highly of all the staff at Ameritania with a particular mention to Francesca and Sadiq who greeted us on our arrival with both being highly informative and easy to deal with. Many Thanks.;5
We were warmly welcomed, our beds were very comfortable, and we slept well after a long and tiring journey. The location is also great. However, our positive experience ended there.  Firstly, checking in before 3pm entails an additional fee of USD 100. Secondly, no breakfast is served due to the covid situation. Since bottled water is freely offered, a box containing the basics (for e.g, 1 yoghurt, 1 fruit, and 1 juice) would suffice if covid is a concern. Paradoxically, none of the staff wear masks. Moreover, the delivery company they have partnered with takes 3 hours to deliver food (thankfully there are other options nearby). Thirdly, upon check-in, we were required to provide a physical card that would solely serve the purpose of securing a USD 100 deposit. We were assured;2
Our room was more than adequate.  The housekeeper came and cleaned when expected.  The lobby personnel were delightful and very helpful.  In particular Sergiy, Mourad and Shay. They all helped to make our 50th anniversary celebration memorable.;5
Would definitely stay here again. Comfortable bed, nice shower, larger room than other NY hotels we’ve stayed at. Next door to a couple great restaurants and a comedy club.  Staff was friendly, funny and helpful. Hotel is walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, subways.;5
"Excellent location, friendly staff, big and clean rooms; very good value for money! Thank you Majid and collegues! I would definitely recommend a stay in the Ameritania hotel. The combination with the bar the three monkeys was ideal for the last beer when you’re back after a long day!";5
I had reserved a room and it was nice.  Problem was that night, I found out the tv wasn't working so the next day, I alerted the front desk.  Within minutes, there was someone in my room and then two people trying to fix it.  When they determined it was unfixable, they spoke to the manager and he called immediately and offered me another room that was larger and nicer than the one I reserved.  Majid was the manager's name and Sedik also helped out to get me into the new room as effortlessly as possible.  I will stay here again as the staff was excellent and the location is also great for the affordable price.;5
We stayed in this hotel the 5th - 10th of May. We came for a family wedding and we were very pleased with our room selection which was a deluxe king room. The room was spacious and clean and the huge bed was very comfortable. Jeff the concierge took care of our wedding and airport taxis and gave us better directions than google maps to get the pier for our boat tour. The hotel is in a good spot with Times square and Central Park all very close. There are many restaurants and Irish bars less than a minute away and far nicer than at Times square which is very busy and stinks of weed.Outside of the hotel is a van which you can get the most gorgeous egg,bacon and cheese roll with a brew for $12.00 for 2 and really hit the spot remember to ask for over easy if you like a runny yolk.;4
The staff at this hotel are AMAZING!  From the moment they open the door for you, you are treated like a friend. If you need anything, all you have to do is ask.  This was our first time in New York City, so we had no idea where to go. We were given great recommendations and help getting to and from places. Even lessons on how to use the subway! The hotel is smaller, but very cute and quiet. Perfect for anyone who doesn't want to deal with large chain hotels with tons of people! Mourad and Majid were especially helpful in transportation arrangements, food deliveries and making sure we had the best time ever. We will definitely be back!;5
The location of this hotel is simply perfect, it is close to several subway stations, for sightseeing locations further away, and it’s maybe a 5 minute walk to times square! Lovely staff, like doorman Jeff who made us very excited about seeing the city, and he gave us a map with highlighted places he recommended us to see. In the morning, they wish you a happy dag and after a busy day you get welcomed with happy faces! Good bathroom and a fine room. And even though the beds could be seen as rather small, you won’t sleep for long in such a city! Great hotel, had an amazing experience!;5
Great location, super nice and accommodating staff. They were able to get us an early check-in which was wonderful. The lobby was large and clean. We stayed in a double room with another couple and it was spacious enough (especially for an NYC hotel). Complimentary waters and nice bathroom. No fridge, but that is ok. We have had really good experiences with hotels in this area of NYC, but the nice staff really made this one stand out. We would stay here again!;5
Location was perfect. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square and 5th avenue. It’s at the corner on Broadway. The staff was friendly specially the butler who booked us a taxi back to the airport cheaper than Uber. Also the room was comfortable even though it was small.  Although we’re on the third floor the view was nice the shower was great and had a mini fridge, iron and hair dryer. The only downside is that we didn’t have a cleaning service due to “covid” however masks are optional🤷🏻‍♀️ I would stay there again!;5
Upon arrival we were greeted by the doorman Jeff, who took our luggage until our room was ready. We were then greeted at the front desk by Majid who check us in and took care of all our needs. I had some special medication that needed to be refrigerated. Majid took my medication and placed it in the staff refrigerator until our room was ready. He also had a small refrigerator taken to our room for my medication. Our room was small but we had a great view over looking Broadway Street. Between Majid and Jeff, we felt we were in good hands. They helped us with all of our tours and made sure we were on time. Next door is a bar called The Three Monkey's Bar. Great place for a drink and food. Throughout are stay Majid made sure we were taken care of which made our stay pleasant. I;5
It was very central, walking distance to most attractions. All staff were very attentive, especially Salah very helpful printing directions for us. Jeff on the door very friendly and helped us with a taxi to the airport. Hotel room clean and a really comfy bed, with good amenities. We will definitely be returning.;5
The staff we dealt with were nice. Kind, friendly and helpful. So that's a plus. The hotel is in a perfect location.  The room, wasn't exactly ideal. I mean, it was okay but could've been better. The lighting isn't great, the light fixing casts a sepia tone over the room, it could be brighter. To open the window gives a view into a rundown building... the view was awful - but I didn't come to New York to look out a hotel window - so that wasn't too much of an issue. There was a fan outside which was constantly making a loud noise, thankfully I was able to zone it out to sleep. There's a comedy club near by which is SO loud but thankfully it stopped around 11pm.   Wasn't so happy about the room only being cleaned once during our trip 'due to covid'. Every other hotel I've stayed;3
I made a reservation over the phone at the Ameritania. After 2 days of not receiving a confirmation email or my credit card being charged, I called to check.  Maria told me that they could not honor my reservation because it was booked as part of a room block. This was explained to me when I made the reservation and told that it's not a problem. I was told numerous times that it's fine, the rate would be honored and I didn't need to participate in any of the events.  I am beyond annoyed at this hotel and their complete lack of professionalism and absolute lack of customer service.   Be warned, I can only imagine how terrible the service is at the hotel if they can't even hire competent employees to do the booking.;1
Pleasant staff and fine location. However, this hotel could use a serious face-lift. The wallpaper is rather drab and just outdated. The lighting is something out of a eastern block experience circa 1970. The bedding was definitely not premium. Amenities were decent but the bar was closed all weekend.;3
I spent six nights at the Ameritania Hotel and I am very pleased with my choice of hotel. It was quiet, clean and from there it was a short journey everywhere. Staff was helpful and Jeff is the king! There were nice bars and breakfast places in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.;5
Enjoyed our visit to Ameritania! The staff and team here are extremely friendly and helpful. We were greeted by Salah and Sedik upon arriving! And they also greeted us when we returned from our outing. Thank you guys so much and keep up the good work! Please continue to keep team members like them around;5
As you may know, the hotel has a fantastic location. In our particular case our stay in NY has been of 10 thanks to the help of Majid, a good man that from the reception of the hotel has been essential to help us and solve the doubts and inconveniences that we have had these days. We are sure that our perception of the hotel would be totally different if it had not been for Majid, as once again it shows that the most important thing is the people and how they treat you. He has been kind, he has taken care of us and helped us and has tried to make our stay pleasant, and that's why I want to say it from here because I think this kind of things deserve to be said and praised. To all the travelers who come, I hope you will always have a person like this to support you and help you;5
With my husband we spent 5 days in NYC to celebrate our 50th birthday . We had fun time staying at the Ameritania Times Square wich location is just perfect : close to Times Square, Central Park and Broadway. The hotel provides all the facilities for guests and everybody is nice and helpful. A special thank to Mourad for his good advices and his kindness. Can't wait to go back !! 🇱🇷👍;4
Upon arrival the staff went out of their way to make our stay perfect. They offered some recommendations and activities to make our stay more enjoyable and the rooms were so nice and clean. Salah was the star of the staff and helped us with so much and even put up with my over friendly mother haha. About an hour after we checked out I realized I left my jewelry in my room and was devastated! Thankfully I called the Ameritania and Salah picked up and immediately confirmed they found my jewelry and were ready to send it the next day. He went out of his way to help me out and I cannot thank him enough for his amazing hospitality and service!! I’m so great fil for everything they’ve done. Excellent hotel service!!!;5
I can't say enough good things about the Ameritania at Times Square Hotel, where we stayed mid-March 2022.  The Location is absolutely perfect (6 min walk to Times Square, or to Central Park, or to Rockefeller Centre, all the theatres and many more places).  From the time we checked in to the time we checked out the staff went OUT OF THEIR WAY to accommodate any need we had and always did so with gratitude and a friendly smile.  The lobby was modern and well decorated, the rooms were clean, organized and cozy, and the rainfall shower in our bathroom was sublime. Special shout-out to Sergiy at the front desk and all of the other staff at Americana for making our stay in NYC so enjoyable.;5
I stayed at Ameritania for 5 days and enjoyed every minute of it. Majid and Salah were a lot of help and always there to provide service! I traveled solo, so they’re help was much needed!   The location of the hotel could not be better. Almost everything I wanted to do was right around the corner or a few minutes of walking. From Times Square to a Broadway show, and 5th avenue to a good bagel in the morning!  And of course the hotel in itself was a  very good hotel and made the stay very pleasant . Clean and nice rooms.  Thank you Ameritania;5
This is a perfectly fine midtown hotel, in a central location. It has been recently renovated with a modern decor.  The rooms, though, are small, even by Manhattan standards.  Be careful walking around the bed, because you are likely to hit your toe on the bed frame or on the huge mirror along the side!  The bathroom has absolutely no counter space.  The check-in desk seemed a bit chaotic, but we did not have any problems.;4
Right when we arrived there were people to creep us at the door. Check in was super fast and easy, Sedik at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Room is not as small as I thought with a HUGE rain shower and a mini fridge. Very clean and big full length mirror and some cool art. Right on time square and very excited to be staying here.;5
First of all, thanks for Shae on the front desk for being extra helpful and friendly.  The hotel is clean and tidy.  Shower is hot and has good pressure  The beds are also incredibly comfortable  Apparently there is a minimum character limit of 200;5
Excellent service from hotel, employees Shay and Andy went above and beyond to assist me and my family! Thank you so much for your service, highly recommend this hotel and their staff for a great stay!;5
Majid took great care of us, making sure we had all that we needed during our stay. The room was small, but adequate, clean, and comfortable. Within a couple of blocks of Time Square and close to all Broadway Theaters. We would definitely stay there again.;4
I purposely reserved the Ameritania hotel because of the location. I had prepaid reservations and when my wife and I arrived they told us that they overbooked the hotel and due to renovations they couldn't accept my reservations.  They ended up pushing us to their sister hotel which placed us to a 20 min uber ride outside of all our planned events instead of just walking distance. The room was filthy, water leaks along the window,  stains in the tub and torn carpets. Since I prepaid through a third party I couldn't cancel the reservation without losing money. Due to being sent to another hotel we also incurred additional charges since we had to uber/cab to the places that would have been in walking distance. I could only suggest to anyone thinking of this hotel or the Bentley to;1
We booked our stay a week in advance and when we arrived to the hotel they said that our room was taken and the hotel was overbooked. They also did this to the man i front of us. Then they had us walk a few blocks down to a different hotel that wasn’t as nice and made us stay there. Also the hotel they made us walk to had a cheaper rate and the Ameritania is refusing to give a partial discount for the price difference. I will never book at this hotel again. Stayed in over 100 hotels in my life and this has never once happened to me.;1
My room was one of the smallest I’ve ever stayed in (yes, even in NYC standards). A 6-foot mirror with a heavy frame stands against the wall and further blocks your ability to walk around the room. And the bathroom is so tiny you can hardly find room to use the toilets.  Being right next to the elevator and with no isolation on either the door or the windows - the room had constant noise from both the elevator and the machinery outside the window.  And maintenance - well there were no signs of it. The room door wouldn’t fit into the frame and you had to push it hard to actually close it. And the toilet paper hanger kept falling off the wall. I have no idea how are the other rooms in this hotel, but with the risk of getting such a room - I will not stay here again.;2
Would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are fantastic and so helpful especially Majid and Adam who met us with a smile at reception. This hotel is very clean. The beds are very comfortable. The location is fantastic - very central. Perfect base for exploring New York!;5
This hotel is so perfectly located. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square. Great amenities all around the hotel. Clean and comfy beds. Nicest and most helpful staff. Jeff helped us at arrival and helped arrange airport travel. Will return!!;5
When going to NY next time I will absolutely consider coming back to hotel Ameritania. Nice room having the needed things including nice and comfortable bed and  cleanness was also fine. Enjoyed the central location .;5
I cant really fault the Hotel, great value for money. It is in a ideal position. Very warm rooms with air-conditioning if needed.  The reception staff are friendly and helpful, however covid made the visit a little hard work with the constant mask wearing.    There was low noise level considering where it is positioned...I am it's only drawback is no kettle in the room. Although your surrounded by Macdonald's on every corner you had to get dressed to get a hot drink.;5
This hotel is pretty reasonably-priced with decent amenities and present at a great location which is walkable distance from Times Square and Central Park. I primarily used this for sleep and the bed is comfortable without the mattress being too soft. On the whole, I really liked my stay and will definitely be visiting again.;5
Hotel was ok, our room was quite small, bathroom was clean though the taps and towel rails where poorly fitted nothing was level!! Due to covid our room was only serviced once in 5 nights! Doorman was great and got us a taxi to penn station to catch our flight from Newark , we used the commuter  train from jfk to Manhattan, quicker and cheaper than a taxi.;3
Great location, nice hotel. Rooms well equipped, could do with some improvements, but you are really only in it to sleep!  Didn’t dine at the hotel (don’t think it was even an option due to covid). Staff helpful enough, although the lady that assisted us at check in wasn’t that pleasant. Didn’t impact our stay!  Hotel close to Times Square (3 blocks) and many restaurants etc  We got a taxi from JFK (I think fixed fee $65) but took nearly two hours! We arrived at JFK around 2/3pm. Took the same length of time going home. Hotel booked taxi for us, again at a fixed price but he was 30mins late, so just factor that into your timings etc.   Rooms small, but done the job. Three of us, two double beds. Small fridge in room was useful.;4
The hotel is good value for money. Location is awesome as you’re within walking distance to a majority of the tourist attractions. Mourad the bellhop was incredible. Always greeted us with a big smile and helped us with anything we needed during our stay.;4
Wharf an amazing New York experience magnified by our welcoming agent Jeff.  Very special thanks for him! The hotel is very well situated : very close to everywhere like central park, time square, broadway and subways for every parts of the city…..;4
Staff were friendly and helpful. Maintenace seems to be an issue here. There was only one elevator working and it took forever to get up to the room and get back down to the lobby. It pretty much stops at every floor due to the amount of guests trying to get up and down. 3 elevators in total. 1 out of order, 2nd stopped working 2hrs into our stay. So only the 3rd was working. The room was very small and bathroom tiny. Also the bathroom not clean. Hair from other guests all of the place. I will say, the bed was very comfortable though, but I believe I was being bitten by something. Not sure if bed bugs or not. It was a great location though! Central to everything and again, very helpful staff.;3
Great stay no issues. The Doorman Movrad is awesome very helpful. My family came to New York from Florida and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location and is for sure the best bang for your buck.;5
Had a great time! Jeff the Doorman was great. He was always there for a quick recommendation of where to go and what to see and eat. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel room was perfect for our needs and the bathroom was nice and big. Our room was very clean and comfortable. We didn’t spend much time at the hotel because we were out seeing the sights.;5
This hotel is great from the actual building/ rooms, to the location, to the staff.  I have stayed here many times now and have no complaints.  I would especially recommend staying here if you are still failey new to NYC.  Also, Jeff is awesome, very helpful!;5
I loved the hotel.They went out of their way to get us an early check in. Our flight takeoff time was 6am, so we were a little tired around 1pm. They got our room ready around 1:30pm. The check in staff were so polite and caring. Jeff the doorman was unbelievably kind. He hailed our taxi's and gave us recommendations on food and shopping.  We were very pleased with our stay and will stay there again in the future. Grat location and plenty to do just outside the doors. Thank you for taking care of us;5
Very clean and hygienic, very nice receptionists, we enjoed our vecation, and the best part was a very kind man who works in Ameritania, his name is Jeff, he explained us everthing, he guided us and we are recommend this hotel, its located in the best place ever;5
This trip to NYC was great and the gentleman, Jeff, from the ameritania hotel, who took our bags and helped us with a stress free transit back to the airport, was incredible! Thanks Jeff!! For everything!;5
Really good location. Concierge (Jeff or Jei I think) was great. Looked after my bags while i continued to explore city and got me a car to airport. 5 mins from Time square. Perfect location for a city break and i really enjoyed my stay ..........................;5
Had a great time when we stayed here. Jeffery made our trip really smooth. Actually bumped into an old friend, Brent, who was also staying there with his mum. We stayed on an upper floor which had great views. For reasons of safety, Brent stayed on the ground floor and said it was really good too.;5
Three of my friends and I had the most amazing time!  Location is AWESOME!  We walked to everything or hopped on a subway.  The greeter/doorman/concierge Extrodinair “Jeff” made everything easy.  We had an early flight arrival time so he tagged our bags so we could go out and hit the town before check-in. He arranged for our car back to the airport for us when we checked in so we didn’t have to worry about that either. Great price, easy peasy. The room was clean, beds were soft, and comfortable.  Bathroom was clean with newer tile and a rain shower head and hand held as well. We had a gigantic floor mirror that made getting ready easy. Closet was small (but totally expected that) we proactively brought Magic hangers and it made it 5 times bigger.  I would definitely go back!;5
This is my 3rd time in the hotel, and I had a very high regard for it, due to its great location and quality (that's why I kept coming back). I am currently in room 1114.   At the check-in, I paid and everything went very well.  In my 2nd day at the hotel, I came back at 10 pm, after a long day out in the city, just to realize that my room had not been cleaned.   At first, I thought this was a mistake, so I went to clarify this to the reception.   The host kept insisting that whomever had helped me with the check-in had told me that, due to COVID, rooms are being cleaned up every 3 days. I replied this was not true since, had I known that, I would not have stayed here!   I found this disrespectful and annoying, plus, I had never heard that lack of room hygiene is good to prevent;1
First our flight in arrived roughly around 11 pm so we were instructed to call the front desk and inform them that we were going to be arriving past midnight to ensure that our reservation was not canceled. That in its self was a pain in the butt. We called several times and no one answered so we were forced to leave a voicemail hoping that they would actually get it. We got to the hotel and got our room, when we walked in we almost left because the room is roughly 11x11 and right next to the elevator. We could barley walk in the room and there was no room for the luggage. The bathroom was tiny as well. The bathroom was probably 3 feet deep and 7 feet long. Luckily for us the room was clean so we decided to tough it out for a couple of days, but if they give you a _20 room;2
From walking in, the staff ( reception and doormen) were efficient and very helpful, The room was warm cozy and clean, (what an Amazing mirror😊) free in room safe, bed was clean and comfy and bathroom was a great size. The location was fantastic, very walkable to lots of tourist attractions. Next trip to NYC will be staying here again.;5
We all had a great vacation!  The hotel was very clean and accommodating!  Every time we are in New York we stay here. Jeff was very helpful with recommendations, giving us information and helping us with transportation!  Highly recommend this hotel!;5
Check in and out was smooth. Salah was super helpful and friendly. He arranged our cab and  watched for him to arrive while chatting with us as we relaxed in the lobby. All of the staff were very kind and generous. The rainfall showerhead was to die for. Bed was comfy, lots of pillows, room was very clean. Great location for Broadway shows, Times Square, 5th Ave. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Great place to stay in NYC! The staff especially deserves KUDOS! Every interaction with a staff member was pleasurable - from reception to bellman to housekeeping. Room was quiet and very clean. Shower (with rain head) was one of the best showers I've experienced. Bed was average in comfort. Convenient to Ed Sullivan theater. Will stay again. Again, 5 stars go to the staff. Thank you for the wonderful service.;5
I'm from chile and with my gf it's our first Time here un USA, especially un NY. It was the best experience ever, the spot was to close to everything, restaurants, Subways, central park, and the hospitallity was amazing, one of them was JEFF, worker of ameritanian hotel , who show me all what i need to get a full experiencie there un NY, with the most importants Places ti visits, locations and tips. If i had the lucky to Comeback again definitely it Will be ameritanian hotel no doubt.;5
"Quick overnight in NY. Front desk staff very helpful. Doorman Jeff very helpful.  Tiny rooms, even for NYC, but very clean and well appointed.  ""Bar/lounge"" not available though it is still listed on website.  We would stay there again because of the nice staff and cleanliness.";4
This hotel is convenient to everything. As it’s In the heart of the theater district, with easy access to Central Park and 5th Ave. And of course lots of restaurants and shops abound.   The staff is great, but the fitness room is closed and breakfast is no longer served due to Covid. The cleanliness is good throughout the hotel and in our room.   The furnishings are very nice throughout the hotel including the lobby. You can tell that they’ve been done relatively recently. I would say though, that the fit and finish is slightly off. For example one of the elevators has a very bumpy floor. When you look at the tile in the bathroom the caulking is average and somewhat sloppy.   We had an interior room facing the inside courtyard, so the outside noise was zero. You could hear folks;4
"This is one of our favorite locations in Manhattan for the type of trips we usually make here. The staff was extremely friendly and accesible. The room was not excellent; safe didn’t work and one of the beds had stains on the new sheets they had just changed. However, I would consider this hotel again for a future stay. We did get a very good rate but I do see how it can get very overpriced if not booked in advance. Very quiet room considering Manhattan is very noisy.";4
After having my flight abruptly cancelled, the hotel was very reassuring that my reservation would be honoured at 1:00 AM and that ground transportation would be readily available at LGA.  Check-in was smooth, friendly, and efficient.   The hotel was in an excellent location, close to Times Square, and very near to the 50th Street subway station whose Line 1 goes straight up and down Manhattan, easily transporting us to our show in Greenwich Village and to our favourite spot for pizza!  The Museum of Modern Art was a key part of our weekend trip, and it was an easy walk from the hotel. Central Park and Columbus Circle were also within easy walking distance.   There are many good choices for eating and drinking, and a drug store nearby for those forgotten items! The king-sized;5
Perfect location . Very short walk  to Central Park and Times Square . Rooms are very spacious and clean . All of the staff was very nice . Jeff was so helpful with assisting us with luggage and arranging a car to pick us when leaving the hotel . Hotel is located right by  numerous restaurants and shops . We will definitely stay here on our next trip to NYC.;5
Perfect location ! This hotel is only a short walk to Times Square and Central Park . Rooms and lobby were very clean and spacious. The staff was extremely nice and helpful . Jeff was awesome he assisted us with our luggage and car to the air port . I highly recommend this hotel , I will be staying here again next time!;5
Sarah at the front desk and the staff are great. Everyone is so friendly.   Location is perfect. Next door to the Ed Sullivan Theatre, Time Square, Museums, Starbucks, shopping, Subway, and Central Park.;5
Jeff was amazing. Made the experience so much better. Very attentive to detail and makes you feel welcomed. As soon as we got to the hotel we greeted us by opening the doors, taking our luggage and answering our questions.  Thank you Jeff!;5
I have stayed in the Ameritania hotel on my last day of traveling in NY. I have booked the wrong room, the staff was very friendly and updated me to a better one with discount. They have allowed me to drop off the bag without any payment why I was using my time to go around the city. Majid and Sedik are great, super mood, great vibes, and always positive energies are coming from them. They try their best to help you. When I've checked out of the room, accidentally I've left my passport in Room. When I got back after 4 hours, Found out that they have found and kept my passport for me.  The building is old and furniture needs some update, but when staff is so good, these bad things do not matter. I Will go there again definitely;4
I normally don’t write reviews but this has to be acknowledged.   When we arrived at 6am, it was not time to check in yet so we understood that we had to wait until 3pm. The front desk staff was not friendly at all but Jeffrey from bell desk was super KIND and treated us with RESPECT. Shout out to Jeffrey for that.Being that it was our first time in New York and was exposed to this type of behavior right away, It set the tone for the rest of our trip. She had an attitude and was very snappy when providing us more info. When we came back around 1:30pm, there was another front desk person working and was hoping to get a better experience. Unfortunately, the same staff from that morning appeared to have just came back from her break and proceeded to call me up. I was hesitant since;1
We stayed the last couple nights and all of my feed back is positive! As my first time to NYC, I’d stay here again! Jeff, the doorman was above and beyond helpful. When it came time to check out, he was attentive and helped me with my bags while my boyfriend pulled the truck around. He waited on the corner with me for 20 minutes until my boyfriend arrived, to ensure my safety. He didn’t even judge me for my healing pile of bags! Sooo kind!;5
I normally don’t do reviews, but I had to in this case. During our stay, the power went out. No problem, except that all elevators and lights went out too, including the emergency stairs. Had this been a fire, this would be a death trap. The owner cheaped out on safety, which is an absolute no for families. No backup generators or power, even for emergency situations. If this were my home state, this would be a massive safety violation. The room itself is okay, but lacks some simple amenities (like a coffee machine). The bathroom fixtures are nice, but poorly thought out (the shower, for example, will splash water all over the floor due to poor design). It just screams amateur. The staff transferred us to another hotel of the same ownership (the Moderne), and similar problems;1
The staff was amazing! Nay was Our favorite- so helpful and personable. The hotel is way clean and we always felt very safe! Our room was small but very nice and clean. We loved it! They helped us quickly with any questions we had. If we make it back to NY we will def stay here!;5
This hotel is conveniently situated but the rooms, even double rooms, are small.  The furniture in the lobby is torn and run down.   But the worst part was that the female day manager was exceedingly rude.  She clearly should not be in the service industry.   She needs a job where she has no contact with customers.  Will never stay here again.;2
My family and I just returned from a trip to NYC and a stay at the Ameritania. It was a great location, central to so many things. It was clean and simple but it had everything we needed as we weren't in the room much. The staff was efficient and helpful. Jeff was especially kind. As soon as we arrived, he put our bags in storage until it was our check in time so we could get going without wasting a minute. He grabbed a map for us and laid out the city, giving us helpful tips and answered our questions. He arranged for our taxi to pick us up to head back to the airport when we left and made sure we were all set. I would recommend staying here if you want to be right in the middle of all the action.;4
I booked a standard room, then messaged them asking to upgrade to a double bed room. They took 24+ hours to respond and didn’t change my reservation so I lost out on the upgrade (which I was willing and agreed to pay for the additional cost). I then asked for a rollaway bed, which was confirmed by them but when I got the room, there was no tollway bed AND IT WAS TINY. You could barely walk in it, it was so small!  A rollaway bed would have NEVER fit in there, which they should have advised. They were apparently completely booked so recommending to me that the room would be too small for what I needed wouldn’t have hurt them.  I was literally in the hotel for no more than 15 mins from check in to leaving. I saw the room, booked another hotel, and turned in my keys to the front;1
The Ameritania Hotel is our family’s favorite—been there at least four times now. The rooms are large by NY standards, with very comfortable beds and extremely clean, modern rooms. The location (between Times Square and Central Park) cannot be beaten, especially for first-time tourists.;5
The Ameritania was in a great location with easy access to the subway and a quick walk to Central Park and Times Square.  The room was small but well decorated and very clean.  It has clearly been updated in recent years with beautiful tile in the bathroom and updated light fixtures and furniture.  The person at the front desk during check-in was personable and helpful and set a positive tone for our stay from the start.  Considering it was the most reasonably priced hotel in the location we wanted, the hotel exceeded our expectations.;5
had a really good stay,  hotel staff was real helpful an friendly,  Everything was very nice and clean, amazing front desk staff, Definitely recommend staying here if you come to New York. Great hotel..;5
As a proud born & bred New Yorker,[which obviously most of you are not] was excited to return back ,After booking room months in advance and explaining how important and special this homecoming trip was for my wife and kids, we were assured to have a room with a view. What you gave us was a back corner looking at a wall. Shame on you. My only relief in this is karma....what goes around will surely come back around, and hopefully two-fold. Simply no care, pride, or love in what you do...just a job going through the motions.  There is nothing you can say to take away the disappointment. [1]-brown water[rust] from bathroom sink. [2]- floor uneven with objects underneath filthy carpeting [3] room smelled [4]insecure internet [5] towel rack in bathroom not attached properly to wall;2
"this was the best hotel we have ever stayed at in NYC! First of all it was right in the center of everything. Beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable room, and quite large for downtown NYC!! It was super quiet in the room, even though we were right in the heart of the city on a weekend. I would like to give a shout out to the amazing front desk staff; Sarah, Nay, Robb Serg and Jana who were so friendly and helpful the whole stay! I have never felt so welcomed or comfortable in the city before.";5
We loved our stay at Ameritania! Everything was very nice and clean. The staff all was wonderful especially Sarah and Robb at the front desk. Definitely recommend staying here if you come to New York!;5
Thanks to Majid, my stay was wonderful.  The room was perfect and the bed comfortable.  No problem or complaint.  The only thing I would suggest is to enable each guest to control the thermostat and the television from the outset.  Had fun in NYC!;4
Great location and the staff were friendly as well . Minutes away from central park and Times square . Would definitely go there if i visit NYC again  . The street is easy to find and just 50 meters from food and CVS . We ordered a taxi from there for the airport and it was a good bargain .;5
This was my first time staying at The Ameritania, and, in general, I found it a wonderful mid-town property.  There were a few tiny glitches with room service, but nothing major.  Excellent service was provided by Chainea, Robby and Sarah.  However, their WIFI needs a serious upgrade.  It was virtually impossible for me to get any work done.  It took almost two days for me to upload a relatively small Video File.  I'm sitting in the United Club at the moment, and what took four hours at the hotel, was accomplished in less than a minute here.  If this improvement were made, I believe this could be a first class hotel for the business traveler.  But at present, it would, sadly, not work in that category.;4
The staff was extremely accommodating and willing to help. The location was perfect for what we were doing and the room was very nice. Above all else, it was very clean. I would recommend to others and I would stay here again;5
You could not ask for a better location if you are in NYC for a tourist-oriented visit.  All the staff was fantastic, very friendly and attentive.  This is not a luxury hotel, but the rooms are clean and comfortable and the lobby welcoming.  My wife and I highly recommend Ameritania.;5
A very nice hotel. Our rooms were clean, with plenty of space. The staff were helpful and attentive, and the hotel was in a terrific location. A very nice place for a very good price. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Rude staff and terrible service. Rooms are not cleaned at all during the stay(using the Covid excuse while in the reservation it is said daily cleaning) Location is good, but there are much better options around for the same price with much better service  Stay away!!;1
Wonderful Staff and a very clean room!  They were extremely helpful throughout our stay.  Also a great location within walking distance to theatres, Central Park, etc.  Reasonable rates as well.  Will stay again!;5
I picked this hotel on a whim for my first visit to Manhattan.(I’m from Virginia)  When I called to ask questions the staff was very polite and friendly. They recommended parking and addressed all of my concerns.  When I got there to check in my experience was even better! The two young ladies at the front desk were super sweet (Chainea and Sarah)! They explained everything thoroughly. They were  so kind and they also recommended places for me to go/eat. They genuinely cared  about my visit and my experience.  Thank you so much ladies for making my birthday trip so seamless and special!   Now as far as the hotel room itself.  It’s decent. For the price I would give the room/hotel an 8 out of 10. For the price/location its very fair.   My two small complaints would be that the;5
Upon arrival I was greeted with a  friendly smile from Chaunea and co workers as she assisted me with check in. She informed me of all details I would need to know while staying there and answered all my questions. I came to look forward to seeing her daily until I departed on my 4th in NYC. Two different gentlemen helped us with our bags one at arrival and another at departure. The decor of the hotel is beautifully eye catching.  The room we chose was beautiful it was standard hence a tight fit, next time I will go with a king room and YES I will 100% be back. The gym had great equipment though a very tight space.;5
The hotel was really well located, and the room seemed to have been renovated not too long ago. Especially the bathroom looked and felt modern, and featured a nice big shower. I am not a fan of having bathtubs in hotels, and it was very nice to have a proper shower. The stuff was always very friendly, Jarla and Brittany especially were very kind and professional. It was good value for money. The rooms we may be a bit small, but for the price I paid it was really acceptable.;5
Arrived at the hotel and was notified that I was charged $100 cancellation fee which in their website ( hotel website ) it says if you cancel your reservation they’ll charge you $100 and my booking was through a third party Booking.com which didn’t happen to say anything in that regard as well, Keep in mind that this is different than $100 incidental fee. Anyways we agreed to pay the amount they asked for on top of the cancellation fee that they already held and incidental fee. We asked if we can get a room at 1pm. Hotel policy Checkin at 3pm and if you check in before they’ll charge you another $100.  The lady at the front desk Ashley said  that she doesn’t have a room in the same category at that time. We did ask for a different category her answer was I can get you a room;1
The location is good and near Times Square. The price is cheap!  Good service from Sarah and Ashley! Although the room is relatively small, the interior finish is new and modern.  Overall, it's a good hotel to live!;5
"Good side - Good location, friendly bellmen.  Bad side - The management are cheap. You can tell by the hidden costs like the ""resort fee"" what is so resort about this place? The free breakfast is cold coffee -- often out, there is a chargeable room service breakfast you can order from a menu with no prices! The staff are clearly underpaid, we were told without tips and side hussels most of the staff could not afford to eat.  On check in I was given ORDERS not to use any food delivery service... they would reject it, but I could use the overpriced service they get a kick back on and I was given a card. $50 minimum delivery fee? I also had initially about 8 disclaimers and waivers because they get alot of credit card disputes. I was also warned not to miss check out time by even a";2
I’ve stayed at this hotel a few times do to it’s great pricing, location, and excellent staff.  The rooms are always clean upon arrival. It is has an easy marker for people to find being right next to the Colbert show in Times Square it also has quick access to the e train express which will get you to most places in the city easily;5
Sarah and the staff gave us a warm welcome !! Room clean , bathroom excellent!!! .   Main lobby well maintained and clean!   The location of the hotel is excellent cause we visit a lot of sightseeing in Manhattan   Will come again!!!!thanks Sarah;5
This place is a gem.  From the doorman to the front desk staff everyone we encountered was helpful and responsive.  The only issue we had was with a defective door lock which was fixed the day we reported it.  Morning coffee was a plus, bed and linens were comfortable and the bathroom was incredible.  Clean and spacious by NY standards, look no further.  Reasonable parking was 1/2 block away with great staff there as well.  No need to stay anywhere else - this will be our go to place.;5
we did a 2 night weekend stay . check-in wasn't as smooth as it could have been. that said the room ( 808) was fine. it was a good size room , king bed was comfy. the room had a fridge/ safe/ flat screen .AC was very good. the window coverings worked very well . the bathroom was well designed. the shower was a large space, good water pressure . the rain head was at least 8 1/2 high - . the bathroom had a window . the hotel has a small gym .  the location , @ 4 blocks to Times Square  . even on the 8th floor , there was street noise, ehh - nyc.   overall - a good hotel , I would stay there again.  JDS/CT July 2021. * the room was very clean.;4
The hotel is in great location, all staff were so nice and helpful. Especially Jaria. She was amazing!   It was very clean. Every morning they served coffee/ tea and also in the afternoon with a snack.  I highly recommend this hotel and I’m definitely gonna come back!!;5
We stayed in a standard queen. The room was very clean to my liking and Sarah at the front desk allowed us to check in 4 hours prior to check in time. The only negative is room did not come with mini fridge as stated on the website. However, hotel staff was very accommodating to bring ice and water to our room upon request. Overall great stay and would book again!;4
I was immediately greeted by a friendly girl named Brittany that helped me out with everything I needed throughout my stay. Great hospitality and right next to times square. Will be coming back very soon!;5
I will start with the the great location , walking distance from everything.  Reception are very welcoming and easy to deal with Rooms are nicely furnished and very clean and has everything u would need This area us great and very safe I would highly recommend this hotel;5
I have been to NYC many times. However, my husband and daughter had never visited so I chose Ameritania for our stay in July 2019. The hotel is very reasonably priced for the location. It’s a 5min walk to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall and Central Park. Rooms are very small but they’re clean and the beds are super comfy. I don’t think I would stay here again but if you’re visiting NYC for the first time, spending a couple of nights here would be easy to do.;3
Due to Government restrictions, we could not fly to New York and the Ameritania was also in lock down, so not accepting guests and yet we have been unable to obtain a refund for services not provided.  The Credit note offered was too restrictive, as while we would love to be travelling prior to the end of 2021, the impact this pandemic has had on us, like so many other people, financially, means that travel within the foreseeable future is unlikely, especially to the U.S.A.! A full refund would give us confidence to be booking with this hotel again.;1
I have stayed at this hotel for 5 consequent years and in October 2020 it was going to be my 6th. Unfortunately due to Covid,  I had to cancel my booking placed in January:  the staff was very kind, as usual and I was granted the refund. I always book the deluxe room with king size bed since this kind of  room is bigger and more comfortable. NY's hotels rooms are always very small, this is something known, but if you take a deluxe room, it is really much better. As written in the past, the position is great: very closed to Times Square and all main attractions, included the metro stop.;5
Me my son and his mate stayed here dec 7-14 nice clean hotel really friendly we never eat here but the door men made us feel welcome the room was well equipped bathroom clean the heating was good at one point we had to turn it off they took so much out of my account a day to pay for the amenities;5
When we arrived at the Ameritania we received a very warm welcome from the doorman Julian. He showed to our room. Due to a mix up from the travel agent our room was according to Julian, very very cozy. We had a clean, but small room with a small queen bed. The next morning we addressed the size of the bed at the reception. Christy and Hope were very understanding and promised us another room later that day. After a very nice day sightseeing New York we were welcomed by Christy and Hope and showed our new room. This one was very specious and super beds. We would like to thank the reception team again for pulling this off for us.  Robert Veenis;5
Spent 4 nights here in February 2020 - was hoping for snow but got none..! Very very cold though.   Whilst room was small, it had everything we needed and was always kept clean and tidy. Herself used the hairdryer and found it great. I have a bad back and find sleeping in hotel beds a bit of a lottery but the beds in the Ameritania were perfect for me. Not too soft but not hard either. Shower was amazing! Rooms were also very quiet. We didn't hear anything from outside or neighbouring rooms.   Location was perfect for walking to Times Square or to Central Park. We never used the subway so can't comment on that. We did buy a 48 hour pass for the Gray Line bus and this was fab. We did the four bus tours plus the boat trip and also used the bus to get around New York.   On to Jeff;4
We stayed here from 5th to 10th March! We had a great stay! Couldnt have been more helpful! Jeff was great at the door with our bags and also to show us where to go and what to see!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone!;5
Hubby and I stayed here from the 8th - 11th March, had conversations with both Christie and Haronil 😊 On arrival was upgraded to a king room along with bottle of champagne 🥂 downstairs was greeted by Jeffrey who was very helpful with regards to where to go in the city. Room was extremely comfortable and clean. Staff extremely helpful and polite.;5
We just got back from a girls trip to NYC.  We booked two rooms for four people at the Ameritania.  The doormen and front desk staff were all wonderful!  We did have a room on the fifth floor and had to buy earplugs because the street was noisier than we had expected.  The rooms and bathrooms were always very clean.  The only two negative things that I would like to note is that every day the housekeeping for one of our rooms forgot to supply washcloths so we had to call down to the desk every night, and there is no ice machine on the floor so we had to call down for a bucket of ice each night as well.  Other than that, we had a wonderful stay!  GREAT location if you want to be around everything but not in the heart of Times Square.;4
This hotel is in a fab location for our stay! We first had a king room on the 12th floor (their highest). I found the bed way too soft (old mattresses with toppers I suspect)  so on our 2nd of five nights they moved us to another king room on the 10th floor. This was done with no fuss at all and greatly appreciated. The rooms have been renovated but maybe a number of years ago?? They were clean (I’m the type to check under beds!) and the king room was very spacious for central NY. Every afternoon in the lobby free muffins, fruit, biscuits, croissants, soft drinks are offered which was a nice surprise. My only complaint would be that all the hotel doors seem to slam. I had to ask our neighbours to please close theirs gently. There is a bit of street noise - but this is central;4
Great hotel, great and friendly staff. Especially Maura. The room is clean, spacious, bed was great The location is great as well. Close to everything, subway stations, Time Square, Central Park.. I will stay in this hotel.;5
Stayed at this hotel on Valentines weekend.  GREAT location, 5 min walk from Time Square, TONS of restaurants options and delis if you want to save a few bucks.  10 walk to Central Park, 30 min walk from Met Museum. Staff was very helpful.  Room was nice, a little small, but that's NYC.  Highly recommend this location!;5
Personal very friendly, rooms was cleaned every day, hotel is the near of the time square and the center park. The only bad thing was in the night. The room is in the night to cold. The bathroom hasn't a locker.;5
Recently stayed at the Ameritania and had one of the best breaks we've ever had, the hotel was excellent and in an excellent location. The staff were always pleasant and extremely helpful, especially Jeffery (what a star). Great holiday guys, thank you.;5
The staff was very friendly and they really show interest in making you feel welcome and appreciated as a customer. As soon as we got there, the doorman was helping us to get settled, Sufia, at the front desk was amazing as well.  We were able to check in earlier (11 am) and they even upgraded our room. We requested a high floor and it was provided to us without hesitation.  The room was really comfortable and the bathroom and shower were awesome. The location is great.  I will definitely stay here again!;5
I have just come back today from staying in the Ameritania hotel for 4 nights. And all I can say is that it was amazing! The door staff are so polite and always welcome you in. Upon arrival, we were told we had been upgraded for free. We were expecting small rooms in NYC, but we were given room 712, two big beds, a lovely bathroom and very spacious. The hotel is pretty much at the bottom of Times Square, turn right out of the hotel then right again and you are on the tracks of Times Square. Broadway theatres are located very close, mean girls theatre is literally the street next to the hotel. A great stay here, would recommend to anyone!;5
Me and my hubby are just home after having stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights!! What can I say! From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone was friendly, the room whilst small was spotlessly clean, tidy and my goodness the bed was super comfortable and the shower just perfect!! We were standing scratching our heads wondering what direction to take on our first venture out and we were rescued by Jeff who sat with us for 10 minutes explaining uptown and downtown and highlighting a map, suggesting ways to walk or what trains to take on the underground!! This was so helpful so big shout out to Jeff and thanks so much!! The hotel location is just fab!! 5 minute walk and you were in Times Square or Central Park!! Yes the room is noisy but didn’t expect it to be a;5
We have just returned from staying at the Ameritania for 4 nights. The location of the hotel is fantastic, short walk from times square, subway stations and central park. The staff were friendly and always had a smile on their face. Hotel was clean and modern. The room was a decent size and bed was comfy. Will defo be staying again if we come to NYC again. The only thing I would change is the tea/coffee facilities, it would be much better to have these in the room like other hotels,rather than in reception, as it would be nice to have in bed in the morning. But small price to pay for such a lovely hotel.;5
Just returned after staying here for two nights. Hotel is 3 mins from Times Square, location is perfect for Broadway too.  Staff is very kind and friendly and super helpful. I emailed them a week before we arrived and asked a room with a view on the upper floor and they did everything we asked for. So thank you again for that.  There are some complimentary tea and coffee in the morning and some snack after 4. Room was basic but perfectly fine. It was clean, only the windows would need more regular cleaning.  It is a bit tired so that is why I have the 4 stars but the building is beautiful.  I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again  Thank you;4
We are just back from our family NY holiday  It was the kids first time there and they absolutely loved it  I chose this hotel for its convenient location and the fact that there’s not 500 rooms ! It was perfect ! Staff so helpful and friendly  Free tea and coffee every morning and the beds are soooooo comfy which is always welcome after a day walking for miles !!!!! We will be back hopefully 🙏🙏🙏;5
Our initial impression of the Ameritania was not as good as we had expected. I had cancelled a stay at the Doubletree Times Square because of poor reviews. We chose the Ameritania for the predominance of reviews stating the rooms were a decent size. Which for New York City is a bonus.  However, when we arrived we were given room 1120. Now, all the rooms numbered 20 on all floors are to the left of the elevators as you face them, and are absolutely tiny. It felt more like a cell than a hotel room.  The room was tidy, the bathroom recently refurbished, but the size was so small we struggled with 2 people in there. The bed was barely wider than a single. I am 6'4 inches tall, and my partner is 5'10. We struggled terribly. We advised the front desk, but the hotel was full. But we;4
Haven't not been to NYC before and returning  today back to the UK , we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and I can say the staff were pleasent and helpful especially  julian! , the hotel was clean and tidy and close to times square . Nice sized bed and bathroom and tidy room .   I would definitely  recommend  this hotel again  especially  when we re visit the big apple again .;5
I was selected as guest of the day yesterday so our room was upgraded and got some free amenities. The stay was I'd say almost perfect. Clean, neat. In the front desk, everyone was nice except the blonde lady at the right most. She only accommodates white people, me and my sister wanted to check in but she didn't even bother to talk. Later I saw her accommodating french couple w big smile. Such discrimination.. I had to reach out to the team leader, he was a gentleman. If you're asian, watch out for that lady. This is unacceptable but we received great service otherwise therefore 4 star!;4
The hotel was very clean. The room was big and the beds were nice as well. The staff was very kindly, especially Jeff, he told us a lot of tips about NY. I enjoyed my time here. If I will ever visit New York again, I will certainly come back to this hotel.;5
This hotel came as a pleasant surprise for us. The reception area is quite smart, with a small bar. But what pleased us most was the Malmaison style room, with a lovely comfy bed, good sized tv and a lovely large shower room. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room, but bottles of water were replenished each day, along with nice toiletries. There was complimentary tea and coffee in the bar each morning and at times there were facilities for tea/coffee making alongside iced water in the reception. The location just could not be better: theatres, cafes, bars and of course Times Square all close by. The staff were lovely and there was a really cosy, welcoming atmosphere. Definitely a good deal compared with other similarly priced hotels in this area that we have stayed;4
We’ve visited New York for my partner’s 30th birthday and spent a week in this amazing city. I’ve chosen Ameritania for our stay, and I’m so glad I did it. Super location! The staff was very helpful, the check in and check out was easy and smooth without any issue. (They have a small extra fee what you need to pay at the end of your stay and they ask for a $100 deposit.) Our room was pretty small but it was perfect for us, we spent most of the time discovering NY. Jeffrey from concierge was especially kind and helpful! 😊;5
"This is very nice hotel with a great location. Walking distance to Time Square; Rockefeller Center; Central Park; 5th  Ave; etc. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Rooms are on the smaller side, but so are almost all average hotel rooms in NYC.";4
Rooms are ok, however, it was the staff that made the trip great for us. Jeff the doorman was so nice and helpful! Also, we had a mishap with our room at 4am and between the front desk staff and the engineer (I can't remember his name, but he was so great!), things were handled so well.;4
Thank you so much to Jeff for being so helpful during our stay! Couldn’t have gone better. Lovely rooms, every staff person you encounter is friendly and helpful! And the location is super convenient for a trip to NYC;5
Just returned after 4 nights at Ameritania. Perfect location for theatres and Times Square. Stayed in two rooms on the 8th floor, very clean rooms and comfortable beds. Showers were luke warm one morning which was rectified quickly. Staff were great, polite and courteous, especially Sufia! Would defenatly stay again.  Michelle;5
Stayed 12th to 16th. No complaints. Everything was ok. Would stay here again but hopefully on a higher floor as the air conditioning  unit outside our window at the back of the hotel was very loud and had trouble sleeping. I developed a stomach bug while  there but it was nothing to do with the hotel. Great staff too. Very helpful.;4
Literally just leaving the hotel fab stay the room was perfect  - cleaned every day. Staff were brilliant - we stayed on the 7th floor in room 702 and had no issues at all. Julian on the door arranged us a transfer to the airport which was lovely too - thank you for a lovely stay.;5
We stayed in a deluxe room with king bed.  It was, hands-down, one of the most comfortable hotel beds we ever slept in.  The pillows were heavenly as well.  Clean room and super friendly staff.  We will definitely stay at the Ameritania again next time we are in NYC.;5
The hotel was a fabulous location near times square, the hotel itself was great. Our room was a little on the small side but to be honest it didn't affect our stay as we weren't in the room very much.  The only thing I would say would be to include basic tea & coffee facilities in the room as there weren't any and we had to keep sending out for hot drinks which was a pain TBH.  Jeffrey on the front door was excellent very friendly and helpful.  Great trip to my favorite place in the world and can't wait to go again. xx;4
Nice Hotel. Room with excellent structure, clean, cozy. Helpful and cordial staff. In addition, I would like to congratulate the honesty of the employees, especially General Manager Jean-Francois Tremblay !! During my stay, I lost my wallet with passport, money and credit card in the hotel. It was found by the team and returned to me without any loss. I recommend and would stay again here.;5
First of all I will mention that the only good thing about this hotel is the bell boys. They went above and beyond to help.    The staff at front desks are absolutely dreadful. No help at all. The elevators are all knackered, three times we got locked in them, we started taking the stairs to the room which was on the 10th floor. The stairs were shocking as you can see from one of my pictures there was loose mains wires hanging out the wall !! If a child was to even go near the stairs it could have been dangerous.   The room ... the room was an absolute disgrace as you can see from the pictures it was filthy, every day something new would go missing from our room small items like a pair of gloves then it was a pair of trousers.  When we checked into the room there was an old pair;1
"We had an absolutely fantastic stay at this hotel, we could not be happier with the hospitality or level of service!  It was my first time visiting NY so had no expectations. Two realities that are worth noting are how expensive the City is, we underestimated that. Also, Times Square is particularly loud at the weekends, so it's worth expecting that. We arrived on a Thurs and the noise at night was notably different on Friday! I loved the vibrancy of everything so didn't mind at all. It is ”the City that never sleeps"" after all!  Everyone at the Ameritania was so kind and couldn't be more helpful and hospitable. I would recommend to anyone visiting NY and would be delighted to stay there again.";5
Unfortunately I am left with no choice but to leave a poor review. The customer service at this hotel is nothing short of shocking. Please be wary of paying residents tax in cash. They’ll take it again from the registered credit card claiming it was never paid- someone pocketing cash??   Obviously you have returned home so then spend months trying to sort with them ignoring your emails/ correspondence and leaving you out of pocket.   Claimed passed issue back to booking agent- but agent unaware and chasing continues again.  Disgusting behaviour from what should be a reputable hotel.  Very unhappy as tarnished what would have been a great trip.;1
Brilliant location with fantastic staff especially Julian & Jeff the doormen great help & advice on where to visit & where to eat couldn’t be more helpful all the staff were great, room was exactly what was needed for the trip will definitely be back;5
Loved this hotel, fantastic location, close to Broadway and plenty of places to eat.  Julian and Jeff were great doorman, so helpful and happy to help this made such a difference. We will definitely be back.;5
Can't recommend the team at the ameritani NYC enough . Really helpful friendly and went out of there way to help with a few email issues. Hotel was clean and tidy and very warm . Jeff at conceirge was fabulous . Will be back again;4
Stayed here January 2020 and couldnt fault one thing. Staff were friendly and helpful from the second we arrived to the second we left. Hotel was clean and well maintained. In a brilliant location to times square. Would definitely recommend!;5
Just spent 4 nights in the Ameritania Hotel. It was so central to the visitors attractions. Room was spacious enough and the bathroom was well equipped and a great shower, hotel supplied essential liquids. Good WiFi. Jeffery was very helpful and gave us some sound advice on getting around. Reception staff were very nice and there tea and coffee available free all day.;5
This was a great choice of hotel for my first time in NYC. I went with my mom and we left happy. The location is perfect, it's nice that its not right in the middle of Times Square since I was always able to get a good sleep because it wasn't noisy. The hotel is nice and has character to it, every staff member we came across was helpful and super friendly. We took an uber from Newark to the hotel and a shuttle was arranged to drop us back off at the end of the trip, so that was easy enough. I recommend staying here if you want to be around all of the action, easy subway access to other parts such as Brooklyn, but still be able to get a good sleep! The only negative thing I experienced was there was never hot water when I had a shower in the morning, I can imagine it's because;4
Only hotel I stay in when in NYC. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Thank you to Christie and David, at the front desk and Jeffrey at the entrance. They are truly an asset to your organization.  Great location, rooms, lobby and complementary refreshments Looking forward to my next visit.   Regards, Michele Durst;5
I stayed here for the first time last evening. I brought my 12 yo daughter to see a broadway play. I chose this hotel based on the great price and amazing reviews it received. I was not disappointed! The people working there were the friendliest and most helpful people I’ve experienced in  my travels. The rooms were nice, with bottles of water and a variety of fruit on the desk in our room. My daughter loved the robes and slippers that were left on each of our beds and was excited about the marge shower! It was such a great stay I booked another stay next month for a conference I have to attend! Thank you for making this special mommy daughter overnight so special!;5
Stayed 4 nights at the hotel.    The hotel is in a great location and within 5/10 minutes walk from Times Square, Central Park and more.     Bedroom was a good size for NYC and the bathroom was very well appointed with a walk in rain shower.  Only minor comment about the bedroom was the lack of tea/coffee making.  Was available trhough at the small bar area free of charge.  There isn't a serviced restaurant on site however there is so much choice in the area you don't miss it.   Another plus point is the free wifi throughout which was great.  Last but not least the staff throughout the hotel who were friendly and helpful.  All in all a very good base for a visit to the big apple.;4
Thanks Sufia for your warm welcome, I had a nice stay close to Central Park and Times Squares. Room were clean, the staff very kind. Such a beautiful place to hang out in New York City.  See you again soon;5
Stayed in the hotel a few weeks ago , hotel was fab staff lovely and friendly and great location close enough to Time Square with it being in the middle of it.  Two minutes from subway so getting to and from airport was super easy. Would definitely stay again;5
I recently stayed at the Americana at Times Square and enjoyed my stay.  Kristy, the Manager, was so helpful and kind.  She went out of her way to assist me with directions and suggestions.  The rest of the staff including the front desk, bellmen, etc.  were in a word 'great'.   Thank you for such a great experience!!!;5
If you are looking to pay a reasonable price for a good hotel which has a great location , first-class customer service then this is the hotel for you! Right from the minute, we entered the premises doorman GEOFF was on hand to assist and provide good tips and this continued throughout our stay. I have to mention that all of the door staff and reception staff were first-rate but it was Geoff who we mainly dealt with. We had a slight noise and view issue with our King Delux room but manager CHRIS was on the case and moved us into a lovely room the following day and even though this caused us minimal inconvenience we were compensated. Tea and coffee in reception every morning and again at 4 pm with a choice of small cakes. Geoff booked our ride back to the airport at $65 which was;5
My partner and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel, it was generally clean and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is situated very close to Times Square, we thought the location was perfect as it was easy enough to get to from JFK using the air train and the subway. Good value for money. My only comment if I’m being picky is that our headboard on the bed needs replacing. Would stay here again and would recommend to a friend.;4
Stayed for 5 nights during our first ever trip to New York. Had a fantastic trip and was very pleased with decision to stay at the Ameritania. Good clean and spacious room, with a fantastic shower. Staff were friendly and helpful, particularly Jeff the doorman who was most kind to offer loads of advice upon our arrival about where to go and what to see. Super location but early rises due to the amount of cars horn honking out on the roads, but I guess that’s pretty common across NYC! Would return.;4
Stopped here for 4 nights and had a great time.  The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  David on reception was so helpful when we first arrived as there was a mix up with our booking but he soon sorted it and even gave us an upgrade.  The room was spacious and clean.  Loved the shower, roomy and clean.  Just not enough plug sockets for 2 ladies so a good job I took my 6 gang extension lead lol.  The snacks that are served between 4 and 6 were a great treat, after a hard day walking and seeing the sights we headed back to the hotel to recover ready for the night time touring.  No kettle in the room but asked reception and they sorted one out for me. The concierge are very helpful too and the barman Javier was friendly and a pleasure to have a;5
I was there for a business trip. The hotel is clean and the bed is comfortable. Front Office staff is friendly and helpful. Bellmen always smile and help with information and direction. Lots of bars, restaurants and theaters in the area. It’s walking distance close time square where it’s the center of New York City. Will definitely recommend and stay again.;5
I had previously stayed here 5 years ago. It was great to come back to familiarity. Not much has changed to the hotel. It still feels very welcoming and laid back (maybe the elevator doors seem a little angry though). I had a deluxe king room on the third floor. It was adequate in size and had everything you need during a stay. However, when I visited in January, it was particularly cold and the bathroom was freezing as there was no heating in there, Overall, I cannot really fault Ameritania and would stay there a third time without hesitation. Special thanks to doorman, Jeff, who kindly organised a ride back to the airport. Our driver was great and he played some cool chilled tunes on the way.;4
Just came back from our trip to New York, stayed at the ameritania, it’s central to everything, our room was good, such a comfortable bed! Shower was lovely and powerful, although busy outside you couldn’t really hear to much from outside, you were so tired from all there is to do you slept well! The staff were amazing, Julian helped us with the subway, took us right there, told us what subway to take back, so friendly, javier was on the bar, lovely man and great to talk to, all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel;5
The room was very nice ! Beutiful decorated and very clean . especially the bartender, javier, was very nice! We had a lot of fun so we recommend this hotel to everybody. Also the bed ligt very lekker .;5
It was a great hotel, quiet at night and vibrant during the day.  The staff especially Sufia went out of their way to makes feel welcome.  The room was very comfortable and clean.   Shower was very nice.   Snacks offered at happy hour was an added bonus. Excellent location with lots of fun restaurants close by.;5
We stayed her for a week in January 2020.  The desk staff were helpful on arrival and gave us lots of information including a list of local recommended restaurants.  We were told there are snacks in the foyer during happy hour, 4-6pm every day.  Unfortunately we didn’t realise there are also breakfast snacks available in the mornings until our last day.  Something to keep in mind for net time. The bartender was excellent and chatted easily with us.  Jeffrey the doorman was polite and courteous and arranged a car for us to return to the airport on our last day.  The bed was comfortable, the shower was warm and strong, and the room was bigger than we expected.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is doe to problems trying to stabilise the air conditioning.  We advised the;4
My daughter and I were so impressed by the very energetic and helpful receptionist, David V, that checked us in last night. He was very receptive to our request to change rooms so that we could be in a different area and we really enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend this place!;5
Our stay at the Ameritania was incredible. The stay started off with Chris checking us us in to a Junior Suite. When I tell you that this is by far the largest room I have ever stayed in during any of my many visits to NYC, understand that I also mean that it was bigger than my niece's NYC apartment! The lobby is fun & funky - a perfect welcome to NYC.  The rooms are beautifully appointed - clean, calming and comfortable. It's a good thing we saw Mean Girls (right around the corner!!) the day we arrived - I absolutely did not want to get out of bed in the morning because the mattress was so comfy. And the bathroom ... dear me, the bathroom is gorgeous & the shower is heavenly! That rainwater shower head made me want to re-do my master bath at home. In addition to the wonderful;5
Hotel is in a perfect location, 5 minute walk to Times Square and 5 minutes in the other direction to Central Park, and 53rd Street station a matter of minutes away.  Hotel was nice and clean, comfy beds, plenty of room, and a great shower. We were located at the centre of the hotel so it was nice and quiet at night, and real easy to sleep.  Didn’t get the girls name on checking in, but Jamal on the door was excellent in giving us plenty of advice and bringing our bags to our room, as was Jeff when leaving the hotel and putting us into our taxi. Maura also made check out really easy on the front desk.  Would definitely recommend this hotel if your planning a trip to New York, if we’re to go back I’ll definitely be checking it out again, such a reasonable price too!;5
Clean room, fresh clean sheets, comfy bed., windows that can be opened ! No street noise, we were on the 7th floor facing Broadway. We were upgraded without request which was very nice. Room service is provided by an off site catering and arrived hot and was reasonably priced for NYC. Their is complimentary coffee available in the morning. A small bar and lounge area with a warm fire place for conversation. We were in town for the night , and out stay was perfect.;4
We spent 4 nights at the Ameritania and it was perfect for us, a family of four,we were on the top floor and even slept with the window open and Times Square didn’t keep us awake  Rooms were clean and tidy, tea and coffee provided in the morning and fruit and cakes in the afternoon   Jeffrey the doorman was ace, he organised our transfer back to the airport at a great price and told us where to eat, nothing was to much trouble  Would I stay again?......definitely;4
Fab hotel in Midtown Manhatten. Close to Central Park and Times Square. Very clean, comfy rooms and staff mega helpful, particularly Jeff the doorman. He really helped us plan our activities and how to negotiate the subway. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Clean room, friendly staff, comfortable enough bed. If you catch it at a good price, it’s a very good value. Great location for tourists, close to Crntral Park and Times Square. Get a king size bed for a better sized room. If you’re not from a big city, not a suburb of the city, stay above the ninth floor. It will be quieter and the bright signs will be less intrusive. If you want the whole touristy stay, stay fifth floor or lower. If you’re a tourist and you have leftover money on your subway card, leave it in addition to your tip for housekeeping. They use the subway to get to work, they don’t live “in the neighborhood” walking distance generally.;4
The hotel is very good located. The rooms are big and the service is super friendly. Jeffrey helped me in everything I needed. I really recommend this hotel to everybody.  Moreover, you can easily order a car to go to the airport.;5
Had the best time in New York! Will definitely stay at this hotel again when I return to New York!!  room was amazing staff and door men Jeff and Julian spot on guys.  Keep up the good work guys  Till next time 😘;5
My girlfriend and I won a flyaway trip to NYC, where we were put up in this hotel, from check in throughout the entire stay we were greeted with friendliness! Sofia handled our check in and check out and she was the kindest lady. David helped us with any troubles or questions that would arise, he was such an outgoing guy who went above and beyond! The doorman, Said, held our bags at check out and continued to be so helpful to assure that we had the smoothest departure possible, he went out of his way to find which terminal we would have to go to to get home. Overall this place was amazing to say the least! The rooms were so clean and everything was fabulous!! Thank you Ameritania!!;5
Nice clean friendly hotel would do anything for u,would go again great location also “JEFF” the concierge guy top bloke great help,rooms cleaned daily,great location 5 mins from times Square. First time to NYC good trip.👏👏👏;5
I always stay here when I come to the city and it gets better each time!  Rooms are clean and spacious, I can walk to so many attractions and dining. I never miss eating at Alfredos just around the corner.  Julian at the door goes above and beyond to get a cab, see that you get where you want to go and offer friendly helpful service with a smile... love him!  The front desk can answer any question you might pose!;5
This hotel is very lovely would 100% recommend it! The staff is beyond friendly. We did have a slight problem where the AC (which was turned completely off at the time) started spewing water. We called the hotel staff who sent someone to check it out, they realized that it was about to catch on fire and immediately jumped into action and had us pack our bags. David V. came in and upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of wine on the house for all the troubles! Couldn’t ask for better service!!;5
I have stayed here 2 years in a row with a group of students.  The staff here has always been so nice and helpful.  The location is fantastic. Near restaurants, theater, shops, and more.  We take the group all over and public transportation is easily accessible.  This year, some of our group was on a flight out that was cancelled and the hotel staff went above and beyond to help us out.  Jeffrey is always on point helping with whatever comes up, bags, transportation, and more.  He is awesome.;5
Well what can I say from the minute we arrived it was an amazing experience. Jeff(consierage/ door man +++)  Thank you so much for your help, knowledge and advice you are an amazing lovely, kind, knowledgeable person and such a valuable asset to the hotel. The other doormen were so helpful and polite too. All your staff are amazing. The rooms were amazing so clean and comfy, we wanted for nothing. Thank you so much to ALL your staff for an amazing stay at The Ameritania Hotel xxxx;5
As usual our stay at the ameritania has been faultless If you want a hotel at a reasonable price and great location you won't go far wrong here  All the staff are great A big thanks to Jazleen for getting us into our room promptly on arrival with no fuss at all it's what we needed after the trip we had  Will definitely stay here again when we are back in this beautiful city  :);5
We stayed here for 4 nights in Jan 2020. The hotel is lovely and clean and staff are extremely helpful, one doorman in particular named siad couldn't have helped us enough, from taking our cases to our room to providing us with information to enjoy our stay he was worth his weight in gold. The only negative thing I would say was that the room state that they have a refrigerator which ours didn't and on the Sunday and Monday night the bar wasn't opened which was abit strange as it says that it's open daily from 5-11pm. Despite these few negative things I would definitely return.;5
Rooms are very clean! Maids do there job very well great eye for detail! And presentation outstanding well done! (Im housekeeping supervisor back in the UK) Bellmen so nice and welcoming, front desk reception staff where pleasant upon our arrival! Spoke with the manager before we left! He is a credit to the hotel. Thankyou for a nice stay!;4
I recommend this hotel to everyone. Booked through lastminute.com who had booked  single room for my daughter & I. David & Hope upgraded without hesitation & Jeff the doorman was a 'superstar' Fabulous!;5
"I booked this hotel through Expedia and upon arrival was shocked at the poor condition of the room.  It looked nothing like the pictures depicted on Expedia.  There were several hastily done patches on the walls to cover what I assume were water stains and the fabric of our headboard was peelilng and torn. The ac and heat did not work properly either.   I've stayed in better motels.  They did waive their ""resort"" fee, but did nothing else to make me feel better about wasting over $700 for the room.   This was a shabby, dark and cheaply decorated room.  Probaby much like the rooms one would find in TImes Square back in the '70's.   I would steer clear of this place.";2
We had a great time staying at the Ameritania hotel, great location and very friendly staff. Jeff in particular was a great help to us our whole trip. He drew us out places to go on the city map which was a great help and even booked us our taxi back to the airport on our way home. Couldn’t recommend the hotel more and Jeff especially.;5
"What a wonderfull stay yet again.  I was traveling with a group of 40 high school students.  The staff was terrific from the moment we arrived, handling the bus and luggage with professionalism and organization.  All of the Bellmen are helpful and Jeff is awesome!  His ""system"" the last day was a blessing when trying to wrangle 40 people and bags (it's almost like herding cats).  He made it smooth and easy.... The level of dedication the staff puts in makes my job easier :-)  The rooms and room keys were ready on arrival and the wake up call was timely each morning. The rooms are larger for NYC standards and always clean.  Wonderful housekeeping service and the breakfast was well run and organized.  The location can't be beat!  A 10-minute walk to Times Square with multiple";5
We stayed here for 9 nights over Christmas and New Year! The staff were so friendly! A big shoutout to Jeffery the bellman, he was incredible, very friendly, helpful and knowledgable - he gave us some great information and tips to make our experience the best ever. Julian the bellman was also extremely lovely and helpful. Hope was an amazing receptionist, always pleasant, such a sweet kind girl - we wanted to take her home with us!!! These guys really did make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel is situated in a perfect location close to subways, bus links, and everything else you may need and was very very clean. Thank you for having us! See you again! Fordham Family.;5
it was my first time stay at ameritania . i had a great time . the rooms are perfectly sized and they clean really good . it’s also very close to time square and located by good shops and restaurants . a worker there named jeff was amazing ! i definitely recommend stay here !;5
We’ve just returned from NYC, where we had our third stay at the Ameritania hotel.  The service was fantastic and as always Jeff and the rest of the staff were amazing! The twin room we stayed in was clean and spacious and I always sleep well at the Ameritania as the beds are sooo comfortable! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in NYC and would like to be within walking distance to many of the major attractions such as Central Park and the Rockefeller Centre.  Thank you to the staff at the Ameritania for another wonderful stay.;5
we were in new york in May 2017 to get married in central park, and chose this hotel primarily because the location was perfect for us, within walking distance to both central park and time square. the staff is absolutely wonderful and mainly the guys in the door, I can only remember one name, Yassir but both he and the others were really nice and helpful. and as a big surprise, the hornet offered a larger finer room as a surprise when we came back from our wedding ceremony, in the room there was a bottle of champagne to celebrate, this was just magically done nicely. I can warmly recommend this hotel, and if you are thinking of getting married in New York? Do it, it will be an unforgettable experience 😊;5
This was my first time to stay at this property but my 4th time in the city.  I booked it because of the excellent location, decent reviews, and very accommodating price I was able to find thru Orbitz. It did not disappoint!! I hardly ever leave reviews, which I should as I base a lot of my choices on other people's, but I had to for this hotel! Jeff was AMAZING. He assisted us from when we arrived from the airport, to when we left. He took the time to get to know us and ask why we were there. He got us a car to take us back to the airport after our stay at a better rate than a taxi at an appointed time, no wait! He walked over to a coffee shop to get us coffee when the lobby had none!!! Who does that?? No one, and when you find someone who does you take the time to recognize;5
fab location...easy access to subway. Times square on your doorstep .to be expected with city hotels rooms and lobby area slightly tired however the room was spacious enough comfortable beds clean room and good shower. Maids came everyday with clean towels. Iron and hairdryer in room no coffee facilities however in lobby every morning complimentary tea/coffee available from 7 to 930 and water available all day. resort fees payable approx. 25 dollars per room per night . fab diner 2 mins walk Cascade serving everything  we ate breakfast there everymorning (fresh tasty and reasonable price)  pizza shop 2 mins also  starting 8 dollars for a huge pie. in a nutshell perfect for what our family needed. ( myself and hubby late forties and two daughters 16/20 );4
This hotel is in perfect location for walking to major NYC attractions. It is a clean hotel too. I liked that the windows opened to let in air. However there are many things in the hotel, top being security, that need attention/upgrading. There are no lights at the entrance. Front desk is dim. Floor access for elevator is disabled. Bathroom shower leaks onto floor which is damaged. Chair fabric was peeling. The doorman was not consistently there. Anyone could walk in and go to any floor.  The resort fee per day should be removed until all of these items are addressed in the hotel.;3
The hotel was nice, but the best part was the bellboy/concierge who helped us. Jeffery went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay, and a safe and manageable price for our taxi service when we left. He was friendly, helpful, even telling us about his favourite restaurant for us to try for dinner. He called, on his day off, to make sure we had everything we needed for our trip. You can't ask for anything better than that!!! Make sure you ask for Jeffery during your stay - you won't be disappointed. 5 Stars!;5
We enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel. The service was excellent. All the staff were very friendly and took care of any requests we had.  The rooms were comfortable and well maintained. Well located to Times Square and surrounding area. Highly recommended;5
The first night of our stay we were on the second floor facing the street. It was so noisy outside that none of us slept well. We asked to be moved to a quieter room the next night and ended up in a smaller, interior room and it was perfectly quiet. Boy, did we wish we had been there the first night too. Great location. Clean, with the exception of the lobby bathroom which was in rough shape. Helpful staff.;3
Great hotel and price for staying near most of the midtown attractions. You can't beat the location, right on the corner of Broadway and next to the Late Show theatre. Staff is very helpful and checkin was fast. Great place for a family of four to stay during a quick trip to NYC.;5
This is our 4th trip to NYC and the first time staying at the Ameritania. It is a nice hotel, but smaller than we are used to, even in NYC. We had no room to store our clothes or luggage. Everytime we needed something we had to put our suitcase on the bed and go through it to find what we needed. It seemed we were constantly tripping over something. We were here Saturday-Tuesday. The only time I saw the bar open was Monday night. The hotel was clean and in a good location. All in all we had a good stay.;4
We stayed at the hotel in October 2019, and overall the stay was alright.  Pros:  -          The location was nice, it’s on Broadway right next to the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Central Park and Times Square are within walking distance. There’s a Starbucks right across the street, a subway station right around the corner and further down Broadway. -          The view is nice at night if you book a city view, which we did, though at first, we were given a room facing out into an alley. But the stuff friendly and moved us the next day -          The beds were comfortable. -          The tea and coffee bar in the morning was nice -          The hotel was clean        Cons:  -          The 20 USD a day residence fee. Not a surprise as it was in the booking email, but overall;4
The purpose of our stay was to experience Christmas in NYC. This hotel is in a great location. Close to everything we did. The room was very small and no view at all. I think it was because we booked through a 3rd party site. The staff was very pleasant and helpful.;4
Front desk staff were extremely helpful. They had us checked in and resting in our room quickly. Room was clean. Hotel location is excellent. Off site parking is across the street and very convienent to the hotel. Cost of overnight parking was very reasonable and less than on recent trips other cities.;5
Our stay at Ameritania At Times Sqaure was great, particularly to the thanks of Jeff.   Jeff took the time to explain the best ways to get around New York City. It was extremely valuable to our stay at the Ameritania Hotel.   Thank you Jeff.   10/10 for location, service and our overall stay.;4
"We were very pleased with our overall experience with this hotel.  From the outside, we thought we would be staying in an older hotel.  We were very pleasantly surprised when we entered and found a beautiful lobby,and modern rooms.  We were greeted immediately upon our arrival by the doorman who brought our luggage right into the hotel; the front desk staff was incredibly warm and welcoming.  We were pleasantly surprised to be able to get our room immediately upon arrival as we had a very early flight.    Our room was upgraded to a Jr. Suite, which was wonderful for the added space, but not good for the third member of our party as she was relegated  to the sleep sofa.  That was not a comfortable experience for her, sadly.  The hotel does not have a restaurant, but does have a";5
Great hotel a few blocks up from time square, room was perfect was clean and bed was comfy this was a must after spending hours of exploring the city! Hotel staff was great, the staff at the hotel reception gave us advice on the best way to get tickets for a broadway show which was a great help with it been a very popular time of year. All in all great stay!;5
I felt very safe with my 2 teens.  The hotel was conveniently located to many attractions.  We walked to all sites with no trouble.  The hotel was clean and staff was very friendly.  We would stay here again!;5
Great location and close to time square and subway. About 3 min walk to subway and 10 min walk to time square. Room was clean and comfortable. They Held our bags after checking out which helped so we could explore NYC before leaving! Also our room was available early when we checked in.;5
OK the room deco is a bit outdated but for the rest, everything is there ! Nice bed, not noisy, nice staff. A real 4 star. Considering the price, one of the best value I have seen in New-York ! Located half way between Central Park and Time Square.;4
We visited as a group of 2 families and had a fantastic stay at the Ameritania Hotel. While it isn't a huge hotel, we found this to be a benefit, as the staff got to know their guests. The rooms and the lobby were clean and modern and the showers in particular were great.  The only downside, as with other reviews, is the rooms overlooking thd street can be quite noisy. However, this would not put me off staying at this wonderful hotel. Finally, a special mention for the staff. I have stayed at different hotels in New York and have never come across such fabulous staff. In particular the bartender and the concierge staff. All go above and beyond in helping guests and make your stay special. I will definitely stay at the Ameritania again when we return to New York!;5
Excellent as always Samantha was incredibly helpful with all our needs and Javier as usual was the perfect bartender. Perfectly located a couple of blocks away from Times Square and the maddening crowd.;5
If you can manage a small room the hotel has great atmosphere and friendly staff. Lovely afternoon tea and snacks and coffee in the morning. Location is perfect for Times Square and other attractions nearby. Clean and everything worked.;4
"We were welcomed at Ameritania, especially by Majid, who was helpful and kind and assisted with the accommodation and transport. Very central location; good, clean rooms with excellent showers. Very good value.";4
"The Ameritania is a great hotel. Clean and warm in a fab location in the city not too far from Times Square. The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much bother for them. The doorman Jeff helped us a lot when we were checking out, storing our bags and ordering a taxi for us; a lovely friendly man :)";5
Just back after our 3rd stay great as always Jeff and co always so helpful room was fine we will be back a great location and very comfy bed after walking a great distance everyday  .Jeff got us a car back to jfk super quick and nice driver;4
We had a wonderful stay at Ameritania! The hotel was very clean and comfortable.  The location was in a great spot and easy to walk to many places!  But the best was the service of the staff!  - Jazleen, Julian,  Jeff and others!   Thanks for a great stay!;5
Very nice and clean.  I've read some people say the rooms were small, but they weren't that bad.  We had an issue with the heat and the room getting too hot.  After telling the front desk, it was fixed within an hour.  They were very apologetic and accommodating.  I would recommend this hotel and will stay here again.  Very close walk to central park, times square, Rockefeller center, etc.;5
Very nice and clean.  I've read a couple people say how small the rooms are, but they aren't that small.  We had a problem with our room getting very hot and not cooling.  After telling the front desk, it was fixed within an hour.  They were very apologetic and accommodating to the situation.  I highly recommend  this hotel.  Very short walk to central park, times square, Rockefeller center, etc.;5
Staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel and rooms were clean and inviting. Nice plush robes and slippers were  left on the bed for your use which was great since we were walking around in the rain all day. A few blocks from Times Square;5
Perfect stay - wonderful location.  Close to theater district but not in the middle of things. Room was great and very quiet. Comfy bed!  Glad to be near new Nordstrom.  Great shopping and amenities at the store.;5
We stayed 4 nights here in December.The hotel is friendly and welcoming and our room was great-clean,spacious with everything we needed.It was kept spotless by the hotel housekeepers. As soon as we arrived we met Jeffrey,one of the doormen/porters/concierge.He couldn’t have been more helpful,sorting our luggage and getting us a cup of tea as we were very early for our check in time.He got a map and advised us where best to go,get transport etc .When we set off next day for breakfast he told us of a deli and diner just 2 mins away and safe to say we ate there every day.Jeffrey was a credit to the hotel. On our departure day Jeffrey provided us with the email for the hotel so I could forward our boarding passes to print,which the receptionist did.Just helpful things like this make;5
The  Customer service was amazing. The door a man were incredible and so   The customer service was amazing. The door men were so friendly and helpful. The maid service was great. Location of the hotel is ideal. You are close enough to walk to everything but far enough away to have peace and quiet at night.;5
Adorable, quaint hotel in a great location. Free coffee in the mornings. Free water, replaced every day in the room. They arranged a car for me to the airport for a 4:30am pick up. They were friendly and kind. The rooms are clean and nice. This is a fantastic hotel!;5
Conveniently located just a short walking distance from everything in Midtown and from few subway stations that can take you anywhere else quick.  Rooms wary - from small and gloomy with no view to nice and bright with a pretty view of NY skyline. Overall experience, as usual, depends on the staff. A girl at the front desk might benefit from a customer service refresher training. But a gentleman Majid made an extra effort to make our stay enjoyable. THANK you Majid. It’s only because of you I am rating our stay highly and will not hesitate to stay again during our next visit.;4
Great from start to finish. Staff were all helpful and polite.  We were able to check in 2 hours early, fab after a long time travelling. The Hotel was clean and tidy and the location is just perfect. Within walking distance of most things. The room was a good size, warm, clean, modern bathroom and we were lucky enough to have a street view. Can’t recommend this hotel enough! Thank you for a wonderful stay;5
Great hotel and loved it. Best location and everything close by. Would definitely stay again with no hesitation.  The hotel was very clean and tidy and all staff very polite. Very spacious room and a truly amazing venue for my girlfriends 40th Birthday surprise.... Thankyou everyone at the hotel who made our experience a good one.;5
Stayed here for a last-minute trip into the city. It’s right at Times Square and close to Central Park, so it’s very convenient.   It’s a boutique hotel with a small lobby and bar. They have a good 2 for 1 happy hour, which is a great deal for nyc. The bartender is friendly and happy to give advice on restaurants and shopping.   Our corner room  had two double beds and was big. You could tell the hotel is a bit older but it was clean and the beds were comfortable. It was also very quiet and dark. That can be hard to come by in nyc.   Staff was polite and helpful.;4
Location is perfect for walking to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and most theaters.. Subway stations close to the hotel make visiting Central Park, the Met, and 9/11 museum are an easy subway ride. Lots of eating options from steakhouses to street vendors are in close proximity. Our only issue was housekeeping. Getting 2 washcloths (2 people in the room) daily was an issue and one day she left her used coffee cup in our room.  Jeff, the doorman, was fabulous. He took  care of our luggage, arranged for our return car to JFK, provided easy to follow directions and always had a smile and greeting. I would stay here again.;4
We had an amazing stay! The concierge mourad litrally made our stay he was great he helped us out so much with advise about where too go and what too do and so friendly so a huge thank you so much overall i would highly reccomend the hotel was clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful;5
Travelling with a 9 month old baby is always challengin, but when going to the city we didnt factor in the street noise that proves this city never sleeps. Originally assigned a room on the 3rd floor but after that 1st night when the baby didnt really sleep we asked if we could be moved up at all. The staff was extremly helpful and was able to accomidate out reqeust and move all of our luggage for us while we were out exploring the city.  The location is perfect, close to all of the major tourist attractions but not not right ontop of them. Just above Times Square and the theater district, just below the park and columbis cicrcle 1 avenue over from Hells Kitchen and a short walk from Rockefeller area. Beds were comfortable if you enjoy a nice soft bed then you will be in heaven.;5
We arrived at this hotel on 15/11/19 for 3 nights after an 18 hour journey from the UK, we were checked in and shown our room which was basically a large box room no bigger than 4m x 4m, add the furniture and there was very little room to move although the bathroom was a decent size, the views was just the inside of four tall walls with windows.. After such a long journey a nice shower was the order, NO hot water, rang reception, informed no hot water in the hotel due to a boiler problem but would be sorted soon. Got up next morning for a shower, still no hot water, told by reception same problem will be sorted soon. So had a cold strip wash, took my medication and went out for the morning. Returned after dinner and had a hot shower, went to take my medication which i know i;1
The hotel itself is very nice. Great bar, service, and location. However, the company's customer service is TERRIBLE! When I called the number on the website, I never was able to reach an actual person at the front desk.  There was a major storm in NY that caused me to have to change flights, but because I couldn't reach anyone at the hotel, I couldn't change my hotel reservation and so I ended being charged for two nights instead of one.  To get my receipt I had to call several times because the rude customer service staff kept transferring my call to a number where no one answered. Then they said that it may take 24 hours to email it to me. Makes no sense. It's a nice hotel, but not worth the trouble.;2
Hotel was perfectly situated near Times Square, 5th avenue, Rock Center and many other walk able destinations. From check-in, the staff was very friendly.  When we got to our room, we experienced an issue with the heater in our room. They were quick to resolve the issue by moving us to a larger room free of charge and even offered a slight discount for the inconvenience!  When leaving, Jeff was more than helpful to load our car and watch over the luggage while i walked to a nearby garage to get the car. Would highly recommend!;5
"I stayed here in December 2019. The hotel was a mixed bag in my opinion which led to only an average rating. Depending on what you're looking for, the rating may be higher.  Pros: -fast check in -little/no wait for elevators -nice bathrooms (look recently updated, compared to room) -comfy bed -good location for subway lines -good internet connection  Cons: -My room super noisy with street noise. I could clearly hear a woman talking on her phone across the street. The windows seemed very thin. Maybe its better on higher floors, but this was a major knock for me on staying here. If you want to sleep in or go to bed early, this was not the place to do it. -Room size is rather small, even for NYC. It was fine for just me, but would be tight with two people.  -""residence fee""";3
Room was small but warm and cosy with a lovely shower room. Tea and coffee supplied free in the morning and evenings down in the lobby. The hotel was very quiet for being in the Time Square area Staff were polite and helpful. Especially the doorman Jeff! He’s is a true gent and very informative. He was always there with a smile on his face and willing to help. Jeff is you’re reading this I hope you managed to get that Chick-fil-a XD and again thank you :) tell them you want a pay rise haha;5
We really loved our stay at the hotel. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. Love the rain shower head and water pressure, clean room and the staff was simply amazing. Majid went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and easy. Jeff was a great doorman and was helpful and friendly.;5
Stayed here 4 nights and have to say for the price was good. Bed softer than I'm used to but still comfortable. Great bathroom & shower. Plenty of decent towels toiletries & tissues. The staff were obliging and friendly.  Eating facilities are not provided but there are plenty of shops & restaurants nearby. Coffee and a selection of different teas are available in the reception area during the day. Unfortunately every time I wanted tea the hot water had run out, maybe a bigger or 2nd run would help.  Overall a good stay and based in a fabulous location for Times Square but away from the major hussle & bussle of being in the middle of it.  Would stay here again.;3
We really liked this hotel, lovely atmosphere all the staff we met were so friendly cannot praise them highly enough. The bedroom was a decent size and the bathroom was large, before we arrived my friend and I were joking about having to share a small bed but the bed was large and very comfortable. The room was very clean the housekeeping team do a great job thank you. Reception staff were very pleasant when we checked in our room was not ready, we were early as our flight got in early, this was not a problem as our cases were stored so we could go out and explore straight away, when we arrIved  back a couple of hours later the lady on reception recognised us straight away without having to give our names which was really nice. Jeff from front of house was lovely definately an;5
Service was excellent. Majid was extremely helpful as we arrived late on Thanksgiving night but he was cheerful and pleasant.  The room was clean and comfortable. The location is perfect for every show as well. Walking distance to anything that you might want to do in NYC.;5
Where to start. From arriving at the door Jeff toke us newbies under his wing. The man is a legend what ever you need he will make sure you will get it.  Front desk staff made everything nice and smooth just what you need travelling for such long time. Rooms nice and spacious and most importantly a good bed. To be fair that's actually what you need after walking nonstop threw Manhattan.  Located in probably best affordable spot near absolutely everything.  You can walk everywhere and if you want to go to statue of liberty or something like that subway (line 1 no changes). Best old school diner apple jack 1 minute away highly recommended for breakfast, brunch lunch or dinner. What we didn't know was the $20 residency fees which I found pretty steep for few coffee's or teas. 5th;5
Amazing Hotel and Amazing Staff. I had a medical emergency while there and they were quick to help me stay comfortable and safe during the emergency. It's also only a 15 minute walk from Centeral Park and Broadway!;5
I liked to stay at Ameritania at Times Square. Good service, excellent staff... Very good value, excellent location! You can enjoy the area... But the room, isn´t clean every day. We didn´t have soap, shampoo...;4
Right in the heart of Midtown.  A block from Subway station makes it easy to easily and inexpensively get from JFK Airport to Hotel.  Close to broadway shows, Ed Sullivan theatre, times square.  If too far to walk, head to the subway a block away.   Good for business travel (attending conference) or for couples looking to experience the energy of Midtown Manhattan.;5
Me and my partner came to stay at this hotel and we enjoyed everything about it, from the min we arrived we were met by Jeff ( he is a legend ) who is a credit to this hotel, if we were looking for places to visit he told us how to get there, makes a difference compared to other places we have stayed in, rooms were clean, stylish and very comfortable 10/10  Will definitely be back to this hotel in the future. Hotel great Jeff on the door 10/10;5
Our stay was very satisfactory, we had fresh sheet and towels everyday the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Jeff the bell man. Jeff was very helpful towards us and helped with anything we needed.;5
Great service, Jeffrey and Alex were very helpful and made our stay a lot more pleasant! The room was nice and clean and the location is perfect for first time visitors to the city. The staff was very very helpful and we felt right at home;5
My wife and I stayed at this property on a recent visit to the big apple. The property is old but still in very good shape. The rooms were comfortable and the staff courteous. It is the location we liked as it is a walking distance to all the most go to places in Manhattan. I would recommend if you looking for a good place to stay and location is your issue.;4
Absolutely fantastic staff! They truly were over accommodating at every step of the way. The front desk team were able to get my colleague and I an early check-in. The bellmen were also lovely. The room was large and had all the amenities necessary for a business trip.;5
Great location. Room had no microwave or refrigerator, but cozy. Room door was a bit thin as you can hear conversation from the hallway inside the room. Friendly and helpful staff. Ray’s Pizza around the corner was the best!;5
We had bad luck this time, but the front desk girl with the curly black hair was very nice and professional and knew how to handle the situation, they discounted 20 dollars of our 276 dollars check for the inconvenient  👍🏾;2
Just had four nights here, hotel is ideally located for a lot of the attractions.  Room was very nice, clean with very comfy beds and lovely crisp sheets.  Would have given it a five star review however I really missed making myself a cup of tea in my room so kettle etc would have been appreciated and there was a fridge in the room which was locked for some reason.  Special shout out and mention to Jeff the doorman who was so lovely and helpful, sorted us with a taxi for our return to the airport, nothing was too much trouble....the young man who collected us who was contracted to the hotel was an absolute delight and was so friendly and got us to JFK with time to spare despite the traffic being horrendous!  Can very much recommend this hotel.;4
Everything went well but I'm still waiting for the hotel to contact me about the money I lost after leaving my wallet in the room when checking out,the wallet was returned but 200+missing promised an investigation but ignored since.;2
I travel to NYC for business every month. I have stayed at the Ameritania at least 10 times over the past two years. I love that this hotel is in a great location in Manhattan. The bar and lounge area are cozy and comforting after a long day of work. The hotel rooms are always very clean and the gym is small but functional. This past visit was exceptionally enjoyable because Alexis from the front desk went above and beyond to make my stay the best it could be. She helped accommodate my room issue, she provided insight on things to do in the area, and she consistently remembered my name when I came to the front desk. This hotel feels like my home away from home, and Alexis made that happen.  If you are looking for a cozy, clean, comfortable, well designed hotel with a great staff;5
The Ameritania was warm and welcoming when we arrived. It was clean and helpful while we stayed there. It is walking distance to an amazing amount of tourist attractions. Next time we return we will be back here.  All the staff were great but the doorman, Jeff, was fantastic! His knowledge and gentleman's demeanour made a great trip into a fantastic trip! Thanks Jeff!;5
We stay in Manhattan often when we have an event to go to rather than drive home. We stay in different hotels depending where the event is. AMERITANIA is a great place for us to stay for a Broadway play and this is the third stay at this hotel in about two years. They have discontinued the free breakfast we had the first two stays, I'm sure it was in the description and I didn't read it but it was a disappointment anyway. A manager that heard us talking quickly understood the confusion explained the policy change and let us in without any questions. I recommend AMERITANIA to others and will stay there again.;4
Great location right at Times Square stayed for a work visit. Room was alittle small but was clean.  Rating would be higher if it wasn’t for a difficult to use heating system that reached 90+ degrees.   Overall good visit;4
"Thought I'd gotten a fair price when I booked and pre-paid for my room online. However, when I checked in, I was surprised that the hotel charged an additional mandatory ""resort fee"" plus tax. I found this to be deceptive.  Be up front and include all fees in the booking price.";3
A lovely boutique hotel with an amazing location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They take time to get to know you. Our room had no view, but we didn't care. The decor was really nice and the bathroom was gorgeous. Location is amazing. you can walk to everything. If you use your room for a place to crash in NYC, this is perfect. No real hotel bar or food, but we just wanted a home base. so value for the price it was great.;5
Alexis at the front desk was so helpful!  The hotel has a great location, easy check-in/out process, staff are all friendly and helpful, and the locale could not have been better.  This was my second time staying here and I'll be back again.;4
We reserved a queen bed room and arrived early. We checked in and were told we would get a call when the room was ready. We never received a call. When we went to check in hours later, we were told there were no queen beds available and we were being UPGRADED to double beds. This is not an upgrade for a couple on a NY vacation. Bad enough to not have our room, but ridiculous to call it an upgrade. No explanation was given for why we were never called and why the room we reserved was not reserved for us when we had checked in hours prior to normal check in time. We were told there were no queen bed rooms left, we would have to take the double beds and see if anything opened up the next night or go to another hotel. We asked to talk to the manager and was told she would come out.;2
I didi the reservation via booking.com and when I did the check in they asked me for my credit card. I said that I would pay in cash because using my credit card I would have a lots of tax. They said I would need just for segurity. When I did the check out I paid in cash and few days latter when I look at my credit card bill I saw two charges of the amount 400,36 BRL and 3.434,49 BRL whicht means around 900 US dollars. Imideatily  I call to the hotel, I send so many emails and no answers at all so far. I don´t recomend no one stay at this hotel. This is so stupid from them. Still waiting for my money back at my credit card.;1
This hotel was amazing from the minute we hit the front door!  The staff members were incredible, the room was comfortable, the beds were great and the shower was fantastic.  You cannot beat the location and I hope to stay here next time I am in NYC;5
The hotel is beautiful (on the exterior and lobby interior), and well situated. The room, though, was a disappointment. The bed had small bugs on it, the sheets had light yellow stains, and some features (like some room lights and the elevator) were not functional. It doesn't help that the hotel charges an additional amenities fee at checkout. The one great thing about my room - it was quiet and made for a good night's rest.  I had such high hopes, but overall the room was a disappointment.;3
Excellent service and convenient location. We went early in the morning, even though we couldn’t check it, the staffs were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is great, the interior is modern and elegant. The room is big and clean. I really like the experience and the stay.;4
this is our go to hotel in NYC!  its amazingly well situated, right near central park and time square.  its easy to get to either, we took the subway and you have stations at 50th, 57th & columbus circle to get you around the city.  We walked from here down to time square and walked to 34th to the highline, spent a while walking the highline. then from there walked down to wall street and one world.    We booked 4 rooms in total and they sorted us out all nice rooms, we were in the corner room which shows 54th & views down broadway!    We had a big bed and a decent sized room, the bathroom was nice with a great shower.  The lobby area has a red grey and black theme, which looks great, the staff here are what makes it special!  Mourad is one of the doormen here and he is awesome.;5
Excellent customer service,  rooms were extremely clean, bed was comfortable and the position of the hotel was central and walking distance  to most of sights we wanted to visit. We Highly recommended the Ameritania!;5
I stayed one night at this hotel, and would absolutely return. The location is excellent, and although the room was dark, it was clean and spacious enough. The bathroom was well appointed and very large.;5
Besides the patched-together brown tweed wallpaper that makes you feel imprisoned, there are two room temperatures affected by the 1/2 window tall obtrusive heater: 60 degrees or 80 degrees. This is despite choosing 70 on either cool or heat selection.  Dirty, smelly...ugh;2
Spent 1 night at Ameritania and was greeted by Julian, the bellman! He greeted us with a smile and was extremely helpful immediately! He stored our bags for us since the room was not immediately ready and began to give us directions to nearby locations. Our room was very modern and clean and the entire staff was pleasant and welcoming!!! Front desk staff were all very accommodating! Would definitely return, hope to see Julian again!!! He’s truly a great sincere man!! AAAAA++++++++!;5
Alexis was very accommodating and helped with my needs. Hotel room was nice and beds were comfortable. I would stay again. It is a basic hotel and although no coffee makers in the rooms they provide coffee in the lobby.;5
What a gem! Staff super friendly! Location was all that! Room was lovely. Super comfy beds, huge mirror for selfies lol and stylish modern bathroom. Loved it and will for sure return. Thanks Jessica at Front desk ... excellent customer service skills :);5
The staff and rooms were great. Location fantastic straight onto Broadway 5 minutes from Times Square. Free coffee and cake late afternoon. The only thing that let it down we're the lifts that kept breaking down. Would recommend though.;4
We arrived early and left our luggage with a friendly receptionist, think the name was Jaz. Used the guest restroom wich was filthy, should really clean that more often since it was our first impression of the hotel. The room was very small but alright. The doorhandle to the bathroom almost came off, doesnt the cleningstaff notice such things? The walls in the room could need some paint but I understand It’s a busy hotel. Very good location near times square and central park. When We checked out the receptionist did not Ask how our stay had been or anything else, almost not even a goodbye. All together an alright stay and you really visit NY for the atmosphere, maybe not the hotel. But some small improvments would have resulted in a better review from me.;3
Booked a “Double standard room” thinking I’d get two beds AS shown in pictures. Turns out it was a tiny room the size of my closet with a single bed. When I asked what they consider a “standard room” I was told that there’s no such thing. Residence fees also weren’t waived as promised. Great location but I definitely won’t be returning to this hotel. Also, I’m sure this hotel is usually clean, but I had to kill two flies in the bathroom.;1
"The hotel was a great location: was close to Time Square and from there you can get on the hop on and off bus to hit all the recommended tour site locations. The rooms were clean and tidy (we booked many rooms as a group). The staff was very accommodating and polite (had a holding room for our luggage until we got our rooms; knowledgeable of the area). Would book here again.";5
"I'm a NYC resident, but we're always looking for a go-to hotel for mini ""stay-cations"" or to recommend to visiting friends and family. We tried the Ameritania at Times Square this past weekend (NYC Marathon weekend) and were BLOWN AWAY by the service! Immediately, we were allowed to check-in early, we were asked if we wanted any recommendations, and it really seemed as though the staff cared about our visit and what we'd be doing while in the area. Our room was clean, the view was amazing, and the bathroom was spotless. (For anyone concerned about AC/heat: you can adjust your room temperature within seconds, this was great!). The next morning, we had to wake up early and check-out around 8am, and Maura at the front desk was great. She offered to hold our bags for the day, we";5
"The hotel is close to Broadway/Theater district. In general it is well kept, clean and reasonable. We had bad luck: our ""superior room"" on the second floor had a big ventilation in front of the window, thus no light but continuous noice. David at the front desk sold us the room as one of the best.";3
Superb location, friendly staff and oh my days....the beds and the pillows were gorgeous.  Would certainly stay there again.  The only thing i felt was not value for money or justified is the $20 per night additional charge at check out.  You are getting  nothing (not even tea or coffee making facilities) just a small bottle of water.;4
Perfectly located near Times Square and Central Park. Majid provided great service by upgrading us for free to a double bed room. For free! Thanks to the manager Christy as well! Had a very pleasant stay and would definitely return!;5
So glad we chose this hotel. Myself and 3 adult daughters  returned at the weekend from a 5 night stay. The room was clean and cleaned every day, big enough , very comfy beds and had everything  we needed  for a sightseeing  holiday.  The location  is fantastic , our room looked out onto Broadway and was easy  to  get to all the places we wanted to go. The staff were very  helpful  and would  arrange  anything  for you which  was a great help . I must also thank Jeff the doorman who helped  us , he is a credit to the hotel.  I would  definitely recommend this  hotel  for  seeing the sights in New York.;5
We stayed here on our honeymoon this month. The hotel is great for access to the park, Broadway and Times Square.  It is clean, comfortable and the staff are lovely.  It's not as luxurious as the photos make out but great value for money.;4
We been to New York a few times and this was our best visit. The hotel was situated well, staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially Jeffery. The rooms were fine if a little small but everything we needed was there. Would definitely return to this hotel.;5
We chose the Ameritania based on good reviews and location.  It was the perfect location and a great hotel.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Our favorite was Javier in the bar.  He was so friendly, always served with a smile and gave us advise and suggestions in the city.  If you go, visit Javier at the end of your evening at the bar..Thank you Javier!!;4
"Resort fee?  For what?  Two small Fiji waters?  No coffee in room.  No refrigerator. What amenities did my ""fee"" cover?  Tried to check in after 3pm.  Room not ready. No recourse.  Just wait till it's ready. Ameritania is nothing but an old hotel with an over inflated since of itself.  I would rate this hotel at 2.5 vs. a 3.5.";2
I visited this hotel when I was in New York and stayed here for the duration of my stay. It was a wonderful hotel with amazing service, very clean and provided complimentary tea and coffee every morning. Amazing location, only a couple minute walk from times square with a starbucks right across. Would definitely revisit!;4
I had never heard of this hotel before deciding to book there but was pleasantly surprised upon arrival ! The location is 54th and Broadway and parking is 200 meters away with very decent special rate !  Quiet hotel, good coffee in the morning, friendly staff.  Only minor less positive detail is the size if the rooms with 2 double beds. With 4 people and luggage they are a little small but it's New York and the rest is so positive that I'm still giving them 5 stars !!  Would reserve there again any time !!;5
"We stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. Our room was a bit small (310) and the bed was very soft and small. There is a lot of noice coming from the street at night; but you're in the centre of NYC! We thank Julian for his advice and help when we needed it; love this guy! Also the rest of the staff is very friendly and helpfull.";4
Very good hotel in the centre of New York. Reception ok. Door men Jeff , Jamal and the rest were very helpful ! They arranged a lot for us and we could ask them anything. Also a great compliment for the cleaning service ! The beds and rooms looked every day like new ! Thanks from a happy family from Holland;4
Got a great rate by booking 60 days in advance. Flew into Newark (Liberty) and took NJ Transit to Penn Station. The hotel is 1 block for the E line's 7th Ave & 53rd St station. 5 min walk to Times Sq / Theater District or Rockefeller Center / FAO Schwartz or The Park. Good restaurants nearby. Ask Alexis at the front desk for anything. She knows the city, is super helpful, has her finger on the pulse of what's going on and will definitely be able to address your needs and concerns. Would stay here again.;5
Great price, great room, great staff. Rooms are always super clean, functional with great extremely comfortable bed and linens.  Always wonderful too that they offer a parking deal at their wonderful location.;5
We stayed here with my Mum and Dad as a city break for sight seeing. The hotel is very well situated and easy to get around the city. The hotel itself is lovely but our rooms were very small so try not to pack too much! The beds were very comfortable and the staff were very helpful. Jeff was very helpful with advice about getting about, theatre tickets and he helped with booking our return trip to the airport. Memorable family trip aided by our location to food, theatre and transport around the city.;5
Nice Boutique hotel, clean room, good service. The perfect hotel and place to start sightseeing in Manhattan for a week. It´s very good located close to Broadway, Times square, Central ark and subway.;4
We spent 4 nights at the Ameritania and enjoyed the hotel immensely. Location was perfect for a midtown tourist visit. Staff was friendly and helpful at all times. Javier at the bar took great care of us, gave lots of good dining and travel tips.;5
To those complaining that this hotel is noisy... this is Time Square NYC people, not a beach condo in the Maldives!   We stayed here for 5 nights in October and the pictures on the website do not do it justice, the rooms are spacious, clean and the bed in our room was HUGE! It's not 5 star luxury but it's not 5 star NY prices, for a mid price hotel it was perfect for us... how much time do you spend in your room when you're in the city that never sleeps anyway?!  Its location is great, two blocks away from Central Park and a few blocks away from Times Square. The subway is a 5 minute walk if that, and use the subway... it's the easiest and best way to get about once you have calves like a WWF wrestler after 48 hrs of pounding the concrete every day. Buy a card for $1 and charge;4
Cute little modern hotel in an extremely convenient location.  Close to Broadway, Times square, Central park, and subway.  All the staff were very helpful and friendly.  The bell men went out of their way to greet us, and help in any way they could with directions and recommendations.;5
I spent here 5n on a business trip. No doubt the location is great, right in the middle of Theatre District, 10’ walking from Times Square, 5-7’ from two different subway lines. Room was ok size, typical NY I should say, clean and modern, nice bathroom with rainforest shower. However, the noise from the street was terrible, almost like there was no window! Really annoying, unless you’re so gifted to be able to sleep with any noise conditions. You have to pay $20/n for council tax and fees (newspapers, WiFi, use of the gym, two bottles of Fiji water?!?). Definitely I would not go back if I wasn’t given a quieter room.;3
Hotel set in a great location, with lots of bars , restaurants and subway round the corner. Rooms very clean, beds so comfortable and hotel easy to navigate round. But Jeff and Javier made our stay so rememberable. Jeff so happy, positive and just brings a smile to our faces. His memory is awesome too ! Javier our Mexican bar tender, just a wonderful man. Totally looked after my sister and made the end of our fathers birthday the best. Thank you gentlemen. You are worth your weight in gold how hard you work and how wonderful you make people feel. Keep doing what your doing !;5
The Rooms were small but clean with all the standard amenities. The staff were all helpfull and we would like to give a special mention for Jeff. we were split up over three floors 4, 6 and 10 and all rooms were much the same. The a/c can be a little noise but it works very well. The showers were always hot and room service was excellant. We would use the hotel again;5
Our family enjoyed our visit here. The room was nice and clean and the prices were great! The hotel is right in the middle of everything. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.;5
Very good hotel central for sightseeing it was  cleaned every day,  fresh towels modern decor , staff friendly especially Jeff,concierge  he couldn't do for us,ordered our taxi for flight home. Definitely recommend this hotel;5
Great hotel with a fantastic location, hotel is literally on Broadway! Staff were incredible and nothing was too much trouble, Jeff was a huge help in organising our Taxis for the airport and any general information we needed.  Would happily stay again so recommend it highly.;5
Nicely placed, next to times square, on broadway. Rooms insulation could be better (particulary on windows).  Great thanks to Jeffrey and Madjid for your help and your concern.  Des gens qui parlent Francais à la réception: utile. Merci;5
First of all i tried to communicate with the hotel prior to my visit and no one even bothered to respond me with an answer! :( When i arrived to the hotel and asked for early check in - i did not even receive an option to pay extra just to get into my room they just said no rooms are avilable. When i finally received my room after requests of a high floor i received the lowest one, the windows does not close even after calling service guy, Safe did not work, there was no refrigerator in the room - even that in booking there is. The worst thing is that my room had a view to all Air conditioning of the hotel which made a lot of noise and i has to sleep with  ear plugs in a 4 star Hotel. There are 3 star hotels more modern and equipped from yours.;2
We had a really comfortable stay here in a fabulous location close to Times Square - perfect for exploring midtown Manhattan. Staff were helpful and friendly. Just a shame it doesn’t offer breakfast and the room service option we tried on one morning was appalling. Don’t bother with room service - there are plenty of nearby restaurants that do a much better service.;4
Booked this hotel last minute after our hotel/flight package was cancelled due to the downfall of Thomas Cook, and I’m so glad we picked this particular hotel. It’s location is fantastic, right in heart of Manhattan and minutes from Times Square.  The room was a basic size but nice. Bathroom was lovely with a good walk in shower (no bath). Contained a queen bed, nice full mirror, desk and chair, cupboard with hangers, storage sage and a set of drawers. There was a small fridge but I believe to use included a surcharge as it was locked. Towels and hairdryer provided in bathroom. Good working air conditioner aswell. Bed was very comfy and good amount of channels on TV.   One thing to be aware of, this hotel comes with extra charges of approx $22/night per room to be paid on;5
We chose this hotel because of its location, and we were not disappointed!  The rooms are very small, but we spent no more than an hour a day awake in our hotel room, so this wasn’t a problem at all.  The staff were very, very friendly and helpful!  We would definitely stay here again!;4
We stayed at the ameritania at times square for 4 nights. Let me start by telling you that is the perfect location to get everywhere, just a few blocks of all broadway theaters and even close enough to walk all the way to central park. Subway also less than 5 minute walk  The staff is very kind, friendly and helpful.   The rooms are a great size and all room amenities are great quality.   The look of the hotel is modern with an edge, tons of red! We enjoyed our stay and we felt really pampered. For sure we will come back next time!;5
Clean yes, amazing location yes, downfalls in places like noisy AC, old furniture, front desk staff with limited knowledge.  I wouldn't say don't stay here, I just think it could be improved. Price was good though.;3
My wife and I flew to NYC on our way to Amsterdam. We decided to stay at the Americana at Times Square for three days so that we could take in a couple of Plays.. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by Julian and directed to the registration desk. The registration staff took care of our needs and explained amenities and local restaurants. Julian then took us and our luggage to our room. The room was small.  The UN was in session and many other events and by the time we made a reservation the size room we got was what was available.The room turned out to be very comfortable  and quiet. In the morning Julian made transportaton arrangements to the airport. It was very thoughtful. We did not have to worry about last minute arrangements. When we were getting ready to check;5
I was in another part of NYC and was coming to Manhattan for 2 nights here at the Ameritania. I arrived late morning to see if I could store my bag until check-in later. I was told they had a room available and I could check-in early, which was greatly appreciated. This saved having to return mid-afternoon, and I was happy to store my things in my room. Check-in was smooth and friendly. Room was very small, but normal for NYC. No real closet but didn't really need. 2 adults with suitcases it was hard to find floor space for the bags, but we managed. Clean room and bathroom. Great shower. It was a back/inner facing room on the 2nd floor. I didn't mind the location, as it was quiet, away from street noise, and near the elevator. Only mild annoyance was in the morning it was near;5
Wonderfully located near Times Square, this cozy hotel is perfect for people who like a quieter lobby. If you're driving in Manhattan, it's an easy drive coming over the George Washington Bridge, off the Henry Hudson Parkway and a left on the 54th street exit,straight down to the hotel. There is a parking garage conveniently situated a 150 feet down the street with special rates for guests of the hotel. Small, clean and comfortable room. Nicely renovated bathroom. Beautiful! Friendly and helpful staff. Almost at the corner of Broadway, The Ed Sullivan Theatre, home of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, is right around the corner. You're right in the midst of things. I'll surely be back!  Thank you for our marvelous stay.  FM;5
"My wife and I would like to thank the staff of the Ameritania for making our stay so enjoyable. It began as we were checking in. Christy at the front desk informed us they were upgrading our room. When I asked why, Christy said "" The upgrade is available and when we can, we like to go the extra mile for our guests."" Thanks Christy. We have lived within an hour of Manhattan for the past 30 years and visit regularly. But we rarely stay over night - so this was a real treat. The hotel is conveniently located, the rooms are very nice, and the staff is welcoming and friendly. We hope to return.";5
Our musical The Green Room opened down the street at ATA and we needed a great place, at a great price. The Ameritania took great care of us. A nice upgrade in rooms, friendly service. Jeff was especially kind and helpful.;5
We really enjoyed our stay at Ameritania.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Facilities were clean, housekeeping did a nice job, and loved the fresh decor.  The location also worked well for exploring all over the city with easy connections to either subway or hop-on / hop-off tours for us tourists.  Would definitely go back!;5
Staff very warm and helpful! Made gave us extra water on demand, they kept our luggages all day until 9pm for us to explore the city and they allowed us a later check out. Very close to Time Square! We loooved it;5
First off - staff was great.  I ran in to dump my bags before heading to see a client.  Jazz at the front desk took my bag for me while I sprinted out of the door.   My room was good - on the very contemporary side.   A little worn.  Bed comfortable.   Fan on ON covered up street noise.  My bathroom was very small and I had to reclean my toilet seat myself.   I would stay again.;4
Great place and location for a memorable stay in NYC! Close to everything and connections to everywhere you want to go. Located halfway between Times Square and Central Park, what more could you want?!;4
This is a decent place to stay. The rooms are quite small. There are no coffee machines in the rooms. There is no shuttle service. I had difficulty accessing the internet. The daily MANDATORY surcharge of $20 plus tax offers little in terms of services, all of which are included at no additional cost from other reputable hotels. Even with the surcharge, all that is offered for refreshments is free coffee in the morning, free water (yay!) and tee in the afternoon, and a minimal selection of happy hour snacks. My room was not able to get NBC New York on the TV, which was very surprising..  Lastly, there were ZERO cups or glasses in the room. This makes it difficult to use the bottled water to take meds.;3
I had a great stay here. Christy was amazing and she gave us great recommendations for food. She was very sweet and welcoming. I’ll definitely be coming back next time I visit. She made sure we got to where we needed to go and really made this huge city feel welcoming.;5
Thank you very much jeff! What an assistance! Ameritana is a nice hotel. Very good localed, next to the time square in the broadway. The hop on hop off by big bus is nearby inly 5 min. Walk. A nice hotel in a nice place.;5
Noisy room due to the room being continuous with refrigeration equipment from other areas that constantly turned on and off during the whole stay, I could ask for a room change but I decided it was not worth it;3
Overall it was a good experience,the location of the hotel is very good The room was clean and everything worked although the manager was quite rude and arrogant to be honest  Food was a bit overpriced;3
"We stayed in this beautiful hotel that was central for everything in NYC. The hotel was great, rooms were spotless and we never had one single issue with anything during our stay. Staff were friendly, warm, helpful and fantastic; especially Julian and Jalal who were helpful above and beyond their duties. Highly recommended.";5
The hotel is really well located for everything you'd want to see in Manhattan, being south of Central Park and north of Times Square. Everything is on your doorstep including places to shop and eat and public transport for trips that are a bit further afield. The only downside was on departure when the receptionist was pretty unhelpful regarding a question on our journey to the airport. She wasn't up to speed on the working of the subway and this made us feel it was because she wanted us to get the hotel to arrange transport  to the airport (we'd already been offered this by a bell boy too). Other than that the stay was very pleasurable.;4
We had a great experience here. Front desk staff was super friendly and accommodating- always happy to help with whatever we asked. Room was small but clean and comfortable. Location was excellent- off the busiest streets but close to everything- we walked to Times Square, a Broadway show  and to Central Park. Lots of restaurants close by. In the same building as the Ed Sullivan theater if going to see Colbert is on your list of things to do.;4
We have really bad experience with them. we have a problem with the reservation and after hours and hours, the problem has not been solve and they due us c. $500. We are waiting for our money back and we do not have any response. It is incredible the treat we have receive. Be careful. Really bad experience. We do not recommend this hotel. We use to go to this hotel since years but after this, we have broken our relationship with them. There are lots of very good hotels in Manhattan, really much much much better than this one.;1
We really enjoyed staying at Ameritania at Times Square. Our room was small but beautifully decorated and the bathroom had a fantastic shower.  The doorman/valet Jeff was especially friendly and helpful. He saved us many $$ by advising us on how to navigate the subway.;4
Nice hotel. Room was clean and fell well-maintained. Not a large room, but not small, like other NYC hotels. This is not a luxury place, but it is very comfortable, clean and good value for money. The location is fantastic if you're doing anything in midtown Manhattan.   What stood out was the super-friendly and accommodating staff. Very impressed. especially by Majid at the front desk, and by Hugo the doorman.;4
"i dont know why they  keep this job; they hate it; have no patience to explain things to costumers; no helpful at all; do they dont like brazilians? go find another thing to do lazy peopls..i complained with them and they laugh... the manager didnt care too... the door man was nice with us; the cleaners were eficient too; reception was the problem and ruined our trip";1
Good hotel. Terrific position. Good restaurants and connections nearby. Nice staff. breakfast to be reviewed. Maybe also in the room the air condition system can be updated with more efficient one. Thank you Jeff!;4
I am staying in many hotels in NYC but this one was extra special from the service, to room size and the efforts everyone made to make you feel special. David who greeted me with a huge smile that took away all my tiredness (red-eye back to meetings including one no show) his Service (capital S) made me feel at home while I am away from home. The room size the large-sized shower made this stay one to remember.;4
We chose the Ameritania because of its location. We had stayed at another hotel a couple of blocks away at the beginning of our cruise and wanted to be closer to the Ed Sullivan Theater. These two hotel rooms were roughly the same price but there is really no comparison! The hotel room at the ameritania was ‘all bed’, nothing like the picture on their website. We had an interior room with the ugliest view everand couldn’t open the window because the ac noise was intense. We were constantly bumping our toes on the bed legs because there was no room to move around at all and absolutely no room to put our luggage!  This room should not have a king sized bed in it! The best part of this hotel is the staff all were really helpful. The gentleman who took our luggage up tried to help;3
Great, friendly staff, nice, comfortable corner room.  Hotel overall was quiet and nicely decorated, and the lobby was a nice place to chill and hang out.  Made our five-night NYC get-away a great one, thank you!;4
Pros: • Great location, a few minutes' walk between times square and central park. • Cute decor and nice little rooms – just big enough • Renovated, modern suite bathroom • Nice staff  Cons • Room smelled a little moldy and toilet smelled mildewy • Tiny bathroom was extremely cramped • Bedroom area of suite needed renovation – notably, peeling/stained wallpaper was unsightly.;3
The hotel staff was very friendly, including Jeff, who helped us around the city and arranged a car back to the airport at the end of our stay. The hotel is at a GREAT location on Broadway, minutes from Times Square.;5
Aside from not being let into our room, because my brother failed to put my name in his reservation, when we got back to the hotel, 3 elevators were broken, and we had to walk 1 flight up to the service elevator! Our room was nice. The people working there were nice and Jeff the porter was especially nice!;3
Really enjoyed our stay here at The Ameritania. Location was great right near 2 subways and Times Square!  Lovely rooms, free coffee every morning and it was good too.  All staff very friendly and always ask “how was your day?”  Special thanks to Jeff, Julian and Chris on the reception for whom nothing was too much trouble.  Would recommend this hotel and will be back 😎;5
Great location and friendly staff! The room was spacious enough for NYC and the bathroom was clean and new. The shower leaked a bit so extra towels were needed. The gym was small but adequate. Tea and coffee was offered in the mornings, would have been nice to have small breakfast items as well. The location was great and lots of restaurants and activities in walking distance. Great stay overall!;5
As always, it was a fantastic stay, this is the second time I stayed in Ameritania. A hotel in a perfect location, large rooms, clean, quiet, with the most amazing bed! All the staff were great, specially the doormen, all of them! Thank you all! I had a very special birthday!;5
We stayed at the Ameritania over the 2019 Labor Day weekend. The location is fantastic. Just around the corner from the Stephen Colbert (Ed Sullivan) theater, five short blocks to Central Park and seven blocks to Times Square. There is so much to see and do right in this area. My wife and I like to walk so we walked from the hotel west to get on the High Line, walked down to Chelsea Market and then back. It’s not a bad walk but if you have children they will get worn out. The hotel is also close to public transit. About five blocks away is the 47-50 streets Rockefeller station. We got on there and took the subway to York St in Brooklyn, spent time in the Dumbo area- lots of places to eat/snack and then walked back over the Brooklyn bridge. The Amertania’s location makes;5
The hotel was in a great location, just a short walk to all of the things to see as well as the subway station.  The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of everything.  Jeffery was a huge help in suggesting places to see and how to get there. The hotel phones were down the entire stay but really wasn't an issue for us. I will definitely be back!;5
clean, confortable, spacious, quiet: all major qualities in NYC. Bed had excellent linen and was extremely comfy. Restroom was equipped with nice Bigelow products. Picture on the website are accurate. Special praise to Jeff, a very kind and considerarate valet.;5
Stayed here in September and even though I have asked them about a quite room, they put me in the 3rd floor where there was a constant noise of some sort of generator turning on and off 24 hours a day. Woke me up constantly at night.  I chose this hotel because of the reviews but from what I see I don’t think this hotel is anywhere close to 4 stars.  The building seems to be worn out and the amenities such as breakfast area is vacant and to me it looks like they planing to vacate the building.  Overall experience was bad 👎👎;1
Very personable hotel! Jeff at the door is the best! He took care of us during our stay! The hotel is located in a great location for tourists! Easy excess to everything! We will stay here again in the future!;5
I was such a great stay at the Americana at Time Square. Majid was was very attentive with us and helped us for booking our excursions and all we needed . Very nice Thanks again. very good Hotel. We recommend there ! I hope come back here for my next trip at NY !;5
Husband and I booked here for our anniversary trip to NYC because it was affordable and I wanted to stay in Times Square.  We did arrive in NYC before check-in time so we just left our bags with the hotel and we were off to start our adventure. It couldn't have been more easy and they didn't even charge us for leaving the bags as I KNOW some other hotels in NYC do. Just a couple bucks as a tip.  When we came back about 330, room was ready and bonus! we got a room upgrade for our anniversary! The room was huge! It had a living room area with a couch and TV and a huge king size bed! We were very happy with the room. We also got a nice note from the front desk manager and a bottle of wine. Also, even though we were close to the street, we were never once woken up by the city noise.;4
The staff was so pleasant and helpful, we will return!! Especially loved the bell boy, he helped us with so many questions we had.  I loved the happy hour and coffee availability. The rooms are kind of small, but they were clean. The air conditioning in our room needed some attention.;5
IT was a top Location, but the room was really small. And I booked and afterwards had to pay an extra of 20 usd per night, this is beside the tax. They could have communicated that better I think. It said city view and it was not.;3
We booked on line because of the reasonable prices, and found the room and common areas to be clean and neat.   This hotel is conveient to the things we wanted to explore. We would recommend this hotel to friends.;4
Everything worked really well for us in this hotel. Easy check with helpful staff, straight in with recommendations and maps etc. We had four nights in this hotel, 6 of us, me and my partner and our 4 `'children' aged 20-16! We had 3 rooms with 2 double beds in each, they were a really good size for NYC. When we booked I knew it was fairly central but didn't realise how good it was. Minutes from Times Square and Central Park but not right in the middle of the madness of Times Square!! Two really stood out - Jeff on the door made everyone feel really welcome, sorted Taxis and transfer back to JFK for a cheaper price than we had booked for the incoming transfer and the barman - same one each night but even though i didn't get his name he made the bar a great place to finish off;5
Fantastic hotel and wonderful staff from the minute we arrived..they can’t do enough for you. Our room was huge and super trendy, and gave us everything we needed. The bed.... wow I want to take it home with me! It’s was one of the most comfy beds ever... everywhere is clean and smart. Whilst our view was a brick wall to be honest it was good as we had no road noise. We definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. And so close to everything. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making us so happy to stay with you.;5
If you need a place to stay in the city ,well look @this hotel. Next door is the the evening tv show Stephen Colbert. Plus it's an easy walk to Times Square or Central Park or Empire State & also 5th Ave. Great hotel .;5
My daughter and I shared a room on the 4th floor with two double beds. Our room faced a courtyard, so we kept the room darkening shade down most of the time, but at least that meant we didn’t have street noise. We slept quite well except for the first night when the alarm clock set by a previous guest started blaring. We were surprised to discover that the refrigerator had a lock on it, but thankfully the front desk sent someone up to unlock it. Also, the tv didn’t work, so the front desk sent someone else up and they reset it. The room was very small, but the bathroom with a rain shower was fine. The Ameritania staff was very kind and helpful. It was nice to have cold water in the lobby.;4
Great service, beautiful room. They even sent a birthday card and cupcake to my daughter. Very nice touch. The view from our room was a brick wall and not very pleasurable but that is the only complaint that I have;5
We choose this hotel for the location. We were going to see 2 Broadway shows and this was the perfect location. The room was too small for 2 people (Room 822) , but we were out and about most of the time so it didn't matter as much, (If your on your own it would be fine) but the two of us literally kept bumping into one another. Staff is fantastic, helpful and friendly.;5
Great location if visiting the city to see Broadway shows, far enough away from Times Square which was a plus for us! Bed was extremely comfortable. Friendly staff, especially the bartender, nice modern decor, free coffee in the morning.;4
"Pros: 1.  Location of the Ameritania is great, Right on the North side of Times Square.   2.  You could not ask for a better staff.   3.  The King sized bed was very comfortable. 4.  We asked for a fan in the room on arrival and there was.  Cons: 1.  Our view out the window was of the air conditional unit. 2.  The shower has a weired designed without a door or curtain just a short glass panel that lets water splash by it onto the floor. 3.  The king size bed made the room realy small  4.  They charged and outragous ""Residence Fee' on top of the price they charge for the room.  This Fee is total BS!!!  give me your TOTAL price up front and QUIT slapping on additional charges!!!";2
Very nice hotel, very well situated, clean rooms, good service staff.  Unfortunately the breakfast was very poor, not having much food available, and very little varied.  Overall I was pleased with the service.  could be to repeat if breakfast improves.;4
Very pleasant stay in the hotel thanks to the amenities and the staff, needless to say that it is well located to visit the city on foot or by public transports. Confortable bed, clean bathroom and room. Convenient continental breakfast, good coffee and wonderful pâtisseries. Highly recommended;5
This was our third time at Ameritania.  It's a good hotel for a small family or a couple getaway.  Like other NYC hotels, the standard rooms are small.  However, great service.  Excellent location with Time Square a 5 minute walk away, Central Park and Rockefeller Center about 10 minutes, and food options all around.  The Icon Parking garage was just across the street.  The only negative was the carpet that could use a little bit of shampooing (since our socks were turning black).  Will definitely be coming back.;4
Even if the hotel is not super-new, the quality vs.  price is excellent. Clean and comfortable rooms (2 adults and 2 kids). Great location between Time Sq. and Central Park (few minutes walk to the subway connections to the most popular NYC attractions).;5
We had a lovely stay at the Armetania and would highly recommend staying there. It was a great value and loved the location. It was near to everything but enough off the main drag to be quiet and less overwhelming.  Staff was universally friendly and helpful.  Rooms were comfy if not spacious but really fine.  They were extremely quiet.  Only small complaint was the light coming in from the hallway around the edges of the door.  A little extra trim could solve that problem.  Would definitely stay again!;5
Great location for Times Square and Broadway   This hotel was perfect for what we required , Jeffrey the concierge was amazing , helping us with directions , places to eat and a taxi to the airport. The barman was outstanding a pleasure to spend part of our evening with. Would recommend this hotel in an instant.;5
I loved the lobby and the set up on the floors of the suites it was very artsy. Bed was comfortable, quiet room lots of privacy. Close to food spots. It was a very low key spot I walked past it once on way and didn’t notice it lol.;5
Very happy with our stay. Great location on broadway, short walk to Times Square. Staff were helpful, even helped hail a taxi. Room quiet with a comfy bed. Free coffee and tea on the morning and snack in the arvo was a nice touch.  Would not hesitate to recommend.;5
We had reserved a “Deluxe King”...  Seriously? A room that looks at a brick wall passageway is not the best start. Room and bathroom fittings loose or broken - oh dear... Room safe doesn’t work... the list gets longer (Room 215 if I remember correctly)...  But to really finish it off - the hotel laundry is just below with machinery and an incredible noise all night.  At 00:30 unable to sleep the night time front desk turns up and admits the noise is impossible.  No worry - we can change rooms ... repack... take luggage ... room 806 (?)... a room that is obviously not a “deluxe king” as we had to coordinate movements to be able to move around the room - and no we’re not overweight...  Management opinion the following morning ... sorry - can’t change the room fee you booked;1
The staff treated us like family. Friendly, professional and able to assist with all inquiries. The location was in the heart of Times Square. Just around the corner from The Ed Sullivan Theater and the taping of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The room was picture perfect. Ultra modern decor, clean and excellent view of the city. Parking was less than a block away and reasonably priced. I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again!;5
"Comfortable and clean and friendly staff. In particular ""Said"" … this guy really was the most helpful guy we have come across on our travels. Said took time to get us information, maps printed and personalised assistance and explanations of how to do what we wanted to do. Said never tried to on sell external services e.g. shuttles etc and helped us determine the most practical and easiest way to move around.  More people like Said in the hospitality industry and everyone would have a great experience.  Thank you Said - we were most impressed and grateful for your help and it all worked our exactly.";4
I visited NY with my mother and got this hotel. It was really good, location is amazing and overall great service. We had an unfortunate situation with other guests but it was solved quickly, and the hotel made sure we felt safe, special shout out to Alexis, she was so nice to us and made sure everything was perfect;4
When I checked in I was told the extra fees were included in the $211. I even asked for a receipt, but they couldn't give me one. I wanted the bill so I could divide it in half so my friend could pay her half. I come home and I was charged an additional $69. Talk about cheating a guest!;1
We stayed here for our anniversary weekend and it was great! I had gifts sent to the hotel ahead of our arrival for my husband and they set them up for me so when we got in the room my husband was so surprised! This review would not be complete if I didn’t mention Alexis who went above and beyond with helping me set up and make this weekend special! Alexis was awesome! Also Majid was very helpful and accommodating with our check in. By the way we stayed in room 605 which was beautiful;5
The hotel is in a convenient location - very close to central park, subway stations, and times square. The bell boys are extremely helpful and kind. They can take care of your luggage if you arrive/ leave later. Julian was extremely helpful and went above and beyond for us. We orginally were planning to take an Uber to the airport but he recommended and booked us a much cheaper option with the hotel. While our hotel room came with several issues (eg. The broken AC, burnt out light, broken knob) the hotel was very reponsive to our complaints and would quickly solve them. A nice addition to the lobby area is how there is hot and cold water available. The only real problem we encountered was that our luggage straps disappeared from our room and they offered to take a look for us;4
We decided to spend a week in NYC and while looking for a hotel, we noticed that there were major works on 7th Avenue. Then we chose Ameritania for its great location, near Central Park and Columbus Circle. When arrived, we found a well manteined, clean hotel, with a kind staff. The room was pretty good, with an adequate size. We'll be back again, surely.;4
My daughter, and I booked a 2 night mini vacation at The Ameritania Hotel. After checking in there were many problems that occurred. It is a hotel, and spending most of my life in the hospitality business, I am more than understanding of the problems that may occur. Unfortunately, there were many. We were lucky enough to find Alexis on the following morning after all the mishaps the night before. She was understanding, compassionate, and was able to take control, and remedy all of the prior nights foe-pas. When we returned from our day out, our room was upgraded, our bags were delivered to the room, and she even gave me her cell phone number ( a first in my many trips to New York ) to make sure I was in contact with her with all the arrangements. She should be commended by her;5
I had quite a few issues with my stay. The front desk clerk did not fully explain the total fees for paying at the hotel through a Travelocity reservation. The amount charged was almost $200 more than the amount noted on Travelocity. When I called from the room to ask about it I was somewhat dismissed and told I need to call Travelocity. It took two reps and almost an hour later to get an answer as to why there was a drastic difference in price. The additional fees and total rate oer night should be disclosed during check in. I realized the discrepancy when I got a transaction notification on my phone. Also, we had one face cloth for my husband and I for a two day stay. The room is extremely small and the ac does not work well at all. If we used the shower the room felt like a;2
Be careful when you buy a hotel package from another carrier.  I had a small cramped room where the night latch was frozen so did not work.  I immediately asked for a new room which was bigger and better.  The eclectic, modern look attracted me to this location and that it was near Times Square. The hotel is a bit old and can use repairs.  I stayed 4 nights.;3
We spent one night at Ameritania on our way home from Italy.  Excellent location near Times Square right around the corner from Stephen Colbert's theater.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Jeffrey, the Bell Captain.  Held our luggage while we explored NY and got us a $45 ride to La Guardia in a Lincoln Town Car!  Rooms clean and comfortable.  Good value.;5
They charge a $19.95 “service fee” for “amenities”.  So you’re not really getting free internet.  You are paying $19.95 every day for internet and a warm bottle of Fiji water.  The very definition of a rip-off.;1
The staff was wonderful and accommodating. The location could not have been better. Had the best room in the house that was on the corner of Broadway and 54th. Everybody have a smile on their face. Would definitely stay again.;5
We were really pleased with out stay. The beds were super comfy, the staff were fantastic and the afternoon snacks were very generous! The location was great - about 10 min walk to Central Park and Times Square and very close to the subway. Definitely recommend!;5
Don’t stay in room 502!  Besides being tiny (expected for NYC), the condition of the room was not up to par.  The headboard was peeling off, the carpet was dirty, a bench wouldn’t fit under the tv and blocked the corner of the bed, there was a hole in the floor between the bedroom and bathroom, the light fixture was too big for the room, and there was a giant Mirror blocking the light switch.   The customer service was okay, especially the doormen.  They just weren’t good enough to overlook the condition of the hotel.;2
Lovely hotel. Great customer service, thank you Christopher! Our room was clean, comfortable bed. We would definitely stay here again but, would reserve a deluxe room next time time, our room with a queen bed was a little tight for two people.;5
This hotel is in the most perfect location! It’s just a few blocks from Central Park, Time Square, broadway theaters, and is within walking distance to the Metropolitan museum and Museum of Natural History. The hotel itself is nice. The staff is friendly and helpful. The room was clean but a little small. My biggest complaint is that there are only 2 drawers and a small closet so you couldn’t really unpack all of our clothes and I like to do that. The beds are very comfortable which is good because it’s noisy outside and can be hard to sleep but I guess that comes with being in the heart of everything. The bathroom is small but there is a great shower that makes up for it. I wish the hotel would have served breakfast but there is a Starbucks right across the street and there are;5
This is an okay hotel with functional rooms and close proximity to Central Park and Time Square. There are hidden fees called resort fees of 19.95 - though this is really not a resort and they hold a 100 dollars for incidentals though there is nothing in the room/no minibar. The front office gave me a room which already had someone in it (!) and I lost power when I turned on the hair dryer in the morning...not really endearing experiences to have. Hence the rating.;2
Hotel was very nice when you 1st walk in. I Don't think I ever saw a bar tender or the hotel bar ever open. Rooms were nice and cozy. The beds and black out curtains were everything! But the room did not get cold at all. Put the A/C on low for the whole time we were out and it never went under 78 degrees. Thankful the black out curtins helped keep the room coolish or it would have been a miserable day the next day.;4
This was a great property for its value. The rooms were nicely appointed with stylish furnishings, although they were a bit worn. Friendly staff. A request for a new iron never materialized, but it wasn't a big deal. The a/c could not be controlled in the room so it was either a bit too chilly or a bit too warm. The location is excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel.;4
Room was tiny, very run down with ripped carpet , a broken desk lamp, and a mildew odor.  A/C unit was very loud . One of the elevators was broken. The gym was dirty and had broken equipment. There are plenty of better choices.;1
This hotel is superbly located at the cross-roads of the midtown business district and Times Square entertainment district (54th & Broadway).  The service is excellent -- responsive and helpful.  I didn't love my first room and asked to change.  My second room was terrific.;4
The room didn't have enough wardrobe and luggage space. The shower didn't have a door, so the water got on the floor. The room Lighting was poor. Overall my stay was average. The hotel location is good.;3
A return visit so clearly we like this hotel! We arrived  early, expecting to be able to leave our baggage whilst we explored,  but amazingly our room was ready 3 hours early! Fantastic bonus! View from our 9th floor room was not much to shout about but certainly let plenty of sunlight in.  Terriic large shower and plenty of towels. If you've never stayed here before, the sound on the air con may seem loud - but you really do get used to it. Complemintary teas and coffees / snacks every day were an unexpected bonus too. Location is great for Central Park and Times Square with verything else a very easy Subway ride away. Geoff and all the guys on the door were there normal great selves - if you need or want to know anything, just ask them! In summary, a great, non chain  place to;5
Our first time to New York and this hotel and we would definitely go back and recommend this hotel everything and everyone was amazing especially Jeffery the man who stands outside got us taxi and told us where everything was answered all our question he really made the stay that much better;5
This hotel is in a perfect location 54th and 8th, right on the corner of the Colbert report studio. The staff was extremely helpful, Jeff the door attendant, helped us with our bags, he helped us get a car scheduled to drive us from the hotel to the airport the day of our departure. He was very friendly and courteous. Our room was the right size and had all the things we needed. I have very happy with our stay;5
NYC at Ameritania/ fun, friendly, and very helpful staff.  Room was small, no refrigerator, but the air conditioner was cold.  Clean and comfortable.  Enjoyed our stay.  We would recommend this hotel.  Great .location.;4
Stayed one night for city visit and show next day. The hotel is located in heart of Times Square. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. The hotel staff were very nice  The room was nice, a little small but fine for short stay. Nice bathroom.  It was nice the management left cupcakes and a happy  birthday note as we were celebrating my sister's birthday.  The view was nonexistant but we were only there to sleep. NYC keeps you busy. We asked for late checkout and they were very accommodating.  We were able to leave our luggage while we went to a Broadway Show and a very nice staff member, Julian helped me get our  bags and carried them for us. He even offered to take them to our car. We parked across the Avenue in Icon parking. The hotel stamped our parking and we paid $40.;5
Would definitely come back! Receptionists were so helpful and Jeff (the lovely door man) helped with directions to anywhere we asked. Nothing was too much for the staff, a lovely atmosphere! See you soon ameritania 😄;5
This is the 3rd time I have stayed st the Ameritania. The overall quality of everything has greatly declined. Breakfast isn’t offered. Instead we were referred to an outrageously overpriced ($140 for 3 people!). Our room wasn’t cleaned one night of our stay. We ran out of toilet paper and waited 30 minutes for housekeeping to bring some. The snacks offered in the lobby were uncovered and lacked serving utensils. The front desk staff was unpleasant and seemed put out when asked for assistance.;2
"Just returned from a 5 day family vacation to NYC at beginning of August. This was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. The staff at the hotel was so helpful and nice. Front desk was able to answer all of our ""tourist"" questions. The person who stood out most was Said, one of the bellman, who was able to give us lots of helpful info about NYC, where to find good restaurants, grocery, subway stations, etc. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay. The location of the hotel is great - walk to all theaters in minutes, Central Park, MOMA, Hell's Kitchen area (great food and reasonably priced), Times Square. The Residence Fee at this hotel was one of the most reasonable I've seen, and you get free coffee in the morning and snacks in the afternoon! (be sure to";5
My husband and I stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 4 nights in May 2019. We had researched and reviewed a lot of hotels as we had a budget and wanted somewhere quite central and clean. We were very pleased and impressed with this hotel. The location was excellent. It was very clean and quite comfortable, the rooms were an adequate size and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We even got a little Anniversary treat on arrival in our room.;4
Excelent location, near to times square, a lit bit noisy due to the location. Been there for 5 nights and staff was always friendly and very helpfull. Special thanks to Mourad who was really helpfull during ou stay.  Very clean and tidy rooms.;5
Fantastic location  (few steps away from Broadway and all the theaters). The hotel staff was very pleasant, attentive and helpful. A special thanks to Jeff who took really good care of us. The room was clean and had all the equipment we needed.;5
Hotel - Excellent Location, Front Desk,Housekeeping& Bellhop(s) - Friendly & Excellent service. The Hotel room was very nice. Central Park & Time Square with in walking distance. First time visting New York City, a wonderful experience.;5
The poor service I received started via email well prior to arrival and did not improve.   1. I emailed advising I was arriving from an international flight, and having already read on their website that the hotel did not offer a shuttle service, I noted this in my email to them and asked for their local knowledge for alternate options.   The reply was one line advising me the hotel does not provide a shuttle service. Argh!   2. Fridge was locked (not sure why because it was completely empty) and apparently it is only unlocked on request of the guest. 24hrs later it was still locked and I had to request once again.   3. Housekeeper wasn’t a pleasant person at all - despite my attempted positive engagement and pleasantries.   4. No free daily water left in my room - although;1
Great location (very close to Times Square). Lots of good food options close by. Hella kitchen is a short walk with way too many good options. Staff was attentive and great for local knowledge. We’ll be staying here next time.;5
The hotel staff was very personable and pleasant.  The room was clean and quiet.  The subway is just down the road and the parking garage is across the street.  My only complaint is the shower took 5 minutes in the morning to get hot.  It was a great stay and I definitely would stay again.;5
The hotel is very nice and clean.  The beds are probably in the top 5 most comfortable bed I've ever slept in outside of home.  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 is the staff upon arrival was not Texas courteous when they had us stash our luggage in a room.. Rushed, snappy, added an element of uncomfortable.  Otherwise, the hotel is centrally located, nice, easy and I would recommend it.;4
"We stayed at this hotel for our last night in USA and it was the most disappointing stay. The receptionist was really arrogant and not at all friendly. The luggage-boys were all after tips and since it was our last day in USA we didn't have that many dollars left and we obviously didn't tip them enough because they were really pissed off. We had to tip them Three times for the luggage even though we didn't need help With it; when we came, to put it in the locker room and to get the luggage from the locker room.  If you want to stay at a hotel with friendly people you should look for another hotel. We have stayed 5 times in NY. There are plenty of hotels with friendly staff.";1
"I have stayed at the Ameritania several times before, and would definitely stay there again.  The location can't be beat; the lobby is modern and beautiful; I appreciated complimentary coffee and water in the lobby 24/7; everyone at the hotel was friendly and efficient.  The rooms are small, but the value is good.";5
First...Jeffrey (not sure of spelling) was extra helpful.  All of the customer service was helpful, friendly and efficient.  The lobby was very nice (and smelled good too).  All of the amenities (a/c, etc.) worked well and the bed was super comfortable.  A pretty and clean room is a wonderful thing after a long day of sight-seeing!  The only thing I could have wanted was a bit more light in the room.  It could be a bit dark sometimes.  But that is a TINY thing.  We were really happy with our choice!;5
Very nice and clean! Little Figi water bottles complimentary-cute! Jeff was very nice and helpful! Their shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion was very upscale. Their staff was friendly and professional. I highly suggest this hotel.;5
We just came back from our family trip between July 20 and 24 from NYC. With 4 kids between the ages of 8 and 17 it couldn’t be any more fun 😉 We booked Ameritania online after all the positive reviews we read. I rarely put reviews (call it lazy) but nowadays I feel I have to respectfully to all those who helped me with their reviews and to the people in the facility we used. The hotel is 12 floor, on 54 and Broadway. PERFECT location: 4 minutes to the right and you’re in Time Square and all the great theaters, M&M store, etc.. 7 min left and you’re in central park. Great stores each way surrounding the hotel that also have 5 stars reviews, such as: Grom (gelato), pick a bagel (begels), Angelo (Italian food and pizzeria). The rooms in the hotel aren’t big, remember you’re in;5
The rooms are tiny, creepy and noisy AF. The beds are like sleeping on cotton balls ... yes ... uncomfortable. If you DONT want to sleep or require a SMALL amount of quiet to sleep STAY. SOMEWHERE. ELSE.;1
My stay was enjoyable. Front desk was helpful with my needs. Room was very clean and was given two complimentary bottles of Fiji water every day of my stay. Doormen were very nice  and helpful. I would stay here again.;4
My daughter and I came to NYC to see a play on broadway.  Our 4 day stay at the Ameritania was fantastic. The room was a bit small, but very clean and modern.  Everyone on staff was exceptionally attentive to the needs of every guest. All were very friendly and anxious to serve.  Particularly helpful was the bartender in the lounge.  Javier was eager to hear of our experiences in NYC. And in turn, he provided great reviews and suggestions for things to see and do.  Outside we found typical NYC chaos, inside the Ameritania was comfort and peace.;5
We had 2 rooms at the 7th floor. At night you’ll hear a noise what will keep you out of sleep. Airco had to en turned of at night, also too noisy. The location of the hotel makes it all better. The other services are okay.;3
We stayed here for six nights with 2 adults and my ten year old. I will start by saying I give a 5 for the bellman and front desk staff. They are fantastic! With that said, on night one, everything felt dirty. We asked 3 times for the hair and corners of drawers to be wiped, there was dust in all corners and on all lamps. Nothing got cleaned our entire stay except fresh towels were added. They have a newly renovated bathroom but the room as a whole felt unclean. On top of that, we ended up having stained sheets on both our beds! Yikes.  They were nice enough to bring us new ones but some were frayed and just badly kept. I would rate the room a 2 but overall because of the nice bathroom and friendly front desk staff, I gave them a 3. I would recommend to pay more attention to the;3
Our first stay in New York City. Nice hotel in very attractive part of NYC. 5-days trip unforgettable. Very nice and attentive hotel staff (esp. Jeffrey). Very good accessibility in terms of public transport and Hop on Hop Off.;5
We got a shuttle bus from the airport took us approximately 1hr.  Arrived at Hotel reception staff were very friendly.  We told them it was our 30th wedding anniversary so they very kindly upgraded us and gave us a bottle of wine in our room which was a lovely surprise.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  Considering it was only about 5mins walk from Time Square it wasn't too noisy at night. Jerry the doorman was really helpful and gave us lots of advice and information about places to visit.  Ha gave us a map and highlighted all the places we wanted to see.  This was really helpful. Hotel is 5 mins walk from Time Square and 10mins walk to Central Park.  If you like walking then Empire State Building and Rock A Fellow observation point is about 45mins walk away. Great;5
The hotel was perfect, great location and amenities. Jeff the doorman went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We were always helped right away, and he helped with a great attitude immediately from the time we got there to the time we left.;5
We had a joyfull stay at the Ameritania and would recommend it highly to familys with kids. Our kids especially loved seeing Jeffrey from the hotel, even though they didnt understand a single word he was saying (since we are from Switzerland), he was all kind and funny. We hope he enjoyed our Swiss chocolate and to see him and the Ameritania again sometime in the future!  Greetings from Switzerland!;5
We spent a good few nights at this hotel, and found it to be a comfortable stay. The room size was a little on the small side, but this is probably to be expected in NYC. The front desk staff were courteous and always smiling. The location of the hotel was great, as it was in the center of the action, and just a short walk away from the subway.;4
Fantastic trip with my family.  Hotel was excellent value and superb location.  Janeth the front desk manager really went the extra mile to ensure we had a great trip and Jeffrey simply the best concierge ever.;5
Overall a great stay, but Jeff the doorman/valet was the real highlight of the trip. He was always there helping us get where we needed to go. We had a business meeting to get to ASAP and it was pouring rain and he got us into a taxi that got us there at a great price. He also got us a great deal to get to LGA on time for our flight. Thanks Jeff!;5
Excellent Hotel. Courteous front desk. Super friendly Staff for luggage and at the door. Convenient parking arrangements. A little further away from actual Times Square. Awesome location. But very near for Broadway shows.;5
Majid at Ameritania made our night.  After finding ourselves with a competing local hotel with lousy service and a “bait and switch” situation, the Ameritania and Majid were our knight in shining armor.  The personal service and care was remarkable, kind, generous . . . Befitting a 5 star hotel.  Highly recommended for a night in Times Square;5
My wife and I stayed last minute at the Ameritania.  Because of issues with traffic at LaGuardia.  We had to book it through hotels.com for a last minute stay.  The manager who checked us in was very nice.  It was a good clean room with a nice stand-up shower and surprisingly nice closet.  We were very pleased with the location for the price for sure.  Especially for booking it the day of. then;4
We had a large group for a 2 night stay and it was great! From the moment we arrived we were greeted by Jeff at the front door and he helped us non-stop for the remainder of our visit. Everything from restaurants, maps, where to go and setting up transportation, Jeff had us covered! Highly recommend.;5
We arrived on Blackout day, 7/23, and the card machine was not working for the one hundred dollar deposit.  The next day we presented the credit card in the morning and the deposit was made, but the validity of the key-card for access to the room was not increased.  In the afternoon I was without access to the room and had to go down to correct the days of access.  Unfortunate lack of attention from attendants.;2
Centrally located to Central Park, Times Square and Broadway as well as various other attractions.  Staff was professional and polite.  Our room was clean after being out all day.  No complaints.  Lots of thank yous!  Special thanks to Javier the bartender.  I'm a Realtor by trade and he allowed me to work at one end of the bar.;5
We enjoyed our stay, especially the friendly service given by Jeffrey. Each time we met him he was helpful and very accommodating. All employees were nice but he was exceptional. Our room was cleaned each day of our stay and housekeeping did an excellent job. The room was nice and the hotel was located close to the subway station which allowed for easy access to all our destinations.;5
I just checked out of the hotel. Nice, clean, modern and great location. My daughter and I stayed there during the power outage on 7/13. The lady at the front desk was so helpful and nice during an otherwise chaotic situation. The hotel and everyone in the staff were fantastic. We specially liked Jeff at the front door, very helpful, and my daughter loved getting chocolate from him.;5
Very reasonable 3 star hotel (Staff is 5 Star A+) in the best location for Broadway, Central Park, Radio City,/Carnegie Hall, all within walking distance. You are literally on top of the Ed Sullivan Theater (Steven Colbert.. Just high enough on Broadway (at 54th) to be out of the real Times Square crush, not a crowded feeling on the street.;5
The wall paper has what appears to be water marks on it. The room is very dark and the bathroom basin stand is wooden, but it is not protected from water from the shower which makes the room smelly. The bedside on the right side of the bed did not have a lamp.;2
Stayed here one night with my best friend after seeing a concert. Location is great! Walking distance to Times Square and Radio City! There is a bar next door so that was nice to have a few drinks and head up to our room!  Upon check in, the woman who checked us in could have been a bit more friendly but she wasn’t mean or unprofessional. One thing that totally blew the day we were there was only 1 out is 3 elevators was working and it took forever to get up to our floor. What was even more aggravating was as we were about to get on the elevator, the backside of the elevator opened and a person started vacuuming the floor of the elevator. Seriously? There is a line of people. Once on the elevator, it started to glitch up so we were forced to climb 7 flights of stairs in the;4
On a night when all respectable hotels in midtown were $300+, we were able to book a room at Ameritania for a fraction of that cost. The room sizes were what you would expect for a NYC hotel room (small) but they did a beautiful job with high-end decor and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms are large and updated with glass-wall stand-up showers. The front desk staff and doormen were extremely nice and attentive. The free coffee and tea in the morning and snacks (apples, muffins) in the afternoon were also more than many NYC hotels will offer. The location is perfect for Times Square area.;5
Perfect location not far from Beach and plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. Very quiet rooms, clean and superb service. Breakfast was enough and tasted good. One of the best hotel we ever stayed at.;5
I stayed at the Ameritania hotel in times square for four nights. All of the staff that I encountered was extremely helpful and kind. Crystal and the other front desk staff really go above and beyond to make sure guests' needs are met. The room was also very clean.;5
Excellent Stay in the middle of midtown Manhattan. Walking distance to Central park, Broadway, Rockefeller Center & Empire State Building. Subway a few blocks away. Javier took good care of us at the Bar all week and gave us some excellent recommendations for local spots to eat. Overall a very good experience.;5
My stay at Ameritania was awesome all around!! Friendly staff, clean rooms, amazing value, and close to everything!! Jeff, the doorman, was the best!! I would definitely return to this property!! My daughter and I were more than pleased!!;5
'Andy' was so nice to us at the desk and felt very comfortable. He helped us a lot with the Stay and answered all our questions calmly. Anything you request, he will do the magic in few minutes. Great Job and Thank you for your assistance, Andy!;5
If you want to be close to theater, restaurants, and shopping this is a fantastic location. My room was on the street so it was a little loud but not bad at all. The entire staff was helpful, friendly, and incredibly gracious any time I spoke with them. The room was small but not atypical for a New York hotel room.  The bed was comfortable. The nightstands had plenty of outlets. There was enough room to put clothes away. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a very comfortably sized shower. It was clean and up to date. The internet was a bit spotty but worked way more often than it didn’t. This hotel is a great deal. The price is right and it was a very enjoyable stay.;5
My girlfriend and I stayed overnight at this hotel for a show we were attending and it was one of the better hotels we have ever stayed at. The room was clean and a nice size for a NYC hotel. Check out is at 12pm which is great for us. We were able to have our bags held before check in and after checking out which was very helpful! The location is great, right by broadway! Would definitely stay here again;5
Overall, very kind employees and great service! The location is super convenient, being centrally located in Manhattan. We loved our visit and the hotel stay we had! It would have been nice if they had a gym/fitness center. We would have loved to have breakfast included.;5
All the staff at this hotel were awesome, but if you are staying there and have a question about literally anything, Jeff is so knowledgeable and always happy to help, so be sure to ask for him. The location of the hotel is perfect. You walk out into Times Square and it’s a super close to a subway station as well as some really good places to eat. I really liked staying here.;5
We were welcomed last night by Majid, he was very kind, helpful and friendly. He made our stay very nice and that’s the reason I am giving it 5 stars. He did the best he could within his power to make sure we were satisfied with our stay. It’s a good location and nice rooms. I would recommend the happier hour at the Mexican restaurant next door. Margaritas are good.;5
We enjoyed staying at this property and it was close enough to everything.  The staff was friendly and Jeff was an asset in letting us know the best places to visit and  navigating the subway system. It can get a little noisy at night but the hotel was right off Broadway, so that was to be expected.  We would stay again for our next trip to NYC.;4
We love staying at this property. It is close to everything and has excellent service. The doormen are always so nice and offer great tips and suggestions if you ask them!! If you want a quiet night in look for the menu in your room and order. The diner that Ameritania uses for this service is EXCELLENT. The food is amazing and price is reasonable. It is even delivered to your door!!!! Always happy with our stay at Ameritania.;5
Recently stayed here after a long journey checked into rm 522 at 10pm to discover that half the rm hadn't been cleaned. There was: Takeaway in the fridge Dirty cups Not hoovered Sink and floor not washed and when i moved the face cloth it was full of beard hair. I rang reception to be told housekeeping had gone home and to leave a list to morrow which is not acceptable at all but it was 3 am our time and we were exhausted, I myself used to work on reception and someone even if it is the receptionist themselves should of cleaned the rm after all I am paying to stay there. I found the receptionists very frosty, no good morning, not even asked if we had a nice stay just didn't care.  Conceirge were lovely and the only ones who actually spoke to you. It was resolved the next day but;3
Room decor a little Dark but we were not innit for long periods.  The doorman Jeffrey is a star !  Very helpful chap and all the staff were great !   There is tea and coffee only in the morning so not really a breakfast ! Location is very good so would stay again;5
If you have back problems.....the bed was absolutely horrible!  The room faced the bathrooms of another building.  It almost seemed that because the room was discounted quite a bit that we received an inferior room...;3
Though the room was pleasant and clean, the AC was weak at night, the room was a bit noisy, the only morning coffee provided was a minuscule urn of coffee for all hotel guests in the lobby, finally,  i had to request an extension cord to plug in my laptop by the cramped desk.;3
I’ve stayed at many hotels in midtown and this one is just ok.  On the positive side, the rooms are in good condition, the decor is quite nice, rooms reasonably sized for NYC, and the location just off broadway on 54th is convenient.   The negatives:  when we were there the room was expensive ($400+) for almost no amenities (no restaurant, no coffee maker in room, call for a bar of soap took almost an hour for a response) and the staff (outside of the excellent bartender at the tiny bar) were not friendly or helpful.   Think two employees at the door almost always and no one opens the door for guests...  There are so many options in the area, I don’t think I’d tried here again.;3
Hi. During my stay at Ameritania, I had to go to the front desk to acquire ice. The representative first brought me a bucket of ice water. I then replied that I only wanted ice. He returned with a bag of ice. I next inquired about where my bucket was? Another representative replied that it would be brought to my room. It never was. The WiFi also stopped working before my checkout was completed.;3
The room was too small, with none space to walk around and couldnt open the luggage. The bedroon couldnt sleep a couple, and it was supposed for 2 people, it was one like one person bedroon. The worst accomidation I have stayed ever.;2
It’s rare to find hotels that match up to the hype and photos presented by the hotels themselves but this one did big time. If you’ve been to NYC, you will know that hotel rooms often aren’t bigger than a walk-in closet with views of a brick wall or alley dumpster. Not this place  big spacious rooms, ridiculously comfortable bed and bedding and the bathrooms are stunning! Clean, modern and within steps of the Late Show, it’s an outstanding option to anyone visiting NYC. Would definitely book again and again.;5
Close to Times Square and Central Park. Excellent location. Host Jeff was fantastic, super helpful and friendly. Even organized a car to the airport for us. AC was a bit loud at night otherwise a fantastic location. Would definitely stay there again.;4
the rooms are small, the location is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The morning coffee was also a nice touch.  A shot walk to Time Square and tons of bars and restaurants in the area;4
It was a very good time at the hotel Ameritania and there personal was very friendly.   Especially I would like to mention the employee Mourad El Hanbali, he was very friendly and has help us a lot.  So especial thanks to Mourad.;5
Expect to wait for room if you arrive at 2:45 pm.  This hotel is in superb location, rooms super tiny but it’s ny. Who spends time in room?  Doormen and housekeepers were super. Desk clerks, not so much.;4
"I booked this hotel trusting the reviews on tripadvisor. My only request upon booking was a quiet room. I was given an exterior room on the 5th floor. As soon as I checked-in I realised it was too noisy to sleep in, and I asked for a replacement. The hispanic woman at the reception promised me a room change on the following day and asked me to pack my luggage so that the team could move me to the new room on the following day. The room change never happened and at reception they told me that they could have moved me on the following day to a smaller interior room. It was very annoying to see at reception the same hispanic girl blaming the other receptionist for trying to find me a better room: ""you should just say we are sold out"".  Other than this bad customer experience, the";2
The stay was excellent.  Jeff at the front door/lobby stood out.  He was very helpful, friendly and always asking how he could help.  The location is very convenient for my purposes.  This is the second time I have stayed in the last month and will be staying frequently. Only suggestion would be to have coffee available earlier than 6AM as I am up early.;5
We absolutely loved this hotel.  The staff was super helpful and the room was very comfortable.  The location was awesome.  We have will stay there again anytime we visit New York City.  A great place to stay!;5
Great location and within walking distance to all the action yet tucked away and quiet! Jeff was especially helpful and made sure we were assured to have a great stay in NYC. He went above and beyond! Highly recommend this hotel.;5
From when we first arrived the staff greeted us courteously and were very welcoming. Both concierge and reception were helpful and friendly.  The location was perfect. I would recommend this hotel.  The room (916) was a bit tired, back of bathroom door peeling, aircon unit very noisy, bed head rests worn. However the room was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  I would recommend the hotel to others.;4
Room was tiny and noisy though the bed was very comfortable. The extra charge per night of US$20 + tax is over the top. Apparantly for phone, gym, water and coffee which most hotels include in tariff. And when you consider no coffee in room and only available between 630am and 730am that's a hard one to justify. Who gets up that early in NYC!!;3
I booked this hotel on the understanding that as a wheelchair user this was fully accessible. Unfortunately this was not the case and access was via a portable ramp which was not particularly safe but moreso was undignified entering and leaving hotel by holding up passers-by. All that being said the front of house staff were extremely helpful and special mention to Mourad for his assistance.;3
Stayed here for 3 nights with my daughter in law to be - from start to finish the customer service in this hotel is second to none - the reception staff are friendly and efficient - the door staff are first class never encountered better in nyc!  The room was huge, clean and very comfortable   - I would not hesitate to stay here again.;5
Amazing customer service. The hotel was very clean and accommodating. Jeff’s assistance was very very helpful. He was respectful and helped any chance he could. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.;5
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious. Beds comfortable with quality white cotton sheets. Room lighting was a little dark, could have had brighter lights. Overall a very pleasant stay.;4
I've stayed in many hotels, this was by far one of my greatest experiences. From the doorman Jeff being an absolute wondrous help in every way, to the way the rooms are laid out to be sleek and aesthetically pleasing. I highly recommend this hotel for an NYC stay.;5
We were here on a school group tour. The staff were very professional & extremely nice. The rooms were nice. Shower was very large. We were able to control temperature in room & it actually got cold unlike some other hotels.;5
"Writing and reading hotel reviews are really useful, but are also very subjective. Before choosing to stay at the Ameritania (which was recommended to us), we read through several reviews. The majority were excellent, and a few not so great, and there is a complexity of reasons for what is presented as a review which can either lift or hurt the hotel. However; we made a choice to stay at the Ameritania.  On arrival, checking in was smooth and quick. The desk staff were excellent and could not do enough for us, answering any questions and queries we had. When we arrived at our room, but sadly the room was not ready for us to occupy so we returned to the lobby. Majid was horrified to see us return so soon, and could not apologise enough, and he immediately sorted another room for";4
My wife and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. We were disappointed with the size of the room (very small). The old airco was behind the curtain and very noisy. The fridge was small and locked for whatever reason. The location however was perfect, within walking distance of a lot of sites (Times Square), Central Park). The service was alright, with exception of Jeff the concierge, who was very helpful and friendly. The hotel could upgrade itself by offering a limited breakfast service.;3
Only great thing I can say about this hotel is that it’s in a very convenient location! I was able to walk to and from everywhere. The trains are also very close by! The hotel itself is ran down. It’s very tiny. Do not expect great customer service. This would be a perfect hotel is they did some upgrades to the hotel and worked on their employees customer service skills! It’s lacking a lot !! The bed isn’t that comfortable neither !!! I was actually pretty disappointed in my hotel but you get what you pay for !!!;3
We chose this hotel because of the price and location (location is about the only good thing about it) but regretted our decision the moment we walked up to the reception counter. The man that checked us in was rude and seemed bothered that we interrupted whatever the hell he might have been doing. Once we got up to our room we couldn’t believe how tiny it was (room is advertised for 4 people). I think my laundry room back at home is the same size. The view from the window also left much to be desired for.  The place quickly went from bad to worse. The beds considered double beds were barely big enough for myself and my 13 year old. I had to sleep like I was laying in a coffin. The room had an old beat up mini fridge that was not even plugged in and was locked! We didn’t bother;2
Not a good experience. The staff was very unfriendly, and always pushing for additional services. the room windows were broken and It was like sleeping in the street with all that noise, and overall the room was not sound proof at all!;2
We picked this hotel because of it's location and price and we were not disappointed!  We will  definitely stay there again next time.  The subway and Penn station are a short distance away and close to many of the museums and main attractions.;5
Ameritania is located right in the middle incl close to several subway lines. Nice design, good staff and good value for money. We were not at all disturbed from other rooms, either because the guests were quite ans nice or because the walls were thick and good. The AC fan was however not quite as quiet but there is an OFF button. The hotel porter Said was very helpful and also identified a valuable lost item as probably belonging to us which was accurate..;4
We had a great experience at the hotel. We stayed for a week. Was given the upgrade we asked for. Although the hotel was fully booked. Everyone at the front desk especially Kristal and Said the doorman and the housekeeping staff and bartender were friendly and helpful.;5
Our stay was a wonderful experience. Clean, modern, quiet, everything you would want. Be sure to check in with the doorman named Jeffry. He is so knowledgeable and so helpful for us first times in NYC.;5
We have just had an amazing week in New York, the only negative was our hotel room it was tired  and worn, the bed was made of faux leather and was in a very bad condition the material was all peeling off of the  head board and the frame surrounding the mattress, the bathroom door didn’t close and the toilet has not been installed straight so make things somewhat difficult,not sure who did the grouting in the bathroom but boy it is bad,the two drawer chest of drawers had a very worn faux leather top on it and two drawers which were another problem the top one had dropped so every time you opened the top one the bottom one opened to and you couldn’t open just the bottom one , we were never offered the key to the fridge or told you could get breakfast all you get is a bottle of;1
"Listen, there are certainly a dearth of luxury hotels in NYC and if you are looking to spend a small fortune, this is not your hotel. However for me, The Ameritania is my ""go to"" because it combines great quality and great price in a sweet, stylish, boutique hotel literally in the middle of everything. Located next door to the theater The Colbert show calls home, the Ameritania is walking distance to all the Broadway shows, easy access to subways that will get you everywhere in NYC including to and from JFK and the two times I have stayed there, the staff has been great! I have to give a shout out to Jeff, our doorman, he was great, very helpful and accommodating. I give it 5 stars not because it's the fanciest or the most luxurious, but because it knows what it is and does that";5
Live the stay, Jeff thank you for the advise to get around the big apple. The area was filled with great bars, stores. This location is right around the corner from the late show broadcast. So if you are thinking of booking here see if you can get some free tickets for the show.;5
Very nice situation of the hotel, next to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park and the people who are work info there are very line. The « but » are about the rooms, they are very small, the bathroom wasn’t clean and the breakfast was very very bad (no choice, no hot meals...);3
Our room run out of hot water for shower at midnight and the door key didn’t work for 2 days. When we checked out the next morning, we complained what we experienced last time, but the front desk girl didn’t say a single ‘sorry about that’ but said ‘YOU should come downstairs and tell us at that time’ Come on it’s midnight and we already in our pj!  The hotel have a deal with cap when you go to LGA it should cost $45 including toll fee and tip. But that taxi driver lied to us and forced to charge us around $54. The ac in the room is pretty loud. And our room smells like feet for the whole time...;1
David V checked us in and gave us a FREE upgrade!!!!! We got here an hour early and since our room wasn't available, he did what he could to help us out while being friendly and courteous to us. Definitely will revisit in the future!;5
JEFF and Majid absolutely made my stay. Both of them, went above and beyond to make sure my time at the Ameritania was nothing short of excellent. From restaurant recommendations to daily tasks (like calling a taxi, replacing a room key, or event just making personable conversation) these two gentlemen made my business trip a breeze.;5
U are gonna ask for JEFF he was amazing he was great he helped make sure we got to the the airport on time and made sure that we were comfortable in our room and he was very nice just a amazing person in general!!;5
Great stay for a family of 5. We had a room with 2 double beds one for my wife and I and the other was for the kids 10, 8 and 5. Room was a little tight with all our stuff but we were only in the room to sleep. The bathroom was great. WiFi was not so great. Also not sure why we paid a resort fee because it most definitely did not have all amenities as a resort does. Overall good stay. Plus parking is across the street and not a bad price.;4
We Recently stayed 2 Nights at the Ameritania Hotel. The location was just Fabulous, 5 min walk from Times Square, 7 min walk from 5th Avenue. The Rooms were newish and was pleasantly surprised. The AC however was ancient and loud and at disturbing at night. The soundproofing could also have been better considering its in the heart of NYC. we were on the second floor and at times even a friendly conversation below could be heard in the still of the night. If you are a sound sleeper these small sounds wont bother. Apart from this the rest of the experience was an amazing one.;4
"We were very happy with our room. For us, it was a place to rest and so we don’t expect much, a little room to move around, comfortable beds, and cleanliness. Our room checked all of these boxes. I loved the down pillows and bedding; they were very soft. The shower’s design may be flawed as it did leak water onto the bathroom floor every time we showered, but ultimately it was clean and functioned well. The location was fabulous. Right in Times Square, we were within walking distance to many of the sites we wanted to visit. The staff were friendly and very patient with our children. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our experience and accommodations at Ameritania and will be back again!";5
Came here for the weekend.  So convenient to midtown theatre district.  Although no hotel restaurant, there were excellent restaurants nearby.  Room was clean and bed very comfortable.  Great shower.  Concierge staff were very friendly and helpful.;4
this hotel was super fun.  very new york style. this hotel has the best bell hop mourad!  he was very helpful and was easy to talk to!  it was also very  cool having this hotel right there in time square!;5
Very convenient location. Great places for lunch and breakfast nearby. Subway station short walk. Most of all, hotel staff very helpful in booking tours, transport within city and to airport. Desk staff, Chris Majid, had us booked on a Harbor Lights cruise within the hour of our arrival so we could see New York at sunset. Said was always smiling and ready to help us figure out how to navigate the subway to see the city. When we go back to NYC again, we will be booking at this hotel.;5
Always wanted to visit NY . Hotel recommended by my son and wife who had stayed there before . Very friendly helpfull staff .  central for visiting the sites . Also near Broadway . Our hotel room was just what we needed for our 4 night stay . The only disappointing thing was no coffee / tea making facilities in room . Asked for room service for a coffee and was told upto 45min wait and surcharge . Door men helpfully especially Jeff .;4
Great location near Times Square and the Theatre District.  Excellent selection of restaurants near by like Carmine's and Serafinas.  Staff was very friendly and the rooms where clean & nice.  We had a wonderful experience and would return again.;5
This is definitely a 2.5 star hotel. It looks fancy in the lobby with its closed bar but it's actually kind of falling apart and needs updating. Rooms are the same. Bed was pretty  comfy and bedding was nice. I think I could have went with a better hotel for the amount of money i spent. Just be aware of what your getting here. I wouldn't stay here again.;2
We had an initial problem with room allocated. Crystal on front desk sorted the problem quickly & efficiently. As this was a Birthday suprise it could've worked out badly. All was superb. Highly recommend this Hotel as location is in the middle of everything,with Times square,shops & Broadway all within minutes walk away;5
The positive: fantastic location near Broadway, restaurants, and access to transportation. Staff very nice. Depending on who you ask, some staff knowledgeable others not so much. The room was small but clean enough. The bathroom was sufficient and nice. The not so positive:  we were on the second floor facing the street. The city noise was loud enough to interfere with sleep. The air conditioner is just SO LOUD. Annoyingly so. The tv had intermittent connection on many channels. The fridge - locked. I found this very odd.  The snacks were mini muffins daily-nothing great.   The lobby is very nice and the area safe. I wouldn’t rule out staying again due to location and cost, but will likely check elsewhere.;3
Check other hotels. Too noisy, small rooms, terrible internet connection, bathroom was not clean when I moved in, staff does not have the right skills, the promised me a free night but they finally charged me for it, and many many other things. Worst hotel experience ever!!! I had to cancel an online course that I teach due to the bad internet connection;1
Very nice hotel, perfect location, beautiful room, me and my family loved everything but the hotel urgently needs an access ramp for wheelchairs and a stroller. Other than that we will definitely use the Hotel on our next trip to New York.;5
"Problems faced: 1. Initial room given was tiny for two ppl. 2. Initial room given was on 2nd floor facing front of hotel where there was very much noise.  Could not sleep all night. 3. Heating in second room given was not working and when informed front desk answer was, ""it is a city of NY problem as they did not expect weather to change"". Total lie! Engineer came and fixed heating 1hr later. 4. When room was cleaned maid took away towels and did not leave any clean ones.  In general staff, especially at front desk, did not seem to be totally with it.";2
As far as nyc hotels go it’s ok. Clean and friendly.  Gym is tiny and outdated. The internet is fast. The bar is expensive. They tell you they have free snacks 4-6 which means fruit and very plastic mini muffins.  Generally meh;3
Great location next to Times Square and the Broadway Theater. Great restaurants nearby. A couple people at this hotel went the extra mile and helped make this a good trip.  Shout out to ADAM and JEFF. Thanks!;4
The hotel was comfortable and clean and in a great location!  The staff from the doormen to the front desk to the bartender were warm and friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  All in all a great find at a great price!;5
Do not stay here if you expect to get any sleep. Every night, trucks idled loudly directly under my window into the wee hours of the morning. Last night I had to call the front desk to request they ask the truck to leave. And then the jackhammers started at about 5:30 am. The hotel MUST INSTALL BETTER SOUND-PROOF WINDOWS. It was RIDICULOUS.  Also, they artificially lower their rates on TripAdvisor, so don't be fooled. You think you're getting a decent rate only to find out from their website they will be charging you (at the end of your stay) a $20 service fee per day for wifi, coffee, etc. That fee also covers afternoon refreshments. The wifi was spotty and the refreshments consisted of tiny muffins and tea. Hardly worth $20 extra each night. I said something to the clerk about;1
It was conveniently located in Times Square. I also loved how it was within walking distance to Central Park. The hotel was safe and clean. The staff was very professional and helpful. My son stayed here on a school trip and I stayed here on a girls family getaway. Great experiences both times.;4
The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional!! This was our first trip to NYC and when we come back the Ameritania will be the only place we stay!! I did not catch the ladies name that checked me in around 7-8pm but she was so nice and I had questions about my travel and she gave me great advice and helped us set up a taxi for the day we went back to the airport. I didn’t have to worry since she set it up for me and let us know it was a flat rate from the hotel. Sa’id, not sure of the spelling, was extremely helpful and friendly. Jeffrey was just awesome!! Made us feel super welcome, gave us suggestions on things to do and see. He seemed like he genuinely loved his job and he absolutely deserves a huge raise!!! He helped us without hesitation!!! Thank you for an amazing;5
The hotel is perfectly located to get around NYC and explore - and very reasonably priced. Jeff was super helpful on our first day giving us advice and tips on what to do each day which we took onboard! The hotel itself is clean and our room was great - very comfy bed. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that when on lower floors (we were on level 3) that the noise from the street is quite loud, so if you can request a room on a higher floor I would!;4
Located in Broadway, between Central Park and Times Square, the location is really good. You can do everything by walking.   The room was pretty good, clean and modern. The only negative point we've met is the shower gel. Actually, a little sample of shower gel for 2 people is not enough, and especially for 5 days ! ! ! The housekeeping didn't replace the shower gel not even once during our stay. So we went to the shop around the corner to buy one.   The positive thing ? SAÏD ! Thanks a lot for your help at any time and for all your advices, from our arrival to our departure, a real nice and friendly guy, very professional, efficient, and so helpful ! He explained to us everything, every time !  (the roads, the subway, the best way to go there or there, the time, the weather,;4
it my 3rd time to NYC (my wife’s 1st) we were recommended your hotel and we wasn’t disappointed  it was the perfect location with its lovely boutique look a special extra mention to Jeffrey whose help really made our stay even more memorable  thank you so much  Ross & Kat McNaughton;5
How a hotel deals with those situations that would otherwise frustrate travellers is a mark of their customer focus. When we arrived the electronic system that validates electronic key cards for room entry was malfunctioning but the staff were highly apologetic and escorted us to our room each time we needed entry. This level of staff friendliness was repeated each time we interacted with them. The room itself was small but comfortable enough and surprisingly quiet for New York. The decor is, however, reminiscent of a 1970s bachelor pad. For location and price, we couldn't complain too much though.;4
"Its a standard NYC hotel. It served its purpose, with a clean room (bed felt very low to ground) and a nice staff. For a $25 ""resort fee"" per day per room however I would expect a little more than basic hotel coffee in the lobby and hotel WiFi.";3
The location of this hotel near Times Square and the Theatre District was perfect.  The staff was friendly and helpful right from the start of our visit.  Jeff, one of the doormen went out of his way to help us with directions and arranged for a ride to the airport at the end of our visit, that was cheaper than Uber.  The only issue that we had with the hotel was their bathrooms.  Our bathroom had a toilet that was installed too close to the sink, to be able to use it comfortably.  Their bathroom off of the lobby needs some work as well.  The sink in the bathroom was slanted on the sides, which makes sitting anything on it almost impossible.  The bathroom issues can be overlooked because of their staff and the location.  They do need to fix their exterior entrance lights, as;4
Great location, very friendly staff, clean rooms. Only issue we had was we booked a room with a queen size been but were given a room with two double beds when we checked-in as they had oversold. Still the overall experience was pretty good and we would stay here again.;4
Good location!  Very convenient to visit museum, Central Park, and many theaters. But a little expensive. I stayed this hotel 2 times. I will book and stay Ameritania at Times Square for my next visit to New York City.;4
Stayed at the Ameritania for a few nights last week. A larger hotel but decorated boutique style. I had a street facing room that was a little loud. Decor and size of the room was great. The bed was comfortable, with a good sized bathroom. I would stay again if the opportunity presents itself.;4
Location and customer service basically perfect, Quaint charming spot. Key system at check in not working, housekeeping didn’t service the room, and water was not working in bathroom or hotel...you could be great but...  Movrad the bellman went above and beyond to accommodate and assist! The hotel must be brought up to par. The view was nice, we were able to walk everywhere. Could not take a shower due to water being unavailable in the hotel. We were out all day and returned to no housekeeping. Christy at the front desk made attempts to make it right. Disappointing stay but again the hotel could be great.;2
"Hotel staff members were extremely friendly and helpful; room was clean and attractively decorated; bed was comfortable; and location is convenient to Broadway, Times Square, shopping, Central Park - fabulous location. The room had a hair dryer, iron and ironing board, and umbrella to borrow.  There’s no coffee or tea in the room but complimentary coffee and tea are served in the lobby in the morning. Minor nuisances in my room - a desk lamp didn’t work and the heating/air conditioning didn’t seem to be adjustable.  I was just there overnight and didn’t mention these to the front desk staff so they could be user error :).";5
Great location close to time square but without all the noise! The room was the quietest we have ever had. No outside noise, or other room noise either. They even stored our bags after checkout while we saw the sights during the day.;5
Overall, i was pleased. Our rooms were clean and it was a great location, walking distance to everything! Some minor issues like housekeeping missing a day of making up our rooms. And our two room reservation ended up being on separate floors, that was an inconvenience for us. I paid for two deluxe rooms and one of them was actually a standard room. Not sure if they are the same price or not. Check in and out was simple, however, there was a big group of 30 that took most of the staffs attention at check in. I would probably stay here again because of the location and the cleanliness. Concierge, Jeffery was a huge help!;4
Great value for money, the location is a bonus. Central Park is a short walk North, Times Square to the South, easy subway access to take you uptown or downtown.  Great choice of restaurants nearby. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Staff very friendly and helpful, especially Jeff at the front door and Alexis at reception. Will definitely stay here again.;4
"We booked this hotel through hotels.com, consider as a ""reduced price"" night. There were fees associated with this hotel that one must read in the fine print before accepting, I believe for our night this equated to about 30 some extra dollars. I must say when you enter the lobby you are encircled by a nice modern red themed decor. I was very impressed by the design. The check in process was quick. There are a couple... scary... elevators, I remember the one we rode had a broken light, the other customer riding with us was also scared. The room, was ""New York"" sized. No issue with size. We only needed a place to stay and sleep before our next day flight. Unfortunately, the street noise was undeniable. We attempted to use the constant feature on the air conditioner but to our";3
Nice hotel located in good spot to explore manhattan.Staff are all very nice and helpful especially Javier at the bar who does with very reasonable priced happy hours. There is a daily charge for internet useage which when you see the extras you can get doesn’t seem to bad.;4
Very nice hotel centrally located in Times Square and only a few blocks from the theatre district and good restaurants. Rooms were small but clean. Quiet hotel wit a comfortable lobby with lots of seating. Continental breakfast was included and had several selections to choose from. Staff friendly and courteous. We especially enjoyed Jeff who was delightful. He was friendly with a good sense of humor. Made us feel welcome and was very helpful in giving directions and pointing us in the direction of the subways instead of expensive cabs. Would definitely stay there again.;5
We enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania.  The room was clean and we never heard noise from adjoining rooms.  The location is superb.  Very close to Central Park and the theater district.  Jeffrey was very helpful in getting us whatever information we needed, including how to utilize the subway system to visit the 9-11 memorial.  We noticed he gave each guest his attention and engaged them with his sincerity.  He is a huge asset.  The entire staff was gracious.  There was noise from outside but that is difficult to avoid in a city.  The biggest drawback is with the modern furnishings, there is limited storage, and definitely a lack of space in the bathroom as there is virtually no countertop.  However the updated shower was very enjoyable.;4
We had a great stay at the Ameritania Hotel. Both Movrad and Jeff were very helpfull and the people at the frontdesk were very nice. The rooms are not big, but they are clean and that is what’s important to us! I will defenately come back to this hotel....!;5
Nice place,  but the room cleaning is very bad .  I reserved a taxi for Newark airport and the man who called It made a mistake for the price (he told us 65 dollars), name of airport and It was uber.  Taximan asked us 100 dollars and, because a mistake, leave Us at Jfk airport. Very bad;3
Nice hotel, little rooms, a bit expensive, but great location. there is free coffee and tea in the mornings. A mention to Jeff the buttons of the hotel, thanks for all your advices and for being so polite with us;3
This was my second time staying at this hotel. The staff was always friendly as well as helpful. The price and location was great, close to subways and Times Square, but not too close!! Will definitely recommend to friends and family.;4
The front desk staff is a nightmare. Misinformed, rude, and argumentative (with each other) about policies. Rooms were nice and clean, but a bit expensive for what was essentially just a giant bed and side table.;3
We were very happy with our stay at the Ameritania.  The location was perfect, between Times Square and Central Park.  The hotel is updated and clean and the staff were very nice, would definitely stay there again.;4
Nicely decorated modern hotel. Great location although due to proximity to Times Square it could be a little loud at times. Very clean and very spacious room for NYC. Walking distance to subway, restaurants, 5th Ave shopping, Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. Good wifi and very friendly staff. The bartender, Javier, was awesome. Reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area. We stayed nearby at the Hilton on our last stay but chose the Ameritana this time due to increased prices - the Ameritana was better in all respects and for a one week stay was $1000 AUS cheaper!;5
Check in staff was aloof except for concierge.  Jeffrey was great!  Room was very small, and extremely noisy.  Thermostat did not work and we had to call facilities to turn on the AC.  Noise from fan was overwhelming.  We couldn't even hear traffic over the fan!;2
Wonderful stay. Had a very quiet interior room. View into a center area for A/C units but I chose the peace and quiet over looking out front and a view of the street. Right around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater and the Late Show with Steven Colbert. Quick walk to Times Square or Central Park or Rockefeller Center. They have negotiated a fixed fare car to La Guardia Airport as an option that I found cheaper than Uber at the time - ask at the front desk. Room was clean and comfortable with nice bathroom amenities. I would stay here again.;5
"Positives: Location is excellent; WiFi was very good; Jeff the doorman was outstanding. Jeff was very welcoming,   friendly and helpful. He advised us on tourist attractions and helped us organise airport transfers. Thank you Jeff!   Negatives: Poor quality overall condition of our room. Shower leaked water all over the floor due to poor design and we were constantly mopping up water with towels. Door handle on bathroom was falling off. Noisy outside, think due to air vents outside at the back of the building. Air conditioning was very loud and rattely. Stains on the walls, perhaps  from water leaks/damp from the rooms above us.  Paid quite a lot for this room, which I appreciate is mainly due to the central location but basics in the overall condition of the room could easily";2
Considering all the big brand names with big hotel buildings the Ameritania Could be considered almost a charming boutique hotel, with 12 floors with a mixture of a classical property in the outside and modern and beautiful rooms. And just 4 blocks from Times Square. Perfectly clean and all the friendly  staff compromised to a very clean room and hotel. The exact distance to be calm and secure for walking after the district theater shows and near from all the good restaurants and stores without the noise. The only thing missing is David Letterman in next Ed Sullivan Theather!!!!;5
Finally caught Hamilton in NY and wanted a place close by but also near the park.  Great location to get to both.  Lobby always had security.  Staff friendly and accessible.  First night it was a tad noisy but hey it's NY.  Hotel supplies ear plugs!;5
I have stayed here 6-10 times a year for the last 4 plus years.  The hotel is clean and well located.  it is definitely in need of some sprucing up, and some maintenance $$.  Don't get me wrong, it is perfectly fine, I stay for a week when i come and the rooms are clean and the bed comfy, its the thing hotels always face - furniture is getting dated, maintenance budget going with a  patch instead of replace - small stuff -- a scratched up corner here, a worn headboard- nothing that affects my comfort.  The main reason I return is that the staff have always made sure that I have a fantastic stay.  If I need anything, they get it or help me find it!  Not happy with room - let me see if I can find another!  and with all the faces in and out they know my name when I come in.  Like;5
The hotel was affordable and clean, and the reception staff, particularly Jeff, were exceedingly friendly and accommodating. When I first arrived at the hotel, Jeff greeted me very warmly and spent a lot of time showing me a map of walking destinations around Manhattan! He also set me up with transportation back to the airport for my last day. Jeff was the most notable part of my hotel experience. He made me feel very comfortable and taken care of.;5
We just completed our second stay at Ameritania and it was as good as the first.  Checking in, the staff doesn't have that stuffy NYC vibe that we got from other NYC hotels and they are very friendly and helpful and eager to make your stay a great one.  It's the city so the rooms are going to be a little smaller than elsewhere but it was fine. Within walking distance to a ton of food options and a 5 minute walk to Times Square, 10 minute walk to Central Park and Rockefeller Center.  Will definitely stay again!;5
Hotel is center of more or less everything. Very close to Central Park and Time Square, Car Rentals and 5th Avenue. Stuff is helpful. Guys working in the door were very friendly.  didn't try breakfast , just look and decide to explore out. Many options close to hotel. Room was noisy due to street and floor is just 3rd. Ask to get upper floors. Room is really small compare to all my travels around the world. Not easy to walk if you keep open your luggage on the floor.;4
The hotel is very nice and staff very helpful with any questions you have about NYC. This is my 2nd stay at this hotel. I liked that it was close to Central Park and Time Square. Would highly recommend this hotel.;5
I do live in Jersey but my family came to visit me so we stayed at the Ameritania Hotel and had a great time. The hotel is super clean, the room is nice and the staff is really friendly, especially Jeff he is helpful, friendly, and talkative!! The hotel is very central, which was good for my parents since they wanted to see NYC in less than 3 days lol. All in all we had a pleasant stay here, definitely recommend it!;5
Location is great. Service is great. But the room is narrow and VERY noisy. I had to put a pillow over my head to be able to sleep. I tested 2 rooms with similar noise. On the inside court the AC is axtremely noisy. On the street, Broadway is... noisy too.;2
Great Central Bijou Hotel. Good value for New York & right on Broadway. Location excellent for Central Park also. Stayed there a few times now, rooms a bit tired. Exceptional concierge & security. Everyone very friendly.;5
We enjoyed an amazing 3-day stay in NY, thanks to Ameritania's friendly and helpful staff who made our time smooth as ever. We loved the oversized room and bathroom, the great amenities and decor. The price was right and the location truly convenient to Times Square endless attractions. Ameritania, we will be back, for sure.;5
The Ameritania is an older hotel on the corner of Broadway and 54th St. That's a convenient location, but the down-side is a lot of street noise. Windows are not very well soundproofed, but the blackout curtains do a great job blocking light and a decent job reducing noise. Rooms are small, dark and dated and desks are tiny, so the rooms are not a great place to work. Bathrooms have minimal counter and shelf space, which is annoying. Towels and amenities are stingy. Internet is free and pretty fast and reliable. Front desk service is minimal. An acceptable hotel but nothing special.;3
It’s centrally located. Close by is Starbucks and a pizza place at 2am for two large slices and a water for $2.75! It’s a very expensive city, but if you look, you can find hidden gems. It would be best to go with someone who has been there before.;5
Great and very comfortable place. The staff were very caring and pleasant. A special thanks to Jeffry. He was very mindful and was very helpful for us. Also thanks to Nataliya and Zoya for help during our stay in the hotel!;5
Perfect location and cozy room. You can get from the hotel to the Central Park and Time Square on foot. Very friendly staff. Jeffrey was kind and helpful, many thanks for him. Delicious breakfast. Convenient price. Hope to stay here next time. Highly recommended!;5
Very nice hotel located just blocks from Times Square, Central Park, and Theater District. Great location for business or pleasure. Clean rooms, excellent staff, and fairly priced.  Easy access from LaGuardia or Newark Airportd;4
Value for money. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel perfect location for Central Park and Times Square - both in easy walking distance. Beds are super comfy and the linen and towels are beautifully clean.;5
I’m fairly sensitive to mold and felt a wave of gross as soon as I walked in. It’s technically clean, so housekeeping is doing great- but if you’re also mold sensitive, it’s probably a place you’d like to skip- it’s in the walls. Additionally, the reviews imply the rooms are reasonably spacious for nyc standards, and the room I was given was definitely not.;3
Room was pretty small but worked out fine.  Would have been cramped for more than one person. Only things- the safe was nonfunctional, and I was left on hold for over 10 mins when trying to order room service.;4
Clean hotel located between Times Square and the south end of Central Park. We traveled with 4 children under 14 and requested a rollaway bed when we booked using Hotels.com. There was no indication that it would be an issue. When we got to the hotel I called for the bed and was told our room was too small and it was a fire hazard. Obviously had I known, I would have booked somewhere else with more room/beds. After a few minutes, they remedied the situation by providing us a mattress, sheets, etc. that we just plopped on the floor. They were quick to solve and sympathetic to my situation. I'm really pleased and look forward to another stay with them.;4
Very good hotel. The room is comfortable and well equipped, with a huge bathroom. The staff was helpful and kind. The wifi worked beautifully both in the hall and in the room. Great position, close to Times Square and metro stops.;4
We stay 5 days at the Ameritania and we loved it - great, modern/minimalist rooms and style, BEST location and the Doorman, Jeffery could not have been more friendly and helpful everytime we saw him. We would atay again for sure. Other perks were blackout curtains and minimal noise from the street and others in the hotel;5
The Ameritania Hotel is an excellent choice in the Times Square area of NYC. Comfortable, clean well kept rooms and friendly, helpful staff. Highly recommended to all. Convenient to all the major attractions in the area.;5
Fantastic location near Central Park and a host of other landmarks  Somewhat basic in content but reflected in the price, the ameritania was just the ticket for us  Big thanks to Jeff the door man for courtesy and advice;4
Once again had a lovely stay at Ameritania Hotel. Thanks to Christie at the front desk for all her assistance, and the rest of the staff, the best. Also great to see Javier again, always goes out of his way to say hello. Our home away from home. Hope to be back again real soon.  Great location and very comfortable rooms.  Michele Durst;5
Great location. The staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean. Close to good food and all of the Broadway theaters. Eat at the Black Tap (amazing burgers and shakes) also the Buttercup Bakery is amazing for anyone with a sweet tooth!;5
Staff was friendly and helpful, checking was easy and quick. The location was ideal for us as it was close to Central Park which is one of our favorite places to go, as well as near the Broadway  theatres and restaurants.;5
The rooms are spacious and very clean.  You are steps from Broadway shows and restaurants. The hotel serves fresh coffee every morning and lovely ice water through out the day.  2 bottles of water each day at bedside. I've returned twice in the same month.;4
The highlight of the trip was the great energy from Javier ! Just a great overall love for being great. Great stay, great hotel.. would definitely recommend .. staff is always available and willing to help;5
A lovely hotel very friendly staff and so helpful enjoyed the relaxing feeling of the bar and the lovely wine . My 9 year old could build his LEGO while we had a drink . The location was great near to time square.;5
We loved our stay here! The location and staff were wonderful. Jeff is incredible - he was so helpful! He went above and beyond for us during our visit! If you have any questions or need help navigating the city, just ask Jeff! Also, be sure to visit the bar - Javier is great at his job and so friendly! Our room was nice and clean -- the bed was comfortable. No complaints here -- We cannot wait to come back and stay here!!;5
The location is great. It is walking diestance to most subway lines and Broadway theatres. The service was excellent. I arrived quite early and they had a room ready for me. The room was clean and the bd was comfortable.;5
Unfortunately this was a bad experience for me and my girlfriend.  The location of the place is of cores convenient and some employs are very friendly, but the management of the hotel is really far from ideal:  - Breakfast is very poor. No hot food, only serials and milk, some bread, tea and coffee. - Hotel doesn't give proper forks/ plate/ knife in the room, only plastic ones. This is embarrassing! - room cleaning service was never this annoying. First day, cleaning staff showed up at 4:30 pm, and if you can't let them in at that time, they won't clean your room as the working hours for cleaning are till 5 pm. I guess hotel doesn't take into consideration the fact that guests not always available to jump out of the room immediately. We went through a long debate with the day;3
Staff was very nice. Jeff went above and beyond helping my girlfriend and I get to the NYC half marathon on time! Huge thanks! Rooms were clean, bed was only ok. Hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square and Central Park.;4
Our room location was quiet and comfortable. Room service was good. Nice medium sized room and bathroom. Close to subway and central park. Heating and air conditioning worked well. Nice little refrigerator.;4
Very enjoyable 5 night stay, All staff very helpful with good advice for getting around town. Clean comfortable beds for a good nights sleep. Had a few drinks in the bar talking to the excellent Bartender (Javier) who made us very welcome and was great to talk to. Would definitely stay in this hotel again.;4
The rooms are much larger than we expected for NYC.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the showers had very hot water.  The staff was very accommodating to our needs.  We were initially charged for two items from the in-room bar which we did not use.  But when I called Tiffany at the front desk, she immediately removed the charge. Truly a great find with a great price and location!;5
"The room was clean which is most important to me but there was a lack of service which bothered me. My used cups were not replaced and my used towels and washcloth were not replaced. After the first day, I placed them on the floor the next day and they did not replace the washcloth. Aside from making the bed I am not sure they did anything to the room each day.  The appearance of the room was ""ok"" but you could tell it was just surface level improvements. The bathroom updates are not to code and the vanity is less than one inch from the toilet making it extremely uncomfortable to use.  With plenty of choices in NYC, I will not be going back.";3
Though we are not strangers to the city, this was our first time in 30 years staying in this particular area and it was a pleasure!! Our stay was only 1 night, as we were attending a show at Feinstein’s 54 Below which was literally maybe 50 yards away. We arrived early and the friendly doorman (Hugo I think) took our bags to hold until check in. The front desk associate (Vlem? So sorry if I messed up the name) was friendly, welcoming, and very courteous. Check in was fast and we were upgraded to a very spacious mini suite! It was sooo nice to have that extra space with all our coats and umbrellas. We never waited more than a minute or two for an elevator, and the lobby has a nice lounge area. What I did notice as we waited for 3:00 check in, was that several staff members came;5
I was upgraded to a different room because the room I booked was smaller than I anticipated. Hotel called me immediately and made me comfortable in a different room. The room was a perfect size and very elegant. Thank you!;5
Excellent facility, friendly staff, clean rooms and plenty of space for a decent stay. I stayed in a double queen room, just myself. There was plenty of space for casual and business clothes to be hung/laid out for the convention. Room was maintained daily and during convenient times. The concierge was very friendly and personable. Very convenient location near Times Square, with everything you could want within just a few blocks.   Highly recommend!;5
Very friendly, accommodating staff. Our room was ready early and they were happy to store our bags on our check out day. Clean and great location, especially for the price! We were easily able to walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park.;4
Really good location.  Helpful doormen and bellman.  Guest services quick and efficient. Rooms are clean and spacious. Good coffee served in the lobby. Close to Broadway,clubs and restaurants. I'll stay here again;4
Thanks at Jalal who give us many good advice and being really nice to us , he was really helpful We are appreciated . All the staff are nice thanks very much ! It was my second time in this hotel and it’s always a good moment ! Near to everything , 10 min walking to time square !   The only bad thing it’s about the noise in the hallways with the doors slamming many times early in the morning it’s annoying   Anyway except that it’s was a really good place;5
Fantastic location in NY for everything my fiance and I wanted to do. Almost everything was walking distance and there is a subway station a block away for everything that was a bit further. The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful upon check-in and check-out. The room was small but very much expected for NY and we didn't need more than that as we were out all day. Noise wasn't a huge issue as we were far enough from Times Square to not hear the crowds late at night - only noise was a normal big city during rush hour in the morning (lots of honking). Overall, incredibly happy and would absolutely stay there again.;5
Ask for Jeff for excellent service! The location is very good for easy walking access to Times Square. I traveled with a group of friends from Church, about 30 people, and have not heard any complaints about our Hotel from anyone.;5
The stay was just ok. We had issues with the air conditioner not working properly on more than one occasion and I noticed when checking out that my sheets had holes in them. Beds were comfy but small and not for tall people and the rooms are very small! Bathroom needs more counter space because there is NONE!  Best thing about our stay was Jeffrey the doorman! He was very kind, courteous and very very helpful both with checking in and checking out...he took the time to store our luggage because we arrived before check in and he went over a map of all the must see attractions and their locations around the city. He also arranged a ride to the airport for us when we checked out! A true asset to the hotel!;3
Stayed at this hotel on the 12 th floor overlooking broadway and I wasn’t disappointed  Jeff the doorman was fantastic room clean and tidy  Excellent position 2 min walk from Times Square if that and 5 min walk from Central Park Would stay again;5
We LOVED our stay at the Ameritania! It is a beautiful hotel walking distance to Times Square and so many other sights. The staff is wonderful. It was quiet at night. We loved the waterfall-like shower. Housekeeping was especially helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone making a trip to NYC. It was just a hop from Feinstein's 54, which was the main reason for our visit.;5
The rooms were super clean! The location was fantastic. It’s in the middle of everything. Easy access to parking garages, public transportation, Times Square, etc. Great restaurants and even grocery stores just a block away! I would definitely stay there again!;4
I would definitely recommend this hotel. Not too pricey and great location. Great helpful staff. Great room. I loved the shower in the room. The hotel was very quiet. The staff was professional and helpful in navigating the city.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania after a recommendation from my parents who see plays often. What a great find! The hotel is modern and beautiful. Tiffany at the front desk was not only lovely in person, but was a big help before our trip even started! There was a restaurant we were having trouble getting into because of our large party and Tiffany handled the reservation for us and also communicated with my sister via email to confirm all details. We are already planning our next stay at this wonderful hotel!;5
Our family stayed here for the Canadian March Break.  The hotel is in a great location.  Easy walk to shopping & eating in Times Square, Central Park, the Subway, tons of restaurants, theaters (numerous options for shows), souvenir shops etc. The location was outstanding!  The staff are very friendly and helpful. The door man and bartender were always smiling and welcoming us when we returned from a day out.  We stayed here for 5 nights and I have to say it was the quietest hotel I have ever stayed at. Not once did I hear noise from any rooms around us.  Of course it's NYC and there is some outside noise which was expected.   The room was a deluxe double.  Smaller then what we are used to but this is normal for NYC.  It was in good shape and kept very clean by the staff.  We had;5
Really helpful staff, who went out of their way to ensure our stay was the best posible, free upgrade to a corner room.  I would especially like to thank the door staff and Said especially who made sure all our travel needs were catered for.  Location was ideal for transport links and broadway.  Would definitely recommend but be aware New York isn’t cheap haha;4
Myself and my husband stayed here for 4 nights in February, hotel room was cleaned everyday , comfortable bed, only thing we had on our voucher in room coffee but was told by a member of staff , they have never offered it so this was disappointing, tea and coffee only offered in the morning,but we found a Starbucks close by. The hotel was about a block away from Thames square so was quite close, the consiarge Jeff was a lovely person, and was very helpful on our first day by showing us a map and hi lighting all the things we should try and do, thank you Jeff 😀;4
Came to NYC for a work conference, the host hotel was booked so ended up booking at Ameritania. I've been so pleased with the friendliness of the staff and willingness to help and be personable. The room is well maintained daily and plentiful of fresh clean linens.   When I return I'll definitely look to return here, great value for the location (few short blocks from anything you'd want), friendly staff, safe and secure facility.   Highly recommend!;5
Good location, just up from Times Square. Rooms were clean and serviced every day. Bed comfortable.  A couple of negatives - there weren’t any free plug sockets for charging phones etc except in the bathroom so not ideal. Also, no coffee or tea making facilities. I know this is probably a British thing but it would have been nice to have hot water to make a drink first thing. They did had hot water in the reception but obviously you had to get dressed. Anyway, a minor thing.  Overall, we were pleased with the hotel and staff. We had a problem with the safe not locking and it replaced within 15 minutes.  The Cascade deli/cafe just at the corner of 54th/8th street was great. We went in everyday for coffee and breakfast. Really reasonable.   Would definitely recommend this hotel as;4
"Ameritania Hotel was just as described, but it surpassed our expectations. My daughter and I stayed there for 7 nights. We were greeted by Crystal, who was friendly and very helpful in offering us a free upgrade on our 1 double to 2 double bed.  The hotel lobby and rooms were very clean, and the bed was really really comfortable. The only thing I think they could improve on is having better free complimentary coffee downstairs.   The location is perfect; close to subways, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park.  Thank you Crystal! I would definitely recommend this hotel!";5
Geeat locstion right in the heart of NYC, south of Central Park. Shops, Restaurants, Theaters and Nightlife all close by.  Special thanks to Jeff for helping us out getting to the airport for an amazing price!;4
"I stayed there for 3 nights. Staff is very good. They let me check in a bit earlier and when I complained about a noise coming from the bathroom they fixed it right away. Location is perfect. That probably the best pro of the hotel together with the staff They charge $20 per day for hotel fee (not included with an online third party reservation). They say is for the bottled water in the room, the wifi and the coffee in the morning at the lobby. I guess that's common. But for that money internet should be ultra fast and coffee should be good quality.  Two things to criticize. The carpet is old and not properly clean. For people like me, with allergies, that's a challenge. The other thing is the size of the bathroom. I know it's the ""NY special"", but still...as you can seemy the";3
Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel with my Mum. On arrival, Jeff the doorman made us feel very welcome and gave us a detailed map of sights to see. He even arranged our transport back to the airport whilst we were waiting for our room keys.  The location was perfect for us. 3 mins walk to Times Square & 10 mins walk to Central Park.  Nice room with very comfy beds. Great stay!;5
Great location! 2 min walk to Times Square and Central Park.comfy bed. Room was warm and no noise volume. Staff really friendly. See Jeff,the consierge, he kept us right in where to go and how to get there;5
Excellent hotel.  Great service, location, and facilities with a decent price. Night club next door can be a little noisy to 1:30 am.So bring earplugs.  Doormen were very helpfu!  We would go there again.;5
I stayed at the Ameritania with my mother for a girl's weekend in NYC. It was our first visit to the City. The Ameritania was recommended by a friend who once lived in NYC and has stayed here before. We were very pleased with the room size and relative quietness (except when horns honked or garbage trucks came by). The doormen were super helpful and friendly - especially Jeffrey. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.;4
Got to the room late after a very long day. Found that the overhead light had a short and was flickering non-stop in what seemed to be a disco hall. Advised lobby who sent a worker up to fix it. By 9:30pm he was done and left the 118sf room. Needless to say, I was unable to get anything done, or eat, or even dance as there was no room to do so. The other problem was the drawers on the seating bench which kept opening as the property is old and has wooden floors that are warped. Gravity did the rest and I had to kick them shut each and everytime I tried to cross the foot of the bed to get to the bathroom. Finally, I resorted to rolling over the bed Rambo style so as not to have to deal with the drawers. I was so tired I could not stop laughing at the situation as it is so typical;2
We felt so welcome here. Beds were very comfortable. Room slightly cold in bathroom but can cope.  Jeff the bell man gave us the time of day by giving us a map and highlighting the places for us to go. This made the holiday actually as we wouldn’t have known or seen what we did.  We were very grateful and Jeff is an asset to your hotel.  I would recommend tea making facilities in the room to make the stay most enjoyable. Loved NYC :);5
Perfect hotel to visit New York. The ocation is great, staff very helpful.  The carpet in the room could be changed because it is not very clean, but the rest is perfect for a nice stay. Relation Price-Quality very good.;4
From waking in door to leaving, staff were friendly, efiicient, helpful. Room a decent size with cool touches.   Decent coffee in the morning.  Staff arranged ride to LaGuardia, with no effort on my part.;5
I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Great customer service in an ideal location for and affordable price. Not very fancy but more than functional, would recommend.  Plus notes would be Lovely treatment by all staff (especially Said and Jeff) Amazing central location Decent sized rooms (Room 814) Effective heating Complimentary umbrella use  Nice clock with added functions Other standard amenities eg a safe in room and room service  Good standard of cleanliness   Things to improve The headboard was damaged which didn’t look very nice  Both lamps in the rooms were faulty with plug sockets which pulled out of the base The bathroom window was a bit broken at the top that made bathroom visits chilly One of the door handle roses was loose Some;4
The hotel was very nice and very affordable. The only thing to note is that the rooms are small, not too small as to detract from the stay, just small. Otherwise the room was clean and the sheets and towels were replaced daily. Overall a great stay for the price and the location is incredible!;4
Super close to everything. Very clean. Very safe. My only complaint is the loud sounds of the people in the hallway and I wish there was a bathtub. That is all. I love this hotel and will come back. REALLY great price.;5
We stayed at Ameritania as a homebase to celebrate our sons 25th Birthday in the city with friends and family. I absolutley am so impressed with how attentive and kind the check in staff is and the doormen are always super friendly. Thank you for   Going out of your way to accommodate my special request and above that sending up a nice birthday treat for our son.   The beds are soo comfortable,the rooms are always very clean.I love the shampoo and soap. The hotel has everything you need and it's the best location for seeing all of Manhattan. Short walk to central park/columbus circle shops, times square, hells kitchen, Rockefeller center.  The 1, E and QRN subway lines are within a couple blocks.  Restaurants all around.  Thank you Ameritania! See you soon;5
We stayed at this hotel with friends and I have to say we will definitely go back.   Room was very clean, bathroom spotless and very comfortable beds. The staff is so nice and helpful.  shout out to Jeff!  thank you    Cheers;5
The check-in process was efficient. And the lobby presents nicely.  The disappointment is that this is a hotel with interior rooms that face exterior walls of the hotel only. And the view is not pretty. Water stains from the heating/ac unit make for a very unattractive view (see photos.)  When I was about to go out for a drink about 11 pm, I realized that I could not control the heat. It was about 83F in the room! I went to the front desk and reported that the thermostat isn't working. He told me to try the unit on the wall. I did. It also was not functioning. So I went downstairs again, and this time another employee tried to fix it. He could not. So I was given another room.  The new room had a working thermostat. But the room is not designed for queen bed. There was not desk;3
We had an amazing experience, the hotel staff was wonderful, Jeffrey took the time to map out a plan for us to conquer the city and see all of the sites. He was extremely knowledgeable and really made our trip the best it could be! The rooms were great, the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel was modern, clean and comfortable. We will be back!;5
One of the nicest and wonderfully priced hotels I’ve had in New York. I traveled here for a birthday celebration and the location was walking distance from a subway station and great food. I would definitely book again.  Also shoutout to Jeff for being so kind and helping out during our trip!;4
Nice localization, next to several famous sigtseing atractions Employess are nice and friendly with the guests Excellent room Close to Times Square and it gives us a chance to walk around to know the streets and to go tothe atractions;5
Loved the room and the friendly staff. The beds are wonderfuly confortable and soft. Rooms are extremely clean and very spacious (for New York standards). Bathroom seemed recenlty renovated or even new. Location is excellent, right around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theatre (where the Late Show with Stephen Colbert is taped) and 2 blocks away from the Broadway Theatre. Free Wifi. The furniture in the lobby has seen better times and that threw me off a little bit when we got there, but the room was in excellent condition. I was very pleased with this hotel.;5
All the staff greeted me with a smile and made me feel welcomed and happy to answer questions or just share some of their local knowledge. Would definitely recommend this hotel.   The only little confussion is booking with all the fees but still worked out as a great value.;5
Staff is very nice. Let them know if there is any problem. They will solve it. They changed my room.   Location is very convenient.   The small is really small though, not good for a couple, lower price though of you are traveling alone.;5
Went to NYC for the weekend and decided to stay here, based on my last two stay from 7 years ago. I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything was still very similar, but not run down at all. The beds are super comfy, with plush sheets and blankets. There’s plenty of pillows too, which is a big plus for me. The hotels location is perfect for walking. Central Park & Times Square are both close by, as well as plenty of restaurants and shopping. The staff here is very nice and accommodating. There is a lobby bar as well (not sure why everyone is saying there isn’t one), it’s just not open from Sunday-Tuesday. I’ll definitely be staying here next time I’m in town!;5
We have been home a few days now and I’m already missing New York City it really is the city that never sleeps and has stolen my heart. We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel and it was amazing,and the beds are so comfy I had the best sleep, the staff are all friendly and the Door Man Jeff is the best he is so helpful. The hotel is in the best location on the corner of 54th and Broadway 5 minutes from Time Square and 10 minutes from Central Park. There is a bit of street noise from the cars but this is New York and it’s all part of the experience, I’m actually missing the car horns lol. If you have never been I would advise planning your trip, we used city pass and they were great also look at Eric’s New York he is on Facebook and very helpful. We did everything that New York has to;5
We arrived at night for our 2 night stay at the hotel.  From the outside in the city-lit street, the Ameritania looks beautiful.  The lobby is red and looks high end, but it is not. Check in was easy and stress free. I was given a room on the 8th floor. First the key cards didn’t work and I had to go back down to the desk. They are super sensitive to cell phones. We brought the new keys back up and opened the  door.  Upon inspection of the room, it was a small NYC room (standard). There was just enough room to walk around the bed and get to the bathroom.  The headboard was peeling it’s faux leather.  If you want space, the standard room is not for you. The bathroom had been remodeled, but lacked clean finishes (caulking on tile, etc). You can see that the hotel is trying really;3
We've just returned home from a 5 night stay at the Ameritania, and its been brilliant. The hotel is in a great location and the staff are great, especially Jeff who works on the door and in the lobby, this man went above and beyond for us showing us all the great places in New York to visit and even booked our transport back to the airport for us. He really knows his stuff and was genuinely interested in us and where we were from.  Our trip to New York was magical and we will definitely be returning to New York and to this hotel. Xxx;5
We have just had a wonderful time in this hotel. We stopped for 4 nights in a deluxe king room. The room was large clean and the bed was so comfortable. The whole time we were there the staff could not have been more helpful.  The hotel is in a great location just off broadway and so easy walking distance to everything in central Manhattan.;4
We've just returned home from a 4 night stay at the Ameritania, and its been brilliant. The hotel is in a great location and then start are great, especially Jeff who works on the door and in the lobby, this man went above and beyond for us showing us all the great places in New York to visit and even booked our transport back to the airport for us. He really knows his stuff and was genuinely interested in us and where we were from ect (the 2 Scottish people). Our trip to New York was phenomenal and we got engaged at the top of the empire state building (trip made). I will 100% be returning to New York and to this hotel.;5
I've been staying at the Ameritania for years and they never fail to disappoint. The rooms are always beautiful and clean, the service is always extremely friendly and willing to help. Andy, at the front desk was a pleasure!;5
Every aspect of stay was top notch ,including friendliness and efficiency of front desk,  decor and condition of lobby, good elevators, spaciousness of room (by NYC standards), quality of bedding and linens, and location. One of the best hotel values in NYC.;5
The location was perfect for us.  We only stayed one night and the front desk was happy to store our bags in the early morning of our arrival day and late into the evening of our departure day.  Everyone from the front desk to the bell hops to the cleaning staff were helpful and accommodating.  We were pleasantly surprised for the cost.;5
A modern, clean and friendly hotel perfectly situated just off Times Square.  Efficient and friendly staff, great daily servicing if room.  Comfy bed and super clean room and hotel.  Nice facility of having coffee/tea/got chocolate and water available in reception through the day .  All staff a genuinely friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Ameritania .;4
Just back from a 7 nite stay in New York hotel was very good only bad point I arrived with my daughter and had requested a room with 2 beds when got to my room only one bed went down to reception and lady said you can have double room but cost you another £166 I paid it but I as disappointed out that money when I just arrived in New York;4
Great value for the price we paid.  Special included no hotel fee or internet fee.  For all in price of under $150 you cannot find this quality and location in NYC.  Rooms were very well decorated and done and nice size bathroom;4
The location of the hotel is superb.  Just a couple of walking mins away from Central Park and Times Square. The rooms were enjoyable enough in that they were clean and cozy. The customer service was exemplary, when you go there, ask for Majid. Very friendly and helpful guy. He assisted me with all my needs, informative and was already ready to help.;5
Good: Close to Times Square, nice breakfast restaurant around the corner, 12:00 checkout, nice size room.   Bad: Bathroom door didn’t shut, mirror was broken, shower setup left floor wet, Internet doesn’t connection problems and slow speed.;4
A very friendly boutique-style hotel. Excellent location, only a short walk to the very heart of Times Square. Situated just off Broadway this hotel offers luxury & comfort. I have never slept in such a comfortable bed. Will stay here again & will definately recommend. This was a gem if a find.;5
What can I say other than my 5th trip to New York and this hotel was excellent. The hotel is not too close to Times Square and you would not really want to be either! The staff were so helpful and we asked for a twin room and were upgraded to a twin queen which was perfect for my daughter and myself. We did not include breakfast but went down each morning for our complimentary coffee to take out and had room service on arrival as we arrived very late and exhausted.  Would definately stay again..... 5*****;5
Arrived with my daughter for a night in the city what a disaster!  Lobby strangely arranged . The desk clerk had me sign a statement about the smoking policy . First of all I have never done this in the many places we’ve stayed . Long and short our room was on the 2nd floor . Dirty , small and creepy. That night we went to a show and came back to smoking smelling , marijuana smelling floor . Besides the fact we had some one playing trumpet sporadically through the night along with creepy clown sounds . We never slept all night long  . We get going in the morning early as we shut the door we heard a mans voice shouting obscenities and screaming . He must of watched us leave through the view from his door . My daughter and I head to the nearest staircase as we were heading down;1
Location is excellent.  We arrived early, and the hotel was able to hold our bags until check-in time later in the day.  When we did arrive back at the hotel, the elevators were not functioning, and our room became a 12 STORY WALK-UP. WITH BAGS.  Happily, that was the only time we had to walk up the stairs.  The $19.95 residence fee was expected, but still seems unusual- no other hotel has ever charged me a $20 residence fee.  Cleanliness was okay.  DO NOT EAT THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST.  This hotel charges $12 for a bagel and coffee, or whatever you might grab, breakfast offerings that are complimentary at comparable hotels.;3
So arrived on the 14th feb and check out is the 20th feb i was in room 1006, my first Impression was the reception is nice and tidy the front of house staff are helpful and door staff are fantastic, I liked the fact no body took my cases to the room I'm not daft i have stayed in hotels before so i can manage a door and light switch and was very happy with this, the room was okay on first impression but it wasn't without its faults !! i put my clothe in the drawers and closed them and like magic the drawers re opened so i shut them again but 2 mins later the drawers were open again it was quite funny, so i folded a few pieces of paper and out them under the front legs easy fix but maybe something more permanent would resolve the issue, now there is like a arty clock on the wall;4
elevator was out of order when i arrived, and the staff didn't offer to help me with my luggage as I climbed the stairs to the auxiliary elevator, BUT, to their credit, they listened to my concern, and offered me two comps to a continental breakfast. it's a nice enough hotel, with cheaper room rates than their neighbors. if you want a no frill, clean room, you'll be fine here, just not excited.;3
Here for our honeymoon. Room is large, bed is enormous. Bathroom is fantastic. Staff are excellent, very efficient. Hotel maids are very accommodating, room is immaculate every day. For the price, this is the absolute best in Manhattan for location, amenities and friendliness of staff. Can't wait to come back here!;5
My Husband and I, had a great short stay. The staff was great The hotel was very clean and warm. I was disappointed that there was not coffee maker in the room. I did not like the half glass door shower. A lot of the water got on the floor, which is very dangerous.  I was not made aware that the coffee and tea was available in the the lobby, when I first arrived.. Julian was extremely helpful. the other young man who helped us with our bags was extremely helpful also, unfortunately I can not remember his name. We will come back and stay at this hotel again.;5
I recently visited New York with my partner and booked into the Ameritania for 3 nights.  Right from the start of arriving at the hotel the staff made you feel really welcome, firstly the guy at the door Julian got the cases and then Chris and Mijad checked us in. It was great to have such a smooth check in after a long flight, the other staff I encountered were also helpful and had recommendations of places to eat and see!  Only down side was that the room was a little noisy but then again it’s New York and you’re a stones throw away from all the main sights! The room was tona good standard and the bed was comfy, bathroom also good.  Thanks again for an enjoyable stay!;4
The helpfulness of the front desk staff is amazing!!!  they solved  a room detail  misudertanding efficiently and promptly. Rooms are great, comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay at the Ameitania NYC.  Definitely will come back on the future.;5
If a great location is what you're looking for, this is a good place to consider as long as you're willing to risk sacrificing the basic services and amenities that other hotels offer. As soon as I tried to check in, I was rudely informed that since I was 18 and not 21 I would be unable to check in, and that I should have known this because it was somewhere on their website. This information was nowhere to be found on Priceline, which is where I booked my room, not to mention the fact that most hotels don't have a minimum check in age anyway, so who would think that a hotel in a major city would have such a restriction? After calling his manager, the guy then told me that it actually was okay for me to check in since I had already paid several hundred dollars for my room online,;2
Nice hotel, centrally located. Loved the overall vibe. Beautifully decorated. Thankful for the luggage valet before check-in. Checkout process was easy. The beds were super comfy and the bath amenities were nice. A few issues with the building being old (e.g. elevator had some problems operating, etc), but overall a great stay!;4
"The air conditioning unit in our room was extremely broken, and even when set to ""off"", still was blasting hot air. The room never got below 80 degrees, even with the windows open in the middle of winter, and the maintenance people said there was ""nothing they could do"", as the hotel was booked full. Staff were very friendly, and the hotel was nice, but between the AC and a few other things in our room being broken, and the fact we were promised a refund which hasn't yet been given, staying at the Ameritania proved a frustrating experience.";2
The hotel was really nice and clean. Staff was very friendly as well. It is close to time square. Perfect location 👍 my only complaint is the elevators we're not working..they only had 1 working.But I would definitely stay again.;5
Perfect location for sightseeing. Everything we wanted to see and do was walking distance to our hotel. Staff friendly and courteous. The room ammenities were great. Just right for the weekend getaway with family.;5
Excellent customer service.  Central location close to subway, shops etc. An excellent base for our stay. Noisy due to large volume of traffic and use of vehicle horns. Windows could do with being updated to reduce the noise.;3
We're just back from a stay at the Ameritania and we loved the location - very central for New York - 5 mins walk to Times Square, easy walk to Central Park (10 mins) & Museum of Natural History (20 mins). Friendly staff helped with check in and the door staff were very approachable and helpful. There is no lobby bar but the 3 monkeys next door is a good place to have a drink and there are plenty of restaurants near by.  We upgraded the room but it was still a bit small (to be expected in NYC) but was clean, functional and stylish. Our only gripe was that the bathroom was so cold - we visited in February and the average temp outside was around 2 degrees C - and so was the bathroom.   That aside, its a great base to explore the city and I would recommend it to those who want to;4
Stayed here in January and couldn’t praise the hotel enough . Concierge staff best ever and so accommodating and helpful . Def a hidden gem of a hotel . Guy on reception on night of 3rd Jan deserves an award for his helpfulness;5
Great decor throughout the hotel and very funky. Room was a good size and bed was really comfy however could do with a little tlc which some people would probably complain about. It’s in a great location and staff were really helpful especially Miguel in the bar. Would definitely return if we go back to nyc;4
The rooms were clean, beds comfortable, showers great, and centrally located so sites were within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay and would book again for our next trip. They were very accommodating for our group and went above and beyond to keep us in the same area of the hotel.;5
Booked a hotsale with hotwire and was given the Yotel. Amazing tech savvy hotel but rooms are well beyond small for 2 people. Was finally able to cancel and ended up with Ameritania. Never heard of this location before. Was greeted by Chris Rosa who had an amazing infectious vibe. He was pleasant, bubbly and super nice. Was able to accommodate our needs. So impressed by his superior customer service. Checked on him daily and was sad to hear that he was a bit under the weather, but his positive attitude shone through. Not only were the rooms and lobby beautifully decorated and clean, but all staff members were extremely nice. Will definately revisit. Thanks Chris for making our trip memorable and for taking the time to hear our concerns and accommodate us. Hope you feel better;5
We went to New York with our four kids to watch our daughter perform at Carnegie Hall. We stayed at the Ameritania for four nights and it is a wonderful small hotel close to everything we wanted to do. The concierge’s were insightful and extremely helpful. The hotel was very reasonably priced and clean. Though the rooms were small but perfect for us.;5
Highly recommended. Clean, chic, modern, professional atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was picture worthy. Room service is excellent. Bathroom was spotless and they had complimentary Figi water - superb.;5
Very nice staff,exelent location,goood bed.I will come back soon,thank you very much😊I really enjoyed my stay here.It is so easy to get around,very central.Very nice places to eat in the neighbourhood.The door personal were always very helpful whith all my request,and always with a smile.;5
Well-located, excellent modern design, clean and quiet, it's an excellent choice for Manhattan. One con though, the bed mattresses are too soft and that can cause back pain. But the cleaning and front desk staff are excellent: they found the charging phone cord I forgot and are going to mail it to me when I send them a pre-paid envelope.;5
Great value, fantastic location, friendly and helpful staff, large room with great bed and awesome shower. Morning coffee/tea and all day tea/hot cocoa are a nice touch. Front desk staff super kind: offered me a box of tissues to take with me because he noticed I was coughing so much as I was checking out! Decor is hip but not overwhelming.;5
For the price, I was not expecting a luxury hotel. I am happy to say I was wrong! Everything about the Ameritania was very impressive, from the room to the service and the helpfulness of the doorman Jeff! Would definitely stay here again.;5
Stayed here for 5 nights, the hotel staff were lovely and friendly and really made us feel welcome in arrival and whenever we did see them throughout our stay, lovely and quirky style lobby and rooms! Rooms were lovely and cosey the shower was amazing! You get free hot drinks throughout your stay! Now the cleaners always came round to do the rooms in the morning when we were out, however we got back one day just to chill in the hotel before going out for an evening meal about 5 and the room still hadn’t been cleaned around half hour later the cleaner knocked the door so we just asked for fresh towels, however she came in and was pottering around the room. We went to Carlos cake shop before hand and I was eating my cake but I didn’t finish so was saving for later and now this;4
Another awesome stay. Julian greeted us at the door, Mourad had arranged transportation to and from the hotel. Majid checked us in, he remembered us from previous and gave us a great room on the 12th floor! As usual there’s water and now hot chocolate available in the lobby, even a tray of cupcakes some days. We had a few drinks in the bar and we sampled some rums, water was replenished every day in our room. This hotel is hard to beat, the staff are awesome, the location is great. Even has a new time square sign. Thanks everyone see you soon!!!;5
This is our favorite hotel when we are in town! Staff is very helpful and friendly. The location is perfect walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and Central Park and much more. It has such a relaxing vibe.;5
Great location. Great rooms. Great staff.Jeff on the door was so helpful especially when our flight home was cancelled. He really is a great member of staff.The hotel has a great location and it's so easy to get to so many of the main attractions.I will 100% be back again to this hotel!The free tea and cake between 4 - 6 are a great bonus!;5
I attended a conference with EF Travel with a large group. This hotel was hosting Many large groups  and handled it with ease.  During our stay we had a few issues with the room that we reported at checkout as we did not want to move we were in room 701 however I’m very confident that this room received the TLC it needed when we departed.  I was in the hotel industry for over 13 years and things happen in rooms ware and tear and general issues just like in any home what makes a hotel unique and special is their  service.  Every time I turned around someone was going above and beyond and had a smile and friendly greeting.  The breakfast crew and the Bellman we’re all extraordinary but one stood out from all the others .  This is hard to do when everyone is already doing their;5
"I was at hotel for a college trip and I had a FedEx Letter sent to me. I had to pay $5 to have the desk clerk simply hand it to me. They did nothing to support this charge and when questioned they said it is disclosed on website; I checked and it’s only listed if you search frequently asked questions. I was told I you pay a $20 daily fee and it would be free....do the math and that makes no sense. My father called and spoke to front desk manager who agreed to send the general managers contact information and documents to support fee disclosure. Well this was never sent to him as agreed. I was walking by the desk and was told they had the wrong email address and my father called and left the message with correct email again and still no response...";2
We travel to New York several times a year and usually choose one of the big brand chains to stay with. This time we said we would try the Ameritania. It will be our base forever more. Check in was swift and friendly, room was great, clean and quiet. The location is amazing. Short walk to Times Square and Central Park. Everything on your doorstep. And more than anything else great value for money;5
Pleasantly surprised. Great location. Cool decor. Welcoming and most accommodating, friendly service from the whole staff (Front desk and doormen ( including Jeff ) So personable and helpful. Rooms well appointed, good amenities. Bed a little soft for our taste. Minor in the schemes of things. Really enjoyed our stay and can’t wait to come back.;5
Need renewed Need to change the furniture. Its to old and ugly the bed was very bad the sheets vely old.  Its look so dirty if you want ppl to come back.  Just renew the hotel and the looby looks like they never changed since you open the hotel;1
This Hotel was in a Great location, within walking distance to just about anything.  A deli and a 24 hour drug store around the corner, A Starbucks across the street.  JEFF the Bellman, WAS FABULOUS.  They do not come any nicer or more accomodating.  He helped us get several Cabs, he helped us with Directions, places to see & eat, and on our Departure date, he arranged for our baggage pickup and a nice car to take us back to the Airport. He was born & raised in the area so he knew something about it all.  The hotel was very modern, rooms are a little small especially the bathroom and the toilets are a bit low to the floor.  Overall Great Hotel, Would most definitely stay here again.  THANKS JEFF !!!!;5
This hotel is in a fantastic location 5 minutes away from Times Square and  Hell’s Kitchen (great restaurants and bars)  Room was clean and comfortable bathroom was great  All staff were very friendly, would stay here again!;5
pros: Very goo location,  you have coffee or tea for free every morning,  Stuff was very nice,  Cons: 1.They didn't cleaned our toilet in 1 of the 2 days we stay there, no shampoo etc either, One empty beer left in our rooms that day, do not know who put it there (ot us for sure) 2.I left my iphone USB charger connect to the clock, came back evening for it they said they didn't find it....it was connected to the clock 100% sure. 3.Noise from the street for rooms that face to. 4.No free wifi;3
it was a great location, all staff were charming - particularly the front desk staff and the bar staff.  we had some minor repairs required that were fixed quickly.  staff shared their local knowledge about getting around New York;5
Stayed at the Ameritania for 3 nights earlier in the month.  Got there early that morning and we couldn't check in until 3pm which we knew, they were very helpful especially Jeff who gave us a low down of the city and things to do kept us topped us with coffee and looking after our cases.  Ideal location, Very Helpful Staff, and over all a good hotel and a great trip  Thanks!;5
"We stayed here in room 504 for 5 nights from 20th January. Upon check in we had our credit card swiped. I read that there was a residency fee of $19.95 per night for the room which I was totally not aware of or told when booking the holiday in May 2018, or advised of during check in at the hotel. The signage on the reception desk is very small and can be easily missed.   I challenged this with reception on three  occasions over three days who told us we had to pay this as it was for ""complimentary snacks and drinks"" (not complimentary in my book as I'm paying the fee for it) finally Crystal spoke to a Manager who informed her that as I had booked prior to October 2018 when this was introduced this would not apply to us for the stay.   Negatives were the room was on the small";3
Hotel was great. The decor is a lovely boutique style decorated hotel. The room.was a wee bit small but lovely and the bed was so comfy. The rooms were cleaned spotlessly everyday. The doorman gave us the most valuable piece of info that you need in New.york - how the street numbers work....this was the only reason we managed to find our way about the whole week.  The staff are very helpful but not in your face. They leave you to come to them if you need them, which we loved. This place is in the theatre district, a stone throw from times square, and central park.  It was a perfect location for everything. We didn't try the food but only because we ran out of time.  We will definitely stay here next time we visit NYC;4
"If you're looking for an afforable hotel in the Times Square area, it's difficult to find a better hotel than the Ameritania. It;s a 4 star hotel at a 3 star price. The service is superb starting with doorman/bellhop who greets you at the front. My only complaint is that there are three steps and no handicap rank to get your luggage up to the lobby. The lobby is modern and spacious with free coffee in the AM. The rooms are large by Manhattan standards. The bed was very comfortable, The showers were the modern rain forest type with a switchable wash bar. I recommend this hotel highly.";4
lovely hotel with an excellent service from all the staff. Very helpful and would recommend. Will visit again. And is 5 minutes from Time Square which is very handy and everywhere is within walking distance if you are willing to walk;5
My husband and I stayed here for one night while we were seeing a show in the area.  The place was very nice and clean.  We were surprised by how big the room was since we were in NY.  As someone who gets a little claustrophobic it was a nice surprise.  They offered the normal amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc.) as well as some earplugs since it's located on a busy street.  We didn't have an issue with too much noise, but make sure to close the black out curtains and the bathroom door (some of the street lights reflected into the bathroom).  There was no coffee/tea maker in the room which might have been a first for us.  They did have snacks and other things available for purchase.  They also included a complimentary water by the bed.  Check out is late at 12.;5
The staff is great starting at the top Garret was very professional and Janet is very helpful experienced and welcoming she just great ...The housingkeeping staff is excellent The bellman and door staff are great and professional  ....;5
"My boyfriend suprised me with a 6 night stay in New York for my 30th Birthday! (My first time to NY and his 3rd)   We was there for Christmas and the Ameritania did not disappoint! All the staff was polite and friendly! Especially Geoff on concierge! He could not do enough for you! Our room was lovely and cosy. The shower was amazing!   You can help yourself to cold and hot water in reception and they put out tea/coffee and snacks in the afternoon! The hotel is a stones throw away from Times Square and Central Park!   You can hear street noise at night but that was expected in the ""city that never sleeps"".  We did all the main site seeing and my boyfriend proposed to me Christmas Day whilst we was on the top of the Empire State Building!!   Geoff on concierge arranged our taxi";5
We just came back from a great stay in NYC made possible by our hotel. It was clean and comfortable and you can’t beat its location, close to shows, restaurants, Central Park and so much more. And the staff was very friendly and helpful. We’ll stay there again.;5
Went for conference and trade show at Jacob Convention Center. Very convenient, fantastic stay and very close to Times Square. Centrally located to Hell's Kitchen area and some great restaurants. Last, but not least, very good value for money!;5
The hotel is nicely located, clean, and good for the price. The staff in general if nice and ready to aid you. Jeff in particular was very helpful. Beware that packages delivered have a 5 dollar fee. Will go again!;5
We enjoyed our 2 night stay. Very clean, spacious room with a nice bathroom. Great location and plenty of restaurants in the area.  If you are a light sleeper it can  get a little noisy at night though.;4
We stayed here through Christmas and New Year. It really is the perfect location. The madness of Times Square is five minutes away yet the hotel location is relaxed. Central Park is also five minutes. Even though it is quieter here ( not by much) it is safe to walk home at night even on your own. The room we were in was large with a cupboard and set of drawers. Bathroom was large also and the whole room kept spotless. You pay a resort fee as most hotels do in America and this hotel gives great wi-fi in room for all devices and bottled water included. We did use the concierge for car to the airport and it arrived exactly as we asked. We have stayed in New York before and we all said this was our favourite hotel. Great hotel,great staff,perfect location.;5
The Ameritania is in a fabulous location near Central Park and Times Square.  Rooms were nice and staff were very friendly and helpful.  No restaurant in the hotel but not an issue because there are many options close by.  I strongly endorse this hotel.;4
We love your hotel!  We've stayed there every year for the past decade.  Your staff is great! Rooms are roomy for NY. Location is great -- close to theatre and subway stops and 9th Avenue for lots of great, inexpensive restaurants.  We'll be back next year!;5
Lovely quaint hotel near to Times Square and all the Broadway shows. Lovely staff very helpful. Bed comfy. Towels changed when required. Room serviced daily. A bit dated but brought character to the place.;5
We stayed here to be close to the theater, and found we were so close to so many great restaurants, plus Times Square and Central Park.  The staff was wonderful, the room spacious, the coffee delicious and the bed comfy.  I would definitely return here!;5
Stayed here with my partner Daughter and her Boyfriend from 19th till 23rd Decemeber 2018. Fantastic Location for all your site seeing. Staff are friendly and helpful the guys in the Lobby always offering advice and wanting to help. Best sleep ive ever had in a hotel room. Heard 4th floor was haunted Disappointed that the ghosts had a few days off when we visited. stay here again absolutely recommend definitely.;5
By far one of best and most convenient hotels in New York. Great location near Times Square and Central Park. Check in and check out very efficient. Room was clean and not too small even for 4 of us. Staff were great especially the lads at the door. Jeffery and most of all Said were so friendly and helpful. Said went way out of his way to help out track a suitcase left in a yellow cab. Free WiFi in lobby but had to pay for it in the room. The staff make this hotel and we would definitely stay here again.;5
We booked the Ameritania due to it's close proximity to central park and the NY Marathon finish.  The hotel has some really glowing reviews on Tripadvisor & whilst we thought it was a good comfortable option for what we needed, I am not sure it was anything out of the ordinary in terms of look & feel or service.  I wouldn't particularly say it was great value for money given we paid c£1,000 for 4 nights but I accept we would have been booking on a peak weekend given the marathon.  The hotel itself is very dark & nowhere near as bright as the pictures look on the website.    We had a Deluxe room and I certainly wouldn't recommend going for a standard, we saw our friends room & you could hardly walk round the bed (they had already asked to move once because their original room was;3
There wasn't very clear instruction on the Wi-Fi passcode.  I ended up paying for it as the sign-on drop box was wonky.  The front desk apologized after I complained about having to pay for internet.  They credited/gave me breakfast each morning.  Not super fancy.  But boutiquey.  And enough,  Not super hand holding staff...  But I like that.  I don't like to be accosted when I come in.;3
Staff went above and beyond to make our short stay a 5 star experience on Broadway. A specials thanks both to the bartender Javier, and knowledgeable lovely concierge for helping my family and (lost bestfriend) get to the Christmas Spectacular Rockettes on time!!!;5
The staff at the Ameritania were very helpful and more than nice. The bar/restaurant area was small and we didn't take advantage of it much so not a lot to comment on that. There is free infused water in the lobby as well which was a nice touch.   Our room was very spacious (corner unit) and clean. The free Wi-Fi made planning our next day's adventure a bit easier. Three elevators make getting in and out of the building a breeze.  The central location of the hotel is what sold us. Right across from a Subway entrance and next to the Ed Sullivan Theater (Stephen Colbert Show!). Steps from a ton of Broadway Shows.   This was an excellent hotel for the price!;4
Booked via Lastminute.com for the NYE in NYC experience. This hotel came up trumps. Wonderfully comfortable mattress.Excellent service all round. The only improvement would be tea and coffee making facilities in the room.;5
The hotel is located at West 54 and Broadway which is close to Central Park, Carnegie Hall, and lots of restaurants. It is minutes away from Times Square. The check-in was fast, efficient, and the staff very helpful in getting us oriented to the amenities of the hotel, the local area and things to do while in the city.   The rooms are well appointed, fairly spacious, comfortable beds, clean and the staff take exceptional care of the property. I had an issue with the batteries dying in the door lock of the room, rendering the card unusable. The front desk had maintenance folks on site within minutes and they had the problem rectified in minutes. They take great care of their customers!  We had questions for the front staff and they showed much patience in providing time to;5
Great location, room was spacious and clean, good linen on beds and plenty of towels. Room wasn’t ready so we had to wait but that wasn’t an issue. The room - as per other reviews- was too hot and we couldn’t regulate it but that’s my only complaint. The doorman Jeffrey Banks is an absolute star, got us last minute reservations for NYE dinner and totally went the extra mile throughout our stay, a credit to you. Hopefully we will be back soon.;4
The hotel is central to many popular places. In addition the staff is really nice and helpful. One particular staff is named Jeffery. He was helpful and very professional. I would recommend this hotel and will definitely go back.;5
I have been meaning to write this review for a while. This hotel was very cool looking interior wise in the lobby and has a nice food hall. The room was also very good with a nice view of the city. I had went to New York City with my mom to check out the city because I had only gone once and did not have alot of freedom to walk around. We went shopping and toured while becoming true New Yorkers by taking the subway and getting off at the wroung stops due to my poor sense of direction. There was a man who took our luggage named Jeff who was very nice and helpful and saved our first day our trip with his extensive knowledge of New York City even telling us what subways to take and writing it all on a map. He really went the extra mile and we are thankful for that. The hotel also;4
The location is fab. However on departure they claimed we were due to be charged an additional fee that wasn’t included in our confirmation, despite our confirmation stating all fees and taxes were included. No explanation of this fee or communication from them since our stay when I’ve queried it and followed up.  So beware leaving your card and insist on a receipt which the receptionist did not give me.;2
Stayed with my wife over Christmas. Great location, could not fault it. Easy walk to subway stations, central park and times square.   Good sized room, we were on the 12th floor, street facing corner. However view was undesirable, looking down onto neighbouring roofs and water towers.  The room was always very hot, even when you set the aircon to cool and the temperature all the way down. One of the windows wouldn't stay open and we had to prop open with a book to try and cool the room down.  The hotel itself is a bit run down, badly fitted windows and you can tell they have cut corners on a recent update, especially in the bathrooms. We had plumbing issues with the sink, after use it would need 15 minutes to drain for simple tasks like washing hands.  The beds were comfortable;3
Fantastic hotel, excellent location!We stayed in the Ameritania from the 18th to the 23rd Dec with our 2 children, We loved it! Our first trip to New York and we couldn’t have chosen a better hotel for location, cleanliness and helpfulness! Thank you hotel Ameritania, we will definitely be back!!!;5
We stayed here for 4 nights. It was perfect from the moment we arrived. The location of the hotel is ideal for anyone new to the city or having previously experienced it, only a 30 second walk from 7th Avenue subway station. Our bags were taken to our room by a very knowledgeable bellboy who informed us of all of the essential information for our first night. The room was amazing, bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom was exceptional for our needs. We were greeted with a smile every time we entered the hotel by the cheerful staff.  Overall certainly worth 5 stars and when I visit again in the future I am sure to book to stay here again.;5
Stayed at this hotel, lovely friendly staff. Beautiful rooms. User friendly mid town, near Times Squre. Defiantly be back, clean and in a good spot just off Broadway. Big thanks to Jeff the doorman who was so helpful and friendly, a real star.  Would highly recommend.;5
The hotel room wasn’t as I expected. The bed had rips in it and I was not totally happy. However we spent little time there. The mini bar was extremely expensive and I wouldn’t use it!  Jeff the door man is outstanding the lobby area is well decorated.  Location is amazing! Would I go back? Yes I would!;4
Nice hotel, you are so tired after a day on foot in NYC so most importantly- the bed is sooooo comfy!! It really mattered after an average of 4.5 miles a day! Nice restaurants on the street we are on (Empire- pricey and Iguanas- fun place)and a nice diner behind us(Cosmic diner). You might spot Daniel Radcliffe as he performs in theatre next door! Thanks to Jeffery and Mourad in particular for help with cars to airport and generally giving us good advice etc. We didn’t use the bar or eat their breakfast so can’t comment but we had a comfortable and pleasant stay here.;5
Minimalist decorating. No dresser to put clothes in. Shower only, no tub. Comfortable beds. Great location. Stayed here arranged by travel agent and with group. Even though it had no tub or dresser it was more than adequate as we spent so little time in the room. Great service by hotel staff.;4
This was an excellent location and with friendly, helpful staff. The Room was bigger than the average NYC room which was quiet and clean. Beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets, with  AC fairly quiet.;5
Spent the weekend here  I cant think of a better location than this, walking distance to Central Park, multiple subway stations, and Times Square. The service was good, personnel always friendly and helpful if something needed However, the rooms are missing maintenance, and some basic details are very visible;3
The price we paid wasn't nearly worth the room (incredibly cramped, two full beds, with a desk and a computer chair that couldn't budge due to the bed being right up against it).  Regardless, the location was perfect to where we wanted to go for our evening and days.  The Uber was cheap to get to/fro the train station (and even then, we would have walked to the train station if the weather weren't so crummy).  The front desk was your traditional New York charm (so a big rugged), but she did switch our room from one bed to two beds because Hotels.com messed up our reservation.  Also, our heater was set to 80 degrees (fahrenheit) and we kept turning it down but it wouldn't budge.  We tried setting it to 65 on air conditioning mode, but it kept blowing hot air.  We eventually had;3
Stayed here with a friend first week in December. Swift check in. Door man very helpful when he brought our bags up to the room. Helped us with booking tickets and where everything is. Hotel is a short distance from Times Square, 5th Avenue, Central Park and is right on Broadway.  Perfect location.  Helpful and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
My husband booked this trip for my birthday and it has been amazing, the hotel is in an ideal position for sightseeing and the barman Javier was a really nice helpful man very friendly and knowledgable, also very good at creating a drink to suit your taste. Now for the hotel review, we were booked into a King size deluxe room, this is not what we were given the room was so small we banged our feet on the bottom of the bed every time we tried to walk around it. 200 sq ft of space - no way, the clock on the wall was broken, no hands on the dial!!! No docking station no easy chairs to sit in and a view of other bedrooms opposite through dirty windows.  As you can see from photos no room at all to move around freely or store luggage, feel as though we have been ripped off.  When my;2
Hotel is a great base for our 5 day stay  It is a lovely modern hotel rooms not huge but more than adequate bed comfy hot shower very helpful staff and concierge who were happy to assist with any enquiry  Happy to look after suitcases after checking out for later collection  Yes there is noise but to be honest you don’t really notice it it’s a very noisy bustling city with constant background noises and police zipping around  It’s in a brilliant location and is on a corner of Broadway and a short walk down to Times Square we walked back from Maddison Square Gardens which took 25 mins  We didn’t eat in the hotel due to being out and about all day  Couldn’t fault the hotel or it’s staff it was cleaned every day and beds made with clean towels  We couldn’t pick any fault with it at;5
Me and a few friends stayed at the Ameritiana hotel this last week and it was so beautiful with the Christmas decorations! The complimentary breakfast and snacks were fresh and delicious. Our flight home was at JFK airport and Jeff was so kind and helpful in making sure we had our taxi ready for us at exactly the time we needed it. Thank you Jeff for your generous hospitality and thank you to the Ameritania for a truly magical stay! We will definitely be back again!   Happy Holidays!;5
Really really confused how it would be even plausible to have a review above 2 stars...  The location of the hotel and the staff are the only things that got this 2 stars. I will never stay here again. I stayed after reading reviews complaining about the same things thinking.. no way they have 4.5 stars and every room is like that. But really no way that our room is the only room with these problems!   First the room we got was the “king deluxe” the bed was the entire size of the room. Which ok not horrible if you’re not spending the entire time in the room.   The TV has a black bar through the middle. (Every channel)  The bathroom- no door to the shower, you have to move the actual sprayer in the shower to get wet it doesn’t spray you. The bathroom door paint was peeling off;2
Our flight was early so we were able to drop our luggage off at the hotel and check in so when the room was ready all we had left was to get our keys. They gave us tips on places to eat and did a great job.;5
First trip to New York for us. Hotel staff was always friendly and warm, as well as helpful. Spent 4 nights with them. Room is small, but comfortable for 2. Bed was very comfortable, No tub, but large shower with plenty of hot water. Fireplace downstairs was warm and invited getting to know people. Location was spectacular! Close to all the theaters, the park, Times Square, & primary subway lines. Very modern look and feel. We will gladly return on next trip.;5
We stayed for five nights from 19 November. The hotel is a three star plus and on first impressions I felt slightly disappointed bower this was down to my expectations being too high and being tired from the flight. I was expecting a larger room as everything in America is bigger (I have stayed in other hotels in America) however this is a city hotel and it represented the price we paid. On arrival we were greeted by Jeff the doorman who held the doors open for us, check in was quick and we were soon in our room. The bed was very comfortable, there was a dressing table, Otto an and built in wardrobe with safe. The bathroom was compact with hardly any room to store our toiletries however toiletries are supplied, nice big walk in shower which had a constant supply of hot water.;5
Our stay was amazing! Great customer service our room was upgraded from a queen to a king and they got us a room with an amazing city view! Very stylish and large comfortable rooms. Great location near time square and theater district and close to the subway.;5
I stayed here for the first time on 9th December.   I was a bit frustrated at checkin in having to leave a credit card swipe for $100 to cover any potential incidentals and preferred to use cash. Cash is not accepted for this but in my experience the time it takes to return the $100 to the card is not always fast. Anyway it’s probably not so much if a big deal as I was making out. So I’m sorry if i was a bit abrupt  I was given a beautiful room with double aspect view on the 8th floor however I had to change rooms as the bed, while lovely for some was just too soft for me. I need a firm mattress to sleep well. I was offered a smaller queen room on the 9th floor and the bed was perfect. I slept very well. The bathroom was fantastic with a wet room type shower.   To make up for;5
Had a lovely 4nights stay here in December. It's west on 54th street, smack in the middle between times square and central park. Lovely rooms and comfy bed. Javier the barman is amazing and very helpful! Highly recommend staying here. Would definitely stay again. Thank you!;5
The Ameritania Hotel, is perfectly located for business needs, dining and shopping. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Rooms are large for NYC standards, the blackout blinds and heavy drapery drown out the soundsof the city and let you have a quiet night sleep, and the shower is amazing to wake you up before you leave :);5
My daughter in law and I had a weekend break in New York staying at this hotel, I cannot fault it at all we were met by a very happy receptionist always nice to be greeted with a smile, Our room was large with 2 very comfortable double beds and very clean, large shower room which also was bright and clean. The hotel is ideally situated to all amenities took 5 mins to walk to Central Park and time sq and broadway were literally round the corner, there is bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel but we found it very quiet while in the room, all staff very helpful and friendly I cannot rate this hotel enough;5
Easy walk to Central Park, Times Square and MetroNice “NY hotel room”.  A real desk and chair to work at.  Black-out blinds optionVery friendly staffFresh bathroom, good productsNice lobby coffee / tea bar (complimentary);4
We visited to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and found this hotel which is just two blocks from Times Square- so a great location for tourists. The hotel is smart, clean with modern decor, the rooms are a good size and despite its central location they are quiet and heavy curtains keep the light out. We found the staff very responsive to queries, providing a kettle to our room quickly upon request and even dropping a small cake and birthday note to my partner into our room. There is also tea and coffee in the foyer for a lot of the day. I’d definitely recommend it, well priced for central New York;4
Stayed here December 2018 whilst visiting from the UK for 4 nights. The location is great, less than 10 minutes walk down to Times Square and about the same up to Central Park. The staff are great especially Jamal & Jeffrey and Javier on the bar is friendly and always willing to give advice on where to go and when.  The room (1204) although on the small side didn't bother us as we only really used it for sleeping in was tidy and well kept with great views. If you're a light sleeper bring your ear plugs as it's a busy part of NYC.;5
We stayed here for a night in December and had a great experience! The staff was very kind and helpful to us. Algenis at the front desk was wonderful and the manager on duty, Vlad, was also great! The room was very clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend!;5
Such a lovely hotel friendly helpful staff especially the concierges. Spot on location so close to both time square and Central Park couldn’t have asked for a better location rooms where comfortable and well presented clean tidy and cleaned daily overall a fantastic time was had by all of us;5
Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough.... really friendly and helpful staff especially Jefferey! The location was just perfect and the beds are AMAZING!!! Complimentary tea and coffee in the morningwas a lovely touch! Highly recommend;5
No room service, but they find breakfast for you. No heat on a freezing night and 65 degrees in the room is not acceptable. The manager came up at midnight but wasn’t able to fix anything. Not acceptable.;1
We have stayed at this hotel twice and had a very positive experience both times.  The rate for the hotel is almost always lower than at other hotels and the service has always been top notch. The rooms are larger than your standard NYC hotel rooms and are very clean.  The location between Times Square and Central Park means that you have access to everything you would ever want. The only possible reason for the lower rate must be that the hotel doesn't really have many rooms with a view of the NYC skyline, but if this doesn't bother you, you won't be disappointed.;5
I wish to thank the entire staff of the hotel for being such friendly and great hosts. Jeff and the entire team at the front door were true professionals and extremely helpful. Tiffany and the crew at the front desk were very nice and friendly. I cannot wait to return!;5
I booked a room here for the NY Marathon. I called back a few days later and asked if they had a bigger room, they said they did not so I cancelled the room (per their policy, months in advance) and booked elsewhere.  Fast forward to marathon weekend -  they charged me $470 despite the cancellation and WILL not remove the charge because they never cancelled it on their end.;1
I have stayed here before. I am claustrophobic and most NYC hotel rooms are very small, but I am always quite comfortable here. Great location and helpful staff. Always my first choice when I need to come to NYC for travel.;4
great location for what I wanted to do -- Broadway, Met Museum, Met Opera.  Beds too soft, noisy even on 10 th floor from 54th Street -- single pane glass windows.  It was nice that windows opened as heat even when turned off was too much for late November.  Hotel staff was nice and helpful.  Hotel itself was in good but not great condition.;4
Room was clean, comfy and satisfactory.  Positives are location and Jeffrey, the doorman, was friendly and a great help with all the questions we had.  He took the time to tell us about taking the subway as a group for a reduced price and we found it a great way to get around.  Thank you, Jeffrey!!;3
Our flight was delayed so we arrived around midnight, thoroughly exhausted to find we had been allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the one we booked on the website. There were no drawers at all and only a tiny wardrobe with no shelves. As we were at the beginning of a 12 day stay in NYC and New Jersey we had hoped to be able to unpack! We complained and the night manager said he would write a note for the morning staff. In the morning we took it up with the day staff, who said they would be able to let us know if there was another room about 2pm, and gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers. When we came back we were shown to a very pleasant room, with storage facilities so we took that one and enjoyed our stay from that point on. The doormen, (hello Jeff!), are;3
Close to Central park and time square. Bed was comfortable, sadly thats about the only positives i can think of. Room not ready on arrival despite turning up nearly an hour after check in time. Had to wait around 45 before we could check in to our room. Very poor room layout - huge mirror(unmovable) in an area with no lights, hardly any plugs in room(non near bed), all on far wall in middle of nowhere.  Air conditioning in room loud and broke after a few days - highly ineffective as placed on the ground, in a corner, next to the window. It barely changed the temperature up or down more than 1 degree. Heating system came on at random intervals in middle of night(despite being turned off on wall controls), to very loudly wake you up, then turns off 5 mins later to achieve nothing;2
Only 2 nights in that nice place, nice rooms ans people very kind. Special tks to Olga and MISTER Banks Jeffrey!!! !-)   You can ask what you want, they find the solution!! Near Broadway and 10 mins from Times square. Ingrid and Jérôme;5
Nice hotel clean and tidy room service varies One day we got all our towels changed, another day we got only half off our towels back and room wasn’t as good as previous. And the bed wasn’t made. Hotel staff friendly same goes for door staff;5
The ameritania is an excellent hotel all staff are first class the location gets top marks hotel is just around the corner from broadway coming back next year love the hotel and location great stay thanks to all the staff;5
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found the location to be excellent, close to everything we needed. The room was small but comfortable. Jeff was very helpful with providing us advice on where to go and what to see.;5
Excellent service, more than friendly staff and a warm and comfortable room. The staff here made our visit to New York much easier with helpful tips to get round quicker and cheaper. Nothing was too much trouble, and the room, although small, was perfectly suited for what we needed and good value for money, and was cleaned daily. Overall, an excellent stay and would definitely recommend.;5
Very clean and such a great central location to all the other local attractions. Although located in the Times Square area, the hotel is very quiet and you can't hear the busy hustle and bustle outside (but if your floor has people that slam their doors or kids running around, that's another story). The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I would stay here again if visiting NYC.;4
Spent 3 days at this hotel. Really great room Two double beds in one room on 5th floor. Ensuite bathroom. Safe and aircon. Flat screen tv. And mini bar. Breakfast was extra but this was expected. Nice hotel. Very helpful staff. Door man Jeff was so nice and helpful especially when the transfer pick up failed to turn up.  Thanks to Jeff top man. Hotel was on corner of Broadway and great location to get around the city. Would return to same hotel and would recommend to others.;4
It is a very nice stay and great thanks to stuff @Jeff who helped me a lot when I check-in and leave. The location is very great. Very close to subway,time square, and Central Park etc.second time stay in the hotel.;5
The hotel is amazing, close enough to everything but not too close so that you can't sleep with the noise! The room was fab we had a deluxe double double and everything you need is in there. The hotel provides coffee and tea all day and the staff can't do enough for you, in particular Jeff who helped us with our luggage, our taxis and gave us some good pointers about the city- will deffo be back x;5
I booked the holiday for my partners birthday when we arrived one of the lobby staff named Jeff welcomed us and showed us a map with all the best places to go and quickest routes, when speaking to Jeff and saying it was her birthday he told reception staff and then got a cake and Jeff got us a bottle of champagne (it was a special birthday) any time we needed directions lobby staff happy to help. The room was a tad small but it is expected from Manhattan, overall me and my partner had a fantastic time here and would definitely recommend it;5
Our stay at the Ameritania started on the 22nd October for 4 nights. When I say I cannot fault it, I mean it.  The hotel itself is immaculate, so clean and tidy. The room I suspect is standard for a New York room with an en suite bathroom. But it's clean and is cleaned daily. We didn't spend much time in the room as we are in such a beautiful, busy city why would you?  One place we always spent time, at least once a day, was the bar. The barman was tremendous and so attentive. He always asked about how our holiday was going. We loved him and he is a credit to hotel. I cannot fault the Ameritania Hotel in any way shape or form.;5
Starting from  arriving early and the hotel accommodating our luggage until we checked in, to the friendliness of all staff, room service and to the very nice  room we stayed in, I will recommend this hotel to anyone asking for recommendations while in NYC.;5
This hotel is so well located. We were so pleased and the weather could not have been better considering it was November. Great staff. Very friendly and helpful. Would definitely refer others and stay again.;4
An unlikely affordable hotel in the middle of all the action.  Around the corner is the Stage Delicatessen of movie fame, the Stephen Colbert TV show theater, TImes Square, and, best of all, an great and wonderfully friendly place to stay.  This hotel is SO good and SO reasonable, I hesitate to say too much so as not to spoil this lovely example of welcoming New York the way it deserves. Jeff, one of the several greeters at the entrance, is polite, friendly, full of information (he could be an Italian graceful Concierge, with his wealth of information and advice), and a pleasure to meet and chat along with.  All the people who work here are also but a prelude to the clean, excellently equipped and great room furnishings and views.  Not to be missed, but, please, don't tell too;5
"In Europe this would be a 3-star hotel, but with caveats  - Pleasant staff; no restaurant; a bit long in the tooth  - No plugs at desk for charging devices  - Desk chair broken  - Carpet has seen better days  - Very small but clean room and bathroom; some rooms on Broadway (noisier) some face an alley (no view but quiet)  - Around the corner from Colbert’s Late Show (Ed Sullivan Theater)";3
"Very nice stay, charming room.  Only complaint is that there was no mini-bar in the room.  There were ""snacks"" on the dresser, but no cold drinks or coffee opportunity.  I will continue to use this as my go to hotel in the city.";4
My main complaint is the ‘resort fee’ ($22US) which is being charged for very standard hotel inclusions such as tea and coffee, in room wifi and baggage minding. I found out about this at the time of check in! This is just a sneaky way of charging more per night for the hotel room. I realise that lots of hotels in NYC are doing this, but that does not make it acceptable!  The hotel location was excellent and otherwise the stay was comfortable.;3
This was my second time to stay in teh Ameritania hotel and I will without hesitation return for further visits. The locationn is perfect, the rooms and amenities are of a high standard and importantly all the staff are helpful, friendly, good mannered and generally just make the stay a warm experience.Looking forward to my next stay.;5
Just back from NY having spent 4 nights at the Ameritania. Comfortable, clean and really great location for exploring, couldn’t have wished for better. Great advice if required from all the staff, particular mention to Julian and Jeff always willing to help, Fab!!;5
We were given a warm welcome by the Hotel Manager on check-in. He remembered the trip was to celebrate our mums/ grandmothers 75th birthday and left some cakes in our rooms and free WiFi. We asked for 3 rooms close to one another and this was delivered- even though the hotel was very busy.  The room was comfortable, comfy bed and good shower. Clean and looked after well by room service. We didn’t eat in the hotel but had drinks from the bar, barman friendly and no problem to take drinks to the room. The star member of staff for us with Jeff, the concierge. He was so helpful in helping us plan our routes and gave great advice on what routes to take and times to visit particular landmarks. We would not have seen nearly as much as we did without his advice. A fantastic stay, good;5
invest in a second waffle maker, lines were pretty long and i’d have to sacrifice sleep to get one. when we returned to our room things didn’t go missing and everything was clean. i shared a room with 3 other people and we ran out of body wash within the first 2/5 days;4
Staying here for 3 nights midweek was really easy. It’s close to Broadway and walking around for everything I needed was not a hassle in any way. I didn’t eat at the hotel, so just used my room for sleeping and working.. WiFi was excellent for connecting for conference calls and late check in was accommodated with no problem. I just found a couple of the fixtures weren’t in great shape, as it feels like there are a few areas that would benefit from a bit of love. great for work trips or short stays & would definitely recommend;4
Stayed for 10 days in this wonderful hotel. I have zero complaints, the room was large with 2 double beds, very very clean, modern decor, comfy beds, blackout blinds & curtains, windows that open, the room was fitted with everything we needed & more.The bathroom was well stocked & had 2 shower heads, handheld & rain.  We were on the 12th floor across from the elevators which I thought would be noisy but was pleasantly surprised, some street noise can be heard early in the morning & sometimes late at night but this was expected this as we are in the heart of uptown. The location is perfect for walking, subways, restaurants, theatre, shopping and sightseeing.   The staff was the best part of our stay, always professional and at your service. At the front door Jeff was super;5
Only stayed here as it was such a good olace location wise for the New York marathon. However although the hotel is well run, friendly and does the job it's supposed to location wise, I must have been given the worst room possible, location wise. It was like something out of a bad movie scene where the only thing missing was a train line running just outside the room causing it to shake every five minutes. There was NO sound proofing at all, it was like sleeping with the windows open all night, we could hear every shout, siren, engine and noise ALL through the night and also with the added bonus of a giant neon light illuminating the room up every few seconds ! I supposedly had one of the best rooms available too ??  Also the first hotel I've ever stayed in where you had to;3
Stayed here with family and was a good trip. Checking in was quick and seamless we had two double rooms although we asked for a double and a twin room, however, they were not able to provide this as they were fully booked. Surely when we booked they should have told us this and not waited till we were at the hotel??  Rooms were nice but very very small but again only sleep in them so not the end of the world. The bathroom also very small, shower was nice but again small and cramped and no matter how much you tried to keep the water from going out the shower you just couldn't so there was always a soaking wet floor after you had a shower.  Location is fantastic and right near a subway station. Would maybe look for somewhere different next time. But for a last minute place, I'd;4
Use an electric scooter and found this hotel to be comfortable and bathroom large and accessible. asked manager to install hand rails in shower to make it more safe. Hope this happens otherwise folks can fall if they lose their balance. Doormen (Julien and Said) were exceptionally helpful and I needed to use side door as front entrance has steps. also  accessible taxi did not arrive to take me to airport even though I requested it 24 hours in advance. The doorman hustled to find me an accessible taxi and got to airport just on time to catch my plane. Thank you...Doormen were all wonderful and compassionate professionals!;4
It  was a very fine room on 10th floor, excellent and helpful service. The hotel isvery close to metro and times square, My only issue was that aircondition was rather noisy when you were going to sleep;4
I have stayed at this hotel several times, and although it is a lovely hotel, I had decided not to book again after my last visit, due to the level of outside noise that made it impossible to sleep at night.    However, my daughter stayed in the summer and had a room on the 11th floor, which was both quiet and had a lot of natural light. I therefore booked a deluxe double room at  the hotel, and emailed them (three times!!)  asking for a room on the 11th floor or above - so i good get a good nights sleep, prior to travelling home the next day. I had no reply to any of the emails - but hoped that my request would be adhered to. Sadly, i was given a room on the 7th floor, and given an assurance by the reception that it would be quiet! This was not the case - As well as the usual;1
This was my second time staying at this hotel and I can safely say it will be my last. Before arriving I noticed the hotel had charged my card with extra charges. I contacted the hotel and they did sort this out very quickly. Arrived from a red eye flight from Los Angeles & my room was ready at 10am which was a bonus. Room was extremely small (no issue for me) however this hotel has gone down hill since my last stay in 2016. Room was very grubby and even the lamp shades were wonky and dirty. Hair in the bathroom sink and I noticed the hotel does don’t provide sanitary disposal bags for females. Only stayed one night so wasn’t the end of the world. Was woken very early by house keeping banging down my door and unable to get back to sleep as they were extremely loud in the;1
The hotel is well located, clean and the overall value was amazing for me but I had a good discount. The only negative point was the length of bed which was short for me, so if you are a tall person you might have to ask;5
"I had a good stay. The hotel was clean and tidy and well placed for easy access to Central Park, Broadway and Time Square. Jeff, the concierge, was SO helpful; spending time mapping out a route I should walk to take in all the sights.";4
Location great. Service very poor. Staff or desk clerks arrogant as hell. While checking in busy talking with each other no attention to guests. At check out they had the nerves to charge $20 a day for amenities, which amenities!! Early wake up 0500 musician playing trompet!;2
Great location.. clean and close to Times Square . Staff friendly and helpful.  Doorman  (Jeff) friendly and helpful with what/where.. Beds clean and comfortable. Room dark..  but in the back and very quiet.. Make sure to ask for the back side of hotel. street side noisy.  But what isn't in New York!`;4
"Ameritania was a great hotel to stay at for location, price and quality of the room itself. However after nearly 48 hrs without sleep due to work, the specific hotel room I was in had problems with the temperature monitor of the room; every time it would turn on it would make a loud screaching sound. This made it impossible to sleep.";2
The hotel is well placed. You can visit a middtown and downtown on foot without any problem. The breakfest is simple not too many choice. Special thanks to Jeff who take care of our luggage and order us a taxi. The service was on top.;4
My room was clean and comfortable.  Rain showerhead great!  Some people in our travel party had issues with their rooms, but overall the hotel is great.  Nice location, easy to find.  Doorman Jeffrey is  SUPER kind, friendly, and helpful.;4
Great location, comfy clean rooms.Parking was more than advertised, but I guess that is just NYC for ya. Shower flooded and backed up some weren't able to shower to until the next day when it drained in it's own, as we were told maintenance wouldn't be on the property until the following morning. The rooms were small but good for NYC....very loud and can hear everyone in the rooms adjacent to you and outside! We did enjoy our stay and would reccomend.;4
Our thanks go to Andy, Jeff and Hugo for making our stay so special - all of you were great! Had 5 nights in this hotel - celebrating our birthdays (my daughter and I) and were very well looked after. Very comfortable room with everything we needed - ear plugs a great idea!! Very convenient for all the shows we went to see and the shopping too! Had a great time and would definitely go back. Our thanks also to Front Office Manage Voldodomyr Kozak for all your help.;5
The room we had was quite small with a queen bed but it was perfectly adequate for me and my daughter and what I would expect for a hotel in such a great, central location.  All the staff at this hotel are helpful and friendly especially Jeff and his team.  I had a couple of problems with transport and my airline and the Reception helped me out with all of this. WiFi I the room can only be paid with a credit or debit card but it is free in the very comfortable lobby.;5
The Ameritania is a well located friendly comfortable slightly quirky hotel. Right on Broadway and not far from Central Park it is a good base to explore the energy of this city. Our room was a good size with a very large and very comfortable bed. The staff were friendly and helpful - a special thank you to Ali on reception for his help. Our choice of this hotel enabled my wife and I to really enjoy our first stay in the this unique and vibrant city.;5
We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and I’m glad we did. We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights which is an excellent location, room was clean and comfortable which is the most important aspect for us, 3 of us stayed in the room with no problem, I'm not bothered about the size of the room because this is not where we're spending all our time during my holiday so no complaints from us.  The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Majid at the front desk for all his helpfulness, thank you!!  I surely would recommend the Ameritania hotel to anyone visiting NYC;5
We stayed at this hotel on the basis of a friend's recommendation and were really delighted with it. The staff are super friendly, the room was really big for NYC standards and the location couldn't be better. Definitely recommend this hotel without any hesitation. You will love it!;5
The Ameritania is a very nice facility with everything you could possibly need. We were greeted at the door by Jeff, and he took care of my family and I during our stay. The room was very modern and an absolute perfect size for a city like New York. You have comfortable beds, very comfortable actually, and a decent sized bathroom. The bathroom shower is very strong and it had very hot water. Jeff was prompt and helped with the bags, and he also arranged for a car to pick us up on the day of departure. The car took us to LGA for 45 dollars flat, tip included. Very friendly staff. Hot coffee, cold water always out front. 5 stars. See you next time Jeff, for now I'm back in the Alabama pines. And by the way, one of the kids ate the chocolate bar, and the other one is saving it as;5
Fab hotel located near Time Square,Central Park and Subway station.Staff very helpful and friendly the hotel is very clean and modern room was a bit small but didn’t bother me.I would definitely stay here again .;5
Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were most helpful and very friendly. They dealt will any queries calmly. They were also very relaxed with us staying in the hotel lobby long after we had checked out. Fantastic location too. Would recommend to family and friends.;5
Initially we were in a tiny room and thankfully were moved for the last 2 nights, I wished we’d had that room all along, as it was much more pleasant, the cooling in the room worked and the toilet didn’t self flush all night;4
We had two rooms, each with three operational aluminum windows.  We were able to air out the shower steam and get fresh air (one room had window in the bath) which we loved.  The bath had high end Kohler fixtures and sink including both a great rain shower head, and a nice separate hand held sprayer.    The decor was hideous with artwork oddly placed, black patterned carpet and drapes, and gaudy, bright silver tables shaped like tree limbs near the elevators.  The color scheme throughout was red, white and black with 3’ square chandeliers in the rooms.  But really that doesn’t matter.  Everything was well coordinated.  My husband says “decor was kind of kitschy”, son says “funny”.  Except for one window in one room where there was not room for both the Roman shades *and* the;5
The porters were very kind including Jeff he was a lovely warm kind gentleman who made us feel very welcome. Amazing staff, amazing hotel, maids are very clean. Beds were done everyday whilst we were out. The hotel is based right in the city next to Times Square.;5
This hotel is small and friendly in a great location for theater visits. Rooms are small and if you are used to a  queen or king bed you may want to check your booking as our bed was a double . Very comfortable though.;3
Fantastic hotel located just near Times Square. Small rooms but it's what you'd expect in such a great location! Very clean rooms and quite modern. Shout out to my man Jeff the concierge. Very polite and helpful!;5
Mixed comments - location is good for Broadway and Times Square - and easy to get various tube lines to see other places in Manhatten and Brooklynn.  Room was tiny with just enough space to walk around the bed, with a huge mirror propped on the floor and not fixed to the wall, but the room was cleaned every day, thebed was comfy and the shower was good.  Coffee available in the foyer first thing - but not later in the day, and no tea/coffee facility in the room.  In my view - very expensive for a basic room with no breakfast, but it is New York!;3
Top location, clean, comfortable. Staff is super kind.a special thanks to Jeff. Nice prices. We were very happy with our choice. Highly recommended. Hope to come back soon. Wonderful bed and view from the room;5
One of the greatest hotels when it comes to price/location/quality.Great clean updated rooms with wonderful beds. They offer room service, mini bar and snack bar in room. Easy check in and check out. Parking less than a block away.;5
We had an awesome stay at your hotel, and Julian helped us very nicely, including advice on cool stuff to do. The rooms and beds were very nice and we'd love to come back! The only issue we had was that the room cards got wiped a couple of times, but they were easily replaced. Thanks for the awesome place to stay!!!;5
I arrived before check in and was greeted un-enthusiastically by the guest services agent at the time and then was pointed in a general direction which I assume to be towards the bellman who then left the bags on the trolley in the middle of the lobby and went to do other things... I am not normally paranoid with things like this but there were large groups etc and anyone could really just take my backpack or luggage.   Jeff the bellman however was superb, he was such a help with directions and suggestions and even ordering us a ride to the airport etc. he definitely turned around the experience. Unfortunately, Jeff was not there when we were leaving and the bellman at the time insisted on receiving a tip for opening the door for me and was quite rude when I apologised for not;3
This was my first time staying at Ameritania, and my stay could NOT have been better! Maura and Tiffany were both wonderful upon check-in, and recommended the best place to go for pizza in the area. (Shout out to Luigi's!) The rooms themselves were unbelievably comfy, and the beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. To top it off, Said went above and beyond in helping us with our bags and hailing a cab for us.   I'm just very impressed with the service here.;5
Very good Location, but small rooms with things that did not work: air conditioning, w.c., etc.Some People in the staff were friendly but others not.The Price off the rooms is good, but we will not go back.The Overall experience is not worth it.;2
We have just returned from a fantastic stay on NYC. The Ameritania is ideally situated for sightseeing. The staff are friendly and helpful. They upgraded our room as our stay was my sons 18th birthday present and there was a little birthday cake in our room on arrival. Rooms are very comfortable and stylish and are cleaned every day. Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
Stayed for 5 nights for our Honeymoon in May.  Great hotel, for us being so close to Central Park made the location perfect.  Hotel upgraded our room, as it was our Honeymoon, which was a lovely gesture.  The doorman Jeff was really helpful, and enjoyed having a chat with him, especially him being a Londoner.   Coming back to NYC in 2020, so will hopefully stay again.;5
We were for the first time in New York and were very impressed abou this big city. So we felt super comfortable and very well catered at Ameritania at Times Square. Everone from the hotel were very friendly and it was all clean and tidy. We have enjoyed our stay very well.;4
Check-in was very quick  beds were very comfortable and bathroom was excellent with big spacious shower we were on 10th floor and didn't find the street noise a problem safe battery low warning was on and after a quick visit to reception someone was there within 5 mins to fix it. great location for getting around everywhere. The doormen Julian and Hugo were both very helpful at giving us directions and great tips on places to eat. room was cleaned everyday of our 6 night stay only complaint I had was that there was no kettle in room for to make tea in room when returning after a long day out however tea and coffee are available free in breakfast room in the morning  I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and will be recommending it to friends and family thankyou for making;5
The beds were comfy and the overall experience was wonderful.  Be mindful you are in the heart of Times Square and there is a lot of traffic (car and pedestrian) but the staff at this hotel make all the difference!  Jeff, the doorman, was so nice and down to earth.  He made great restaurant suggestions and was super helpful with transportation options.  The housekeeping on level 10 (floor) was awesome too. She always had a smile and was so efficient!  Thanks for making our trip more like home.;5
My partner and I stood here during our visit to New York, we were looking for some thing simple & close to the heart of the city and this location was it .The decor was lovely really modern, Red is my favorite color so the lobby did not disappoint. The front desk staff was very professional and every one was really nice, including the engineer who came to fix the ac (it was a hot New York week) and made conversation and suggested some areas we could visit in lower Manhattan, Adinson was very helpful. Overall we had a pleasant experience especially after the air conditioning was adjusted ! I would recommend the Ameritania to anyone looking to stay in the city, the pricing  was far especially for it proximity to Times Square.;5
Amazing hotel! Everyone was so sweet! The check in went so smooth and the same was for the check out. Maura, Majid, & Tiffany, thank you guys so much for all your  help! You guys where great! Location is great. The hotel is very clean.;5
The hotel was really nice and friendly especially Jeff, the doorman, that has many tips where to go and to transpor. He have a lot of suggestions so don't be shay. In addition, the location was great,  and the room was nice and cosy.;5
"this is truly a 3.5 star hotel down to the spec. The location of the hotel is just amazing its got some great staff but in the end its not a 4 or 5 star experience. Lets start with breaking down all the good. Location, this place is literally a few minutes between multiple stations with the closest being >2 minute walk. It is literally around the corner from the Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert. Note worthy food close by include (>10min walk) Halal Guys, Original Soupman (Seinfeld), McLaren's bar (HIMYM) and a great stall outside for Lamb Gyros! 24/7 convenience stores. Finally it is a 10 minute walk to the heart of times square.  The hotel is dated but clean; its staff are really nice and were always eager to help. Shout out to Jeffery the door man got me and the wife to";4
Pro - Excellent Location, Reasonable price, Walking distance to almost everythingCons - Broken Clock, Previously Leaked ceiling -> Might be just my roomSummary, if the price is right, it is a good place to stay for leisure;4
Everything seems to be okay and is not too much costly for a hotel near Time Square, but some facilities look a bit old like an AC sounds like a car, luckily the temperature is comfortable and we can just turn it off, otherwise may be a trouble.;5
Stayed here on a sightseeing trip of New York and the location of the hotel was excellent and was in walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and the bus sightseeing tours. The room was comfortable but slightly noisy throughtout the night however this is to be expected being in such a central location.   The staff were excellent and very friendly and continually went out of their way to help us, especially Jeff and Adam.;5
The service was good, I like the guys at the door, funny and helpsome. And at night we went to the bar and Javier served us. If you don’t live here go here anyway because Javier is the best bartender in town!?;5
5/5⭐️ Javier is the best, nicest and funniest bartender in NYC! Come here even if you don’t live here! He will make your trip a lot better. The cocktails are really nice and his laugh makes the visit worth the stay!;5
I always enjoy staying at the Ameritania Hotel.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  A great location and value.  hotel is walking distance to Broadway Theatres, shopping, Central Park and Times Square.;5
We really enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania Hotel. The staff was just so accommodating and friendly. Javier and Andy were a pleasure to chat with behind the bar. The front door staff was always happy to help us navigate the city, and the front desk was available to help at all times.We've got a new favorite place to stay in NY!Thanks all!;5
Friendly front desk staff help offset the length of time it takes to grab an elevator! Seems to be a favourite of school tours, so the lobby is usually quite busy. Our room, albeit small was very clean and the shower was fabulous. A great location for Times Square and the theatre district. There’s a Starbucks across the street if you prefer over the hotel breakfast (which we didn’t partake of) Have stayed here twice and will probably go again.;4
Hotel was reall good, booked a king room and my girlfriend loved the decor! Bathroom in particular had a great walk in shower. The hotel reception and bar area is really nice and it is good to have a water fountain with the city being so expensive for people from the UK! The location is top drawer being in between times square and central park it is a great starting point for the trip. Meant we barely had to use the subway for what we wanted to do except when going to lower manhattan/brooklyn.   The only disappointing bit is that we booked the room which included wifi yet the signal was so poor we had none the whole trip. it was the last room 412 on the fourth floor so must of been too far from the router.   Anyway, a great hotel at a reasonabale rate, would definitely return.;4
Stayed here for one night while my mom and i were in New York. The lobby was very nice and the staff was very welcoming especially with letting us leave our bags before check-in. We got into our room and it was extremely small, we didn’t need much space but it was shockingly small. The room was very clean and nice set up for the size. Check out was easy but when we went to pick up our bags later in the day to head to the airport it took about 5+ minutes to find our bags, which was frustrating since we were in a rush.;3
We stayed three nights at the Ameritania in September.  The price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area.  Our flight was delayed getting into NYC--instead of arriving at 6:00 pm, we arrived at 1 am.  We called the hotel from the airport about our late arrival and there were no issues checking in late.  Everything was ready when we arrived and the front desk even directed us to a great café down the street for a quick bite.  The rooms are not large but they are clean and comfortable.  The walk-in shower in the bathroom was great.  As far as the staff, everyone was friendly and very helpful, especially Movrad who went out of his way to make sure we knew how to get to the subway, made sure we had taxi service when needed and was overall just very helpful.  This;5
Tried several hotels in NYC, but this one was the best so far. Room newly fixed up and clean, incl. bathroom. My room was larger than the ones I had before in other hotels in that quarter (it's NYC - the most rooms in this price range are between 8 and ca 18 sqm). Nicely situated at 54th/Broadway (therefore quite noisy outside). Bed was better than my own! Service was perfect and very friendly, booked a shuttle for us (Mourad) which worked perfect. Try a local beer at the bar with perfect service by Javier. Will come back next time! Note: There is no free Wifi in rooms and floors, only in the lobby (Wifi in rooms costs 10$). Can get breakfast buffet for 18$ without previous notice.;5
This hotel is really cute and has a great location, just above 54 Below (formerly Studio 54). You can usually get a  great weekend rate here as well. Bring earplugs bc if you face the street it is NOISY. But if you're traveling to NYC you should always have those in your travel bag! Good martinis and other cocktails in the bar - nice atmosphere.;4
This was our second stay at the Ameritania. The first was spoiled by local construction work however this time it was peaceful. The rooms had been refurbished and it is now a very smart hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The small bar was a nice place to have a cocktail or beer before bed. I felt the breakfast was expensive but there are so many places close by for bagels etc.;5
Overall very well presented hotel which was very comfortable. The staff were very helpful and friendly, thanks go to Vladk and Maerad who gave us advise on getting metro cards and how to get around New York;4
"Arriving at the hotel the Portier Jeff  made sure we have a great start in our vacation. He was one of the best employees I’ve ever seen. He gave us a lot of recommendations and made us smile every day. A nice young guy at the front office helped us finding some places in the city, especially how to get to the Yankees stadium and when to be there. The hotel has a great location. The room was clean and had a huge bathroom. There where earplugs next to the bed, as you are in the city that never sleeps;) Also there are enough cosmetic products. WiFi worked perfectly in the room and the whole hotel! It was my 5th stay in New York and the next time I will stay again in Ameritania!";5
As a part of celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary my wife and I stayed in the Ameritania and have to say we loved every minute of our stay. The hotel is small in comparison to others, but it is spotless, the rooms are good and the staff were excellent. I read a review that one patron said there was no television reception, I can only say that he didn't know how to work the tv and guide. I had no issues with the US guides and I'm from way out of town. The breakfast buffet is well worth the extra couple of dollars and the staff were very accomodating. Javier the bar-tender is a genuine guy who likes to engage with customers from a human perspective, rather than seeing them as a tip machine. Excellent at his job, Javier likes to make patrons feel at home and we both enjoyed his;5
Courteous front desk greetings, extra washcloths/soap quickly received, and very willing to store luggage/request cars. Jeff, Tiffany, and several others were beyond helpful during our September girls' trip the weekend after Labor Day. We arrived before check in and were able to store our bags with no stress. The room was spacious enough for 4 travelers, and we slept great each night. The shower with two nozzles took some getting used to, but we really enjoyed our stay. The only slight issue was that it wasn't quite as close to our Broadway theaters as we had hoped, but that was on us for not researching. (Still walkable, just not right with the theaters.) We would definitely stay again!;5
We got off to a bad start when we arrived after a Trans Atlantic flight! Our room air con was very noisy and there was no alternate room or engineer available to fix it. The duty Manager handled the situation extremely well to ensure our ongoing comfort and enjoyment. He moved our experience from 2 Star to 5 Star.;5
Just two days in this hotel and the review cannot be positive: Upon arrival safe not working,  WiFi  difficult to instal and you have to pay for it,  there is a lot of noise in the street and the room is not at all isolated from the sound: needed ear plugs all night. Today at 16:30 I arrived to rest before going to a Broadway show and the room had not been cleaned!;2
Our initial Deluxe room was not as we expected, with an aircon unit right outside the inward-facing window. However, the friendly staff arranged for a different room and our luggage was moved across to a larger room with 2 outward-facing windows the next day. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The position is ideal for Times Square, Central Park, and subway options for getting around. All the staff were helpful, notably Janet & Tiffany.;4
We stayed at the hotel in an excellent location in midtown Manhattan, and after a day we asked to upgrade the room to a larger room and our request was answered. Spacious rooms, very clean, we received guidance and assistance from the reception staff. Includes a large deluxe taxi reservation to the airport. Definitely a recommended place;5
Location, location, location!  Clean, comfortable beds and pillows.  Fridge in room.  Doorman/concierge Jeff is 10/10.  First time ever booking a trip through Expedia where early (we only arrived 1 hour prior to check in time) check in was not available.  This was a minor inconvenience as we were able to do the paperwork and leave our bags.  Front desk staff could have been more pleasant.;4
Me and my partner stayed here for 4 nights. We found it to be clean and welcoming. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Jeff was very helpful with advice and carrying our bags. He also arranged for our cab rides when required. A real testament to the hotel. Will be returning one day;5
This was our second stay at the Ameritania, having stayed there for two weeks at Christmas 2016.  Why do you come back?  Because you are happy to do so!  This hotel is in a wonderful location adjacent to Broadway and an easy walk to Times  Square or Central Park in the other direction.  The subway is nearby and there’s a great deli for cheap breakfasts or meals just down the road.  The rooms are comfortable although ours was a little noisy this time being on the front of the building.  Well that’s New York anyway isn’t it?   Noisy 24/7!  I did wonder if the window was double glazed though.  Apart from the fabulous location, what makes this place special for us is the staff.  Tiffany on reception was very pleasant.  She helped us out with any questions we had with regard to;4
Spent four nights, stayed in king deluxe corner room, two windows.  Very spacious room by NY standards. Comfy bed, great rainfall shower. Quiet, never heard a neighbor. Can’t beat location if you want midtown/ Broadway/Central Park/ Times Square, etc. Metro stops very close by- had easy trips to Brooklyn, Battery Park.  Best of all, Tiffany at front desk was excellent. Friendly, professional and went out of her way to accommodate us. All staff were great, but she was a shining star!;5
What a fantastic hotel experience. My daughter loves musical theatre and what better way to celebrate a 16th birthday than a broadway show in NYC. When we arrived in New York Saturday morning I suspected our room wouldn't be ready yet. The bellman happily checked our bags and off we went. Upon returning we could now check in. The woman at front desk completely engaged in conversation with my daughter, making her feel special. She was great. (I don't know her name as I never saw her again, but she was once in theatre as well). When we got to the room the hotel had a surprise for my daughter. Knowing it was her birthday they had a balloon and a cupcake waiting for her. It's these small details that make a world of difference in taking a good experience and making it great. The;5
We came for a Yankees game and some site seeing for mine and my husbands 7 year anniversary. The air conditioner broke in the middle of the night and we were not even offered a discount. I understand that they could not switch is in the middle of the night and it was not technically their fault but it was not my fault either. None of the staff were friendly. The breakfast was not worth $18. Nothing really special, absolutely no view in the rooms. Not worth the cost of the hotel.;3
Stayed here for 5 nights in September to celebrate my 30th Birthday and we weren’t disappointed. The majority of the staff were friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much. I must give a special mention to both Jeff and Javier who were fabulous. Javiers cocktails were fantastic and such a lovely man who made my birthday evening special.   The hotel room was spacious (we paid for a delux) and the bed was HUGE, much to our surprise as we had been told NY hotel rooms were always small. Th decor was great, a few bits in the room which had seen better days and were a bit tired but this didn’t spoil the overall stay.   Location was perfect and I would certainly stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the city.;4
Had an amazing stay at the Ameritania and would definitely return and recommend to anyone that wants to stay in New York. The room was spacious the bed even more so and loved the rainfall shower. The decor of the lobby was really nice and the whole experience was made even better by Jeff who has to be one of the nicest guys you could ever wish to meet! Amazing city, amazing hotel and amazing holiday, thank you New York!!!!;5
We very much enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania Hotel in August. We were there for the Billy Joel concert at MSG and saw Beautiful the next day. Location was perfect. Loved the personal touch with all the staff. Thank you to Vladi, Javier, Hugo, Garrett and Adam.  Sorry if I missed noting others.  We had such a great time last month that we will be returning this month again.  This might be our home away from home.  See you next week, Thank you,  Lance and Michele.;5
A great location.  Good value for the city.  Small but clean rooms and nice people  I stay here regularly and will continue to use and recommend this hotel.  You cannot find anything comparable for the price and the location is probably one of the best in Manhattan.;5
Stayed for a few days with friends. Perfect location, just round the corner from Times Square. Room a little small but clean and shower was lovely and big. Doorman Jeff helped us out getting to the cruise terminal on our last day. Would recommend this to friends as a place to stay in NYC.;4
hotel was clean and we had a good nights sleep. very central for us and doorman always gave directions if asked. we did not need any more than this as we were not there to see hotel.breakfast very expensive so we never ate there;3
Recently stayed at the Ameritania Hotel in NYC to celebrate my birthday with my daughter.  Had a wonderful time as usual. This is an annual trip and we always stay at this hotel. Conveniently located and competitive room rates.  Room was spacious and staff great. Had especially excellent service by Jeff and Julian storing our bags at check in and check out while we saw the sights!  Thanks again for a great experience.  See you next year! :);5
Vlad set the tone with our initial meeting while checking in. He was professional, welcoming, and friendly! We felt special the minute we met Vlad and the rest of the team followed suit! I highly recommend the Ameritania Hotel!!!;5
Jeff was extremely helpful!!  Be sure to ask for him!!!  He was so nice and made us feel so welcome!! It is a really nice place!! It was clean. The hotel is not far from anything. And the price was within limits.;5
My wife and I stayed in this hotel for three nights and would have no hesitation in returning.  Initially we were dealt with someone called Vlad who was absolutely excellent.  He knew it was our 10 year wedding anniversary and upgraded our room and arranged a complementary bottle of champagne.  None of this we asked for he just arranged from his own back.  As this was our first trip to New York as well he took the time to make some recommendations of places to visit and eat and marked the locations on a map for us which really helped us on on our visit.  Later we dealt with someone called Tiffany and she was also excellent.  She recommended a tourist package for us in order to get the most from the city and nothing was ever too much trouble.  The rooms were very clean, spacious;5
This hotel is in a great location - walking distance to many sites and restaurants as well as being near to where my meetings were at Carnegie Hall.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable bed, nice shower and quiet.  I will definitely stay here again.  The only thing missing for me was an in room coffee maker!;5
The hotel is in an excellent location and not far from the subway or Times Square. 5 min walk to both. It really is in the middle of it all. The staff were really friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. The place is clean and had everything we needed ie iron and board, hair dryer etc.   We booked a double room as we figured out we would not be in it much apart from sleeping, I say that tongue in cheek as the windows do not keep out the road noise and the air conditioning unit is like an aircrafts engine running, even when you turn it off you can hear next doors, I’m a heavy sleeper and didn’t sleep well at all, I would be pushing it for 4-5 hrs sleep a night due to this and when I’m gone I’m gone!!   It’s hard to say whether I would recommend as the location and staff were great;3
Great stay. Three blocks from the subway station and close to Broadway shows. Love that the room was quiet, the quest were quiet and the bed was so comfortable. Staff were great and I will return again.;5
I really enjoyed my last minute trip to NYC and the helpful friendly staff at the hotel. I would return again just because of the friendly staff and service I received. Julian helped me with car service back to the airport and it was excellent. He was so helpful and friendly. It was a great location as well.;5
I stayed at Ameritania for 5 nights. Great location, with walking distance to Times Square. The room was very clean, and the staff friendly and ready to answer any questions.  My room was very close to the elevator shaft, which created some issues with noise (very loud banging), however a pair of 33 dB ear plugs fixed it overnight, so I still had good night's sleep. To be honest, the girl at the reception offered to change my room in the last 2 days, but I didn't think it was necessary. It was probably still better than any room facing the street, with all the traffic noise.  As a lot of people are commenting, there is no free wi-fi in the room. Their Internet service provider offers 1 and 3-day packages, but the information about the quality of the service is pretty vague, or;4
The bed was extremely comfortable and the staff most helpful. The bathroom amenities were of high quality, but had to request some more when emptyThe room was a bit dark and humid. Couldn't really figure out how to keep the AC to remain at the same temperature.;4
Adinson Gomez one of the engineers at the hotel, went above and beyond in helping us fix an issue we had with our cable TV. Our stay is not complete but so far it's been good. Overall every employee that we've come into contact with has been outstanding with their customer service.;5
Great location at the times Square, less than 5 minutes walking from the main street and stores in the times square, helpful staff, but has no free wifi in the rooms (only if you pay). Just offer wifi in the main lobby...;4
Rooms are great - very clean, comfortable and well sized. Location is really convenient too, with 2-3 metro stations within a few minutes walk. Staff are welcoming and very accommodating. Will definitely return on my next work trip;4
A nice hotel with a perfect locationThe room was clean and confortable, just what we need.The bell boys were very friendlyVery good to have in the Lobby fresh water to drinkNice enviroment and furniture in the Lobby;5
We had a good time in Ameritania hotel and we were hosted very well by Jeff as he welcomed us with his offer to help and he was suoer friendly. The hotel was also very clean and very good location and a good price for New York.;5
A good hotel with great location close to Times Square. Price worthy. An extra gold star to the door men Jeff for all the help with shuttle transport and great NY tips! We didn’t try their breakfast..;5
My friend and I visited this hotel for a weekend. Front end staff informed us that our room was ready early..a plus. The doorman,Jeff was so very helpful with directions. When I asked him the best way to JFK he told me that they had a car for $65 including tax & tip. We thought that was a great deal and worth it as a cab would have been more with the tax & tip. That price was for CASH only which I did not remember being informed of. We managed  to do cash for the deal price tho. Only one issue with our stay was water pouring from the fan vent. I called the front desk who immediately sent someone up. Apparently 2 floors up had flooded. The problem was remedied and cleaned up quickly. They offered to move us but we only had one more night and the carpet was not wet. We opted for;4
Just wanted to leave a quick review. My Wife and I stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for the recent long weekend. Overall great experience. Hotel rooms are nice, clean but a bit on the small side. We had a room by the elevator which would be a little loud when people would congregate waiting for it. Jeff the Bellman was excellent (very professional) - He helped us with our baggage storage and ordered us a nice flat rate transfer to the airport very quickly. We would stay here again.;4
Very pleased with my two day stay and the price.  Metro nearby.  Staff went above and beyond in helpfulness from front desk person to housecleaning to the bartender.  The lobby bar was a comfortable place to return to out of the bustle of the city to relax in a comfortable and pleasing environment. Will definitely return.;5
Just left this hotel today after a 4 night stay. I wanted something family friendly, central to the city and subway and budget friendly. Knowing NYC is expensive this hotel fit the budget for our family of 4.  The room was as described small, but had 2 full size beds. The bedding was wonderful. Down comforters and comfy. We figured we wouldn't be in the room much  so it was fine. The hotel itself is attached to the Ed Sullivan theater where Stephen Colbert hosts the Late Show and has been renovated nicely. Clean and quiet. Doormen always greet you and we felt very safe. The lobby and bar were never busy...and actually very quiet. Honestly, more like a library than a lobby, so if you are looking to socialize it's not a hopping venue...but if you want to sit, unwind, have a drink,;5
I should point out that this trip was my partner's first time in New York, but my seventh or eighth time in the city, so we wanted it to be comfortable and memorable. Most times I've stayed in NYC I've ended up in a great hotel for a good price with super friendly staff. However, the Ameritania fell short of what I've come to expect from American hotels and American customer service in general.   From the lukewarm-at-best welcome at 9pm on a Saturday night when we'd been travelling all day, to the dingy room with damp patches, it was just a really disappointing experience. The one saving grace was the speed at which front desk managed to dispatch a maintenance guy to our room when we started seeing sparks from one of the electricity sockets.   Good points - It really is a;2
Jeff is the man - professional, courteous, and helpful - he made our trip enjoyable. If you're looking for a clean and reasonably priced hotel in the middle of things, this is your place. The shampoo smells really good.;5
The Ameritania Hotel is a good hotel in mid-town Manhattan. It’s location is perfect, just on Broadway and a short stroll to Times Square.  The room we had was a regular sized NYC hotel room with en-suite.  The only issue we had was with the safe which was placed on the floor of the wardrobe, so you had to lie on the floor to set the code to open and close the safe. We instead kept our valuables looked in our suitcases. All the staff in this hotel were welcoming, helpful and efficient.  For breakfast we recommend Applejacks American dinner which is just up the street from the hotel.;4
My wife and I recently stayed in the Ameritania for our second time and again the service and rooms were brilliant. The hotel is located close to all the buzz and excitement of Midtown but is still suitable to be able to relax in your room.  In addition the hotel and their staff are exceptional, no request is a trouble for them and they will even arrange private transport to any of the local airports for a very competitive price which was a brilliant service arranged by Jeff. We will definitely stay again when in NYC!;5
The location of this hotel is ideal, we love the smaller size and customer service focus of all the staff.  This was our third stay at this hotel and we would definitely choose this hotel over and over.  Jeff the bell hop always goes above and beyond helping with directions, cabs, bag storage, tips about the city.;5
Very nice hotel!The bed was king size and comfortable enough, the pillows were fine. All rooms appear to be exactly the same décor and I loved the enormous mirror .The hotel is just few blocks from Central Park and Times Square;4
Stayed at the Ameritania hotel for ten nights in August 2018. This was our second stay (first time was four night during Christmas 2016). The hotel is located in a good area from which you can easily walk to many interesting places and excellent breakfast spots. Near all the theatres and Central Park. The rooms are a good size and our cleaned daily. The cleanliness was up to standard. Some wear and tear is to be seen but nothing major. There is some noise as there would be next to Times Square but we got used to it by the second night. The staff is so friendly and helpful and attended to all our needs and questions. We would especially like to thank the doorman Said who made us feel welcome with his friendly smile every time we went in and out of the hotel. I would definitely;4
"The hotel is very close to Times Square; just around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater.  After a long journey, we were greeted by a very friendly staff. Every staff member we came in contact with was so welcoming, the doorman were awesome, check in and check out was smooth...it was greatly appreciated.  The hotel was very clean and safe.  The rooms were well appointed with everything you could possible need as a traveler (including an umbrella in the room to borrow..which we did).  The beds were very comfortable and the shower was a huge hit.  Only suggestion would be to ask for a room away from the street.  The car horns were pretty loud, but it kind of added to the ambiance.  Would definitely return to this hotel.";5
We stayed here for our last night in NYC for our Anniversary (09/02/2018).  It was a corner room with a view of W 54th and Broadway.  The space is great and very clean, decors are very nice and the room layout is very smart and cute.  Upon our arrival, the hotel welcome us with a Champagne for our Anniversary.  Staffs are very nice and welcoming.  We love our 1105 room.  It is only 12 short blocks walking distance to Time Square.;5
We were here for 10 nights and it was a great time. The hotel is very good located and has a nice staff. Especially the conscierge Said was very friendly and polite. He answered every question and gave us the best insider tips. We would come back every time.;5
I have to commend the staff. They've been very helpful and accommodating from my arrival and departure - from conceirge to front desk. This hotel knows the importance of customer service and how it ripples through excellent guest experience. They may not be on the top finest hotels you could find in NYC but the staff are truly gems. Well-managed hotel.   Thank you Ameritania! You just earned another loyal guest.   I can't wait to be back.;5
I personally would like to thank Ms.Assia for her extraordinary costumer service she provided to our team where they could communicate 100% in French and enjoyed every minute of the stay. I recommend this hotel for most of French speakers visiting NYC for business or leisure again thank you Assia for all the efforts you did to our group;5
Great hotel, highly recommended. Location is ideal and very central. Rooms were spacious, quiet, well maintained, clean and had all the amenities we required. Staff were friendly and happy to provide recommendations. The only thing needed to make it a perfect stay would be free wifi.;4
"I don't feel the cost of the room meets the value received. My check in process was average but felt it could have been more efficient (notification when room is ready). The room was small with no closet and an outdated air conditioning unit. The housekeeping was poor. I called for an iron, they asked if I looked in the closet (I did not have) and was told one would be brought up. Waited an hour, had to call back same request. Someone finally came and pulled an iron from a bottom drawer in the room; which no one mentioned on the phone. Next day house keeping staff member knocked once I gave a reply and she walked in the room while I was undressed. Service overall not up to par.";2
Shout out to Jeff the bell hop, he was very helpful and great to interact with.  He provided excellent customer service and gave us great tips as to manouvering around the city. He's an excellent asset to the hotel.  The location of the hotel was perfect, close to everything.  The room was clean but a couple of things didn't work in the room such as the fridge, the safe and the window didn't close all the way but that didn't take away from the overall experience. All in all we felt that the price we paid was in line with the room and service we received.;5
We had a pleasant stay at the Ameritania over the Labor Day weekend with our family. Great location. Nice rooms. Pleasant staff. Huge thanks to Jeff for taking care of us and providing  5 ⭐️ customer service!;5
Although the whole could be refreshed a bit, the hotel is perfectly located! 10 minutes from Time Square (shopping, subway, restaurants......), 10 min from the Broadway theatres, all this by walking!!!!! A bit further from Central Park, but everything is around this hotel which makes it a bit a place to sleep over. Affordable and, Ali the receptionist will help you to get around with a smile! Effective and clear. Thanks to them.;4
Walking distance to everything and subway. Jeff was fantastic! Great at directions, recommendations, and taking care of anything you need. Easy to get to subway but also just a $12 taxi to Greenwich Village.;4
Conveniently located at the heart of Times Square and within reach of several Broadway show theaters, Ameritania Hotel is a great place to stay if one considers to be very near these NYC attractions.  Surprisingly despite the busy and bustling streets of NYC, room was very quiet and helped provide a good night’s sleep.  Also commendable were the rain shower (was not able to take photos) and fantastic bathroom amenities.  Recommending this hotel for tourists who prefer to be very near to the sights and sounds of Times Square but would like a little peace and quiet amidst the bustling busy life of NYC.;5
Walkable distance to times square and Central Park. Nice rooms and good service. Jeff left a great impression, very nice and helpful service! The A/C was very loud. We had a power cut but within 2 minutes after calling the desk a worker came to fix the problem.;4
Stayed here for 1 night, 2 adults & 2 kids (big 15 & big 7yo) 2 small double beds. Also the toilet blocked & leaked all over the bathroom floor (it was only wee, luckily) one of those things, but not that good when its 3am & a guy plunging away @ your toilet. It didn't get fixed while we were there but we were out by 8am;3
This hotel is wonderful, stayed here for a couple days. Sort of like a quick getaway vacation. Rooms are great but most importantly is their customer service. I was helped by a young lady named Scarlet Castro. She accommodated me beyond my wildest dreams. She made my stay in Ameritania a memorable one. Keep up the good work.;5
I stayed at Ameritania recently when I was in town for work to attend a convention for my industry. It's really convenient how close to Javitz this place is. The room was clean and the hotel had a nice lobby, which are two important things to me in a hotel. I heard other guests complaining about the room size, but come on, it's NYC, seriously? I was fine with the room size. I didn't spend a ton of time in the room anyway. I'm a NY ex-pat living down South and it had been awhile since I've been to NYC so during my down time I wanted to see as much of the city as I could. I was a little rusty on navigating the subway, so Alaa at the front desk was very helpful in giving me tips on how to get around from the hotel to where I wanted to go. Everyone on the staff I spoke with were;4
We stayed at Ameritania after searching for the right NYC hotel for weeks. We knew we wanted to be central/ close to Central Park and to keep costs down as we were looking to spend our dollars elsewhere and really just needed a bed for the nights we were there as wanted to be out rather than chilling in the room.   The hotel was just that, good location, comfortable rooms, but nothing special - we got what we paid for and to be honest we were happy with that. The air con in the rooms had a mind of it's own and unfortunately it's pretty noisy when it kicks in right outside the window, we slept soundly but if you're a light sleeper one to be mindful of.   We had a room on the 3rd floor right opposite the lifts which didn't disturb our sleep so that was good. We'd upgraded to a;3
Doubting between the 3* and 4* rating, because it was a good hotel for our NY citytrip, just some minor items that might not be a big deal for some guests. So a 3.5* for us :)    The location is great: on Broadway, near different subway stations and Times Square. The staff was also friendly at check-in and check-out. The doorman, Jeff, was a great companion during our wait for the shuttle to take us to the airport. In the end, it was an hour late, but he helped us by calling them, telling us not to worry and taking the time to give us some valid life lessons :)   The hotel itself looks nice and modern, the bed was very soft and there was a great shower, so everything we needed! The minor items that we discussed during our stay: we got a very small room, I think it was about 3m x;3
Hotel ideally located within walking distance to most attractions - about mid-way between Central Park and Times Square.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful.  Room was very clean however I found the air conditioning unit to be very noisy and would cut in and out depending on the room temperature which did disturb my sleep.  Wifi was available in the room but at a cost, (2 devices at $10 per day!), whereas it was free in the lobby which was not ideal for our 2 teenage girls.  The room also did not have complimentary tea/coffee facilities and the restaurant was closed when we returned from an evening out and therefore we was unable to have a tea before retiring for the night.;4
When our cab dropped us on the sidewalk outside Ameritania, we had to trudge our suitcases up the few stairs leading to the lobby. And, the front desk wasn't the friendliest in the world. But after this awkward beginning, there was nothing else about Hotel Ameritania to dis-recommend it: Clean rooms, great beds and fantastic location. Just what you need for a quick sightseeing trip in NYC.;4
Thought this would be a great hotel based on the reviews. Location is great, and not much else. The hallways had a wierd smell on our floor and were old and dated. Room had updated bathrooms, but not much else. housekeeping was adequate on most days. five nights and $1200 later, Im not satisfied.;2
Our group stayed here, and the location was absolutely perfect. Within walking distance of the Broadway shows, dinner and Times Square.  We felt perfectly safe walking around here late at night.  The staff was very accommodating.  The room looked older, but had beautiful updates.  I loved the walk-in shower and the huge mirror in the room.  We had such a good time - would definitely stay here again. We were also greeted by the staff.;5
Visiting from Ybor city, Tampa for a wedding, me and my wife decided to stay a night in the city and came across the Ameritania via the internet. No regrets! The hotel is central all the sights and sounds we wanted to see. We were greeted by hugo Who helped us with our bags and also throughout the day. Tiffany checked us in and let us know we can have our room early even though check in was 3 pm. Super professional.   I surely recommend the Ameritania to anyone in the city!;5
"The room was big and tidy; it was possible to open part of the window, so the air was not as stuffy as it sometimes gets inside a big hotel. The location was amazing, close to the subway, Times Square, and Central Park, yet not so close as to be chaotic outside. We had a great time here!    A special shout out to Jeff who helped with our luggage, and Georgina (sp?) who took care of housekeeping!";5
I was visiting New York just two days ago and I am so thankful that this is the hotel I stayed at. The design of the interior is beautiful, funky, modern, and fun! The staff was incredible! They were personable, light, and extremely kind. Javier at the bar makes some of the best drinks I've had and is knowledgeable enough about his craft to cater to your preferences. Beyond that, he was extremely funny! The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was gorgeous, and this hotel was one of the highlights of my trip.;5
An oasis in the heart of the madness of Times Square!One of the best hotels I've stayed in - anywhere. The staff is helpful and friendly. Best housekeeping staff!!! Clean!Friendly doormen, little bar tucked into a relaxing space with comfy seating, cold water in lobby always filled & chilled, plenty of elevators, no wait check in, hallways spotless, rooms small (it is NY afterall) but they have what you need. Bathrooms clean!! Thank you for the easy on the eyes (and face) lighting!!!!!For those of you driving - there is a drop off zone in front of the hotel (allelujah) and discounted parking in the garage nearby (thank you to the doorman for telling us).What a sweet little place, and what lovely, thoughtful people working there. A great stay!!!!;5
This was our second visit to the hotel - the first being whilst it was undergoing its refit to how it appears today so it was nice to visit when there weren't loads of building works going on. The hotel is smart, welcoming and located very conveniently for a number of subway stations that will get you to the main attractions. The staff are really helpful and Jeff the doorman is a legend - if you need it, he'll sort it - unlike many hotels where the concierge are there just to sell excursions and heavily marked-up tickets. If you need a taxi to the airport - use the hotel service as its cheaper including taxes, tips and tolls than a yellow cab. Rooms are comfy, well equipped with power and USB charging points - including in most bedside lamps and clocks! and a safe, iron,;5
great hotel with a great location within walking distance of the best attractions. very large room with a fantastic bed and shower, great staff always kind and friendly! a special thanks to Jeffry who with his advice helped us in the big apple ...;5
Perfect location between Time Square and Central Park. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Very clean hotel and good space on bedrooms .  Don’t give 5 stars because the floor/carpets needs some fixing and feels old;4
Front desk staff were rude.   I made a booking which clearly advertised free internet.  When i got to my room, they refused to provide it and insisted I had to pay a ridiculous amount to get internet.  Come on guys, its not 2002.  I suggest avoiding this hotel.;1
Great hotel, excellent service, very friendly staff, I advise tourists to go in there, the proportion price service is a great deal, I'm going there again and again, just give it a try, you won't regret;5
Nice Location,  easy walking distance  to  time square ,Broadway shows,  restaurants. The front desk staff was very helpful, the Doorman Jeff was very knowledgeable,he was ready to answer and question you had right then, we would go back again;5
Everyone is super friendly here! Which is huge for me, as I am from the Midwest! Algenis checked me in and was super nice and accommodating! I forgot my name twice (it's been a long work / travel day) and he didn't even judge me. He was quick and went over my expectations of what I'd find in a NYC hotel. Would stay here again. Oh, rooms are super nice and clean too!;5
great hotel great staff very helpful doorman were all great very helpful from places to go booking taxi(Said) to opening doors with a smile. our hotel room faced onto broadway which was great very close for time square and central park lots close by . free tea coffee on morning also cold ice water all the time. rooms great beds made and clean towels everyday showers amazing free safe also ironing board and hairdryers. receptionist great (Reshma) always had a smile from booking us in to us leaving. only thing i would of liked was kettle for an evening hot drink but only small moan . but if you want great stay close to everywhere at amazing price this place is great no hidden costs;5
I chose this hotel as I had read the reviews and it sounded like just what we would like......I was not wrong.  The location was perfect as it was close to Times Square with lots of good places to eat close by. The staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms a good size and spotlessly clean. The room was quiet and beds really comfy, I could not fault it at all. They offer breakfast which we didn't  have but it always looked busy and not badly priced either for NY. I would definitely return to this hotel again.;4
I can't say enough about the friendliness of the staff here.  Everyone from the doorman to the front desk personnel were welcoming and helpful.  The hotel was clean and our room was surprisingly large.  We did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on that.  I was very worried about finding the parking garage that offered the hotel discount (Icon) but it is on the same street and just a short walk from the hotel.  The hotel stored our bags for us before check in and after check out which was helpful.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
2nd time staying here & of course I got the same great customer service as the first time. From front door all the way to my room the customer service was amazing. Thank you to the bell man Hugo and The front desk team Tiffany L and Ali they were all so helpful they assisted me prompt and in a formly manner. Looking forward to staying here in the future again.;5
The hotel was located perfectly for our vacation!! The rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was excellent!  Jeff was the man he took great care of us!!  If we had questions he was there to help out and point us in the right direction. A special Thank you also to Jeff for helping us out when my girlfriend was sick on our day of departure.;5
We stayed here for 5 nights during a recent vacation. The bed and linens were great!! Location was ideal for getting to see the most common tourist attractions. My most favourite part of this hotel was the doorman Jeff, he was incredibly attentive and so friendly.;4
Great Location. Great team member at desk and door. Mourad, Saïd, Marouane are really Professional.  But room cleaning was not Perfect bed sheet had been change 1 time in a week after réclamation  Carpet have To be change.   Good hotel in Manhattan;4
The hotel is superbly located with easy walking distance to subway & buses as well as being close to Times Square, the Rockefeller, Central Park & the MOMA. There is also a great choice of restaurants, diners & coffee shops near by as well as two bars next door. We preferred the hotel bar!   The rooms are nicely decorated with super comfortable beds, big tvs and lovely en suite shower rooms.  Rooms made up daily. All staff very friendly, especially Jeff, the bar man (great cocktails) and the reception staff, who helped us a lot.;5
Nice, clean, friendly hotel at times square.  Jeff was helpful and courteous. Would recommend this place to anyone.  Family friendly.  Rooms are modern style and even offer free earplugs so you can sleep while your wife snores;5
We stayed for 3 nights the hotel has amazing location near everything and have very nice people working in it especially Assia who helped us a lot with the check in and everything also all staff are nice people  I do recommend it;5
Was here for two nights just to get away. Staff went above and beyond. Hugo and Allen could have not been nicer they were very helpful. The location was convenient to Time Square, most of the Broadway shows and Central park . All in all a very GOOD PROPERTY.;5
Excellent location! If you want to experience NYC this is the place to stay. The bellman Hugo was outstanding! Very personable, and knowledgeable of the area. Hotel was clean and a short walk to the subway. Would recommend to family and friends.;5
I stayed at the Ameritania for over two weeks on business and had a fantastic experience. The front desk staff went out of their way to make my extended stay comfortable. Special thanks to Tiffany and particularly Elena, who very generously upgraded my room.;5
I stayed at this hotel for about 11 days, I was upgraded for a king size room when initially I booked for a twin size room. staff is great overall and quite helpful, one of the cleaning ladies was a little impolite for some reason and would not clean the room or take any trash out. other than that, I loved the hotel and it's amazing location to all of NYC's hotspots.  when checking out, I was assisted by one of the staff named Jeff, he was particularly helpful and offered advice in deciding which taxi service should i use and estimated how much it might cost depending on the place I am headed to. All in all, it's highly recommended.;4
To be honest I didn't know what to expect. When we arrived the Jeff and the other ladies behind the desk were super friendly and helpful. We had arrived to the hotel early but they kindly asked us if we wanted to check our bags and use the facilities before we ventured off into the city. The location was great. We were walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. Lots of restaurants and activity in the area. The room and bathroom were fun and stylish. We stayed on the 10th floor and didn't hear any street noise at all. Most importantly the bed was very comfortable. I was impressed with all we got for our money. We will be back for sure.;5
We loved staying here! Ameritania is centrally located. We had a very quiet room and comfortable bed. Loved having staff greet me at the door and open it for me every time I arrived or left. On a hot day, we appreciated the nice cold water that was provided in the lobby. We did not have the coffee/tea that is provided in the morning. It is so nice that the hotel has this service. Another nice amenity was the umbrella that was provided in the room for our use. We will definitely be staying here again!;5
This was our 3rd visit to NY and our second stay at the Ameritania. The hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square and Central Park. Rooms are clean and tidy with nice comfortable beds.  My only niggle was the bar wasn’t open over the weekend, I know there’s plenty of bars in the area but I like to sit in the lobby to have a drink either before going out or on our return, just nice to have the option. WiFi is a bit hit and miss too and only free in reception.   Big shout out to Jeff the doorman. Super helpful with directions to the world trade and the subway routes. Helps with return journeys to the airports too. He’s a credit to the hotel.;4
Would recommend this hotel it’s in a great location and customer serves is really good they give sum a free bottle of wine for our anniversary and a corner view room, bed is also very big and comfy.wifi was pretty good 2;5
I've stayed at this boutique hotel twice and enjoyed both stays. The rooms are on the smaller end but very functional, clean, & comfy. No complaints. Close to Broadway and within 10 min from Madison Square Garden. I would definitely stay again.;5
I spent 3 nights at The Ameritania last month, and as usual, I had a great stay! Everyone was very kind, pleasant and helpful, save for one desk clerk - but she NEVER is! 🙄 But, Huge shout outs to front desk favorite Algenis, who has been wonderful during my last 2 stays, and on the phone as well! Always goes out of his way to be kind, pleasant and helpful! Also doorman Jeff and staff - always pleasant and wonderful!  The housekeeping team also were very nice and accommodating too!  Love the rooms, comfy beds and convenient location for my needs!!;5
We stayed at this hotel recently for 4 nights, chosen because of its proximity to Broadway and Times Square as well as Central Park. Upon arrival we were looked after by Jeff, as well as initially looking after our bags and giving us enough instruction to enjoy or first day in the city he made it a welcoming start to our break. As I said we picked the hotel as it was near lots of must see attractions. Following Jeff's directions we saw a lot in only a few hours. When we returned we had a room assigned and as we arrived at the 11th floor so did our bags, the room was smallish but totally adequate for the trip, when your in NYC you don't spend much time in your room anyways and it had a great bathroom with large walk in shower. The air con was a little average as the blind came;5
Nice and clean rooms in a very central location.  Great staff, Jeff helped me in organising my transfer to the airport and was really kind and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back here when in NYC;5
Stayed with two adults and two teenagers for a couple of days. Room was quite small and required some improvisation to manage the lugage and 4 people. Bathroom was updated and clean. As mentioned by others already, the doormen are very friendly and helpful. So before checking in you already start with a positive feeling. Location is ideal as Times Square, 5th Ave or Central Park are in walking distance. We were not impressed by the breakfast offering, however there is a good pret a manger just across the street. For Diner you might even consider Whole Foods just a couple blocks away.;4
I've stayed here multiple times and will do so again. The only problem I encountered was the housekeeping staff missed my room one day The staff is very friendly and eager to help. I would definitely book this again on a return visit.;4
"The hotel is between times square and central park and is situated right next to a subway stop that heads straight to downtown New York. The rooms were a good size and kept very clean. All interactions with employees were very pleasant; Jeff in particular went above and beyond to make sure we settled in quick and made the most of our week in New York.";5
The rooms are small, so if you're looking for large rooms, you might be surprised. But they're very comfortable, very clean, and well apportioned for typical needs - including an umbrella in the closet you can borrow. Quite a thoughtful touch. The bed is excellent, as is the location. Very good weekend rates for Times Square. Highly recommended.;5
The Ameritania is located less than a 5 minute walk to the center of Times Square! Check in staff and the doormen were amazing. Nicely furnished (red) lobby and bar area looks really cozy as you enter the hotel. Our room was a double, as we were traveling with our two small kids, and the only thing even close to a downside would be that the room seemed really small, when outfitted with the two beds and a small desk. Everything seemed freshly updated and trendy. Great value too, for its location. With a little more “elbow room” in the room we got, this would be a 5 star review!;4
Good hotel, friendly staff...   Very good location for both Times Square and Central Park.  Tube station is just across the road.  Jeff, the doorman was particularly helpful, organising taxis, etc.  Thanks  John & Donna (from Scotland);4
A perfect stay, our room was immaculate and very comfortable. A perfect location too just 5 minutes from Times Square.  The staff were so helpful, especially Jeff who sorted our taxi to JFK much appreciated.  Thank you all at Ameritania Hotel.;5
Jeff was amazing from the moment we arrived and continued all the way to getting us a taxi when our stay was over. He really went above and beyond to make sure we got to our destination! The staff was wonderful, thanks again we had the best time in nyc!;5
This is a gem of a hotel. Our stay at the Ameritania was impeccable. The staff were friendly, attentive and incredibly helpful. The room was comfortable and spacious for New York City. Even though the hotel is located in the heart of the action we found it to be a quiet oasis. I highly recommend this based on value for money and will be back again for sure.;5
My baggage did not make it so I was left with no clothes or toiletries. Hotel did not have even the little basic disposable  emergency toothbrush for guests.  Cannot use electronics in your room as WiFi is free only on the lobby.  Breakfast costs $18 and really is a poor attempt at a;3
We had a great stay here for our NYC trip.  Room and facilities were clean and location is great.  We were impressed by the size of our room and amenities in our room. Close proximity to lots of things and close Metro stop.  We would stay again for sure.;5
We had a great stay at the Ameritania! The staff were all friendly and helpful. Room really clean and good space. Very comfortable bed. Iced water was always fresh and full. Convenient location. Love this place!;5
Had a great stay at this hotel. Nice hotel staff, perfect location and everything was very clean. Our 2 person room was kinda small, but we didn't mind, cause we were only there to sleep. House cleaning was excellent and everything was close by.;5
Today is our first day in the hotel. From the begining we were really bad receptioned. A couple of weeks before we asked.for a crib as we are traveling with the whole family and our 11 month old daughter. The receptionist had zero sensibility with my wife carrying the baby and was really stupid with her. In the end of the day we are still without the crib, we completely lost our first day of vacation trying also to find out an inflatable tub for giving the baby a bath.  The baby is now slapping on the floor in a bed sheet.  No security and filthy floor.;1
We were able to get this hotel for less that $200 / night in Times Square.  Our room was pretty small but I think that's to be expected for the location.  The hotel staff was great.  I felt like the location was secure and they were very friendly.  It's not super glamorous but very nice.  The only bad thing about it was the fitness center.  It's in the basement with no air conditioning so it was like working out in a sauna.  Also, there were no clean towels or equipment wipes and the floor didn't look like it had been vacuumed in awhile.;4
Spent 3 nights in hotel, excellent location for Times Square And Broadway. Negatives were that we were allocated very small room in fact would describe it as tiny, limited space for hanging clothes, had to live out of suitcase, one bedside lamp and hit bed trying to manoeuvre round it to get to toilet. Outlook was poor at back of hotel and extremely noisy with cooling fans operating all night. Would avoid room 421 at all costs.;3
Here for a one-day trip to see Steven Colbert, and just fell in love with the staff! Scarlet, Jeff and our awesome bartender, Javier (el asesino de cocteles!) were just awesome. Would def come again. Thanks!;5
Thanks to everyone at Ameritania, we have an perfect stay al NYC, it was really amazing. The location is very good, near to Central Park and to Times Square. and the personnel was very kind, especially Jeff.  Thanks to all.;5
That is my third time at Ameritania ! And unfortunately this time was not what I was looking for!  The wifi did not work. The room was  not clean.  The sheets... i was expecting to have at least a bed very weel done !! Not the case and to finish Last night They forgot to leave bath towels and I had to use small ones!! Not nice at all. Will be difficult to come back!;1
We stayed here between 11th and 18th  July the location on 54th st  is excellent for almost everything few minutes walk to times square in 1 direction a few minutes walk to central Park in the other direction right in the middle of the theatre district and the reasturant district 2 minutes walk from 59th st subway  Apart from the excellent location our  room was excellent we stayed in room 415 the room was serviced every day and a mini bar was always avalable there was complimentery tea coffee and ice cold water avalable at reception we never used the bar or reasturant  The reception staff were always  very helpful and welcoming and I must make a special mention to to the bellman Jeff who gave us a map and pointed out where we were and the best way to get to places of interest;5
We stayed at the Ameritania end of July. The doormen didca great job. They can take care of your questions. Jeff, Julian and our Morrican friend (name?) did tere very best. At the reception they also really wanted to help. Room was good, location is realy good!;3
The hotel was in a great location for site seeing. The rooms were clean. I wished there had been either coffee in the room to make, or coffee in the lobby for early departures. The bed wasn't that comfortable, and lumpy. The staff was very nice. We were not able to hook up to the WiFi in the room. The cost would be an extra $10.00 to do so, which wasn't a lot if it worked. Most hotels offer free WiFi these days. It was a comfortable stay.;4
When I returned home I had to visit a doctor who confirmed that I had BED BUG BITES. When I emailed the hotel the manager said thanks for letting us know and dismissed my concerns. DO NOT stay here. It has been a week of red swollen itchy hives that are just now starting to go down.;1
I had a good experience at your hotel.  An employee named Julian was always very friendly and helpful.  I do wish that your hotel had a few more amenities, such as free coffee to guests, and a vending machine.;4
I've been from Tokyo, Saigon, Seoul to London, Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and Crotia.  I'm 69.  Never been to New York City.  So this was a big deal.  My wife, who hadn't been to NYC since she was 16, found the Ameritania on a general search (Trip Advisor included).    She couldn't have possibly picked a more strategic and friendlier place.  From entry to exit, the staff was helpful, friendly, curteous, kind....  People like Assia who helped walk us through the procedures for our first NY subway experience.    Now, when we first checked in we were assigned 922.  You don't want 922.  It's the size of a walk-in closet with a single window view of three brick walls.  When the guy brought up our luggage walked in, he called the front desk and asked for a reassignment which occured the;5
My colleague and I stayed for two nights and had a great experience. The hotel is centrally located, the staff are super friendly and care for your needs. We had an issue with our reservation that was fixed in minutes with a sincere apology for the confusion. I would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting NYC.;5
The hotel is in a central location (couple blocks from times square), decorated tastefully throughout. check in and check out was simple with lovely front desk staff. the room itself was a bit on the small side for a double/2 adults, however, this is quite normal for central manhattan. comfy bed, clean modern room, mid range price wise, I wouldn't definitely return.;4
Toilette was not flushing. Airco too loud, room small and dirty. reception forgot two times to make Theatre reservation. No apologize for all the trouble.  Location is very Central in the Theatre district.;1
The hotel is correct, the staff is very nice. Julian at the front door is very nice and helpful. Even if the rooms are a little bit small they are clean. The hotel emplacement near Times Square and Central Park is a very good point.;4
Great location for tourist visit, subway very handy (much cheaper and quicker than a cab and easy to use !!) and very helpful staff on front desk and the door staff !! Rooms good size for NYC......you are never in the rooms other than to sleep.;5
The room was ok, about the same size as other New York hotels I have been in. The doorman/bellhop service was terrible! Not that I find opening the door and being greeted a huge deal, but when I’m paying for it, not leaning against the door and blowing smoke in my face is appreciated. The bed was excellent and location would have been better if the station near the hotel hadn’t been under repair( not the fault of hotel in the slightest). Overall good experience if you are more interested in being in the city than the hotel.;3
"Ok- the room was rather small but it is NYC but... a large bathroom.  It was very clean and just what we needed for our 2 night stay. A wonderful location in midtown . What makes this hotel a lovely place to stay are the people working here.  A big ""thank you"" to Jeff at the door and Tiffany at the desk for making us welcome from minute one and answering questions and offering helpful advice. We would absolutely stay here again!";4
Our first time in the Big Apple and having travelled an extremely long distance from Melbourne Australia, we couldn't have picked a better hotel.   We stayed 11 nights on the 11th floor in separate King Deluxes which we booked when the 40% off special was on and they were perfect for our needs.   The rooms were at the back of the hotel which was quiet enough for me to leave the aircon off and open the windows which was a rare find in a hotel. The bed and pillows were magnificent and we overcame kicking the corners of the bed frame by placing a face-washer on them which made them more visible when walking past.  (Maybe management could consider painting the corners white as it sure hurts when you hit one which many reviewers have done as the they stick out and blend into the;5
Extremely tiny room. Very noisy. Extremely uncomfortable. Unbelievable nightmare hotel Experience. Plus I have just been charged 5.44 usd although i didnt use anything from the minibar but really it is worthless to remember this bad experience so i wont chase it.;1
Just home from our stay in New York. Hotel is beautiful. Very modern and rooms big with a beautiful bathroom and very good air con. Thank you to Jeff the door man, helpful guides every morning and told us what the weather was to be like and told us what was good too see. Kids loved the candy Jeff thank you! Also the other door man from casa  Blanca, thank you too! Times square a short walk away and very close to subway stations. Maid service every day and fresh towels. Hot and cold water also available at all times.  If we were to return to NY this is the hotel we would choose again.;5
Convenient yet peaceful.  Well located in between heart of times square and union square.  Nice staff and clean comfy rooms.  I had deluxe king which I recommend.  Walkable to shows and restaurants.  No need for cabs too much unless going downtown.  Metro stop nearby.;5
Had a great stay at the Ameritania. Staff were super friendly, room was very nice, and the bed was amazing. They have a nice little bar and 24 hour room service if you need. Great location by broadway and a quick walk to central park. Would definitely recommend.;5
Had the best stay at the ameritana on 54th Street, staff were very kind and approachable especially Jeff, as soon as we entered the hotel to the minute we left he was nothing but pleasant and helpful with tips on where to go, eat and visit! Room was just right for us, plenty of space and the bathroom was perfect shower was huge! We had a beautiful room and the air con was loud but when sleeping I didn’t hear it or hear anything from the streets!  Perfect location too! Very central! Perfect stay! 10/10;5
I would definitely recommend this hotel as an economic and nice hotel to use as a base for exploring New York. Reception staff very friendly and informative. Can’t recall the gentlemans name who welcomed us on arrival on tuesday 10th but thanks for your warm welcome. Bellmen very friendly wishing us a great day on our way out each day. Jeff is one particular name I recall being very friendly and helpful.  Our room was very clean. Contrary to what we expected from the hotel literature we did have WiFi in the room. The room also had a safe which is always a welcome addition. The hotel is very handy for 7th Avenue subway station. From there you can take the E line all the way to the JFK air link at a cost of 2.75 USD for the subway (free if you have an unlimited use metro card) and;4
Room and bathroom was clean however no space for a large suitcase.   Room was tiny you couldn’t swing a cat and the air conditioning unit was louder than Times Square even when off the units outside the room were so loud had many sleepless nights.;2
We had flown in on a red eye and were exhausted.  Jeff was extremely helpful taking our luggage and making us feel welcome after the long flight. There is cold water in the lobby and the lobby itself is very comfortable while waiting for our accommodations to be ready.;5
I did a ton of research before booking.  We wanted to be close to Central Park and Times Square and this was a perfect location.  We could walk most everywhere.  Room was clean and bigger than I expected.  Staff were helpful and nice.  Good price for the location.  Breakfast and bar was too expensive and we didn't utilize this.;4
During my visit to New York, I stayed at the Ameritania hotel in Times Square from June 26-29.I am writing this to say how pleased I was with my stay due to the great services of the reception staff member Mr. Algenis.  Mr. Algenis was happy to ensure  that I received everything I needed. I asked of him to book a flight for me and he was more than happy to help,portraying a lot of patience. Mr. Algenis represents great customer service and could be an example to others. Thank You So Much. Ehud Patihi .;4
Very clean and modern property in the heart of midtown. I would give the staff ten stars if I could. Majid, who checked us in after a long hot morning of travel, is a cheerful professional with a refreshing, dry sense of humor. On the day we left, bellman and keeper-of-the-portal Jeff stored our luggage for the day so we wouldn't have to drag it around the city before our return trip. The rooms are on the small side, which only matters if you plan to practice ballet or tai chi* in your room. Otherwise, the rates are astonishingly low for the location and quality.   * They have a fitness center for that, anyway.;4
We just spent a week here and found it fantastic, the room was very clean and modern, and the staff are all super friendly and attentive,  a special mention to Jeff the concierge, if you need help with anything, jeffs THE man   See you again next year.;5
Excellent location, close to Times Square and ,you can walk to Central Park  Jeff the door man is wonderful, very helpful and knowledgeable you can ask him  anything about New York  The only down side was the bar, we went down on the Saturday night for a drink Before dinner and found that it was closed Saturday and Sunday night no explanation  why, The free tea and coffee in the morning was a nice touch,but it would have been nice to have a kettle in the room  We would recommend this hotel to friends and family;4
Nice hotel, clean and very comfortable. Central position. On the day of leaving, we asked to the reception for two times to put the ground floor toilette in order because it was blocked but none did it.  It is not good for someone to leave in the last day.;4
Stayed for 2 nights. Perfect location since i picked this out to be as close to Central Park (5 min walk), about 5 blocks to center square, and every subway close by. Lugo, i think his name, was very helpful when i asked to look for an outlet so i can charge my phone. Friendly desk staff & no problem if you show up early & want to leave your luggage so you can wonder around until your check in time. My room was kinda small perfect for solo traveler like myself, but comfortable bed & the bathroom was my favorite part. Also, the noise from outside your room hallway can be loudly heard when there's people talking. Otherwise, i would stay here again since i get corporate discount from work with best value for the money.;4
This is in a great location.  You can walk to almost everything.  We walked there from Penn Station and that was a little long but the subway is right there so you would not have to if you don't want to.  Grant Park is very close and we rode bikes all through the park.  The staff is friendly and it is right next door to the theatre where they film the Tonight Show with Stephen Colbert.  My room was big for New York standards.  It was all pleasant;5
It is a great place to stay, clean, quiet, comfort. Close to time square. very conveniently access to public transportation (subway). The price ($150/per night) is reasonable. If someone ask the better place to stay in New York, I like to recommend this hotel.;4
Our room was 815 and was a nice clean room with a nice king size bed.  However, we did have problems with the air conditioning.  We called room service and they immediately sent a maintenance employee to our room.  The employee was the Head of the HVAC system for the hotel.  His name was Adam Ponce.  When Adam arrived at our room he introduced himself to me and my wife.  He shook our hand and we introduced ourselves to him.  I have never met a nicer and more friendlier maintenance employee at a hotel ever.  He told us he would either get the air conditioner working or move us to another room.  As it turned out he was able to get the air conditioner working very quickly and the room cooled down to a very comfortable temperature.  Adam was just a great employee and it was a;5
This is my second time staying at The Ameritania and I would stay again. Perfect location.  Friendly staff.  Nice rooms.  Just make sure you get a laundry bag and price list up front if you need it. (There were none in my room and I asked twice and did not receive after several attempts.);4
I searched many hotels in New York City before picking this one. I am so happy that I was able to find this hotel at a really great rate it was a great stay! The rooms weren't huge but they weren't small either. The room was spotless the bathroom was spotless everything was great! I kind of wish I would have had a higher floor room but it worked out. I didn't use any of the amenities such as the bar or room service only because there were so many choices right next door. The staff was very friendly and very helpful check-in was very simple and easy. This hotel was close to everything  Broadway - Times Square great bars and restaurants. My friend and I stumbled upon a little pizza place in the village where they had $4 cocktails to me that's a win-win for New York City. I really;5
Great location, reasonable price and friendly staff! What more can you ask for? The room was small (not unusual for New York) but clean and well kept. The beds were very comfortable.  I have to say that our stay was made so much more enjoyable because of Aali and Algernis at the front desk and Jeff the hotel porter! They went out of their way to help us! I definitely recommend this little gem!;5
Small but comfortable rooms with all you need. Very nice beds , very clean floor and bathroom.  Very close to Times Square and Central Park.  Highly recommended.  The check in and check out process was very easy and very friendly staff.;5
After a shaky start, we were introduced to Vlad K the manager and from that moment on we had a brilliant stay.  Our room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The porter Jeff was extremely helpful advising us on routes and arranging transport.  The hotel is in a super position and we highly recommend a stay at the Ameritania!;5
We were introduced to the Ameritania from a Hotwire price based promo. Now that we have stayed there, and enjoyed the location, I will definitely check the website for future stays. The rooms while small, were clean, comfortable and quiet. The front desk staff was very helpful and gave us lots of suggestions for places to eat.;5
Lovely hotel, very clean and modern, family friendly and central.  Special mention of staff member Jeff who is the hotel porter. He is professional, friendly and helpful.  Thank you we have enjoyed our visit and would definitely come back!;5
Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July. Rooms are pretty small, but that's not unusual for NY.  Rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. The location is perfect - right between Times Square and Central Park. Booked through the hotel website and got a 40% discount. Would stay here again and would def recommend!;5
Pleasant hotel, conveniently located, reasonable price for New York City. At check-in, we requested adjoining rooms and were assured that rooms 619 and 621 were adjoining. They turned out to be as far apart as two rooms on the sixth floor could possibly be. Loaner umbrella in the room was a nice touch. Staff was very friendly. We skipped the $18 breakfast and found excellent alternatives right around the corner.;3
I celebrated my birthday in New York City which has come to be a tradition of mine and every year I choose a different hotel. The Ameritania was both affordable and very comfortable, stylish, and gram-worthy! We enjoyed the lobby bar and because I love maraschino cherries so much, the bartender even gave me an entire cup of them (ha, ha). The hotel also gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday. Like I said, I always choose a different hotel but the Ameritania makes it hard to want to go somewhere else! I would definitely stay again if I plan to be in Times Square area.;5
Decent price in a great location. Staff were very helpful. Jeff and Vladk are two that come to mind but for us the shining star was Javier at the bar. That man knows how to provide great service and how to make a drink. Would definitely return here.;5
We have stayed at the Ameritania before and have not been disappointed.  Staff are attentive, rooms are roomy enough, beds are comfy, but location beats all! And pricing is not exorbitant. I find the lobby charming, with a cozy little bar and lounge area. We'll definitely be back to the Ameritania.;5
Clean smaller rooms in a great location near theater district and subway stops. Staff was friendly and helpful. Had to drive into Manhattan and they had a parking garage within a few hundred feet that offered a discount for hotel stays. Saved me $50 for 2 days. Only thing they could improve was wi-fi. It cost to have it in room and “free” service in lobby didn’t work very well. I did get a Spectrum “hot spot” signal that I could use to check messages. But I would stay again due to location and price.;5
Hi I'm Ralph Ciaio i was going this hotel this is the best hotel of USA has nice services and system is very clean, I have no word's to explain about this hotel but it's clear this is the best hotel of USA,;5
I spent 4 nights (Mon-Fri) in June at the Ameritania, with my husband and 14 year-old son. I booked directly with the hotel (on their website), during their 40%-off promotion, which was a great deal.   Location: The Ameritania is strategically located in the heart of NYC, in walking-distance of the most popular tourist attractions (like Central Park, Broadway theaters, Times Square, the Rock, 5th Ave shopping, etc.). Two subway stations within a block or two will swiftly take you to the more remote tourist attractions (like the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Wallstreet, etc.). Times Square (which gets very loud and crowded at night) is less than a 10-minute walk from the hotel, meaning it's close enough to walk to the sights, but far enough from the noise.   Noise: It's not;5
Staff was friendly and helpful. Jeff gave us great directions to the most popular attractions and helped arrange transportation to the airport. Room was comfortable and housekeeping was top notch. We were even able to check in early!;5
Good decoration, comfortable bed, enough room space, small but morden bathroom, everything is simple, organized and pleasant. Check in and out won’t take you few minutes, staff are nice and efficient!;5
Good location and easily accessible, helpful front door staff and some reception staff but not all.  The hotel needs a revival especially the rooms . The bathroom set up is not functional. They look the same as my first stay in 1996.;3
Great little hotel in midtown, close to theaters and with very reasonable rates. Fabulous staff who helped with everything from directions to holding luggage before check-in.  Small but clean rooms--all you need when you explore the city all day. Cool bar and lobby displaying contemporary décor.;5
We stayed 5 nights at ameritania hotel last week - King room. We were happy that we found this hotel. Very comfortable beds, close proximity to locations, walking distance to Times Square and Central Park and 5th avenue and Hudson River. Price was good as we booked on hotel’s internet site and there was a promotion. Room size was quite big if you ask me (we had king room, I believe 3 sizes larger than the standard one) . Toilet &shower is quite small but we didn’t mind. Nothing negative about the hotel. Room cleaning could improve though. Sleeping is a bit difficult as it is the New York City. Nothing about the hotel. The rooms smell a bit funny but nothing to worry about. We opened the windows all the time we were in the room.   The only problem we had was when we wanted to pay;4
The room was small but clean. Our room ,908 is dark ,due to limited natural light. The rates of using any of the snacks left in the room are expensive.  We would have apreciated a kettle I  the room to make ourselves a hot drink.There are hot drinks available for free in the dinning room of a morning, without purchasing breakfast but not at any other time . purchasing hot drinks several times whilst away is quite an aditional expense.  Geoff the doorman was particularly helpful and friendly.He clearly knows the city well and doesn't encourage customers to waste their money.;3
Lovely clean rooms. Very helpful staff. Modern design which isn’t to my taste, but when you’re out and about all day, it doesn’t matter! Bed is like sleeping on a cloud! Bar man was very friendly. Would use again.;4
From the modern decor in the lobby, to the very nicely appointed rooms we had a very lovely stay. Room with two double beds was quite large for NYC. Conveniently located for easy walks to Times Square, Central Park, Grand Central Station and subway stops for all points farther out. Hotel staff was friendly and very helpful! Highly recommend. Found a great discount rate through an knline search.;5
I enjoyed staying at this hotel, the decoration is very stylish, I really loved the room interior and the bed was so comfy. Very clean and the photos correspond with the real view. It also has a small gym which is a little bonus for those who like to keep fit.:) Located near Times Square and easy access to the main parts of the city. The only thing I didn't like was that the room service sometimes come later in the afternoon.;4
I stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 3 nights on a business trip. My stay was great, but what made it nearly perfect was being greeted by Jeff at the door in the morning on my way out to work, or when I returned in the evening after an exhausting day. He was always smiling and engaging in conversation. As I was headed to my train home, he was instrumental in finding me a cab and truly cared that I had the best experience. Thank you again Jeff, for making my week exponentially better!;5
We stayed for the weekend and had a very pleasant time. The staff was very pleasant and the room was clean. The bed was very comfortable. If you can, I would recommend getting a room in the back away from the street. We had no noise at all, which was probably the best part of our stay.   The only reason I’m giving four instead of five stars is because the room was so small. It was fine for what we were using it for - a quiet place to recharge while exploring the city - but the pictures provided to TripAdvisor from the hotel make the rooms look much larger than they are. We had the deluxe king room and there was barely room to walk around the bed. For what we paid, I was just expecting a little larger.   We would definitely consider coming back to Ameritania the next time we come;4
I Stayed at the Ameritania for a total of 3 nights. When conducting business in NY I usually stay in other hotels however these were booked out. As an emergency option I chose the Ameritania.  I was very pleasantly surprised, the hotel has a great central location in Manhattan, the rooms are very clean and nicely furnished. The best thing about the hotel is the staff working there, they turn a good Hotel into a fantastic experience with their friendliness, passion and drive. From now on I will make the Ameritania my first choice when staying in NY.;5
Our stay overall was all right.  We did not have the breakfast in the hotel--there is a place around the corner to get food items for a little less!  The room temperature was fine, and the lighting in the bathroom was good.  Any requests we made were handled quickly and accurately.  The only drawback was that we had to request housekeeping each day -- i.e., we would return to our room around 4:00 and it had still not been cleaned.  The only card we had for our doorknob was if we did NOT want our room to be serviced, so this confused us, and put us out a little when we wanted to relax after a day of walking around and had to leave when housekeeping came so late in the day.  Otherwise, everything was fine, the room was clean, etc.;3
Everything was wonderful! The room was clean, spacious, and had an amazing view! The service was outstanding! From the check-in counter, to the bartender, to Jeff who helped with our bags- everyone was friendly, accommodating, and went above and beyond to make our stay perfect!;5
Found this hotel with a discount on hotels.com when I was looking for a place to stay after a concert at msg. I’ve only stayed in a few nyc hotels but this one was better than most in the price point. We were on a high floor and faced an internal air shaft which meant it was very quiet. Didn’t care about a view. Bathroom and bedroom had nice finishing and were clean. Only one issue - our reservation said queen size room and it was actually a queen size bed frame with a full size mattress.;4
I travel to NYC fairly often and have stayed in many different hotels. The Ameritania Hotel was lovely. Great location.The staff was friendly and attentive in every way. I'd like to give an extra special shout out to Jeff, the doorman, who was extremely helpful in securing my transportation to LaGuardia on a very soggy morning. He made sure that all of my needs were met and did it all with a smile.;5
Excellent customer service and centrally located. Room was chic, clean and comfortable. Only negative was that the bathroom light was out. We should have called down to the front desk, but we just dealt with it.;4
The staff were very helpful and welcoming. Rooms were very clean. I didnt like that the shower only closed halfway. Reason for the 4 stars is that there is no microwave to use after breakfast is over which is a true bummer when you have EXPENSIVE leftover nyc food.;4
Perfect location for our first time in NYC. Jeff the doorman was so helpful. Jeff recommended great places to eat and showed us how to navigate the city. He was the best. We would definitely stay here again.;5
This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Nowhere near as big as some of the hotels near Times Square that we’ve stayed in and all the better for it. Rooms were a really good rate and location wise there’s a subway stop right nearby, it’s walking distance to Times Square and there’s a sports bar right next door. We paid a small upgrade fee for a more premium room and were rewarded with a higher floor (little traffic noise to be heard) and a corner room that was larger than the norm with three windows letting in a lot of extra natural light. Great size, including the bathroom. Comfortable bed. The huge full length mirror was much appreciated. Hotels so often lack those. We didn’t make use of any of the other facilities bar the complimentary tea and coffee on offer every morning.;5
Room was very small. However we were not in it very often so it didn't matter too much. The staff were always friendly and efficient with enquiries. However it took maid service a long time to get around to doing our room, often we would come back from a day out at 2pm and our room would still not have been cleaned.;3
Great Location, very close to Times Square, restaurants, transport and hop-on-off-off buses. Staff very helpful when we requested to have a change of room to a larger room, without additional cost,  they even took our luggage to the new room for us. Lovely view from the room. Iced water in the foyer on arrival back from adventures each day appreciated. Closeness to restaurants was very good, everything from a good deli, supermarkets, Starbucks, McDonalds to upper crust restaurants, all close by.;5
The Ameritania was a wonderful choice for our long weekend in New York! The staff (especially Tiffany and Scarlet) were extremely friendly and helpful! The room was clean and the location was close to public transport. There were also a decent amount of restaurants and a drug store near by. We will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to New York!;5
We visit NYC  about three times a year and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite hotels. I pop between this and the Viceroy but Ameritania always has a deal! The hotel staff are always helpful and welcome you. The lobby is chic with a little bar where you can grab a drink. The rooms are modern and again chic. I love that they give you four pillows! Maybe that's my favorite part. There are great places to grab food or hear music such as 54 Below. Victors is just down a few streets.  Patsys is close by and MaisonKayser is up a few blocks on Columbus Circle for lattes and a croissant or eggs in the morning. Yes you can walk to all the shows and restaurants in Hells Kitchen.  Make sure you check out Orso on 42nd. It's one of my favorite Italian restaurants along with Matthew;5
The bathroom and room overall were decorated nicely and were very clean.  I enjoyed my stay and the great location.  I will stay here again I am sure.  The price point was very good as well for as nice as the room was.  It exceeded my expectations.;5
After a bit of a problem on our first nights sleep with the terrible noise of an outside generator, we asked staff if we could be moved to another room and it was not a problem . The staff were so nice and helpful and everything from then on was perfect .;5
Good for 3 stars hotel. Breakfast is poor. İts better to go out if u like breakfast. Room is small but clean and nice. The best part is location. hotel is middle of manhattan close everywhere :-) Also airconsition is centralized and working noisy.;3
Lovely hotel and rooms at a good value, great location very close to broadway and Times Square so plenty to do and local restaurants and bars, very friendly and helpful staff will definitely be returning!;5
Great location and wonderful staff, but the condition of our room was somewhat lackluster. The A/C unit made an awful loud noise throughout the night and the bathroom, with it’s odd layout, was a slippery hazard at times. The WiFi didn’t really work and when it did, it was terribly slow. Despite these rather minor issues, you can’t beat the price, location and great staff.;3
Really clean and tidy throughout the whole hotel. Breakfast is one of the cheapest in New York. Very friendlyhotel staff who are always helpful. Perfect location as a sightseeing base. Would highly recommend for your first visit to New York!;4
So easy to walk to Times Square, Broadway, and Central Park. Comfortable beds. Free WiFi. Nice decor. Lots of restaurants so close by. Easy access to subway. Staff was helpful. We would definitely stay here again.;5
We stayed here for 3 nights.  All staff were very friendly from the time we checked in to the time we left. Great location, convinient to Times Square.  Will stay again if we visit NYC.  One suggestion is if they can also have an option for grab and go breakfast, will be great since buffet breakfast sounded a bit expensive if you have kids who are picky eater's.  Overall excellent place to stay.;5
Great location only 10min from Time Square staff very friendly specially Jeff at the door he could do enough to help us he has made our stay so much more enjoyable . I would recommend this hotel highly;4
We stayed on spring season so the room price was too high for what the hotel can offer in terms of service, bed quality and amenities. But the overall experience was good. Don't expect much proactive attitude from the front desk staff. Our feeling is that they are not very empowered and driven to solve customer issues by their own.;3
Dingy place with poor service and extremely small room to the point where I had trouble finding a spot to set my suitcase down. and Worst of all the fitness center was out of towels, hand sanitizer, water and had two dead cockroaches. I went and told the front desk staff and they said OK not I'm sorry for your experience, I'll handle that right away,etc.;2
Please fix your in-room air condition.  Waking up soaked in sweat and unable to rest.    Although the front desk changed my room at 4:30am, I had already lost the night...  the room was so well stocked with everything I needed, I could not believe that a most basic need was left unmet;2
From Jeff at the front door, to the friendly and helpful reception staff, to the room that was more spacious than you'd expect in this area, the Ameritania exceeded expectations.  I also appreciated the ice water in the lobby to fill my water bottle before heading out into the heat!;5
We arrived early and our  bags where stored until our room became available. We had such a great room 905. It was a corner room so we had a view on 2 sides of different streets. The room is rather spacious for a NY hotel room. The bathroom is a bit tight but  the water is hot, the shower has a rainfall showered or you can use the handheld showered. The shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and body wash were really nice, The earplugs not needed but a good gesture. The bed was really comfortable and we slept really well. Ii read that the elevators were rather slow and yes they were but so is the traffic :-) Location wise it is awesome, just around the corner we found Starbucks and several  small places to eat. Next to the hotel and in the entire street are places to eat and around;5
New York is so big that I wanted a hotel close enough to walk to the Broadway theatres, Carnegie Hall, a subway station and Central Park. Ameritania Hotel was perfect for me. I was by myself so the small room was not an issue. It was clean and serviced daily. The front door staff were efficient and helpful - and a big thank you to Jeff on the door.;5
My 2 daughters (11&8) stayed here 3 nights and had a fantastic experience! The room was big enough, clean and was very modernly decorated. You can't beat the location- we were able to walk to our Broadway shows in a few minutes. The staff was very accommodating and friendly... I found Jeff & Julian particularly helpful at the door and with our bags... they even joked around with my girls a little which made them comfortable with being in NYC (we're from a rural small town). I highly recommend!;5
Excellent location for all activities we planned . . . an easy walk to Times Square, theatres, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, pier for harbor tours, and lots of restaurants.  Hotel was clean and the entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  Would definitely recommend and will stay there again.;5
The room did not have a mini fridge or microwave. Room was clean but very small/cozy. Hotel is close to nearby public transportation and eateries. The young lady at the front desk who checked me in wasn't that friendly.;4
We just stayed at the Ameritania Hotel from the 11/6 til the 20/6 as our first stop on our American holiday.   This hotel is in a fantastic location 6 blocks from Times Square so slightly out of the hustle and bustle of the night life but close enough it’s an easy walk in.   The hotel is surrounded by numerous metro lines to take you to all the sights of NYC.   The room we were in was a big retro style room overlooking 8th street. The bed was huge and comfortable with a good size bathroom.   The staff were amazing at the front desk and helped us with local eateries, entertainment and things to do during our stay.   The door lads were great and very friendly when we left and got back to the hotel. Special mention to Jeff who really went the extra mile with making us feel welcome.;4
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We arrived earlier than check-in time but we were able to leave our luggage and do a pre-check-in.  We had a room with 2 double beds.  The room was nice size.  There was plenty of space in the room.  The beds were very comfortable.   I would definitely stay here again when in NYC.;5
I stayed a couple of nights at the Ameritania. It was actually very good value for money given the location of the property. The rooms (despite some wear and tear) were clean and the beds comfortable. The front desk is a little slow when checking us in and out, but generally it wasn't too bad.   I have to say that the breakfast was not worth buying as it was the same thing each day and the staff weren't exactly inviting. Best to step out and enjoy what the city has to offer breakfast-wise.   I have to give a big shout out to the doorman, Jeff, who was an absolute legend! He is all smiles from the moment you show up. He can take your bags, point you in the right direction, give you suggestions and make you feel like you've known him forever! He is a doorman and concierge all;4
Very modern looking hotel when you first walk in.  Staff greets you at the door and our front desk check in person was very nice to us.  Offered to show a map of the area even though we had been multiple times.  Elevators were clean as were the hallways.    The room wasn't very big (although that's to be expected in midtown NYC).  It was clean and had a view.  Location was perfect, 10 minute walk to Times Square, close to many of the major theaters around there.    A little disappointed that the bar closed at 11:30 on a Saturday night but the bartender was very nice to compensate. Had two for one drink specials, which was a welcome surprise for midtown hotel on a weekend.    It's a bit noisy quite early but again its midtown Manhattan, its to be expected.  The one downside was;4
Javier was the bartender who made my night!  He was so friendly and accommodating.  I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation with him!  Jeff was the greeter at the door everyday who put a smile on my face.  Such a kind, helpful person.;5
all you need it a hotel right on Times Square.  Julian at the door is very nice and helpful.  Clean shower with strong pulse of water Very strong internet connection. Great location as its right in the middle of Manhattan.  I'll be here again;5
It has excellent facilities and location, however, I want to show my indignation towards the cleanliness of it, since we stayed 3 nights my friend and I, and the person in charge of the cleaning did not do his/her job ……. only tended the beds and added clean towels.   	He/she never picked up trash, never cleaned the bathroom, which had an unpleasant smell of urine, and did not replace the consumables, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.   I have waited to put my complaint to leave, because I fear reprisals on his/her part, if I made the mention.    Excellent hotel, but honestly, I did not want to return like that, it's not worth the price we paid.;3
Way nicer than you think! Super chill place with great staff. And the guy at the front Jeff was super nice and helpful too. Would return for the cozy environment and nice people!   Rooms could have a bit more light though!;4
Excellent service, especially doorman. Decent location near Theatres and subway stop. Room size average. Able to easily park car a block away. Terrible bed-old, soft, lumpy. Cannot recommend sorely because of bad bed.;3
Our room is small but perfectly formed, has had everything we needed for 3 nights in NYC. A couple of small niggles sorted out promptly with no fuss. Top marks for service to Jalal who not only provided me with a comprehensive map, explained it, and directed me to the nicest areas, organised transfer to the airport for our departure.  We felt very welcome here and it’s in an ideal location for getting around. Noise wise, we slept fine so no complaints.;5
Good hotel. Clean, polite and helpful. Julian (might be Julion) the Porter was helpful and friendly. Free hot drinks. Great location, literally on Broadway.  A couple of small niggles, but both dealt with.  Recommend.;4
Nice, clean hotel near everything. 2 minute walk to seldom used line. The north South to uptown, times Square, downtown is about 5 or 6 minute walk. Cascade Cafe at end of block is fantastic for breakfast, fresh deli sandwiches, smoothies, and desert.. Awesome prices too. Hotel was clean, great location. The only downside is the street noise. It is LOUD with constant horns and sirens all night. So if you want to sleep at all, ask for something off street. There really isn't a need for;4
What a great place, would definitely stay again. Everything was very clean. The staff was very professional and helpful.  The location is amazing. You are so close to everything.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it was perfect for my families trip to NYC;5
We had a phenomenal time in NY,  my granddaughter loved Frozen. The staff and appearance of the Ameritania was terrific. Jeff was incredibly helpful to help us to secure cabs and transportation. His positive upbeat attitude was wonderfully received. Everyone at the hotel is extremely knowledgeable about New York. The man in the restaurant treated my grandaughter to muffins every morning, she was so excited and felt so special. It is the little nuances like this that make you feel welcome! Great location!! Loved the bar area, very relaxing. I would definitely stay here again, coming back soon to see another show! Thank you Ameritania.Thanks again Jeff (at the door)!! You are terrific!;5
We were very happy with this hotel. We got in early and they were very willing to accommodate us - either give us a room right away or wait while a room with a view was available and they would be willing to hold our bags for us. We had a double bed room so I’m not sure how big the single bed rooms are but the double bed rooms are bigger than I expected it would be. We had no issues with noise and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was also decent size and we were happy with it. We had a drink at the hotel bar and the bartender was fun. We found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful. WiFi was free for hotel guests. I would stay here again and would recommend it to others.;5
Just got back from a three night stay at this perfectly located hotel. Nice location between Times Square and Central Park. Manager had wine ready for our anniversary arrival (nice touch thank you). Bartender is a wealth of knowledge about places to eat and see. Good stay!;5
I recently brought my sister to NYC for a night to celebrate her graduation. The Ameritania was a perfect spot! Convenient location with a short walk to Times Square and the theater. The staff were professional, friendly and accommodating. The bellhop, Jeff, was attentive and welcoming! Will definitely stay there again next time I am in the city.;5
This hotel is perfectly located to everything. We arrived to a welcoming, clean, air conditioned room. Would have given a higher rating but was disappointed on our last day after a long day out we wanted to rest up before heading out again. It was 4 pm and our room hadn’t been serviced yet. We had to sit in the lobby and try to stay awake. That was a bit disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend eating breakfast here either..costly and below average food. Make sure you say hi to Jeff at the door. He would have to be the nicest man in New York!! Jeff is full of local knowledge and more than happy to help you out. What an asset he is to this hotel.;4
Such a great hotel and very convenient because it’s close to times square. Jeff is a great service too, he makes our life easier by telling us where the good places at and helped us with the service to the airport :);5
Lovely boutique style hotel with very reasonable prices in the heart of the theater district and a short walk to great restaurants. The rooms are a little small but who is sleeping when visiting NY. The rooms were clean and the decor was very nice. Bartender was excellent and overall stay was great.;5
Positive review due to the great service and attention from Ameritania staff, everytime that I had a need I was well attended by the hotel team. An special thanks for Javier at the bar, and Jeff as doorman.;5
The location of this hotel is fantastic, walking distance to so many attractions. Staff were always friendly and ready to recommend restaurants, give directions etc. Room was clean with comfortable beds and pillows a must when travelling. Highly recommend to anyone looking for central accommodation in New York City;5
The absolute best hotel in NYC. The location is the best, near a lot of major attractions. We took the subway just twice in 10 days, to go visit the Brooklyn area. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room was beautiful, very clean and comfortable. If you stay in a room with a view to the city, you might hear some noises at night, but it wasn’t a problem for us. I loved it.;5
For the past ten years, I've taken 40 to 96 high school students and chaperones on a three day/three night trip to NYC and have stayed every year at the Ameritania.  The people, facility, location, and value increase every year! Every person stops what they are doing and provides the highest level of customer service whenever anyone on my trip needs assistance!  As one example, Jeff and his team help us easily off load/ and load the luggage of two charter buses and make it disappear in a safe room until we are ready to check in.  The front desk team is always prepared and ready for our arrival. The recently renovated rooms are large compared with other hotels in New York City and are beautiful!  The convenience of having the major midtown attractions within short walking;5
Very comfortable and clean room,window you can open, Near the breakfast room,you could get free coffee or tea in the morning,even tea or coffee specials! Location perfect! No noises from the floor or other rooms,only street noise by open window (8 floor) The rainfall shower was amazing!  Very helpful and friendly staff,special the porter Jeff! Would stay there certainly again!;5
air conditioner is old, noisy and don’t work properly. doorman bullys guests for tips. I don’t mind tipping good service, but that’s not the case, some of them are rude and not friendly, but even than they think they deserve tip and bully you into giving. makes the place uncomfortable.;2
Very helpful staff special thank you to movrad went out  his way to sit down with us and go through itinerary with us as first time in New York and explained what to do and where to go thank you so much movrad will definitely be going back to Ameritania hotel;5
My high school and I recently went on a class trip to New York and our stay was amazing all thanks to Jeff at the Ameritania. We had a great time in the city and our trip was made even better once we were welcomed to comfortable rooms to stay in. The staff was inviting and the hotel was an all around blast!;5
Visiting NY for the first time from California and we found this hotel via trip advisor. We stayed at YOTEL for one night before but found the rooms to be a little dirty and really expensive. So we decided to come to Ameritania and we wish we did so from the beginning. For almost $50 less we got clean rooms that is really close to all the tourist attractions.  The staff was very professional and courteous. One of the staff members named Jeff Banks was especially exceptional and offered us really good rates to JFK airport. I wanted to name him specifically for being a great host and would definitely stay here again.;5
That’s all It is well located but I prefer other areas of Manhattan It is an old hotel renovated.... but the style is tasteless  The main problem is the noise , there are wheels’ noise everywhere and majes difficult to sleep Also the air conditioning is ver noisy in the room  Breakfast is less than standard, the cramble eggs are overcooked and sulfur color  It is plenty of tour groups and the common place is not enough for everyone;2
Excellent stay and location! My daughter and I love this clean, convenient location when we atend an event at Feinsteins. The staff always goes beyond to help us out. Checking bags fior the day was extremely helpful!;5
This hotel is lovely 😊. The staff were always on hand to help with any questions. The rooms are clean, beds really comfy!  The bonus was a little note and some chocolates wishing me a happy birthday. Location is excellent , just round the corner from Times Square with nice restaurants and Broadway with the theatres. The only small niggle was no tea and coffee in the room, but we had Air conditioning - when I did the research not all hotels have this and you need it ! I would highly recommend this hotel, didn’t want to check out !;5
This was our 1st trip to NYC. It was our daughters senior trip & we had an amazing time. From check in to check out, the Ameritania hotel staff was amazing. They accommodated our check in needs without hesitation. Our bellman, Mourad was AWESOME! He delivered our bags to our rooms & asked about the nature of our trip. He also offered tips & must see/dos for us being as this was our 1st trip. He also gave us safety tips. Every time he was on duty, he would ask how our trip was so far, what we had planned, what we had done, & offered suggestions along the way. He also offered to get us alternate transportation to the airport if the one we were planning on using was expensive.   Upon check in, we arrived at our rooms. We let our girls stay in one room & we took the other. We let;5
The bartender Javier was super nice and my friends and I had a great time. The service was amazing would definitely recommend this hotel and of course the bar. If you go to this bar i recommend the cake shot it taste EXACTLY like cake it’s delicious.;5
Given small noisy back room on check in but after complaining we were moved to a lovely too floor corner room. Only saw bar open 3 times in the 10 days we were there. Staff were nearly all very friendly and helpful. Would definitely  stay again;4
This was a Great hotel, with a fantastic location. The room was a little bit on the small/tight side but had an Extremely comfortable bed. All the staff are really helpful and even offered to upgrade our room. But because we had been traveling all day we just wanted to unpack and go to sleep. Jeff the bell Man was extremely helpful and really went out of his was to give us extra information;5
Incredible location, within walking distance of both Central Park and Times Square. Excellent service. Vladimir the Front Desk Manager took very good care of us. He even noted it was my son's birthday and had a treat sent up. Room was clean and the price can not be beaten for location and quality.;5
I booked his hotel because it has a very good location, good ratings, and a reasonable price (for NYC) on Booking.com. However the room was absolutely tiny (no space to even open a suitcase) as was the bathroom (barely enough space to turn around) and looked out onto an air shaft. I guess that’s why the room was a reasonable price for that location. The room was at least clean and modern. The hotel has virtually no amenities - a token ‘fitness centre’ and a small bar off the foyer. That’s it.;3
I was so concerned after paying a very nominal cost for a 6 night stay.  Couldn’t have been more happy!  Clean, well appointed, great location, everyone was super nice.  Family of 4 was cluttered with clothes but....lol;4
Such a great hotel/area! Right in the center of manhattan and by so many great places to eat. I loved it so much and I can’t wait to stay here again next time I visit NYC! I didn’t want to leave. It was amazing.;5
Pros: * Excellent location to explore NYC or to visit the theatre * Super friendly bellboys * Really confortable bed  Cons: * Unfriendly reception personel * AC very loud * Toilett was not cleaned during our stay (4 nights) * Shampoo, soap, etc. was not refilled during our stay;3
When you make your reservation, make sure you give them ALL the names of the people allowed to check-in.  Although I made the reservations, I was not permitted to check-in because the reservation was in my husbands name.  I had to stop him from getting our bags out of the car to get his ID.  I felt like the person taking our reservation should've addressed that since I'm female and my name is not Dave.   Once we finally got to our room, I showered, washed my hair then blew it dry only to trip the circuit breaker causing all the electricity to go out in our room for 10 minutes.  Also, watch out for the bed legs! The location is right at the ends of the bed and even though they have some sort of padding around the metal leg, we still stubbed our toe on them!!  Terrible design!!;4
As a avid traveler to NYC I’ve stopped in a few hotels dotted around NYC and I’ve come across the Ameritania before but always wanted to due to location and good reviews etc.  No problems checking in and if your early you can have your bags locked away until your room is ready also the same when checking out until your ride to the airport staff on the desk and door was very helpful with any needs you may have. If it’s your first time to NYC then I would recommend a higher room as I was on the 5 th floor and due to it being New York it was a noisy street but your that tired at the end of the night it shouldnt matter. American buffet Breakfast served every morning for around $20 so very good value and includes everything to start your day off. Location is excellent as Times Square;5
A Wonderful hotel!   Our family room was clean and tidy. The hotel is situated just on the edge of Times Square. It had a metro station within a 2 minute walk and another two no more than 5 mins away so access to the cities key sights was easy. All staff encountered were extremely polite and knowledgeable each and every time I encountered them especially Vlad K.   The beds were the best I’ve ever slept in, even my own! When I return to NYC i’ll be looking up this hotel instantly as the price I obtained was spot on for my budget too.  Book without fear people, this hotel ticks many boxes!;5
We had a great time. Jeff at the concierge / door was the best of Ameritania’s staff. Planning to come back... you are on top of Broadway! 100 ft from subway, nice dinning options and a walk of fame from Times Square. Rooms are quiet and clean.;4
Hi.  Just back from a few days in NY and stayed at the Ameritania.  Lovely hotel and a fantastic location.  The staff were so helpful, particularly when we asked to change our room because of an issue with the air conditioning.  They moved us straight away and were very polite and helpful.  The hotel is very clean, the rooms are spacious (we had a deluxe double) and I would certainly stay here again.  Special mention to Majid and Jeff - both of whom were brilliantly helpful!!!;5
Fantastic location, between Times Square and Central Park! We had a very friendly welcome by Algenis. The room was superb (we had the kingsize deluxe) with airconditioning, a great bed and a nice shower. A few nights we sat at the bar after returning to the hotel in the evening. The bartender Javier made us some delicious cocktails and was very friendly. He even gave us some advise on where to go during our stay. We had a fantastic stay at the hotel Ameritania.;5
The staff at this hotel are second to none!!! Jeff is the main man who can help with anything!! Not only can he do the usual but he goes above and beyond, offering advice and even life lessons if needed! Every visitor needs to spend ten minutes in his company.... he makes you a better person!!! 💚 Everybody is attentive and even if things don’t go to plan the managers call you back with an immediate solution. Great location too, will recommend it to everybody who is visiting my son who is here for the summer!!;5
We stayed at the Ameritania for 3 nights in early May for my husband's 30th birthday before flying to Toronto. This was our first time in NYC and I was so happy that I had chosen this hotel for our first visit.   The hotel is close enough to Times Square to walk each day but still far enough away that you can have a relax if needed. We went to see two Broadway shows when in NYC and walked each night to the theatres with ease. I also felt safe walking back here at night.   Our hotel room was wonderful and we had plenty of space (we had a huge mirror). We ordered room service for breakfast one morning and this was delivered promptly to our room. The staff at the hotel left my husband a complimentary treat for his 30th birthday which was another wonderful touch.  There is a cafe at;5
Just got back from staying at this hotel room was lovely. Jeff the doorman was really helpful and Javier the bartender was a 🌟 . Would definitely go back.location is perfect  but away from noise. Excellent bar next door;4
"Found this hotel online after a long search, trying to find a decent hotel for a Saturday night that wouldn't break the bank. It was a great find! The price was reasonable. The location is really good, a short walk from Times Square; perfect if you are seeing Stephen Colbert as his studio is practically next door.  Walking distance to Central Park and other main attractions, it is perfect. The room was tiny, but for one person it was completely fine. It was quiet and I was able to sleep perfectly.  I did arrive at the hotel and they told me I would have to stay at a sister hotel due to a problem with my room; but after telling them I was there with a friend and we specifically chose the same hotel, they worked it out for me to stay.  I would definitely reconsidering staying here";5
Excellent location close to Train station also. Room got nice space compare with standard room offer in NYC.  Lobby and room looks good.  It is a little nossy during the night but that is normal for that area.  I will repeat it agaain next time.;5
We spent 4 nights in this hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated but at bit worn out.  There is not a lot of space to put your luggage, but I suppose this is always the case in New York.  The personnel was friendly and the hotel is very well located to visit New York by foot or subway.  Our main issue was that our neighbours did a lot of noise and you can hear everything through the walls and doors.  We recommend rooms that are in the upper levels as the AC make a lot of noise in the lower levels.  Besides the noise problem, we recommend this place as the bed is comfortable, the room is clean, the bathroom is modern and the hotel is VERY well located !;3
Comfortable clean rooms, queen size rooms are very small. Book a king size bed room if you can. Jeff the doorman is super helpful. Hotel is near the action but away from the overwhelming crowds of time square. Good value. Don't stay in New York if street noise bothers you. I am quite use to city sounds but heard a lot of guests complain to the hotel staff about the noise such as sirens and horns which you can't escape in New York.;4
Excellent service.  Wonderful location, local bars nearby and excellent food.  Air conditioning unit is very very noisy, but works well.  Would have liked a coffee machine in the room rather than the lobby.  But would return again.;4
We left a stuffed animal in the room and when we called to get it they said we could arrange a postal pickup for it. We did, but the date came and went and the post office didn't pick up the package. I was starting a second attempt when the staff just took the package to the post office for me which saved me a lot of trouble. Thank you Volodymyr!;5
"Stayed December 2017 - The room itself was great, clean and spacious.  Apart from one member of the reception staff, I found the rest of them to be unhelpful and miserable.  A $100 holding fee was ""charged"" to my debit card (presume in case of damage etc to room) - in fact it was taken from my card and I've never received a refund despite numerous e-mails with their accounts dept.  My niece stupidly left a pair of earrings she'd bought as a present for her mother in law in the room (only realised once back in England) and again, despite the staff telling me they had found them, they made it impossible to get them posted back to me in England (which I would obviously have reimbursed them for postage wise).  Shame as I would definitely have stayed again at this hotel and have";4
The location of this hotel is great. You are basically within walking distance of everything. On our last day we were going to go from Penn Station grab a NJ Transit train and then transfer to an Air bus to Newark airport.  JEFF one of the doormen on duty gave us much simpler directions...one bus from the Port Authority that brought us directly to Newark! Thanks Jeff!! I gave 4 stars because there was 1 negative... the mattress on the bed felt as though a slab of concrete had been fitted with a sheet. SO UNCOMFORTABLE!;4
I felt the comfort from the moment I checked in with the front desk Tiffany L. My check in was prompt and very welcoming , she accommodated me with any questions I had! First time staying And will definitely return, looking forward to my next stay in NYC at ameritania;4
I'm a planner- I read every review and do as much research as I can before deciding on a place to stay. Call my picky. We typically stay at Marriotts but lately I have been branching out to try some of the more boutique type of hotels.  Ameritania had some of the better ratings and reviews so we thought we would give them  try. Location was important for us and wanted to be close to Time Square but not pay Time Square prices. This was my husbands first time to the city and I wanted it to be a cool experience.  Upon arriving to the hotel (we got there super early 10a) we just wanted to drop our bags so we could go explore before check in. We were pleasantly surprised when they let us fully check in and go to our room! The hotel is small but quaint and very stylish. If you are;4
Excellent service and courtesy from the staff. they went out of their way to help us. The debriefing bar at the end of the day was a highlight.  The decor was superb.  the location was unparalleled.  the weather was marginal, lots of rain.  all facets of the hotel was more than worth what our price was for this stay.;5
Lovely little hotel in a brilliant location inbetween central park and times square, rooms were large and tidy with lovely big beds and feather pillows. We were lucky enough to get upgraded to a suite as we were in New York to get married and the hotel very kindly surprised us with this,  and it was very welcome!!... the suite was lovely with separate bedroom, living area and bathroom.  During our stay Mourad who is on the front door in the evening sorted out cars to and from the airport and to a couple of different locations and they were always on time and a fixed price, would definitely recommend you speak to him and arrange transport like this it's only slightly more expensive than a taxi and much nicer. Also Mourad was one of the friendliest staff members I've ever;5
Great stay for an overnight in NY. $40 for 24 hour parking across the street. The staff were professional and the room was very comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again and recommend it ( especially at a discounted rate online).;5
First entering the hotel we came across the bellman Siad. He was so helpful and always smiling. Really nice to see that in NYC. Our room was not ready yet, which was not a problem our bags were held and we ventured outside. Upon returning our room was ready. Our room was small but had everything we needed, a comfortable bed and most importantly very clean. The A/C worked great thankfully because it was sweltering the day we arrived. I would not hesitate to stay here again and again!;5
Very good location for central Manhattan this hotel has no frills. The rooms are very clean, on the average to small size but are very functional with a nice shower. There is a bar at the far end of the Fourier and a breakfast area past the lifts but neither of which would you recommend. They both seem like Adams in order for the property to pass as a hotel. We did not have breakfast at the hotel at all it did not look very enticing so cannot comment on the quality or service. The concierge was very helpful. Being Times Square Manhattan New York the accommodation was what it was. There are certainly better hotels for the same price.;4
"This was our first time at Ameritania. The front desk offered me an ""upgrade"" of a larger room with 2 beds but it ended up being beds that were each too small to sleep two people, so hardly an upgrade. I think they needed more Queen beds which were our original reservation. Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars. Otherwise, it's a great hotel. It's right next to the Colbert show and just blocks from Times Square and the subway where you can get anywhere easily. Central Park was just 4 blocks away so we could go running in the mornings.";4
Perfect stay! The hotel is clean, the staff is super friendly and helpfull! The location is amazing to experience New York and to walk to all the hotspots. I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel, the bed and shower are great!;5
I stayed at the Moderne, a sister hotel, for two nights because a family member was having surgery at NY Presbyterian Hospital.  Both the Moderne and the Ameritania are perfect  for this type of stay because of their proximity to the A Express Subway.  When I needed to extend my stay for additional night the Moderne had no availabilty.  Robbie at the front desk of the Moderne was kind, helpful,  and sympathetic to what was going on with my family member.  He told me he would figure something out for me.  He did everything he could to keep me at the Moderne, but he could not.  He did after numerous calls to management arrange for a room at the Ameritania - only one block away.  He was so apologetic about the move to the other hotel and told me he would take care of moving my;5
We were given a spacious room, which is very unusual by NYC standards. So that was definitely a plus as well as its absolutely prime location. Times Square is a stone's throw away and the hotel is smack on broadway. The noise from the streets below could be heard despite closed windows but that seems to be the case whatever you are in New York.  The room itself was very tidy. The bathroom door didn't shut so we told the reception and they tended to the problem immediately and got it fixed.  The hotel had four elevators on each floor so you never had to wait long for a lift to turn up.  Our bags were brought to the room by a bellboy whether you wanted it or not.  All in all a comfortable stay and a hotel I can recommend if you're willing to pay a pretty penny for even the;4
Centrally placed between Times Square and Central Park and near many places of interest, this has to be one of the best positioned hotels in New York. In the heart of the Theatre district the atmosphere around the hotel is exciting. The Staff are really welcoming and are always helpful. Majid on the front desk was a gem and a credit to the hotel. Our booked class of room was not available on arrival but it was sorted out without fuss the following day with our bags transferred to an excleent room on floor 12. The rooms are modern and well equipped with everything you need but the A/C unit was noisy. Having the safe on the floor of the wardrobe is secure but not the most convenient place. We will be staying there again on our next visit. Ther are lots of good places to eat are;5
This was our 4th stay in 5 years, and it probably says it all - very good in each and every aspect! Thanks to Volodymyr and all his staff and to Jalal for coordinating transportation. Take care!  /Mr. & Mrs. Wiborg;5
We stayed for 13 nights. The general experience was fine. It is a good option if you want to stay in Midtown Manhattan and pay a reasonable amount of money. Beds are very comfortable. Very good housekeeping service.;4
Location was great, room was clean and staff was so friendly and helpful, especially Tiffany and Majid (front desk), Javier (bartender) and Said (Doorman).  They offered free wi-fi as a bonus for the month of May.;5
Very good hotel. The only minus might be the breakfast which is only so-so (but still good!). It's clean and the dtaff is helpul even in the middle of the night! Perfectly placed between Time Square and Central Park!;4
We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel. The location was perfect for driving and walking. This was our second stay. We opted for the King room this time and it was more comfortable for two as opposed to the standard room. We visited the hotel bar a couple of times and met Maura, who was absolutely awesome. She gave us very good recommendations for things to do and places to visit during our stay. She was very friendly and extremely helpful!  Whenever I visit N.Y. I'm staying at the Ameritania.;5
The location of the hotel was brilliant in times square. We were given a tiny room to begin with. Reception explained to us that the room was small and if we didn't like it we could change the next morning. Already this didn't bode well before we got into the room. We booked a standard room but we're told we had booked an express double.  No mention on the site of an express double. Well they were right we couldn't even open our cases together in the room it was that small. Also noise from the lift and fans outside. Moved to a larger room which was better alot of noise from the street outside when in the room. The hotel is nice enough and the location is good. Hotel had scaffolding around it. Overall nice hotel but would stay somewhere else if we came again.;3
Just returned from trip to nyc. Stayed three nights at Ameritania and could not be happier with our choice. Great updated room close to central park and times square. Very friendly, helpful staff. Highly recommended. Will definitely stay there next time we go to nyc!;5
We stayed at Ameritania from May 11 through May 16, and loved it. Tiffany at the front desk was wonderful and welcoming, as was every single other employee we came into contact with. Our room was surprisingly large for a NYC hotel room (seriously, twice the size of the last hotel we stayed in there). We got a complimentary bottle of wine in the room for our anniversary too. It’s well within walking distance to any Broadway shows and Times Square, but far enough away that you don’t have all the tourist traffic right outside either.  Subway is easily accessible from the hotel too. We would happily stay there again.;5
Great location...would come back...front desk staff very friendly especially Majed...gave us information about the city and surrounding areas.i would recommend it to anyone who would like to be within walking distance from all major attractions;4
The Ameritania is really conveniently located for access to anywhere in Manhattan. Subway is a few blocks away but we walked almost everywhere anyway. Staff were extremely polite and helpful. The bed was more comfortable than my own at home, I wanted to take it home with me! Only downside for me was a noisy ventilation stack outside the window that roared and rumbled away all night, but if you are used to wearing earplugs when travelling that won't be an issue.   Nice modern shower room with decent toiletries too.  Really, an excellent choice and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.;5
"I travel to NY reasonably regularly and pick hotels based on a combination of three factors:  location within the city, TripAdvisor ranking, and cost.  On this trip, I selected Ameritania because it was very close to my business meeting, got good ratings, and offered a competitive price.  Overall I had a good first experience.  I got there a bit early and was able to check in before the normal time.  The location was convenient not only for my meeting but for much of what anyone visiting NY would want to do (restaurants, theater, other social/cultural activities, transportation, etc.).  The room was small - no desk/chair setup; there was space only for the bed and the closet - but small rooms are not unusual in NY, and I knew I wouldn't be spending much time in my room, so it";4
Location was excellent , the rooms were not that big, but the beds were really comfy . The big thing about this hotel was the staff , they were all really friendly and helpful . One guy , in particular , Mourad , was extremely good to us on our check out as we needed to get our cab , which he had ordered , and the lobby was very crowded with coach parties . He navigated us through all the other people , for which we were grateful .;5
Have just spent 4 nights here, fantastic location in mid- Manhattan and lovely, clean hotel. Staff were very helpful, especially the barman, Javier, who was a great source of local knowledge which proved invaluable!;5
My girlfriend and I decided to have a little getaway and we couldn't have picked a better hotel. The location is everything you can ask for, right in the middle of EVERYTHING. The staff was very helpful and attentive. Will definitely be returning!;5
Came here for a girls getaway and it was the best decision!   Pros: Location is perfect. Staff is very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly.  Great atmosphere. Clean rooms.  Cons: None at all!  I will definitely be recommending this hotel to anyone that asks for suggestions when visiting NYC.;5
Ideally placed between Times Square & Centra Park. Nicely designed hotel, courteous staff. Especially Jeff, at the door. Jeff guided us expertly on how to see New York without spending much. Negatives - very small rooms, no coffee maker in the room, very expensive room service (they charged us 7 $ for a glass of milk);4
Came here for my 21st, room was upgraded at no extra cost! Great central location, very close to Times Square and within walking distance to other attractions such as Central Park and the Empire State Building. Very clean, staff were all very friendly greeting at the door and in the lobby. Jeff the doorman was particularly helpful to us when looking at booking our transport home and was very approachable if we had any questions. He was always happy to help and had a genuine love of providing excellent customer service! Thank you for a great stay!;4
I was in New York on business. I book this hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. Location is excellent, staff is very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely come back to this hotel on my next visit.;5
Stayed here for 7 days in early May. The hotel was clean and the location was perfect. Our room was very good although we paid for a large king size based on knowledge that most NYC hotel rooms are very short of space. We were given a free bottle of wine to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.   Maid service was excellent and we found the reception staff efficient and polite.  There was a doorman named Jeff who was outstanding, he was overtly friendly and went out of his way to help. He was in a different league to all of the other doormen, who just did their job with minimal conversation. I think Jeff should be awarded for his fantastic customer service. A barman was also very friendly although I don't recall their name. The only one negative I had was the noise. The hotel;4
I can only say that Jeff the butler was a gem he went out of his ways to make us feel welcomed. He even made sure my elderly mother in law didnt get lost when she went out by herself drawing her a little map and my 2 girls loved the goodies he had for them. The hotel definitely has a great man in its files.  From an Aussie/latin mum;5
Brilliant location - 10/10. 5 minutes to Central Park one way 5 minutes to Times Square, Empire State etc the other.  Subway 2 minutes away, so able to get around very easily. Staff are very helpful and hotel is modern and clean.;5
We all enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania. This was our first time visiting New York and the location of the hotel was perfect. A few minutes from Central Park, Times Square and lots of restaurants and shops. The room we had was large and clean, especially the bathroom. The only complaint we would have is the noise. The air conditioning was very loud and of course a lot of noise from outside.;4
We found this hotel in a great position, rooms were newly renovated and clean. Overall the hotel is very good. I would have given a extra point if the reception staff had not have been so cold, indifferent and unhelpful.;3
"I am so surprised at the great reviews this hotel receives, maybe we were their ""Friday afternoon"" guests.  Reception cold and matter of fact but give them their due this is a tourist hotel catering for large groups and they have to be curt with quite a lot of them.  Room had a double bed. In the Americas this is unusual because this is the land of Kings, queens and everything big. However our room was only sufficient to take a double bed with no room for a wardrobe and the chest of drawers had to be opened from the side as there was no room between the open drawer and the bed. Air conditioning sounded like a jumbo jet landing and woke us both several times during the night when it kicked in! We tried the breakfast on the first day and on arrival were led to a booth behind the";2
Great situation a few mins from Times Square Clean and comfortable with a fab power shower Staff all friendly and helpful, especially Jeff who was awesome Cocktails made by Javier were superb and great value on 2-4-1 Would defo stay here again! 😊;5
Family of 4, kids are university age. We loved the location, we walked everywhere except took subway to 9/11 site as well as to Yankee Stadium. Easy walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Empire State Building, Central Park, Moma, The Met, and MSG. Hotel staff were very friendly and managed to get us 2 rooms on same floor. Rooms very clean, beds comfy. Wifi not great, but can't have everything perfect. For the price, I highly recommend.;4
Spacious room, comfortable bed and king size, one of the most functional showers found around the world. Stunning location between Central Park and the Broadway theaters. Friendly and helpful staff, thanks to Jeff for his sympathy and professionalism.;4
Stayed at the Ameritania from the 30th of April to 4th of May. Great location, rooms were clean, all staff members were very helpful and friendly. The one issue i have with the hotel is that there did not offer coffee to guests, there is supposed to be a coffee station at reception, but during our 4 night stay, no coffee was available, just tea bags(1 type of tea) on the one day with no sugar or milk, I mean come one this is the 2018 and no coffee or tea, even the cheapest hotels in South Africa offers that, and its not like the Ameritania is cheap, although compared to other hotels in the area, it was the cheapest option when we booked.;4
Our new friend, Jeff, was the best first impression of NYC.  He took us under his wing and gave us great insight and guidance for touring and getting around NYC.  The hotel is convenient and quiet so that you can finally sleep for a few hours before doing it all over again.  The staff at the front door is the best!!  We hope to see a new friend, Jeff, when he visits us in New Orleans!!!;5
Stayed in the Ameritania early May 2018 and had a great stay. Upon arrival we were met by a member of staff named Jeff who quickly got us a map and showed us how to get to the top tourist destinations and gave us tips about travelling and saving money etc. He was very friendly and welcoming and even gave us some metro cards free of charge which was a massive help in transporting us around New York! Thanks Jeff! I found all staff to have excellent customer service during our stay. Hotel itself is lovely, it’s very clean and has a good standard of interior decoration, I particularly loved the shower as it’s so powerful and waterfall-like and the beds are very comfortable which is essential after walking a million miles around the city. The location is perfect also! Five or ten;5
Great Location. Jeff the doorman was really helpful with recommendations of eateries and sightseeing. Rooms were noisy but secondary glazing would solve this. We were in a very small room initially but was swapped without hesitation, only problem was the bigger room was extremely noisy from the street noise.  Complimentary coffee was only available at breakfast and no coffee facilities in the room. It was overall a lovely hotel though.;5
Such a good experience! Jeff and the doormen were outstanding and definitely made our trip and experience so much better. Thankful for their help. Very clean. I would definitely book with this hotel again.;5
I had a pleasant time in NY and thanks to the very nice service of the people at Ameritiania, everything went very smooth. From the people at the reception, the barkeeper, the people helping you at the door or revering a taxi, it all was fast and friendly.;4
We stayed for 6 nights. We paid a small double room. It was really small, mas you get what you paid (which was very good consider the location). Speaking about location, the hotel is around 10 min walking from times square. A lot of places to eat around and a subway station near also. The staff was nice and competent. The lobby was nice. The room was a little worn. The cleaning was ok at first sight, but we discover a dirty sock under the air conditioning, so the floor was not vacuumed all 6 days of the stay. The air conditioning is loud but i think it is a NYC problem, not just this hotel in particular. The shower was hot and with very good pressure. Although we were standing by the elevator, we did not hear much noise, except for some noisier people. despite this, the;4
The hotel has a very central location. Rooms are nice. Staff too. We booked the smallest room with one queen size bed, I will get a bigger bed next time. This turned out to be a quite small room without any chairs. Otherwise ok. A little worn down, but still nice.;4
Stayed overnight while in NY for medical appointments. While the hotel seems pricey (and I know it’s NY), the staff was great. Checking in was smooth and the gentleman was very helpful.   Jeff helped us with our bags, checking them twice, holding door etc. he made a personal connection with us after asking where we were from. So he really made our stay pleasant. Thanks especially to Jeff. Room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. Could not get room internet connected but didn’t continue to try. Great location.;4
I chose this hotel after reading reviews of my other hotel choices for NYC, and seeing lots of complaints about different issues from no hot water, no air conditioning, dirty rooms, tiny rooms, to just about everything in between.   This hotel had some good reviews and was in a perfect location for a wedding we were going to.  Everyone at this hotel was SO nice and helpful.  They were very eager to assist us in any way possible, and unfortunately I needed a lot of assistance when I took a bad fall in Times Square my first morning there.  (Don't walk across the ground subway grates when it is pouring rain, they are slick as ice!)  I ended up in a wheelchair for the remainder of my time in NYC.  The hotel staff was SO accommodating and did everything they could to help me get in;5
We stayed at the Ameritania from 23rd April to the 27th April. We emailed the hotel in advance to request a high floor room at the back of the building to escape the noise from 54th street/Broadway. We got a great (large) room on the 9th floor at the back of the building. There are 12 floors.   When we arrived on our first day we were met by helpful and friendly staff. Our room was not ready so Said took our suitcases and put them into storage for us, giving us the opportunity to explore Time Square until our room was available. I would like to thank Said who was always smiling and helped us out with Subway direction. I would also stay at this hotel again as in good location, it is close to the Subway and plenty of places to eat are just around the block and I would recommend to;4
Smallest room ever, the pictures really lies. I paid 250 dollars for a suite and got the smallest room at the hotel. They told all the rooms are the same. But as you can see on the photos, the dont look the same. The front desk staff are really rude. Never again.;1
Myself, my mother and my sister stayed here for five nights at start of April. We had the deluxe double room with two double beds.  Pros:  -all staff were very helpful, friendly and polite. Nothing was too much or too little for them.  -Hotel is within short walking distance to Broadway/Times Square/Central Park. We like to walk so was perfect for walking to alot of other places too. -Rooms were spacious. I was expecting to be totally cramped with two other adults in room but nope. -Rooms were clean/modern design. Serviced daily. -Beds were soooo soft...could have stayed in them all day only there were things to do and see :) -Shower was warm and strong. Bathroom clean with toiletries provided. -Loads of channels on the TV. -Kept our luggage after check-out -Free WiFi.;5
This hotel was very reasonably priced and in a great location so we jumped on it. We stayed for two nights on their super soft beds. After the first night my wife wanted to change the room because the exterior of the window was dirty and Majid, at the front desk, worked very hard to make that happen. At first he didn't think he would be able to get us a different room because the hotel was full but he worked some magic and made it happen. That made my wife very happy which made my life wonderful again so thanks to Majid!!! Also a special shout out to Said, the doorman. When I misjudged the first step to the hotel and took a spill he was very quick to help me up and also was great with our bags. It's nice that you can leave bags after check out and they will be safe. Overall, a;4
My husband and I have just returned from a 6 night stay in the Ameritania.  The hotels location is excellent.  Just 5 minutes from Central Park and a leisurely 10 minute stroll to Times Square.  There are some great restaurants nearby.  We stayed on the 2nd floor in a deluxe king.  Whilst a little dated the room was extremely spacious.  The only downside for us was the street noise, we had a lot of difficulty sleeping but I think no matter what hotel you choose, if it is in the center o the action, street noise will be a problem.  The windows seemed to be only single glazed which may explain it in part.  The staff deserve a special mention especially Jeff and Julian who were both so friendly and extremely knowledgeable with lots of tips.  I would have no hesitation in;4
This hotel exceeded my expectations from the start. I paid for room only so didn't get to sample the food unfortunately, but what a beautiful hotel it is! The staff were polite, happy to help and courteous at all times and the room facilities were spot on! The weather was rainy during my stay, but the TV kept me entertained with NBA and an assortment of other channels.Would I come here again, or recommend it to anyone else? Without a doubt!!! It is a very short walk from the heart of Broadway and Times Square and there are plenty of shops, supermarkets, bars and restaurants nearby. You won't be short of anything. This hotel is a MUST visit. I will certainly be going back!;5
This is a really cute boutique hotel.  The rooms are trendy and very clean.  The space is what you would expect for a downtown hotel.  The bed was amazing.  I like a softer bed.  I am a side sleeper and finding the right bed at a hotel is really like finding a needle in a haystack.  I end up suffering at most hotels.  This bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  I have highly recommended this hotel for the bed alone.  This hotel is located very close to Central Park which is a nice perk.  It's also within walking distance to Rock Center.  You can really walk to anywhere in midtown if you are a walking type of person.  However if you aren't then you may want something more centrally located since this is at the far end of all the usual tourist spots.;5
It was our third stay at this hotel. A very excellent hotel just 10 minutes from Times Square. Very kind reception and staff!! Rooms are very modern with comfortable beds, LCD TV, mini bar, safe, shower etc.;5
Given this was spring, school break week and NYC, I was having trouble finding a room that wasn't over $300 a night.  This hotel came up on a third party site and what a find.  Its a boutique hotel and very modern.  The place is clean, the room was beautiful.  The location is great for Broadway or Central Park.  Lots of great places to eat from diners to high end.  I look forward to staying again.;5
This was my second stay at Ameritania. Quality service, quality hotel. Can count on it being excellent every time. Beds are very comfy, rooms are clean, bathroom a good size too.  No brainer I would stay here again.;5
My stay was fantastic and value for money! I really recommend  this hotel for all. The room, lobby, breakfast and bar are amazing. I´m was on a trip alone and I did everything I looked there. It´s close of time square.;5
We booked three rooms for a party of 5.  Only one, 205, was acceptable.  On two nights the room cleaning was late and on one day we had no room cleaning at all.  Room 222 was absolutely dreadful - trumpet being played in room next door at any time during night - 2am, 4am etc - plus strong smell of cigarette smoke from that room.  After two nights we had to request to move room, staff clearly knew this was a recurring problem but were unable to do anything about stopping it as it is occupied by a long-term resident. The new room (508) was OK.  The third room (216) was smaller than the other two and had a small, dirty, non-opening window looking onto a fire escape covered in dirty rags.  These two rooms were totally unacceptable and I feel that room 222 should not be offered at;1
My original lodgings for new york didn't pan out, so I was forced to find a new room rather quickly. The Ameritania turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. The room was well furnished, if a bit small, but I assume thats normal for the city. The view was excellent, but the best part was probably staying within walking distance of central park. The staff was also very helpful, and I'd like to mention Jeff specifically, who took it upon himself to stop me from getting lost on public transit in an attempt to reach the airport. He didn't have to tell me about the shuttle service but I'm extremely thankful he did. Overall I would definitely stay here again.;5
Great location in the center of NYC! A few minutes Walk to the Central Park and Times Square, also to the 5th avenue. We had a great time durning our visit thanks to Jeff. He helped us in every way he could, even when we were leaving the hotel.;5
I am an experienced traveler and choosing hotels is someting I like very much, especially in New York.  It took a while to pick this hotel and everything looked great in the site. But it ended in being a total disapointment. The quality of the wifi in the room was very poor. Moreover, during the use of the wifi there was aways an announcement that the line is not safe. Also charging money for the wifi is something that hotels in the world don't do anymore. And charging for unsafe line???  The overall feeling was that the policy of the hotel is being ungenerous to its guests. It's true that my reservation was for 1 person in a standard room, but it was do tiny that there wasn't even a table!  On the first day of my stay;2
Just trust me on this. Pay a little extra and go somewhere else. First room we got put in smelled like smoke, was basically a box, smelled like smoke and had no hot water in the shower. Only window was looking at an ac unit.  Got moved to another room (shouldn’t have had to move in the first place) was more like whats shown in the pictures for a King deluxe. Was for my wifes birthday which made me look like i am incompetent to plan a nice getaway.;1
The hotel was amazing and very nice, hotel staff were excellent and the day we left Jeff helped take our bags and made reservations for a car to pick us up and take us to the the airport which was awesome because we didn’t know how we were going to get there. Thank you to the staff!;5
It was our 1st time in NYC, we stayed with a french group during 1 week at the Ameritania Hotel and it was a really good experience ! 1st of all, the location is perfect because we are right in the center, close to so many subway and bus stations, and you can go to many places by walking. 2nd, the staff was really nice and helpful, especially Majid who was here for us during all the trip to help us anytime we needed !  We strongly recommend this hotel !!!;4
We really liked the ameritania hotel. The entire staff was amazing and our room was clean and comfy. The metro station for B-D-E lines in near the hotel. Times Square and Central Park are not too far to reach walking. Special thanks to the bartender Javier for the best bar service ever. I’d recommend to you all a stay.;5
Depressing rooms. Tiny. Old. Views? What view? Oh, you mean of the back of a building?  Very nice staff. Clean sheets. New bathroom, and nice amenities but none of that can make up for a brown, sad room w no view and the sound of an air shaft. I was fooled by the low price and high trip advisor reviews. Something doesn’t add up here.;3
We booked our room because if the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor, but the experience did not match the 5 star reviews that s many people left. This hotel is 3 stars maximum and one of the stars are for value. But the truth is I would pay more in the future than stay here another time. The room as others mentioned was tiny. There is no closet and room for only one side table with a light, which might not be the end of the world, but when only one of you is ready to go to bed and it’s the person w the light, it’s not ideal. The drab brown colors in the room felt depressing and our view consisted of looking at another building. Also depressing. Though we didn’t hear city noise since we didn’t face the city, we did hear the sound of an air shaft. Unfortunately the guests before;3
We were able to get an early convenient check in and parking was discounted. My first night room was not for me. It was very small with a small closet was only place to fit clothes. This was expected. But the location of the room was in the middle of the hotel with no window to the street. Extremely stuffy and dark. We tried for another room and they were able to accommodate for the next night. This room was much roomier.    The amenities in the room were great and we did have a promotional free WiFi. The hotel itself doesn’t have much , no vending machines or restaurant so stock up.  There is a bar/ lounge. That was very quiet and is only open in the evening.  The location was perfect. A walk to the park and a walk to Times Square. Conveniently a step out for a late night snack;3
I just tried to contact this hotel in order to reserve a block of rooms for two nights in May.  When I followed the instructions on the automated attendant, the extension I was instructed to press was not a working extension.  I then pressed 0 to go back to the operator.  When I explained to the person who answered what I was looking for -- and it took three tries to get him to understand that I wanted to reserve a block of 20 rooms -- he transferred me to reservations.  When I told the woman there what I wanted, she said I had to go back to the operator.  I then tried to tell her I had gone through that already, she hung up on me.  I guess this hotel is so successful they can just throw away the chance at 40 room nights.  I have booked meetings and room blocks all over the;1
I'm rather embarrassed I am just now getting around to writing this review.  I stayed at the Ameritania with family members right before Christmas 2017. This was my second trip to New York, and both times I have stayed in Times Square.  This was my first time at the Ameritania, and I was much more impressed with the level of service their staff provides vs. my previous stay at the Marriott Marquis, which was much more expensive, and not worth the price in my opinion.  The hotel itself is beautifully designed with modern touches throughout.  We arrived several hours before check-in, and they held our bags for us until our room was ready.  Staff member Jeff was there for us any time we need anything or had any questions.  Majid & Yassir were also incredibly friendly and helpful.;5
Had a fabulous 4 night stay in New York.  Great trip.  Hotel perfectly placed in Times Square , Manhattan.  Room decent size and very clean although slightly noisy - not due to traffic or people .Extremely friendly and helpful staff from doorman to bar staff.;5
This hotel was very nice and clean. It was also very convenient to  Times Square and local restaurants and to the subway. This was our second time to stay here and it was very nice. Will definitely be back to stay again!;5
Nice hotel, well located for tourists, but most of all the staff was very efficient, helpful and friendly.  Said and Jalal especially gave us some nice tips and helped with the logistics, as we were on a business trip, with meetings to organize.  Do not hesitate to have a drink at the bar, where the barman will tell you everything he knows about wines and spirits!;4
We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel April 4 - 7, 2018. Great location -- easy walk to Times Square, Lincoln Center and Central Park. The hotel is next to Studio 54 (Feinstein's 54 Below) and the Ed Sullivan Theatre (home of the Stephen Colbert show). The hotel staff was friendly. The room was small, but very clean. The bathroom was excellent!  It was a tremendous value for a king bedroom. The bed was exceptionally comfortable! The dark out curtains were great. There is a fun bar in the lobby. Our bartender -- Javier was excellent and a lot of fun!;5
This hotel is in an excellent location with a short walk to shows, restaurants and Central Park. The room was small but clean and the beds were comfortable.. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This hotel is an excellent value, and I would stay here again.;4
"My husband and I stayed in one of the King rooms on the 8th floor for 4 nights. Our focus for the trip was to go and see everything we could within the 5 days that we were in NYC so we knew we would mostly just be sleeping and bathing (shower only here) at the hotel. This hotel was absolutely perfect for our trip. It is in the center of everything you may want to visit and the subways stations are very close to the hotel. One subway station is across the street and another is only 3 blocks away; we were able to get on any subway line we needed between these two stations. The bus stop to get to Pier 83 was also very close.  Jeff, the staff member in the lobby and at the door, was incredibly nice and helpful. The staff were all approachable and accommodating when we needed";5
Location! Location! Location!. The location can't be beat... just a couple of blocks from Times Square and everything that comes with it around it. We only really needed the hotel to sleep and shower and it served those needs. The hotel has really tiny rooms, we stayed in two (had to checkout and then check back in cos they were full and we had to extend our stay).  I must mention Scarlet and Majid at Front Desk. Super helpful and very pleasant. They tried to go out of their way to help us but obviously since the hotel was completely full there was little they could do;4
terrible initial room -- should not have been rented out  (room 222) smoke everywhere trumpet music all hours of the night tv frame held together by duct tape no housekeeping until after 5pm waiting to hear back from customer service for appropriate compensation;1
loved the hotel. very modern. front desk and door people were amazing. elevators are ok. slightly slow, but there are 3 of them. what was disappointing was the size of the standard room. there's about one foot of space between the end of the bed and the dresser/tv. 1.5 feet between the bed and the wall. standard room doesn't have a tub but the shower is very adequate. a great plus, the windows open. a down, there are no screens on the window.;4
I do recommend the Ameritania hotel since its pretty nice and we'll located a few minutes away (by walk) from Times Square. I did not try the breakfast. A bar down the street was noisy but did not bother me much ... and they stop the singing rather early.;4
The rooms are perfectly pleasant but the WiFi cuts off constantly so if you're going there to work, forget it. There's no coffee maker in the room and very few other amenities-- it's pretty bare bones.;3
Stayed here in March and loved our stay. Staff were friendly from the outset. Rooms were nice and clean, and beds really comfortable. Hotel is an amazing location, just round the corner from Times Square. As it is so close to Times Square, I was worried about it being noisy, however I was able to sleep just fine.  My mum accidentally left her glasses in the lounge when we were checking out. Emailed the hotel as soon as we noticed and we were delighted that they had found them. I asked for them to send them out to us and we would pay the postage. They arrived today. Thank you so much!   Would love to stay here again;5
A little overdue, but better late than never! I stayed here for a weekend during December to finally see NYC at Christmas.....if you haven't been there in December, you should. This hotel is in a great location, really can't be beat. The cost was very reasonable, for New York. The room was very clean and functional. It was small, but this was a sightseeing trip and we were rarely in there. The big standout at this hotel is the staff, they are exceptionally helpful. The only negative for me is there was nothing in the room to make coffee or tea in the morning, but it wouldn't deter me from staying there again. Overall, I would stay here again if I was coming for a weekend whirlwind sightseeing trip. I might opt for something with a few more amenities if I was staying longer to;4
Loved the roomy deluxe double. Clean and bright bathroom. Endless hot water. Comfy bedding. Plenty of outlets for chargers. Super welcoming front-desk clerks. Friendly doorman to greet you upon every departure/arrival. Elevators worked efficiently. Wonderful location around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theater (Stephen Colbert show) and so many terrific restaurants--both casual and a bit swankier. A few blocks to a lovely entrance to Central Park. Easy access to subway as well. No coffeemaker in room, but very reasonable to get coffee via room service, or one can visit  the Starbucks nearly across the street. We would gladly stay at this hotel again.;4
Great location close to Times square and all the happenings in NY. Friendly staff. We got small room, but comfortable. Small shower room, congested. Clean rooms, Good WiFi, would recommend to family and friends.;5
The place is festive on the eyes. It's very inviting. My only disappointment was that the heat wasn't working in the room we booked. We were transferred to another. It was a cozy setting. I would recommend it to family & friends.;4
Good hotel in a great location close to subway and within walking distance to a lot of New York’s attractions. Good size room with large bed and large shower room. We didn’t pay the $18 plus tax per person for breakfast as there is a deli at the end of the street which is nice and cheap. Will definitely go back next time in New York;4
I Stayed with my wife and 2 children for 2 nights in April. I will write an honest review to help families mostly. Positive points. 1- Location can't be better 2- Very clean 3- helpful staff 4- Good value for money  Negative point The family room has 2 double beds but the beds are small in width compared to other double beds we found in other hotels in other cities or countries. Each bed should be at least 20 cm more in width. We are slim people and found it a bit tight. It would have been a bit more difficult if we were a bit more built up. I am not sure if other rooms are similar!  All in all. Good value for money with excellent location.;4
We had a great stay at the Ameritania. Great Location, clean and comfortable. Friendly staff and more than willing to assist. Only thing to highlight is that our aircon in our room was quite noisy, but for the rest, it was great.;4
Excellent time, easy access to be where I needed to get, no problem with any staff, Jeffrey, doorman, extremely helpful with many situations, including directions and helping getting to airport and several other locations needed to get to while in city;5
Busy streets, a lot of landmarks very close, staff/doormen helpful. Overall great stay. Few minor things that I didn’t get ie coffee was downstairs none in room. Bar was closed one night no explanation.;4
It's all about the location, location, location. It is 5 minutes walking distance from Times Square and 10 minutes walking distance to Central Park. When we arrived, we got a free upgrade to a junior suite! The service was amazing. Janet and Majid were amazing and the room was perfect with all amendaties needed.   Definitely recommend to anyone who wishes to visit Manhattan, New York a couple of days!;5
We can’t fault the hotel for service, even starting way before we got there. I emailed the hotel well in advance of our stay asking if they could arrange for a room with a city view and they said they would do their best. I also asked for a bottle of champagne to be brought up to the room on arrival as a surprise for my partners birthday. When we checked in all the staff were very friendly, our flight was delayed on the way out so I was assuming the champagne would not come which would have been understandable. We got to our room on the 10th floor and we had a city view as requested and the champagne arrived 2 mins later, we were very impressed. The following day after returning to the room we were left a message on a card wishing my partner a happy birthday with a few;5
"Well located between Times Sq and Central Park, this hotel has very small but clean, nicely decorated, and updated rooms, with bath. Staff are friendly and responsive to requests. The price was reasonable for NYC, but breakfast isn't included, parking across the street is USD 40-50 per night, and extra taxes also round up the cost.  Unfortunately, we had to call Reception every day of our stay to request that varying deficiencies be corrected: e.g. no towels; no shampoo/soap; no Internet and TV; room not made up by our return at 4:45 pm. The AC/ heating unit was absolutely required for air circulation but was so noisy that a decent night's sleep was impossible. We thought much could be done to improve things.";3
The location was centrally located for the things we wanted to experience, away from the chaos of Times Square but walking distance if you want to be right in the middle of it. Quick walk to the subway, central park and Rockefeller center. The room was perfect, plenty of room for us and our belongings!;5
I stayed at this hotel for three nights and found it very comfortable, modern, well located, and service oriented. I especially want to mention three of the staff that we exceptionally helpful - Said, Majid and Ali.  Thanks for making my stay so pleasant!;5
Great hotel in a great location, right in the middle of the action of times Square and really handy for theatre and broadway. Also walking distance to many popular tourist attractions and great food and shopping right on the doorstep.   Staff were all very friendly an knowledgable, particularly Jeff who sorted out transport back to the airport for us when we were having some trouble with a company we were using.  The room itself was clean and spacious, and we benefited by getting a free upgrade on arrival to a slightly bigger room then we were expecting.   Only negative for us was having to pay for WiFi to use in the rooms, though this is not unusual. We also struggled to be able to connect both our phones despite having paid for WiFi on 2 devices.  We didn’t use the breakfast;5
"The Hotel is good,nothing negative to say. Unfortunately I can not tell you if it is better than any other hotel in NYC as we only stayed in this one. Definitely nicely located,near Times square,but not in the center of the crowd. Room quiet small,but really clean. Bathroom good and clean. You might have Breakfast at the Hotel for 18$/person,but we didnt try it,cause we were not that much into American breakfast. Stuff of the hotel really friendly and helpful;o)Just in case u plan to spent a bit time at your room ours was really small and not that nice to spent time in;o)Bit definitely nothing bad to say about the hotel. Bed was a bit soft,but we didnt get any back pain,so still good;o)";4
Great location right near Times Square, but slightly back from the big crowds. Room was tidy and quiet. Lobby looks cool, great breakfast available. Staff were friendly and helpful, especially Majid and Jeff.  Jeff is a wealth of knowledge about NYC, places to go and how to get there. Such a warm, nice person.  Majid was great at the front desk. Very professional.  Would definitely stay there again!;5
This week my husband and I stayed in New York for 4 nights. The first night we stayed at another hotel that we had booked for our whole vacation. It was horrible and disgusting and took us an hour to check in. We canceled there and came here instead. AND IT WAS WONDERFUL! Janet at the front desk was so helpful. They checked us in early, had free WiFi for our stay, and they stored our luggage for free and then brought it up to our room. The hotel is very clean and very swanky. The one bed rooms are a little on the small size, but have great views and have everything you would need. We are planning another visit for next year, and we aren’t even looking at other hotels. We will be staying here again!;5
We were surprised at the size of our room - it was the end room on the floor so maybe not typical but much bigger than expected for a NY downtown hotel.  The heating was good and quiet compared to many hotels with extremely loud heating and cooling.  Bed left a lot to be desired and clearly had been sat on on one side a LOT and had a definite slope to it.  Very easy walk to Central Park and Times Square but far enough that we didn't hear constant noise all night (though some honking horns).  Skip the overpriced breakfast and find something from the options close by.;4
We went to the Ameritania for 5 nights during Easter holidays. We had a room with two double beds as there were 3 of us in the room.   The location of the hotel is excellent, just 5 minute walk from Times square, central park, 5th Avenue and well connected with the subway. Considering its location, the room was quiet and there was no noise from the outside street. We got given a courtesy pair of ear plugs should we have needed them which was always a good gesture.   The staff at the hotel were friendly and attentive. I did not have fresh towels one day and after 5 minutes of calling reception, the staff had provided me some towels. The room was clean and the mini bar was very well stocked (not complimentary).   On our first day whilst waiting in the lobby, we were approached by;5
Best kept secret in New York. The staff was very friendly Jeff was so helpful. We arrived at 7:30am because we had an 8:30am meeting. Our room wasn’t ready. We knew it wouldn’t be. Jeff however made sure we had some coffee/tea when we came back during our lunch break. You make the best use of a little space the room was outstanding and cute. I have been telling everyone if they are going to stay over nights in Manhattan they must stay at the Ameritania Hotel. The best kept secret;5
Well, my title kind of says it all.  The location could not be better, just a few blocks from Central Park, around the corner from MoMA, and close to 57th St subway.  I would have given 5 stars, but our room had a noise n the ceiling that didn’t get fixed, and kept us up all night, both nights.  I’m sure it was just that room, and will definitely not hesitate to stay at this property again.;4
Ameritania was great, excellent location close to Times Square, theatres, Central Park, restaurants. Staff were very helpful and room was very clean and modern. Beds were small and uncomfortable however. But overall we were very happy with our stay!;5
After some research we booked this hotel for a four night stay in New York. The location was fantastic, just on the corner of Broadway, a few blocks from Times Square. Staff were friendly enough and answered questions whenever we had them.  We booked online and asked for our room to be as high up in the building as possible (to minimise traffic noise and have a better view!) they put us on the top floor (12) which was great. Only criticism about the room (1208) is we were in front of the lifts, so had everyone chatting outside our door. But it wasn’t too often so we didn’t ask to be moved.  We booked a double deluxe room which had two double beds. With just enough room for two people to leave their luggage and move around. Warning! The beds are incredibly soft and well used, one;4
Stayed here for 3 nights for my daughter’s theater showcase. Location was perfect. Decor very modern and every area clean. Beds comfy and only sounds we heard we other doors closing and opening in the morning. Staff was helpful in all regards. Even assisting with transport to airport. Only downfall was our room size. Having stayed in New York before, we were a bit surprised. I would not recommend more than 2 people in standard room. However, if needed would stay here again.;4
Excellent hotel! I had a wonderful two night stay in March 2018. The location was perfect for everything I had on my agenda. The entire staff was helpful with all of my needs. I will definitely stay here again!;5
Just got back from a quick 2 night stay at the Ameritiana. We arrived at 4pm on Monday and were quickly checked in, we were on the top floor in room 1215, the bed was King size and one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The shower was amazing and for us they are the 2 most important things ! Room size was perfect for the 2 of us, and i loked there was a seperate small wardrobe and safe for passports etc. We had breakfast in the hotel on the 2nd day, it was $18 plus tax each and was great, I would definately reccomend the waffles and Turkey Bacon ! On check out Jeff was fab, he helped us with holding our bags and getting in our car to the airport at a busy time in the hotel, all the concierge were very freindly and helpful. Hotel was in a great position for everything,;5
I travelled there with my three kids on a family vacation. It is well located in a safe, central area. Helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms. There are lots of restaurants, shopping areas, subway, Times Square, and Central Park within a few minutes' walking distance. I would stay there again next time I go to NYC.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. Arrived very late on a Sunday night and were checked in quickly. Arrived to our room on the 12th (top) floor. Room was very small, we did only choose the standard. I’d read on previous reviews that the rooms were small but didn’t expect it to be that small. There was no desk, just a trunk kinda thing to fit one small suitcase on. Probably didn’t help that the mirror took up a large amount of space in the room, it was huge! Bathroom was lovely, clean and the shower was fantastic. Obviously it’s a given that New York is a noisy city and you could hear a lot of the noise in the room so I would suggest if you are a light sleeper, like me, to use earplugs.  We actually changed our room for the last night as we were getting married on the last;4
"I found my time at the Ameritania hotel to be an amazing experience. The staff here was very friendly and worthwhile; especially Jeff the door man.  Every time I walked back into the hotel, Jeff would always get the door and greet us with an inviting smile. I hope everyone has a chance to meet Jeff, so they may have the same experience as I have.";5
When we arrived at Ameritania hotel we were greeted by a doorman who quickly helped us with our bags. The young girl and reception was rude and not very helpful at all. But once we had got our room key we were quickly taken upstairs to be shown our room. Gorgeous decor. Amazing bed!!!!!! (The comfiest bed I’ve ever slept in) amazing shower! Decent sized bedroom. Ameritania is in such a loverly location, being only a few blocks away from Times Square (a few minutes walk) but also being away from all the hustle and bustle. We did not have breakfast included in our stay. And it was pricey to say the least. But the amount of restaurants around the hotel made it easy to find somewhere. Would definitely stay there again! 4*****;4
Room was reasonably clean. Good size shower and bedroom.  We could even fit the babycot ij between the double bed. Bed was a bit too soft foe my liking.    I like the location. It's very near to central park and 15 minutes walk to times square.  I like it because it's onbthe quieter side of town. Would be more packed if it was any nearer to times square.   We requested for a baby cot and it was readily available in the room. Reception and concierge was very friendly and helpful. There's free coffee and tea every morning at the reception which was nice. Hot and iced water also provided at the water station at the lobby. This was convenient for us as we constantly needed hot water for the baby.   Housekeeping missed cleaning the room once or twice the whole week we were there but;4
Never been to NYC before so it took awhile to book a hotel as it had to be right and I have to say the hotel was great 👍🏾. Room was a little small but that wasn't a problem the bed was so comfy and big even the pillows were so comfy, the TV was a bit hit and Miss sometimes we had more Chanells than others but that didn't matter, the bathroom was great nothing to complain about at all, the corridors are noisy but that can't be helped, overall a lovely holiday in a lovely hotel I must mention Jeff who was on the door he was lovely and always willing to help and full of chat and character long live Jeff.;4
Stayed here the final night of our trip as the rate at the hotel we were staying previously was 50% higher for our last night.  The rooms are small (normal for NYC) but nicely finished.  Had no issues with noise.  It was a great location near times square and the subway station.  Would stay here again.;4
With our flight out of New York cancelled due to a snowstorm, and our prior hotel quadrupling the rate for an extra night, we found the Ameritania. It's a good value in the heart of everything -- clean rooms, small but not too small, and surprisingly quiet for an older building on Broadway. Jeff the bellman was super helpful getting us in during the storm, and arranging a ride out the next day.;4
Never been to New York before so booked this hotel through a travel agent and what a gem this hotel is, top class they really made our stay special close to Times Square, the theatre district,central park and many more it's the place too stop. We were upgraded because of my birthday and the room was excellent a massive shower and bathroom, two double beds a big tv on the wall and a safe. The receptionist are very helpful as well as the doormen very friendly a big thank you to Jeff what a superb guy so friendly as smiling and couldn't do enough for us if you want to know your way round New York he is the man to ask,he made it so easy for us thanks Jeff. Will definitely stop here again when we visit New York again.;5
Location was amazing. Room was ideal with a large wet room. Bed was large and extremely comfortable. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York and doesn’t want to be too far from the main tourist area of Times Square/5th Ave and Central Park;5
An amazing location, not far to walk from all amenities. The bed was huge and very comfy. The bathroom was incredible, a wet room shower area. The amenities provided are nice however charge $5 for a bottle of water so haven’t been touched. The door staff are great and welcoming, also storing luggage if you arrive before your room is available. We really only used to sleep and store luggage, this room has excelled itself in all aspects;5
Great Location at Times Square. Very good standard room. Breakfast disappointing as was not hot despite buffet style. Complained to hotel and they sorted this. Rooms with safe and mini bar. That apart our stay at this hotel was very enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel to any of our friends. Janet and Geoffrey were very helpful and a credit to their roles at the hotel and their help was much appreciated.;4
The lobby and room were very beautiful but the reception check-in woman was increbibly rude. Also, since we were on an anniversary trip, we asked to be put away from the street if possible or in general just a quiet section. We were put in 315, a corner with Windows level to the bar next door. It was so incredibly loud we could hear the lyrics and bass to every song all night.;3
We stayed for 5 nights in March in a deluxe room. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Rooms have a mini-bar and bottled water etc, but they're hugely overpriced ($5 for a bottle of water) so we went to a local shop if we needed anything. For the amount of time we spent in the room, it was perfect. Lovely waterfall shower, towels changed daily. I've read that rooms were bigger than average for NYC but this being our first time we had nothing to compare it to. It was certainly big enough for the two of us.   The hotel offers a free safe in the room and will also store your luggage on the day you leave if you have a later flight (check-out is 12pm). A couple of nice touches that we appreciated.  The best thing about the hotel though as many others have said is it's location. A;5
We had a lovely 4 night stay at the Ameritania! Comfortable beds, spacious room, amazing bathroom. We had a room upgrade without asking which was a nice surprise and the staff left a lovely note and wine for my mum as we were celebrating her 60th  WiFi worked great and the location was perfect for us. 5 minute walk from Times Square and 10 minutes from Central Park, also it’s close to blue, yellow and red metro routes.  The staff we spoke to were very friendly and accommodating, when I next visit NYC I will be sure to stay at the Ameritania again. Thank you;5
We stayed in the Ameritania Hotel for four nights in December 2017, great location!  Our room was on the second floor towards the back of the hotel so there was no street noise.  The room was very quiet, clean and well appointed.  All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  We did not have breakfast in the hotel, instead we went to Cascade Cafe for breakfast, few minutes walk from the hotel on the corner of W 54th St/8th Ave  -great food. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel for future trips to New York City.;4
"We had a great experience at Ameritania Hotel last week. The location is amazing, just a couple blocks away from Central Park and Times Square, but yet, far enough from the crowd. Our bedroom was very confortable, way bigger than the NY hotels average; towels and sheets were new and soft. The staff was friendly and helpfull, and the check in/check out process were very fast and simple. Highly recommend it!";5
The Hotel is close to shops, transport, nicely presented and clean, the staff were always very helpful, the bar maid was more than will to advise us on places to go and what to see, the doorman also very obliging and helpful;4
We have just stayed here for 5 nights and have been very pleased. The rooms are clean and well equipped and the bed was extremely comfortable after spending long  days walking around the city. The location is excellent, you get free tea and coffee in the morning and Jeff the doorman was fantastic! A lovely chap who is happy to help with anything you need. We would recommend this hotel :);5
stayed here for 4 nights.  The room was a good size for New York and the location was great.  The breakfasts here are horrible, most of the stuff was old and stale and there is not enough space for dining, when we complained to reception about the breakfast she just laughed.  The staff at reception were mostly rude when dealing with them and could learn to deal with complaints. The doorman however was great... basically this hotel is not worth what they are charging.. there is a trend with staff complaints in the reviews but it seems this is not being addressed, the staff are what really lets this hotel down;3
This was a 40th Birthday trip to me from my husband and we had an amazing time. It was our second time to NYC and a different hotel. It was very nice, great location, nice size rooms and pleasant staff. We had a few concerts and dinners booked and used the subway or walked to most places. We also got the subway from the airport and it brought us right out at the hotel. The bar in the evenings or when jet lag set in was perfect, quiet but a nice atmosphere. We never ate at the hotel......it's New York! So many wonderful places to eat and see. Can't wait to return in the future.;4
Hotel was wonderful. Location is walking distance to timesquare, central park. Plenty to do. Great little deli down the street on 54th and 8th. Only thing that could have made it better would have been a hot tub in the room :) btw the beds are super comfortable;5
Stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise. The hotel and staff were really lovely. The hotel has a breakfast option which we had , the food was quite good but the breakfast room doesn't have enough tables so we sat in the bar area with breakfast on a small bar table which wasn't very good. The bar was great for the evenings with a lovely gas effect fire and comfortable sofas. Rooms were spacious and comfortable.;5
Tiny room with terrible view but the price was right. In same building as the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of The Late Show. One block from the subway. Great location, close to Central Park and the theater district.;4
Stayed here for 4 nights for my 40th birthday surprise from my wife on a trip from Scotland.  First time we’ve been to NYC. Hotel is excellent, great location on Broadway, midway between Times Square and Central Park. Lots of bars, diners and restaurants close-by.  Rooms are decent size with well stocked mini bar, nice bathrooms, comfy beds.  Hotel bar is great and the barman Javier was very friendly and helpful, as was Jeff the hotel doorman/concierge, he gave us lots of useful information on things to see including where I could buy my new watch.  He also arranged our private taxi back to JFK which was only $60 (inc tip). Would recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights as a part of a America tour.  Great location  Rooms are good size and clean Comfy bed Safe in room - didn't use not sure if need to pay. Wi-Fi worked well no problems. Plenty of plus although not always visible.. usb plug was actually in the alarm clock. Free tea and coffee 7-11am I believe Friendly staff.  I would recommend this hotel, and would return.;4
Went with college to this great hotel in a fantastic location, only to find the best hotel employee i’ve ever encountered, the man gave me a cup of tea on my last day because we were all tired and sad to be going, he’s a legend that I hope to meet again, LONG LIVE JEFFREY!;5
My wife and I recently visited New York staying here for the second time having visited once before.The hotel itself is very nice and modern with rooms themselves being spacious. The hotels location overlooks Broadway and with only a five minute walk to Times Square and Central Park and other attractions it is brilliant located.;5
Had a good stay with the hotel. Staff were helpful and friendly, especially Jeff. Such a fun and easy going guy. If you are ever having a bad day, feeling down, or feel like talking to someone at the hotel, Jeff is definitely the guy.;4
My room was amazing (316): the bed is so confortable, the room service is perfect ! The decoration is cool, modern, and the breakfast is great but they should add more different things to eat ! Thank you Jalal !;5
Nice hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are small but comfortable and clean.  Walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and attractions. Short walk to Central Park.  Lot of street noise at night. The lobby bar has a great happy hour, but it was closed one the two nights we stayed because of staffing issue.;3
39 of us arrived late at night and were welcomed by the great night crew. The next morning, after a good night in our clean spacious rooms, we were greeted at breakfast by the hotel staff with big smiles and kind words. This was a great experience and a hotel I hope to visit again.;5
Amazing hotel, right next to Times Square and other landmarks. Staff are extremely helpful and the door men are very friendly and helpful with directions, especially Jeff who makes you feel at home and comfortable.;5
"Firstly as many people here have written, Jeff the Doorman is the absolute star of the show. The day the Ameritania lose Jeff, will be a sad day indeed. He carries this joint! He goes beyond the call of duty and makes you feel very welcome. People buy people at the end of the day and this goes a long way in the success and failure of a business.  Now you are wondering why i have only given 3 stars? Well first the good; Obviously Jeff. He provided loads of local knowledge and recommended walking routes etc.. He took care of our shuttle bus back to airport. He was also friendly and always smiling which is nice. Hotel is a great location for Central Park, Broadway, Times Square and Hell's Kitchen. Nice Rooms. Lovely pan head shower. Free Wifi, but it did keep dropping out. Comfy";3
undoubtedly this hotel is located in an excellent position for central park, times sq and the shows etc, we easily walked and took the subway everywhere. We found the door men especially Jeff,room cleaners & maintenance staff were very friendly and helpful but there were 2 counter check in/out who had zero customer interpersonal skills ive ever encountered, so much so they really turned us off the place - i guess it could be because they dont get tips?Our beds were shockingly soft with little support so i felt like i was rolling out, we had a room with 2 x double beds (for x3 people) and it was very tight for space to stow luggage and move about - i wouldn’t advise trying to get four in this room as it would be a nightmare. The breakfast is a communal self serve thing for $20 pp;3
The hotel was in a very convenient location and was clean! No view from my window but saw a lot of the city walking around. No ice machine as far as I could find but one of the staff got ice for me. Very friendly staff. Jeff was the best because he gave great directions and recommendations. Plus Jeff’s personality is perfect because he’s funny and outgoing.;5
Perfect hotel for 4 night stay in NYC. Very helpful staff in particular Siad and Jeff . Overall very pleased with the hotel. Good value and great location between Times Square and Central Park. Would recommend.;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. It is a lovely hotel and in a great location. The staff are lovely and really helpful from reception to housekeeping, especially Jeff who I think goes over and beyond for the customer, a real asset. The room was spotlessly clean and tidy. When we were there, we had free WiFi which was just available for February, usually I think it is only in the reception area. We look forward to returning.;5
Just got back from a 5 day trip to NYC with my partner and we were overall very happy with this hotel.  Conveniently located to both Times Square and Central Park, rooms were clean and staff was great (especially Jeff who made us feel welcome and was very helpful with storing our bags, getting us a taxi and providing an overall friendly atmosphere).  There was some issues with storage in the room...only two drawers for clothes that never remained shut, but there was a walk-in closet with a safe that was convenient. Also, the bed was a strange shape that almost ensured stubbing your toes when walking around the room if you weren't careful.  We got a great deal with our stay and would go back at the same price, if only for the proximity to the theatre district where we spent most;4
The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to almost anything of interest.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The deluxe king room is the perfect size for a couple. The staff was friendly and very attentive, and Jeff, the doorman, was very funny and courteous.  The Cascade Cafe at the corner on 8th Avenue, is open 24 hours and has delicious food, coffee and smoothies.;5
Let’s start off with the fact that the hotel is really cozy, modern, and in a prime location. Can’t ask for more. If you do, go to the Plaza! Lol The staff was amazing!!! Thank you Jeff, Said, and Scarlet!!! That’s just to name a few! You guys were all so great!!!  Mgmt give these guys a raise!!!! Seriously, I was  blown away!! Your costumer service skills are amazing. You made our trip totally memorable even though the weather sucked!! Lol Can’t wait to go back to visit you guys!!! Felt like home!!!!!!;5
Just got home after a six night stay at the ameritania times square new york.the hotel is modern,clean and well situated so cant complain on that front.the reception staff are happy to check you in but anymore than that well forget it! The only saving grace on this front is they have a lovely,friendly,well mannered and incredibly knowledgeable front doorman called Jeffrey (jeff).not only is he a gentlemen but a pleasure to talk to(and he smells really good,bond No 9).so I would like to thank jeff for his help and guidance on my stay in new york this time and also tell the hotel to KEEP HOLD OF HIM!.;4
Just returned home from a 4 night stay at this fantastic hotel. This is our 3rd year that we have travelled and stayed at this hotel as it is impeccable. The rooms are cleaned to a high standard daily. The staff at the reception are always helpful. We decided to continue to come back to this hotel as not only is it in a great location but the staff make your stay all worthwhile. The guys on the door, Jeff and Hugo are lovely people and a credit to the hotel. Will give a special mention to Jeff as he remembered us from the previous 2  years and always acknowledges you when he sees you. We had an issue where the super shuttle messed up our return to JFK. Our flight take off was 21.30 pm and super shuttle arranged to pick us up at 18.30 pm. Jeff was not amused by this as he was;5
The front lady could have been more friendly but the stay was not bad at all. Very small gym. Very convenient location. Free lemon water and hot tea service at lobby was nice. I would go back if I can get another good deal.;4
Great service and accommodation of our needs. Room very nice and staff were great. We arrived early and they checked our luggage and pre-admitted us so we could go out. The location was near our theater and the restaurants we wanted to visit.;5
Spent 3 night at the Ameritania. Close to my work so I had to try v doing the typical Marriott. Rooms are clean and location is perfect next to a couple fun places to eat next door. I spent a little bit of my evening at the bar talking to the bartender Javier Flores. He has worked there 17 years and very dedicated to making customers happy. When he was not interacting with customers he was polishing the bar and smiling. Small things like that make a big difference in a bi city where work, traffic and crowds can exhaust a traveler. Nice work Javier! Will be back v the Marriott when I am in NYC.;5
Me and my husband came for a 5 day break and was amazing the hotel staff were all lovely and helpful especially Jeffery. We would definitely come Back again. Room was always clean and we had clean towels everyday. Room good size for New York and shower was amazing. :-);5
This visit was my first in New York. I got out of my cab and forgot my purse after paying. Hugo ensured i was reunited with my purse. I enjoyed my stay immensely because of these two gentlemen. The hotel is clean, ambience is great and the staff extremely pleasant and professional. I loved the room. Ameritania is within walking distance of some of New York’s must see places. I walked to Central Park and Times Square. A very quiet and Cody Hotel. Thanks to Hugo I was able to say my first New York visit was worth it😊;5
Found this hotel on google and am very happy we decided on to stay here. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially Julian at the front.  Some of the reviews described the rooms/bathrooms as small, but we found them to be quite large for a NY hotel compared to other hotels in the area.  I would definitely stay here again!;5
Went there with my 2 kids. Overall the hotel was very nice and was very much within walking distance from Times Square. Also within walking distance to restaurants and shops. Our room was nice, although somewhat small, and clean for the most part. The only big issue I saw with cleanliness was on the grate of the ac/ heat unit. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating, so overall a good stay and I would highly recommend it.;4
This Hotel is ideally placed for a visit to New York and Times Squaire and Broadway. Our Concierge Jeff was always welcoming and helpful. Rooms were Clean, and noise from the street didn’t disturb us. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay in NY. The Theatre where the Late show is recorded is just around the corner;4
Hotel was lovely and in a perfect location! From the front staff being really helpful and polite when checking us in to the bellman not being able to help us enough. Would deffinatly recommend this hotel!;5
Me and my wife arrived here on the 15th and stayed here for five days and could not fault a single thing and the location is amazing the stuff here are so helpful and very kind Jeffrey on the door was very good and is one of the reasons why we would definitely stay here when we come back in the near future faultless hotel 😊👍;5
Stayed here with family of 4 for 2 nights. The location could not have been better - easy to get everywhere you want by walking or subway.  Staff is very friendly.  Rooms are small, as expected, but clean and well appointed.  They are also very quiet making sleeping easy.  This hotel is the best for the money in NYC.;5
This was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever encountered. The room are so small that you can not barely move. The noise level on the 3rd floor sounds like a train is coming through. I had to request to be moved and was to the 7th floor. Believe it or not, the room was even smaller! Plus the TV was not working. This place is NOT worth your $$$. I have stayed in NYC thousands of times, and this hotel is by far the one with the smallest and most uncomfortable rooms. The housekeeper did a lousy job and basically made my bed the last day with dirty sheets and did not vacuum or clean anything. It was horrible.;1
I've just returned from a 4 night stay here - the hotel was great and just what we needed. I'll list the things that I was focusing on when choosing a hotel:  Room size was good, plenty of room for two of us to spread out with the contents of our suitcases etc and still be able to make use of the rest of the room. The bathroom was a good size and the shower is great.  Room was clean and nicely decorated, as was the rest of the hotel especially the lobby.  Street noise - I requested a room higher up at the time of booking to avoid this and they put us right on the top floor (12), no problems with noise at all. Even if we were lower down I don't think it would have been an issue.  Lifts - there are 3 lifts and we didn't have to wait around for them what so ever, this seems to be a;4
We bought tickets to see Hello Dolly on Broadway and decided to make a weekend   of it in NY city. While browsing Amoma,com ,I came across a Hotel on 54th and Broadway.  Trip Advisor gave it 41/2 to 5 stars. Since I read and write reviews for Trip Advisor I   booked a room for the 18-19th and then 24th-25th of Feb.  I was extremely pleased   when we arrived at the hotel. The lobby was very modern and inviting. Check in was  easy and the room a good size,going by NY standards. It's location is great,since   it is a short walk to Broadway theaters.  The next morning we met Majid who was part of the front desk staff. He was warm  and welcoming. We asked him to check our reservation for the following week. He ,  after much searching,told us he could not locate it on his system but;5
Rooms were roomy and spacious for a NYC hotel, especially given the value. Also like the location. It is extremely convenient to get around. Hotel was great, but only thing is it could be a bit noisy at night with the street traffic. The hotel provides ear plugs, but I found it helpful to turn the fan on at night so the white noise can drown out the traffic.;4
I was here for business and the hotel was great. Clean, comfy, and the right price. It’s not a luxury hotel, but it has everything you need - WiFi, Gym, cable, room service (from a local diner), and even a lobby bar.;5
I arrived in New York very early, so I approached hotel to keep my luggage so that I can visit Statue of Liberty instead to my pleasant surprise, Hotel did allowed me early checked in and room upgrade. Hotel is located at the location where you will easily get to the tourist attractions. Staff was very courteous and supportive.;5
Have just returned from New York after 4 nights at the Ameritania hotel.  Staff were really helpful and friendly. We had a free room upgrade as it was a birthday celebration break which was a nice touch when we checked in.Helped by Vladimer. The rooms were clean and lots of space..Beds were comfortable and lovely bathroom. There was even a plug next to a mirror which is lacking in most hotels and a pet hate of mine! Jeffrey in reception was so helpful and friendly, taking time out to chat to us and advise us on where the best places to go. A credit to your hotel he always was genuinely interested. Would stay here again as such a good location. Recommend the deli on the corner of 8th Avenue for breakfast!;5
My wife and I stayed here for our 10 year anniversary. This was one of the most inexpensive prices that we found but was the best hotel we have stayed at in NYC! We really enjoyed our stay here due to the excellent staff, great room, and overall experience.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania as my partner had stayed there previously and it was such a good location being only  a short stroll to Times Square. The room was on the small side but I expected this being in Central NY. Nicely decorated with 2 VERY comfortable double beds,a large shower and tv. Not a lot of room to put luggage but I suppose people generally only stay a couple of days on average and don't bring much.  Central heating was a bit dodgy,the room was red hot most of the time which I find uncomfortable to sleep in but the beds were fantastically comfortable I must admit. The big downside for us was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room...or the hotel! There was hot water/milk/coffee on the lobby bar between 7 and 10.30 am...apart from this no drinks;4
The hotel was lovely. Great location with wonderful access to the whole of New York City! The staff were wonderfully helpful especially the guys on the door. Jeff could not have been more helpful with our bags and sorting us transport back to the airport. The room was a great size and wonderfully clean. Time Square was so close (but not so close that it was too bright!)! Thank you for a lovely trip!;4
Room was a good size for a Times Sq hotel, clean and nicely laid out.  Lobby with fireplace was cozy.  Really, really convenient location steps to theaters and restaurants.  Street construction outside was a bit noisy though.  Staff was friendly, courteous and efficient.;4
We have just left this hotel after a 4 night stay in NYC. Majid and Vlad were on the front desk. They were both friendly and welcoming and more than happy to help. We were slightly early for check in, so our bags were kept safely at the hotel whilst we explored the city.   When checking in, we were lucky enough to get a free room upgrade for our stay & complimentary  wifi. The room was beautiful, kept clean every day and had more than enough room. The shower was amazing, just what was needed after a long day exploring the city. The only two things that would have made the room better were: bigger towels, and tea/ coffee facilities within the room. Apart from that, no complaints! The room was lovely and quiet and had a comfortable bed.   There were hot drinks in a morning, and;5
A very good place to stay in New York. It’s near to Central Park, Time Square and Brodway.  Near too theaters, restaurants, metrô station. I felt safe to walk at night. The Wi-Fi in rooms were good and free.;4
If you're looking for a great place to stay in the heart of the city, this is it.  Close to almost everything, a staff that cares, and will make you feel at home, you're in luck.  The bell staff is great, they'll get you taken care of.  Jeffrey was outstanding at directions, and food recommendations.;5
This is a great hotel, but book it through booking.com or other service to get the rates. It's one block from the subway, 3 bars next door, a diner on 55th. Rooms are small but well  done. There is a small lounge for drinks, and an artsy lobby. Note they have room service but no on premise restaurant.;5
We could not have asked for better treatment at a hotel.  From the bellman to the front desk person, they treated my daughters and me like we were the most important people staying there.  Highly recommend this hotel.;5
The Ameritania Hotel made our business trip to NYC a delight. The hotel is clean and inviting.  It was a perfect location for us as we mixed fun with business. Located on 54th St and Broadway, it was an easy walk in the evening to the theater district and restaurants. But the best part was the friendly service and eagerness to please. We were greeted with a happy smile each morning by Jeff the doorman. He treated us warmly and made several helpful  recommendations. After attending shows we would return to the hotel bar for a late night drink. Javier, the bartender, would chat and joke with us as we sipped our wines. He always gave us coupons for 2 for 1 drinks. On the weekend, Maura, his relacement, welcomed us, letting us know that Javier told her to expect us. All of the;5
Comfortable place to stay and convenient to many venues. Room walls not soundproof at night.....might be wise to bring ear plugs if one is a light sleeper. Breakfast in lobby area was adequate. Coffee very good.;4
Great stay here, so much choice on hotels.com but this came out competitive and actually a brilliant choice. Right next to Times Square but far enough away from the main lights. Just a 5 minute walk to the centre. Good wifi in room despite lots of moans about no wifi on previous reviews. Would stay again;5
Can highly recommend this hotel. We stayed for four nights and our stay was seamless. From check-in to departure nothing was too much trouble. Brilliant location just off Times Square. Couldn’t believe how quiet the rooms were overnight, very well sound proofed. No kettle in room but complimentary coffee provided in the morning, even if not having breakfast. Iced fruit water available in the lobby which was very welcome and really good! Can highly recommend. The doormen were so helpful, couldn’t do enough for us. Jeff in particular was incredibly welcoming. Saed was also very personable and welcoming. We utilised the hotel’s airport transfer option which was prompt, courteous and cost less than paying for two taxis each way (there were five of us).;5
I was looking forward to my visit to NYC and my stay at the Ameritania, but ended up having a death in the family and am unable to come. The hotel refuses to cancel my reservation. How heartless can you be?;1
This hotel has the best location and the price can’t be matched. Clean, stylish, beautiful and excellent customer service. Special thanks to Majid who checked us in and out. And to Julian, our doorman, he was super helpful.;5
Last week, I stayed at the Ameritania and was very pleased with my experience.  I walked in, a little before check-in time and was greeted by two of the nicest people I have encountered in all of the many, many hotels I have stayed in over my lifetime.    The room was comfortable, clean and relaxing.  I shared an evening drink with some other folks from out of town and had a great experience.  Check out personnel were as charming as the check-in folks.;5
Swanky, modern decor.  Rooms good size for Manhattan.  Nice check-in attendants. Allowed early check-in when I asked a second time. Nice bathrooms.  Loved Xavier the bartender! He makes a fantastic Cosmopolitan!;4
A clean hotel with friendly personal and a perfect location especially for tourists close to Times Square. You get any help and necessary information at the front desk, kindest service and hints and tips how to travel across the city.;5
Found the Ameritania online & made reservation via Booking.com. The very reasonable rate got my attention and I decided to book after reading the solid reviews. Hotel lived up to reviews. I chose a small double since I was traveling solo. Super cozy & comfortable! Not a lot of extra space & no view but plenty of room for one traveler (or two if very compatible). Was impressed with cleanliness & quality of fixtures & amenities. The location is wonderful - extremely convenient to anything in midtown and just north of the bustle of Times Square. A great place to hang your hat!;5
Had a great stay at the Ameritania for 7 nights in January, perfect location just off Times Square, Julian and Javier were very knowledgeable about the city and advised of good places to eat, drink etc.  if your going to see a broadway show, make sure you go to TKTs just on Times Square on the day you want to go and you will receive fantastic discounts for that evenings shows. take good comfy shoes as we walked miles but saw everything we wanted Central Park, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis island, up the New World trade centre, Empire State Building, Rockefeller etc etc etc. We walked the high line,the Big Bus was brilliant as we had a 5 day New York Pass and we could hop on and off for the full 5 days.  Food and drink is expensive in New York but clothes shopping is good and;5
The hotel itself is not bad and the rooms are spacious but I had problem with the heating in my last night, the room was cold, so I diseased. I come to talk about with front desk, the guy who check me out was very nice and polite, but when the manager come … she very cold, no smile, no greeting, nothing! She talk in rude manner.  No apologies or anything. Looks like she didn’t care about the guest.;2
We booked this hotel online last minute based on online reviews and the photos on their website, having noticed the only real complaint was the size of the room. We were pleasantly surprised that the hotel indeed had the boutique feel, with fun furniture and styling. And really wasn't even that small considering we're in NYC, mere blocks from Times Square, and on the same block as the theater the Late Show with Stephen Colbert is filmed at. Would have stayed longer if we had more time.;5
The hotel was in a nice location.  It was close to Times Square, great restaurants, subway, and many other great places.  The room was nice.  We stayed on the back side of the hotel which was nice because it was quieter than being in the front.  Some friends stayed in the front and had many issues with noise throughout the night.  Although, this is the first hotel I ever stayed at that provided earplugs for free in the room!  Jeff was the bellman to contact if you need anything.  He was incredible with any information.  He gave us ideas on what to see, how to get there, where to find good food, just about anything we needed.  He was a warm and welcoming person to see in the lobby.  He always had a big smile and good conversation.;4
This was our second stay from the UK at the Ameritania and the staff do everything they can to assist you no matter what. A special call out to Said who helped with everything we needed. The hotel is so central for tourists and being mid way from Times Square and Central Park make it a must stay. Can't ever fault it. The rooms are always clean and well presented. Loved it....can't wait to come back;5
Really a good choice for those who would like to be in the middle of Manhattan! The location of the hotel is excellent, rooms are clean and big, fully equipped. The hotel stuff is friendly and helpful. It is a good value of money. Time Square is 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and there are a lot of delis and cafés near it. Central Park is also really close to Ameritania. We had an amazing time during our stay! I can only recommend this hotel for everyone.;5
From the second your driver pulls up to the curb on arrival til Jeff's loading your bags and bidding you farewell, Ameritania staff go above and beyond!  From the fun and friendly bar staff, who's cocktails are spot on, served in front of the fireplace to the doormen day and night, desk personally and housekeeping, your given the added touch of class and decadence!  The rooms are small for my tastes, but I'm used to staying in some of the larger rooms offered in Times Square/Broadway area, that last minute trip afforded little more than a round of drinks on the house while we're in town but apologies already being booked up.  I'd recommend Ameritania to anyone for a reasonably priced hotel, prime location and classy time in NYC. And make friends with Jeff, the ultimate;5
Great room, appreciated early check in, Jeffrey the door man was beyond helpful in recommending restaurants and arranging a car back to JFK. Great location, lovely bar and a fantastic weekend. We will all be returning;5
Fantastic location, friendly and  professional staff, great value for money, modern and beautifully clean. Would highly recommend.  Location was 5 minutes from Time Square so was fabulous for theatres, shopping and dining. Also really close to  Central Park.  Will definitely be back;5
I had a very nice weekend in this hotel. Location, room and bedroom is perfect. Didn't use breakfast or dinner. If you visit New York you should have this Hotel, it's nearby Central Park when you like jogging and on the other side is Times Square nearby.;5
Ameritania Hotel was great-my daughter and I stayed there for a weekend in the City.  Ameritania staff was gracious, the room was very nice and our stay was overall great.  The room, halls and common areas were very clean.  The location is prime-a short walk to Times Square and public transportation, also a short walk to Hells Kitchen (where they have great restaurants) and Central Park, and other attractions.;5
this place is a hidden gem, far enough away from the hustle of Times Square but near enough to walk to.  The hotel styling is excellent, and the lobby is a lovely place in which to relax, especially the huge fire!  the staff were all extremely helpful, shout out to Julian and Jeff who were fantastic in seeing to our every need (the taxi they organised back to the airport was a god send!).  Also want to make a comment about the lovely receptionist who having remembered booking us in managed to reunite my son and his wallet from Joe's Pizza place!!  excellent service!.     the rooms are well designed, smart and bijoux with exceptionally comfortable beds.  great shower and all the amenities you would ever need whilst travelling - the umbrella was very useful!! i would not hesitate;4
We are from the uk and decided to take a trip to NYC for the first time 7nights 8days. 25th of jan-01jan  On arrival the door staff , and we remember especially Jeff as he was very polite, chatty and friendly helped take our bags to our rooms, greeted us every day always wore a smile and makes the guests feel very welcomed. Lovely man.  The checkin staff lovely also very helpful. The room was lovely very clean room service was fabulous cleaned everyday housekeeping very polite also. We will return to this hotel as we were very satisfied with the high level of service. A warm welcoming place even when leaving  on our last day, we were able to leave at suitcase after checkout. Great location easy access to time square, awesome. Beds are so comfy and everything worked in the room;5
Great place to stay for a decent rate. Jeff the doorman was great. Very helpful with advice on where to go in the city. The good people at the front desk were also helpful. Asked them where to go and they pulled out a map and told me the trains to hop on. It was a great place. I'll stay again. King Deluxe room with the waterfall shower was lit! Salute;5
Great location, lovely clean, friendly hotel. Close to all attractions. Will be coming back. We had an amazing four night stay here. The rooms are on the small side but it is NewYork! Couldn’t fault the staff or cleanliness of the hotel. Jeromy the doorman is a character but extremely helpful.;5
For travelers who look for hotels that focus and excel at the core facets of a stay, look no further.   Pros Quiet room Excellent bathroom and amenities Comfortable bed  Respectful housekeeping staff  Cons AC is loud Room charges could be more friendly  If you are a visitor who is using the hotel to have a dead quiet sleep, look for excellent shower quality and bathroom amenities, then return to find a perfectly cleaned room, Ameritania cannot be beat at this price point.;4
We’ve just finished a 4 night stay in the Ameritania. The hotel was lovely, in a very good location for all sightseeing & nightlife. The staff were more than helpful. The concierge who was on duty when we arrived was a guy called Jeffery. He couldn’t have been more helpful if he tried. He planned routes for us to fit in all the sightseeing we wanted to do, told us the best places to go & arranged our airport transfer for us all hassle free. Would definitely come back & stay again;5
Just getting ready to head back home to Scotland after first holiday to new york. I highly recommend the Ameritania hotel at times square it's beautiful inside and kept well clean. The staff are helpful. But overall the door man which us my favourite is called Jeff couldn't ask for a nicer person he's lovely and the most helpful!! Had a great time.;5
My mom and I spent a long weekend in New York. It was our first time in the city so we wanted a great location. This hotel did not disappoint. It was within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, and Hell's Kitchen which we loved. Always felt safe. The gentleman at the front desk had a great dry humor and gave us an upgrade which was much appreciated. We loved the room, it was absolutely a great value. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee each morning, as well as ice water and hot tea that were available all day near the elevators.;5
We always love visiting NYC, but need to do low price lodging in order to afford the attractions.  Ameritania was marvelous.  The closeness of the subways and restaurants was appealing.  The desk person recommended Cascade for breakfast and boy was she right on.  The prices were ridiculously low for the quality.  Room sparkling clean and pleasant though small.;5
Really all the staff are very Friendly and helpful, hotel is clean and every this is just near the hotel. special thanks for the Great man, Jeff he is very friendly and always meet with u with a smile.;5
We stayed here for 5 days and couldn't fault it. Great room, comfy bed and amazing shower. The staff were very helpful too, and the barman so friendly! It was a great location too, just 10 minute walk from central park. The breakfast seemed a bit pricey for what it was, so we went elsewhere. Room was cleaned daily too, and shampoo etc refilled (and very nice quality). Great TV with lots of channels, hairdryer and fridge. Thank you for a great week! And to Jeff the doorman who was lovely and very helpful.;5
Love this hotel. Clean, modern, friendly and incredible location between Times Square and Central Park . Loved the free WiFi this time. Missing the rainfall shower already! All staff are really friendly, big shout out to Jeff and Julian;5
Loved our stay here would definitely be returning couldn't fault anything, Jeff the doorman was amazing so kind and helpful even got us a late checkout before arranging our airport transfer, overall excellent stay!;5
Wonderful, modern hotel.  Very clean and updated.  Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Location was great.  Very close to the square and activities.  Cab ride was quick and easy from Port Authority and cost was minimal.  The lobby bar is great.  The bartender is knowledgeable and friendly.  The front desk shared a BOGO ticket to visit the lobby bar.  The morning breakfast was great and priced accordingly.;5
Ameritania was super. Good price, clean room, great staff. Yeh, room was small but didn't mind. Just there to spend a night. Close to everything. For what we needed it was just right. Would highly recommend to anyone hitting the theater area.;5
Excellent location (in the heart of Midtown, just five blocks from Time Square, Central Park and Columbus Circle). The hotel has very comfortable rooms, with sleek and modern furniture and decoration. Great value for the price, it is definitively not expensive, if compared to other hotels of the same quality in the same area. Ideal for either tourists or business travelers.;5
When planning our trip to New York, we knew we wanted to be close to Times Square due to the easy access to multiple subway lines. I found The Ameritania via Hotels.com and it seemed to be the perfect location. Once there it was made even better by the staff. The doorman, Jeff, was an excellent help when we arrived by helping us store our luggage until our room was ready. He also helped set up our late checkout and a ride back to the airport at the end of our week. On weeknights, Javier was working the bar at the lounge and was excellent company. His drinks were delicious and conversation delightful. I also want to say that the staff at the front desk was great to us as well. I did not catch his name, but the gentleman working the morning we arrived asked if we wanted a room;5
Staff rude/unhelpful. Rooms vary wildly in size to advertised. WiFi is chargeable. Charge to have package delivered. Can hear everything between rooms. Rooms very dark with poor lighting. Beds extremely comfortable though!;2
The Ameritania is an excellent hotel in the heart of Broadway. Only one street above the Metro Station and walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. It is like a boutique hotel, well decorated and very chick. I really enjoyed my stay there.;5
"I had a one night stay at Ameritania when I was going out to dinner and a play. The hotel looks freshly renovated and very modern. I booked a room with one queen bed. It wasn't ready when I arrived so the very friendly and helpful person at the front desk gave me a room with two double beds at no extra charge. The room was spotlessly clean and had everything you'd want in a hotel room, including a closet, something many ""modern"" hotels don't have anymore. The bathroom had a large shower, (no tub) and the modern half a shower door look, which does lead to a little water on the floor if you're not careful. Bed was comfortable. There were even extra blankets in the dresser if you needed one. The location of the hotel is perfect, around the corner from the Ed Sullivan/Stephen";4
This hotel was surprisingly affordable for NY.  They could use more staff but the staff they have were very friendly and willing to help when they had time.  WiFi in the room is not automatically included.  If you book thru a 3rd party and believe it is included, print the confirmation.  The infused water and hot water in the lobby was a nice touch.  The bedding was very comfortable.  My room was dark but that is not uncommon in NYC.  714 was ADA compliant so the room was larger than some and the bathroom was very spacious.  The toiletries were a nice quality.  Towels are skimpy but that's a small sacrifice.  The LOCATION IS GREAT!  Lots of restaurants within 2 blocks.  Easy to get to Columbus Circle, 5th Ave shopping and Times Square.  Close to subway stations.  My room was;4
Having thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania over the holidays it was an easy choice to revisit the hotel on our last trip to NYC. Once again the staff went above and beyond - particularly our concierge Jeff who showed a real interest in our needs. The rooms are clean, well maintained and well appointed. A bargain as well considering its mid-town location.;5
We stayed here for six nights and were really happy with the hotel. The room was modern and clean and the bed was possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on. Definitely recommend this hotel!;5
Best experience for a first trip to NY! The hotel was perfectly located to accommodate and need or want you could have! Very welcoming experience with no hassle and very clean all through! I would recommend to all friends and family!;5
I have just returned from staying here for 6 days  with my partner. The hotel was not the original hotel I booked. We  decided to change a week before our visit as first hotel was adding extra charges. I'm so glad we changed the location is perfect, rooms are  cleaned everyday with fresh towels. The bed was so comfy I wanted to take it home lol.  The staff where fantastic especially Jeff. On our arrival he took our bags to the room gave us a map and as first time in New York highlighted all the things to do from subway to attractions. I shall be back here and cant thank the staff for the great service they provided us.;5
Stayed here for one night to witness the famous ball drop. The hotel is very clean and has excellent services. The location is very convienent cause it is located within the police line for the ball drop event.  Jeff was excellent. He was so nice so helpful. With his help, we easily got in the shuttle bus to Newark airport.  Problem is: We had breakfasts (two) in the morning and they said they will deduct the payment from deposit. However, they took 78 usd from my wife's AMEX. A breakfast price was 18usd +tax.  So l sent them an e-mail last week asking why they charged us extra. Still no answer yet. Hopefully they will correct their mistake!;4
I absolutely loved my stay at Ameritania. The location is excellent, we barely used the subway, every major attraction was in a walking distance. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are just like the pictures, very clean and comfortable. The view of our room was amazing, but we had to deal with all the noises of NYC, which wasn’t a real problem for us. I can’t wait to come back!;5
Best hotel room for clean rooms and comfortable. The hotel is so close to everything around (Times Square and Central Park ). Definitely recommend anyone to stay here if coming to New York. The bedrooms were extremely spotless;5
I was new in New York and by the time I got to the hotel one of the nice members of the hotel helped me a lot and I felt very comfortable in the hotel. He is so helpful and nice. His name is Jeff. For sure next time I will stay at Ameritania hotel, only because of the good staff that they have.;5
Amazing hotel , During my stay for one week I would like to thank especially the receptionist Majid for helping me a lot, plus good reception and The organization is distinctive The location it’s very good near anything would to go and fresh towels ,clean rooms  can’t wait to return here  Thanks  Mufid Alhity;5
Had a nice stay and good price but the room was ridiculously small - a step above broom closet and we are fairly small.  Bed was horribly soft and sunken. But the room was clean as was the whole hotel and staff very friendly and helpful. Especially Jeff I. The LOBBY who was so helpful with caring for bags after checkout while we went to lunch.;3
Only problem I have with this hotel is there are no free WiFi in the rooms which is unusual. Location is absolutely fabulous, bang in the middle of Times Square with plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, local supermarkets around. My room view was not particularly nice, the windows were quite dirty and just an old building block but that didn’t bother me too much. Doormen Jeffrey and another guy which I didn’t catch the name of but works the morning shift are both fab guys who are very helpful and polite.;4
Well, booked a 3 night stay here through their website which was cheaper than 3rd party sites. I selected a deluxe room with 1 king bed. The corner room was very spacious and clean. The bed was very comfy. The bathroom is a little bit tight with a small toilet but it is very clean and modern. The doorman that welcomed us was very friendly but the front desk was just okay. There is an extra fee for in-room WiFi. There is free WiFi in the lobby if you do not have cellphone data. The location is great (5-10 minute walk from Times Square). There are also a lot of highly rated food establishments around the hotel. Overall, a very good stay.;4
We had an amazing time in New York made so much better by the fantastic location of the hotel. Very friendly staff especially Jeff on front door who always had a lovely smile and welcome on our return . Very clean and would recommend to pay a visit.;5
The hotel is amazing and the bartender Javier made our evening incredible! Call for his cosmopolitans!  The hotel room is confortable , near everything, close to a statbucks where we always toke our breakfeast!!!;4
"I am surprised how functional their tiny rooms are.. I booked a small room and it was really small, yet very functional. After all, you do not spend too much time there... I missed a kettle a bit, but then you have complimentary hot water in the lobby. TV set was there, so were the hairdryer, iron, usb charging station, hangers, mirror, clean linen, toiletries.. No view from the window but I’ve learnt it is quite normal in NY hotels ;).. I did not have breakfast there but you can have coffee there in the morning. No coffee in the afternoon (just hot water in the lobby). Location is superb!!! 500m to Central Park or Times Square.";5
This is my second time staying at this hotel and both times have been fantastic! The location is great and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back!;5
We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Ameritania and I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. The service we received from the whole team, especially Jeff the doorman, was exceptional.   The room was spotless and fresh towels were provided every day, the mini bar remained fully stocked and they even have an umbrella that you can borrow if the weather looks a tad grey.  The location is perfect with easy access to Times Square and surrounding areas and the subway station is approx 3 blocks away.  All in all, it was a lovely stay and I cannot wait to return in the not too distant future to explore New York further.;5
Two of us stayed in a Queen room for 5 nights while visiting New York. Out of several trips it was the biggest hotel room and bathroom we’ve had in Manhattan. Great location on Broadway, perfect if you’re going to a show. Rooms were clean and serviced daily.   Only problem was WiFi, which is only free in the lobby and you have to pay for in your room. We had issues as payment was meant to cover two devices but didn’t so ended up having to pay multiple times. I raised the problem with staff on the front desk and got no help, just an offer to call the company to see if we had been charged (which I knew we had!). Not a big deal, just an annoyance and would be useful to know if you’re planning to use this during your stay.;4
Front desk staff seem lazy not informative or welcoming. they told me no details about the hotel, gave me keys and that was it he even forgot to to give me the fine print of my stay very unprofessional!;2
Nice staff and rooms, but if you need wifi this is not your place. Had to pay $10 for one day and it was slower than dial up and had to go find a different place during the day to work instead of working in the room I paid for...;3
Location was perfect and the room very clean, quiet and comfortable! They found out it was my boyfriends birthday on the day of arrival and gave us complimentary treats which was nice. Everyone at the lobby was very attentive, shout out to Jeff who helped us to get around and arrange our transport back to JFK! Would definitively go back to this hotel.;5
The staff is all very helpful and friendly! The hotel itself is very cute and clean! Doorman Jeff helped with good restaurant choices and bags! Overall wonderful stay and great location. Definitely recommend to others;5
"Just arrived home from Ameritana after a fab few days in New York. The staff were very helpful and attentive and went out of their way to make our stay special. A ;ady called Vanieta helped me to surprise my partner with flowers and champagne on arrival.  The hotel is in a great location, on Broadway between Times Square and Central park and easy access to the metro.";5
Excellent location...easy access from Port Authority and Times Square. Perfect location for the tour buses also. Clean and well decorated.   Only thing improvement would be regarding the tea that is in the lobby. There was no creamers or sugar 🙈🙈that would not cost too much and would be easily tidied up. This would make up for no kettle in room.;4
This hotel is very good value for money. The hotel is situated right on the Broadway literally 2 seconds walk from Times Square. The room size was big enough for what we needed it for we literally slept in there so it was fine for us. A buffet breakfast is available for $18 but there's so many different places to eat outside the hotel. We brought snacks and drinks from the local shops to bring to the room because the snacks in the room were expensive. The hotel is very clean and tidy. We had a room which was situated to the back of the hotel so no hustle and bustle noise on a night time.;5
The Ameritania is in the heart and soul of Manhattan, only 3 blocks from Times Square. Besides the excellent location the hotel is clean, well looked after, rooms are specious and modern and a shower to die for. Our room, although it was on the 8th floor, was a bit noisy as it is located on the front side of the hotel, it’s true that New York never sleeps but it really didn’t bother us too much. All members of the staff are very attentive, specially Jeff and the rest of the guys at the main doors,  who regardless weather conditions welcome everyone with a smile and are always ready to help and advice. There’s complementary coffee and tea available every morning in the lobby. We opted to have breakfast out everyday, there are literally tons of options out there for every single;4
We stayed her for three nights and not only was location perfect but the hotel was also. Very clean, quiet hotel. Thisb was a great deal as the hotel was offering a discount on a three or more nights stay. Couldn’t be more satisfied.;5
My husband and I had tickets to a Broadway play and we decided to make a weekend out of it.  We stayed for the first time at the Americana Hotel.  We had a wonderful stay. Our room was comfortable, while small it did fit a king size bed.  The hotel was clear and the staff was friendly and helpful.  We received a coupon for a buy one get one cocktail.  We took advantage of this offer and met a lovely young women, Mora who was our bartender.  She was friendly and made us feel welcome.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Time Square section of New York city.;5
Hotel staff was nice and courteous, rooms were decent sized and clean. Definitely in a great location to everything!  An employee, Mr. Jeffrey Banks was extremely helpful and made our stay that much better! Will definitely stay here again on our next visit!  Go Knicks!;4
Very good hotel close to Times Square and Broadway. Hotel rooms were large and very clean. Excellent value for money. Buffet Breakfast is available at the hotel for $18 per person.  We bought a bottle of wine at the bar and put  it on the room bill, they charged $40. So I would suggest buying at a local store and storing in the mini bar in the room if you fancy a drink.;4
I was in New York for a few days for work and catching up with friends and family. While I found some slightly less expensive options, the location of the Ameritania was well worth paying a bit more.  The location was perfect for me - I was able to walk nearly everywhere I needed to go. Because it's New York, you're going to hear traffic noises in the evening. It wasn't terrible, and but if you're a light sleeper, consider ear plugs. My room was small, but seriously: it's New York - you're going to spend most of you time outside. On the plus side, it was very clean, good water pressure in the show, and the bed was comfortable. I wish I'd had an excuse to spend more time in the lobby - with comfortable sofas and a large, inviting fireplace, but maybe next time.  All of the;5
We stayed here for three nights. The bellman and housekeepers made you feel at home. The accommodations were great. The room was small but was equivalent to New York standards. The room was clean and centrally located to the sites of the city. Would stay here on my next visit to the big apple.;5
Great stay! At check in we got to the desk at 10:30 and the guy upgraded us and had a room ready so checked us right in! The room is exactly like it is on the website! Clean and cozy! Bathroom was chic! Small rooms but functional it’s NYC! Comfy bed! It was quiet too!  Extensive items for purchase in the room. Bartender was wonderful! Desk staff accommodating and friendly! Tiffany was really nice as was bellman Jeffrey! Great stay and we will be back! Perfect location!;5
Very accommodating to my unique situation that included last minute changes. Voice your concerns to the staff and they will make sure to help in any way possible. Great value for Manhattan and the location is perfect for tourists and business travel.;5
From the moment I reached the front steps of the Ameritania Hotel, the amazing service of the property was displayed. After being greeted and offered assistance by the doorman, I was met with a professional yet very pleasant and personable welcome by the front desk/reception staff (Helena/Vanieta), who provided me with an impressively quick and seamless check-in upon arrival (and equally efficient check-out, upon departure.)  From the cool contemporary design of the property's main spaces, the even-more impressive size, decor and layout of my room...  the immaculate cleanliness of the property... and even to the outstanding attention to detail seemingly exhibited in everything from concierge and on property services to the other impressive features and amenities (including in;5
I needed a last minute hotel in New York for business.  I came across this hotel and was very happy with the location, the cleanliness, and overall condition of the hotel.  Frankly, the hotel was “like new” and the decor was modern.  Rooms were clean and in perfect condition.  In New York you always take a chance with hotels, and many hotels look decent on the website, but are horrible once you get there.  This hotel was great.  Highly recommended.;5
I booked this hotel months ago. Check in on the website says 3pm.  We arrived at 3:15pm. There are two guys working and a lady (Janet) who I believe is the manager, but acted like she was too busy to talk or help anyone (the guy that was helping me kept calling her name for help, and she was too busy talking with another guest.  He kept telling me my hotel room was prepaid, so I'm not sure WHAT we were waiting for. Finally, he tells me my room is not ready yet, but they have a room with 2 double beds and the room is ready if we want it now. My husband tried to get an upgrade to king for free, and they did not have any. I started getting irritated because check in is at 3 and it's past 3. Why is my room not ready? When he could sense my irritation, all of a sudden, our room is;2
I didn't stay here but my friend did, and by the end of our trip I wished I had too. Her room was great for the price, she was really happy with everything, and when I visited her there the bartender could see I was depressed & gave me my first drink free! Javier is seriously so nice. He also charged my phone for me since it was running low. Just a really nice guy who totally turned our night around.;5
Best value in all of Manhattan.  Reasonable prices.  Beautiful rooms.  Extremely clean.  Staff is the best.  I will never stay anywhere else.  You can find anything better than the Ameritania.  Plus the location is exceptional.;5
This hotel is a bit tired in places but the great location makes up for it. All staff are super helpful & polite especially Jeff. Checking in & out was a smooth process. We didn’t take breakfast in the hotel or use the room service so can’t comment on those services.;4
I think any hotel is a bit of a lottery, but this hotel close to busy Time Square was fantastic. I got a great deal on the room, so was probably the best value for money hotel I've stayed in in a long time. Room was small, but what do you expect given the location? It was still big enough for my needs... Room was also very tidy, as was the bathroom.   Staff were all super friendly. If you're sensitive to noise, I'd recommend asking for one of the internal (rather than street facing) rooms. I've seen some reviews mention the beds.. I'm pretty fussy, and prefer a firmer bed, but these were super comfy.   I'd definitely stay here again,;5
I have stayed at this hotel many times.  The doorman have gotten to know me by face.  They all are great people.   I showed up a little early but had no problem checking in.  Front desk seemed to be on it more then the past.   Rooms clean location is great easy to get to most subways.  2 blocks from 9th avenue with gets you out of the tourist area and to lots of great places to eat.;5
Delayed review as we stayed here at the end of August. Arrived by taxi to be greeted by very friendly doorman who helped with our bags. Check in was speedy and straight forward with the man at reception (sadly I forgot his name) he was very helpful.  Room was a fairly good size for a hotel room in NYC, enough space for a big bed, desk, bedside tables and large mirror and then suitcases and shopping bags on top of that! Bathroom was well equipped with good powerful shower and toiletries.  Location was good, within walking distance to both letter and numbered subway lines, depending on where you want to go. Plenty of restaurants close by, can recommend the pub next door to the hotel- The three monkeys- as we popped there for food one night when we were too exhausted to go;4
Surprised the 14 yr old bday girl with an overnight in NYC and her first Broadway show.  This hotel is in a great location for the stage stalkers like us.  5 minute walk to any theater/Time Square.  The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was extremely clean.  Definitely would stay here again...in fact, as I'm typing this, I'm already planning my return trip.;5
The front desk staff were very helpful and kind. Our room was surprising spacious and even the bathroom was a comfortable size for a hotel in Time Square. Here's a tip the front desk girl suggested...we were traveling with 4 people. However it ended up being just my husband and me, so we wanted to trade in our two full size bed for 1 queen. The said to just keep the two full because the room is much bigger. We ended up loving it cause there was so much room for our luggage and space to walk around. Bring a water bottle because they have a water dispenser downstairs.;4
The locstiin of the hotel is great. The bedroom id ok withe new bathrooms, but bit the hairdryer (it was broken). The bar is also great and the cocktails od the bartender (julio) were great, if is too cold no need to go outside.;3
Friendly and helpful staff, good location! We stayed there one night, and enjoyed it! It is located closely to several theaters. And you could walk to central park (though winter view of the park may be disappointing). We would choose the hotel again!;5
Myself and my girlfriend stayed here had a great time staying here.  I would 100% come back again.  Staff so good and helpful.  Jabier the bartender was very good and helpful, great guy and Great worker . Made us very comfortable in the bar.  All staff very friendly rooms are great.  Great hotel.;5
My wife and I stayed at The Ameritania in December 2017 for a week and had a great stay. The room was smallish, but I expected that in NYC and it was very comfortable. The bar, door and reception staff were excellent, making us feel very at home for our entire stay. The hotel was ideally placed for Times Square, 5th Ave, 6th Ave and Central Park to name a few, with easy access to the subway. There are some great bars and restaurants around too. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.;5
Great boutique style hotel with great sized rooms especially for New York. Great location for walking to local sites and close to the subway for easy access to more distant activities. Will definitely stay again when next in the Big Apple.;5
Good location - hotel far too hot - cocktail bar and waiter outstanding. Very helpful staff - could do with tea and coffee in room. Bed needs updating and rooms are a bit small. This our second visit and hotel starting to look a bit dated.;3
Upon arrival all of the disk staff Where extremely pleasant and the facilities were in excellent  Condition.   In addition to the friendly front distaff the lobby was in excellent condition and the Room looked like it was brand new.;5
We stayed over the new year and our stay was amazing,the staff were great and the rooms were cleaned everyday,The hotel is close to Times Square and all shops and bars.We would definitely recommend the Ameritania hotel to any one going to New York.;5
We stayed 4 nights at the Ameritania early January. We arrived very late on the eve of the snow storm, the bar was closed so we went to the Three Monkeys next door, great little pub, nice food and good selection of drinks. The decor is modern however the room was very small, just enough space to move around in, however it was clean. Day 2 our radiator blew up and we were moved rooms. The room was bigger but was exterior facing and was freezing, there was icicles in the bathroom! The WiFi was intermittent and the TV did not work. When I went to sort our room key, the person on reception I spoke to was rude and dismissive. Although we would not stay here again, the hotel is in a great area, close to Times Square/Broadway so would recommend staying close by. Other tips for N.Y: big;2
Stayed one night and can recommend this hotel with two thumbs up. Convenient to everything, clean, and friendly staff. I stayed on the 7th floor and had an interesting view of the street. Will be back.;5
We stay here last weekend Nov 30-Dec 3. Our stay here was amazing. This a beautiful hotel. The rooms are clean and not too small. Close to Times Square and within walking distance from a lot of things. Having breakfast in the hotel worked out fantastic for us. Everyone was so kind and willing to help with any of our questions. We will remember Rob from the front desk, our great doorman Ja’la  & Jeff. Jeff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and answer our questions. We definitely will be coming back. Thank you Ameritania for being apart of our great 1st trip to NY.;5
The hotel was very conveniently located, had clean rooms (efficiently sized & affordable) and had good service with kind people to hold doors and take our luggage. Jeff, a luggage concierge, was particularly kind. My only complaint was the lack of a door or curtain on the shower- this 'modern' style left water all over the floor. Overall, though, it was a good experience and we would return.;4
"Close to MOMA, a few blocks on foot from Central Park and Times Square, this hotel suited my needs perfectly.  Staff were well informed, helpful and friendly in a non intrusive way.  Decor was eclectic non corporate, adding to comfort and relaxation in the room.  Cleanliness excellent. Wi-fi free in foyer; charged in room.";5
We stayed for four nights over new year and were delighted that we picked the Ameritania.  Location is superb for walking to the Times Square area and the theatres, and the doormen were very helpful in directing us to local eateries (Cosmic Diner for breakfast, Cascade for a snack).  Our room was inside-facing which meant we had a peaceful sleep each night with the aircon being both quiet and efficient.  The room was very clean and the bathroom equipped with a large rainfall shower.  Lighting was pretty subdues in the bedroom but that wasn't a problem to us. The front desk as well as the doormen were so pleasant and helpful with hints about the locality and likely new-year access restrictions.  We found it to be good value for NYC and will recommend to friends.;5
Upon check in, we handed over a credit card. Weren't told that they actually hold a pending transaction which tied up our money for the entire trip. Were very rude about it too! If they'd just explained, we could have used a different card and had no issues at all. Rooms were clean and great location otherwise.;4
nice place and great service.  We choose this place as the price was decent, the reviews seemed good and it is was near the theater district.  The decor is a bit modern in the lobby and rooms, but still felt cozy and not industrial. At first we were placed in an inside room where the AC was stuck on and the floor underneath it was wet (this was in 10 degree weather brrr).  The service man came right away and we were moved to much nicer and warmer room...the corner room on the second floor.  I slept great on the comfy king bed but my daughter had a harder time falling asleep because of outside noise.  The shower was great.  And the curtains were nice and thick to keep out the cold drafts.  The doormen were very helpful in pointing out places to eat, how to navigate the subway;5
One of the best hotels I have stayed in while in New York Perfect location to Central Park, Broadway for our plays and restaurants all around that were fun to try. Julian and Jeff went out of their way to make our stay the best it could be When our heat went out the second day they moved us to another room  quickly and efficiently and were sure we were satisfied We will definitely stay here upon our return to the city --- Loved every minute Just glad we left before the snowstorm ---;5
We stayed 6 nights and had 5 rooms . The Hotel has an excellent location for getting around the city . The rooms are small but comfortable and well equipped .  The hotel offers good value for money . The staff were friendly and helpful particularly Jeff and Jalal who provided excellent advice and support . All in all a great trip, if only the weather had not been so bitterly cold !!!;4
The Ameritania hotel in New York is a good hotel located within walking distance of Times Square, Broadway and Central Park. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.The rooms are cleaned every day and provided with fresh towels. If you opt for a breakfast, there is enough available. There is also a cozy bar in the lobby, where you can get the best cocktails, served by friendly staff. It is not the cheapest but certainly not the most expensive hotel in New York. So definitely value for money.;5
I like each  room design, it does reflecting the hyoe of Broadway theatres around. Ecen if you dont get room with a view,  your room design will give you sense that you are living in Broadway area. The staff are very friendly and everything works well.;4
Doble bedroom , beds to small for a family of 3. Only complain was our bedroom was not clean on new years day. Would like to to see in the future a coffemaker in rooms. Front desk were nice and resolve any problems we had. We also like to see policemen in the premises during the New Years holiday. We certainly would return.;5
The Ameritania Hotel lived up to all expectations. The idea spot for all sight seeing, easy access.  Friendly staff go above and beyond to ensure you have a great time whilst in New York  the hotel very clean. Always smiling even when freezing on the door😂😂😘😘😘👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍;5
I have accommodated the hotel for 2 nights only , the staff over there were friendly especially JEFF whom were supportive at all times no matter what the situation was, also while returning back to the hotel he noticed that my scarf fallen down he called me to collect it not knowing that i was a residence in this hotel. The hotal as an overall was ok but the size of the room was small;4
Location is excellent, staff friendly and room a very impressive size. However the King Size Bed was the 'star of the show'.   I have never slept in a more comfortable bed.   Will definitely return to the Ameritania.;5
Stayed at this hotel 21st to 28th December 2017... highly recommend this, all staff were friendly, doorman Geoff and waiter Mustaf went above and beyond!... spotlessly clean and located on the corner of west 54th Street and Broadway....would definitely stay here again!... outstanding;5
Always like staying at the Amsterdam Court.  The front desk is very friendly and always welcome me back.  The hotel is in the perfect location for Broadway shows and shopping and restaurants. Highly recommend.;5
Located just steps away from Times Square, this hotel is nicely furnished and well kept.  The staff was very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile.  Would definitely stay there again even though there were some issues that happened during the stay - the management really tried to make everything great.;4
Easy check in process, great location (coffee shops & restaurants in walking distance) and room was clean (well stock with linen and addtl supplies). Would recomend and would stay here again for future travel.;5
Our first time in NY and couldn’t have picked a better hotel to enjoy the city. Majid was incredibly accommodating to our unusual circumstances and never skipped a beat in making us feel welcome and prepared to enjoy the city;5
The hotel was very nice.  friendly and warm staff.  made you feel very welcome.  great comfortable lobby.  bartender at hotel bar very friendly.  room was great.  small as expected as your in NYC but very nice, well decorated.  comfortable bed and loved the shower!. Will definitely come back to this hotel.;5
My trip was great and the hotels was perfect close to Time square. They were in the process of some remodeling at the hotel to update the lobby and breakfast area at this time. The front desk and bell service was great;5
From the minute we arrived we were so well looked after. Our requests on check in were met immediately. Majid on the front desk was a real asset throughout our stay. We had a choice of room and chose the top floor which was reasonably quiet. Room was comfy, well appointed and clean. The shower was great. Over the Christmas week we used the hotel as a central base for all the attractions. It is so well located for the Broadway shows, Time Square and within walking distance to all the major sights and shops. The star of the hotel is most definitely Jeff the Doorman. He was always there to greet us with a smile and a handshake and gave great advice and directions. A fabulous experience. We would definitely stay at the Ameritania again. Thank you;5
Kind staff all around the hotel. No complaints what so ever. Our kids loved staying at this hotel. The closeness to all the shops and parks was amazing. The hotel even helped us calling for a cab to the Airport after check out.;5
I stayed in this hotel with three other friends.  My friend and I had an outside room which was a little larger than the inside rooms. Each had two queen beds. We had a very nice experience. I was pleasantly surprised that whenever we needed something we always received it. Yassin on the front desk was especially helpful.  Boutique hotels that I have stayed at in NYC have smaller rooms but I’m only there to sleep anyway! This was a very nice, clean and responsive hotel.;5
After several hours of searching prices, location and reading many reviews on-line, I finally chose the Ameritania Hotel.  I'm glad I did.  We were not disappointed.  Price was important because I needed two rooms.  One for my husband and me and one for our two sons ages 26 and 21.  Some reviewers said the rooms were noisy so we asked for a room not facing the front.  I did not hear any noise.  Very quiet. Slept great.  Our sons had a room on the 4th floor in the front of the hotel and they said it was very quiet too. Some reviewers said the rooms were small.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our room.  We had plenty of room for our luggage.  I'm a morning coffee drinker and was thrilled they had complimentary delicious coffee and tea in the bar area.  Not all hotels in;5
stayed here with friends, had an amazing time. brilliant base for sight seeing and the staff are amazing Jeff on the door couldn't do enough for us made us feel really welcome. and Javier on the bar was so accommodating. would recommend this hotel highly;5
This was our first visit to New York and I can honestly say you won't be disappointed staying in this hotel. The staff were lovely and very helpful. The room was clean and serviced every day whilst we were there, comfy beds and enough room for the 3 of us. They even left a cupcake for our daughter's birthday which we thought was a lovely touch. Great location your right in the heart of everything and Jeff well what can I say such a credit to the hotel, very helpful and knowledgeable, all round lovely guy he gave us plenty of advise on where to go and how to get there which made our vist a truly memorable one. The only one little downside is having no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but this did not have any effect on the fantastic stay we had at the Ameritana!!!;5
Stayed a few nights as part of our honeymoon trip. Room was modern and comfortable. Great location close to central park. Staff were good. Unfortunately, had a lot of trouble with the  WiFi that couldn't be sorted. Helpful doorman.;4
This was our first visit to New York and we chose this hotel because of the location. We were not disappointed. Only ten minutes walk to Times Square and close to all the sites either walking or nearby subway. The checking in was quick an efficient and the staff polite. Our room was 1019 which had no view. There was a bit of noise from the elevator but no street noise. The room was cleaned every day and the towels and toiletries replaced daily.  As someone who travels extensively around Europe I am used to tea and coffee making facilities in the room which were sadly lacking. Coffee was available for free in a morning from the lobby at Breakfast time. I thought the hotel was over priced a little compared to hotels I have stayed in the past but that may be down to the fact it is;3
"Excellent from start to finish we've stayed here before with our kids and we recommended my husbands brother and wife stay here 2 years ago well they've just had their 2nd stay everyone friendly helpful be back again"" hopefully "".";5
"I can deal with small rooms. I can deal with rickety elevators. Even the understaffing didn't bother me. I don't bother to write many reviews because I don't let most things get to me. But the service here was so bad it astounded me. I feel compelled to warn everybody about how rude the front desk is. I don't expect to be fawned over or anything crazy. But when I'm checking into my room, giving you my money, maybe don't be abrupt, dismissive and hostile. All i wanted was to get my room key. But at every stage of the interaction, the front desk agent who was ""helping"" me just got more and more agitated. I mean, snarky comments. Eye-rolling. Excuse me? All i was trying to do was give you my cc and get my room key. Normally a half undone tie isn't something that bothers me, but I";2
I have been stayed in this hotel for nine days. It was LITERALLY the worst hotel experience that I  have ever had. The housekeeper doesn’t clean our room. To give examples, the trash was the same when we check in the hotel and check out the hotel and again the housekeeper doesn’t close the beds. Also, I faced problems not only with housekeeper but also with reception. Firstly, the people in reception WERE RUDE. They do not help with your problems. In addition to that they try to teach you lessons.;1
The Ameritania was an excellent place to stay and in an excellent location!! The room was rather small but clean and comfortable. The design is modern / up to date. Front desk personnel very friendly and a plus that you can leave your luggage there on the day of check in/ check out, if needed.;5
Fantastic hotel perfect location comfortable beds rooms cleaned everyday. Emailed before we went and asked for a high floor was given floor 12! Incredible views. We had the best time and the staff r so friendly and helpful. Thank you!;5
I have never left a negative review but I feel that things need to be addressed so they can be corrected. First off I want to state the positives. The location was great we were close to pretty much everything we wanted to do. The doorman was super nice and helpful. Lobby was cute. I liked the shower. Now the not so great. Staff was super rude. There were hidden charges that they don't tell you about. No one cleaned our room first night at all and we had to ask them multiple times to have our room cleaned. We had to ask for towels and toilet paper almost everynight of our stay. Our airconditioner was broken so first two nights were terrible. Rooms are small and worn and in need of updating.;2
If it were not for the worst beds known to man, this hotel would receive a 5 star easily.  We were checked in and out by Majid, who was the best first impression any hotel could get. Majid was customer service personified. He did everything allowable to support a family with two small children.   We have been coming to New York City for 15 years. This month, I decided to quit my job and could no longer stay at our normal hotels. If not for the beds, this would have been a low cost option. Perfect location to Central Park, Times Square, and 5th Avenue Shopping.   Pros:  - Location, Location, Location - around the corner from the Brooklyn Diner, Pazza Notte, the Russian Tea Room, and so close to nearly everything. - Clean-ish - the beds, the sinks, and the tubs were clean. I may;3
Stayed here for three nights for our annual girls trip and it can’t be beat. The location is great, close to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave, etc. Close to the subway and great small restaraunts nearby. Jeff the bellman was great. Always greeting us and answering our questions. This was the best hotel for what we were looking for. Our room wasn’t ready at check-in(we got there really early), but we did a pre-checkin, they held our bags and we went to explore the city. I will definitely stay here in my next visit.;5
My boyfriend and I stayed at this incredible hotel over the weekend, and we had a great experience. It was snowy and freezing cold while we were there, so coming into the warm and welcoming lobby was the perfect way to defrost. We were consistently greeted by friendly staff as we came and went to and from the hotel during our stay. First and foremost, the location of this hotel is perfect. It’s located in Times Square and was next to allllll of the shops and restaurants! Now, the room: our room was perfect. We loved our view, loved the decor, and loved the mini bar! The bed was comfy, shower huge, and our room was pristine when we arrived. One person who really stood out to both of us was Jeff. He went out of his way to ensure our luggage was stored prior to our final departure.;5
"WHAT a nice surprise for a last minute reservation! My daughter and I traveled to Manhattan for an overnight stay to see ""Dear Evan Hansen"" 2017.  The accommodations were CLEAN, modern and economical. Staff was VERY attentive!  They made our trip a SUCCESS!!";5
Our stay was amazing! The staffs are very helpful and lovely. This is an excellent standard for a 3-star hotel. The location is also wonderful and convenient. This was a good welcome to New York, will definitely stay there again for our future visits.;5
Fantastic location right in the heart of all the sites.  The price was right, room was clean, and front staff was friendly and quick.  Great place for families.  So excited to find a hotel w/ 2 beds that didn't cost an arm and a leg downtown.;5
Our normal haunts were booked or way overpriced so the daunting search for price vs location vs size with full knowledge of how difficult it is to locate a nice room in NYC without draining the fun budget.  Of course this is not the Plaza but it is very well managed, clean, comfortable and in a great location. I witnessed maintenance touching up the normal damage caused but guests and carts several times.  Check in was very fast, all staff was friendly and willing to help.  The bar and bartender Xavier was a wonderful find.  Great drinks, excellent prices and good conversation. Keep it up... we'll be back.;5
The hotel is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The only negatives are: 1. the room is too small, 2. the room is dimly lit even with all the lights on and 3. the air conditioning does not work well - sometimes it is very hot, sometimes it is very cold. We shut him down because we did not know what else to do.;4
We stayed and the Ameritania Times Square for a long weekend in Christmas season.  Could have pain twice as much easily elsewhere but why?  Comfortable sleeping room, friendly staff, cozy lobby with fireplace to sip coffee and read in the morning.  On Broadway, easy walk to Times Square.  We'd go again!;4
The lounge never seemed to open. We were told 5 pm, and checked several times.   The breakfast eggs were green. Otherwise everything else was great. The room was more than expected. Rooms were spacious.;5
This is my third time to NY and the norm is that you pay for the location and not the size of the room.this hotel had both it's a few blocks from Times Square (5 minute walk) and the rooms are a very pleasing size with a very decent bathroom.the hotel is spotless and decorated in a contemporary style.all the staff are very helpful and the complimentary coffee and water in the lobby during the am was a great kick start to the morning.highly recommend this hotel for location and price. I would be very surprised if any person would be unhappy with this hotel.;5
Nice hotel, rooms well furnished, and great staff.  Jeff, at the door, took good care of us upon entering, leaving our bags before formal check-in and after checking out, and with needed directions before leaving for the day.    The greatest plus is its price as well as its location. Rooms are fine  and look recently remodeled, but like most New York City hotels, small due to the fact you are dealing with some of the highest price real estate in the world. Hundreds of restaurants are located close-by, Times Square,Central Park, and the NY Historical Society and Natural History Museum are within walking distance.  Also, the Late Show with Steven Colbert, at the Ed Sullivan Theatre, is also close by.    Lobby is small, but  tea and coffee are available throughout the morning.  Did;5
This is one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed at in NYC. Much nicer than any of the major chain hotels! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Location is excellent, rooms are a good size and bed is quite comfortable.;5
Stayed from 3rd to 8th December on our sons recommendation.  Got a yellow cab from JFK into this marvellous city, very busy, slow journey.  Arrived at Ameritania to be greeted by Jeff the concierge who took our bags and showed us to reception.  Quick, efficient check in, our room 1105 on 11th floor was ready although we were early.  Pleasantly surprised at the large size of our room.  Minor criticism is although there is a good sized wardrobe with hangers there is very little drawer space.  The two bedside tables would be better as drawer units but this wasn’t a major problem.  The room had double aspect views onto the street - reasonably quiet at night. Nothing kept us awake after walking around New York all day. Good size bathroom with good toiletries.  Jeff is a mind of;5
Overall, we are pleased with our 3 day stay at the Ameritania. The location is great. Close to Times Square, restaurants, shows and the subway, the hotel is tucked away from the busier streets and hustle of the city, yet you're right there. Jeff the doorman added the personal touch to our stay. He was cheerful, friendly and took care of our luggage until our room was ready. The room had an enormous beautiful mirror in the room. It was was decorated attractively and was comfortable. Bedding was plush and inviting. Room (and bathroom) was very clean. Elevators were close by and came quickly, even when they were busy.  If you want a quieter room, opt for one of the interior rooms. We had an option to do that, but chose to have a view instead. The view wasn't worth the tradeoff-;4
Amazingly comfy beds, great location, helpful staff. Jeff, one of the lobby/door staff was incredible. Friendly and full of great recommendations that made our trip even better. Easy walk to get to shows, Times Square, Central Park and more.;4
Enjoyable stay at the Ameritania. The hotel is located on the corner of Broadway just a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park. The reception area is bright and welcoming with free WiFi and coffee and tea in the mornings. The staff were all friendly (which is not always the case in NYC), particularly Geoff who’s recommendations for places to eat were spot on. The rooms were big enough for a few days stay, but there was no storage space other than the hangers in the cupboard - no drawers for t shirts etc. Also the aircon unit was very noisy so we could not leave it on at night. Overall a good place to stay in New York. Reasonably priced and a great location.;5
I have only stayed at a few hotels in Manhattan but have been coming here for 13 years.  This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at.  The elevators are so fast!  The decor is very cool. So many places to sit and relax and visit with your group in the lobby at the end of the day. The location is a little away from the hustle and bustle of time square which I appreciate but its so close at the same time.  Love the close proximity to the subway and starbucks. The price was also more reasonable than other hotels I have stayed at.  Would recommend this place very highly!;5
"the beds here are atrocious with the frames jutting out causing you to trip constantly !! As the room we stayed in initially was very small this happened A LOT !! We were moved to another room which was a little big bigger ! We had breakfast on the first morning & it was average the choice limited.  The rooms hospitality tray had the option along with the usual cold drinks & snacks to purchase a "" sexual aids to enhance to your stay ! Very Classy !! (NOT !!!! )";2
We travelled to the Ameritania at Times Square for our honeymoon. The location is fantastic, 5 min walk from Times Square, 5 min walk from Central Park, all round fantastic location.  Beds were very comfortable.  Door staff were very helpful all the time.  Even got a little honeymoon gift from the hotel, having mentioned on booking it was our honeymoon, didn’t expect anything but very greatful.  Can’t wait to return;5
Stayed for 4 nights couldn’t fault a thing.Jeff is so helpful.All staff are great.enjoyed the cocktails.Location is perfect for exploring....will definitely return again.The complimentary coffee sure helped to start the day;5
Feces, mold and temp control dont work.  We checked in on Sunday the 11th.  Checked in went to room left luggage and went out.  Set temp control before we left to 65.  Came home at 12:30 with two small children after Christmas shows and walking and the room was 77 degrees...  kids exhausted and put to sleep / tried.  Woke up tired hot and miserable.  Go to shower and find mold in shower, sheets I fell into being so tired had feces on them, and heat was still 77!  Mentioned this to the front desk and hey said they would investiagate and get back to me.  Long story short the essentially called us liars, everything worked, no mold and feces were not there when we checked in.   Thanks no thanks.  Don’t stay here.;1
Everything you want in a hotel.   Friendly staff,  clean room,  comfortable bed with plenty of pillows,  and nice bathroom in a good location.  Jeff, our doorman was extremely helpful with transportation to and from the airport,  restaurants,  sightseeing and subway routes.;5
Comfy beds and pillows.. really hot water and nice shower with waterfall and hand held fixture. Great location!! They offer breakfast and happy hour at the bar each night. Staff was super friendly. I’d stay here again!!;5
Everything was great perfect location just around the corner from Times Square, lovely and clean, reception staff always pleasant door man on evening we arrived was wonderful and helpful would definitely staff here again.;5
"Very disapointed .... , the room was to small  It very  comfortable  ... bath room  very little space ....  no wif.... TO  used it   must be at the recieption  not very prive   to talk . Bar is not open at all times ;; breckfast  everyday  you eat the same thing. .... I could nt  have lunch at this hotel nerver saw want they propose , its like no resturant at all .;;";3
We just spent a weekend in the Times Square area of New York at the Ameritania. The hotel is well located for proximity to Broadway theaters and Christmas holiday landmarks like Rockefeller Center. The rooms are comfy but not an extra inch of space. I had read prior reviews stating that the front desk people were cold and I must say, I totally agree. I'm not sure if they are told to be that way or it is just coincidence. There is a bar that serves wine and beer and at $14 for two glasses of wine and $5 for a bottle of beer. I think this is the bargain of the city. There is a breakfast buffet for $18 which will fill you up but is a little light on fresh fruit. They do have a  waffle maker which is always a favorite of mine(but only fake syrup). Our rooms were quite expensive but;4
My wife and I spent 5 nights at Hotel Ameritania for our trip to New York. It is excellently located close to Times Square, making many of the city’s attractions, especially the theatre district, within easy walking distance.  Initially, we were booked into a nondescript room on the 3rd floor, but the pleasant hotel receptionist readily agreed to move us to a bigger, street-facing room on the 11th floor after the first night. The higher up the room, the more you leave the noise of the street behind, the better to help you sleep. We didn’t avail ourselves of any other of the hotel’s facilities, like the gym, bar, breakfast (too expensive at $20 per person) or WiFi (again too expensive at $9 per day). We likewise avoided the expensive mini-bar provided in our room. Our eventual;4
Visited here back end of November, decent enough hotel good rooms , great bed and bathroom. Not the greatest hotel but does the job. Free water and coffee. The bar in the hotel is ok cheep bottles 5dollars no draught... Staff on reception not the best , no interaction with guest sure their robots. Staff on the doors are much much better really helpful and friendly especially Julian and Jeff . Hotels in a fantastic location with a decent bar next door (3 monkeys)and great eating places very close by..;4
I love the hotel and stay here every time I come to New York City.  The location is great, staff is always helpful, and room is comfortable, big, clean, you can't ask for anymore.  Mourad is helpful from arranging cars, pick up at airport, or anything else you may need.  I would recommend it to anyone going to New York City.;5
Nice hotel, great location. Stay five nights at the hotel with two kids (4-year old and 6-year old), easy to get to Time Square and Rockefeller.  Staff/Service wise, I could not say that they're all that great and I would have rated lower had it not been for three outstanding staff members who are an absolute asset to your company.  Julian and the other gentleman who was on with him on Saturday 2nd December, Julian was very helpful after 30-hours of (very stressful) travel from New Zealand. He made sure that we were OK checking in, getting the bags up to the room and throughout our stay was the only staff member to always greeting me and my children with a smile when we got back to the hotel after a long day exploring the city.  Jeff was also very helpful, was another friendly;5
We have just arrived back from this hotel and we are that impressed we are looking to go back next year  Location is perfect, right next to times square, right in the middle of everything you need (don’t get me wrong there is still a lot of walking but you’re in New York)  The concierge Julian is fantastic, so friendly and will do anything to help you out, he was such a pleasant person to see every day  The rooms are a reasonable size and did 2 of us quite comfortably and we even had our suitcases laid out on the floor (iron, hairdryer and toiletries are provided)  The lobby is a nice place to go for early evening drinks (open 5pm onwards) and they have offers buy one get one free etc   Overall our stay was very enjoyable and we will be returning next year;5
Spending our 50th birthday in NYC and at the Ameritania was a GREAT trip. The hotel treated my BFF and I like princesses, from a great room with a view to cupcakes and wine. We can't speak more highly of this hotel except to say AMAZING.;5
We stayed at this property for 10 nights before we finalized our apartment. The reason we kept on extending our stay here was because of so many reasons - very courteous and hospitable staff, they help in luggage loading and checking-in (very rare in NY). The rooms are spacious enough in comparison to the city standards, they have a great taste in interiors (very nicely done lobby and rooms), all kind of services and amenities and they are located at a very convenient location which makes traveling around very easy. And it is not very expensive too considering we were staying during festival.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to all who are traveling to nyc and are looking for a 4 star options. P.S. We booked through hotels.com and bookings.com and we got great deals and;5
The only good thing about this hotel is that it's close to everything.Theres no Wi-Fi in rooms,rooms are dull,My view was a wall with Windows.The front desk staff that booked me in wasn't friendly or welcoming.House keeping never came to our room once I had wait till I spotted one and asked for the room to be clean and clean towels. Over all you could get a way better hotel for less than I paid to stay here.I would not stay here again;2
Avery large room for a hotel in NYC.  Mattress needs to be updated and more lighting in room, but overall this is a great place to stay.  Very conveniently located.  5 min was to Central Park, 10 min walk to 30 Rock and 7 min walk to heart Of Times Square.  Staff was extremely helpful.;4
Great location - Easy walk to Time Square & Central Park. Comfortable bed & a fairly large room. Toiletries & hairdryer provided.  Near to some good diners which is handy for breakfast. very helpful & friendly staff.;5
Fabulous hotel in the perfect location. Beds were like sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom was beautiful and the concierge first class. Would definitely stay here again. Everything was within walking distance with lots of diners for breakfast at reasonable prices in the locality.;5
Best kept secret. Priced right. Great location. Room small but adequate. Rain shower was great. Never a wait to check in or for the elevator. Staff very helpful. No hustle or bustle. Will definitely stay here again.;5
Hotel was nice, especially concierge. Front desk worker was a jerk. wish their was food option in hotel, and more restrooms. Shower was modern and cool. Bed was decent. near decent resturants, which was great.;4
I already answered this question.   Staff were wonderful.   Was not happy that I was charged for my room B4 I checked out and without my permission to do so.   This put my card over the limit and then I was charged again when I checked out,   saying that the 500 would go back on my card in 4-5 business days.   This card was to be used exclusively for my trip and the charges put on by the staff checking me in caused my card to be over the limit and I could not use it for shopping in New York the last day I was there.;3
Great location in the heart of Broadway Very clean and comfortable room! You will not be disappointed with the accommodation. WiFi access is a PLUS (no additional cost) Updated amenities Would definitely stay here again!;5
The beds are awesome and the staff was helpful and amazing. Outside the hotel was noisy, but the hotel has complimentary ear plugs. At checkout, the front desk staff and doorman made sure we had a smooth checkout and a ride back to the airport. When I go back in a few months, I will definitely want to stay there.;5
The guests should be informed that they need to notify the front desk that they want housekeeping services. Other then that we enjoyed the lounge area and bartender and Jeff at the front door who was extremely helpful in our inquiries and arranging our early departure.;3
Very good hotel, just needs tea/ coffee facilities in the room for first thing in the morning The hotel is in an excellent spot and the door man called Jeff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the city.;4
The location was fantastic, beds were really comfortable. Room was extremely small and the heater/air was so old and loud. Overall, I was so happy to have stayed there. Within walking distance to everything for. A great price!;4
Perfect location close to transit, Central Park, Theater, and Time Square. Everyone was super helpful and nice. The room was nice and the beds especially comfortable. Can’t wait to return! An additional perk was they had a great rate for a car to La Guardia and so they booked it for me. When a limo showed up to take us to the airport, my grandson was thrilled.;5
I would come back I would recommend it to my family and friends Great price for location and cleanliness Nice shower, heater not too noisy, doorman friendly and always present at the door, ready to help and very welcoming;4
Girls shopping trip....Less than a block off Broadway near metro stop and 3 short blocks to the excitement of Times Square. Accommodations were modern and clean, staff goes above and beyond! One of the best experiences I have had in Manhattan. Cannot wait to return!;5
I stayed here with my fiancé in November and had such a wonderful experience. Hotel is clean, comfortable, and staff goes above and beyond! Reception is always available to help and will direct you to the best tours, shows, and restaurants. My fiancé loved the location as we were close to the shopping center on 5th ave as well as a short walk to both Central Park and Times Square. What really stood out was the assistance from the front office manager Vanieta. We had a little inconvenience with our room and she acted fast to resolve it. Upon our return to the hotel, there was a note + surprise for our inconvenience. We really were blown away by the service from all staff, bellmen were great and so was housekeeping. We will return next year and we won’t stay anywhere else in NYC!;5
Brilliant hotel, location was great couple of blocks from Central Park and couple from Times Square. Rooms very coumfortable only issue was the window wouldn't close properly which led to noise from street outside but this was a very small issue. Will defiantly go back to this hotel;5
Stayed here for 3 days and had a great experience starting from check-in to check out. I showed up at the hotel early, around 8:30am, and was immediately given my room as it happened to be available. This was very welcome as I had gotten off a transatlantic flight. Staff are very welcoming and professional. The doormen (and Jeff in particular) greet the guests with big smiles. My new favorite hotel in NYC. The service here equals that of 5-star hotels. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends.;5
The room 1218 was very small for 3 young adults, dark room rubbish lighting with an awful view of a wall! and very very very hot and stuffy!!!. The Air con gave us sore eyes and throats and awful humming noise 24/7, we was pretty much itchy the whole time we was in the room too!;3
Excellent front desk staff, clean and comfortable room, great location to Times Square and Central Park. I will stay here again on future visits to New York City. The room was very affordable too. Highly recommend this hotel.;5
What a wonderful hotel this was I can honestly say that the only thing wrong with the hotel was there was no tea or coffee. The staff were great the room was clean and the breakfast was good.  While we were there we went on a tour to all the hot spots and the tour guide was brilliant his name was Julienne i would definitely recommend the tour to any one who goes there especially if you like walking.;5
Great location near to Time Square and Central park. Easy to get to from the airport (arrival at Penn street station, NY and then a 5min taxi). Didn't eat here. Clean and quiet room. Free WiFi. Looks slightly dated decor but we didn't spend any time in hotel really so doesn't matter.;4
Overall Fair but POOR Handicapped accommodations especially at the 3 front steps. The lobby and bar areas were eclectic and pleasant, Staff were EXCELLENT and very accommodating. The room really was way too small for more than one person;2
You get what you pay for I suppose, and this room was rather cheap for the location, but claimed to be 60% discounted because I booked at the last minute. If that is true then it's not that cheap at full price. The location is good and the lobby is impressive but the room was grotty with stained walls. At least the bathroom seemed clean and new but the room was not. 4 stars evidently refers to hotel facilities and not standards. I expected the room to be tiny but not grotty. I will not return.;1
"We visited this hotel as part of a short break to New York. The plus points being it is in a convenient position for Times Square and very clean. The minus points are, the rooms are small,with no tea or coffee making facilities, when we returned from a days sightseeing,we asked at reception if we could purchase a cup of tea or coffee and we we were told that ""there is complementary tea and coffee on offer at breakfast time"" ! The air conditioning in our room was extremely loud (good job I had taken ear plugs). The receptionists who we dealt with were not very helpful and rather obnoxious-something which we have never experienced on previous trips to the states. The doormen were totally different and were really helpful and charming especially Jeff- maybe they should be on";3
Great stay for a Midtown experience. Clean rooms with updated finishings and decor. Friendly staff and easy check in experience. Easy access to bars and street food. Ask Jeff for help with anything to do in the city and help with ground transportation.;5
My very first trip to America new york and have to say we really enjoyed our stay we Brita love our tea and down fall was you could only get a cup of tea in the morning and you had to go down to the lobby door men were brilliant desk people could be a bit more helpful had great sleep bed lovely views good all in all fantastic place;4
As this was my first trip over to the US I was expecting to be wowed by a great hotel with fantastic service. I wasn't quite wowed but we had a good stay. We were showed to our first room and quickly asked to change. I don't want to see a wall as a view!!!! The 2nd room was had a lovely boutique feel, if a little small. The view was much better as we were looking out onto Broadway.   There was also an error with our booking and we had to prove that we had breakfast, which turned out to be a good call as the breakfast set us up for each day we were there. The only problem is that the 'American Breakfast' ran out on two days we went the dining room, which limited our choice. When I asked if there was going to be more hot food cooked (we were well within the time to dine!) the man;4
I'd probably award this hotel 4.5 stars instead of 4 and you will see why that is later on in this review. I think this is a great hotel. The staff there are very friendly and are committed to customer service.   This was evident in an issue that was resolved by the manager in an expeditious manner. I also found that the guest service agents were welcoming and friendly. The hotel is very clean which was very important in my decision to stay at this hotel. Sometimes it's extremely difficult to find clean affordable accommodations in the big cities. My only gripe is that that there are no coffee machines in the rooms. I had a peanut allergy reaction to food that I had purchased at Cascades. I had to get up at 4am in the morning to buy ginger ale at the Subway restaurant as there;4
over all the staff is very helpfull (except for one front desk staff who is very rude and really has not profile to work in hospitality business). The bar staff is really friendly and kind. Bell men also helps a lot. The room size (king bed) is great for Manhattam average rooms. The bed confort is a plus.;4
Excellent location, excellant service...highly recommand. Door man from Marocco was helpful, and so were the staff. Had wifi in the room and room was adequate with big bathroom. Not far from Times Square and nit far from Central Park.;5
We stay here every time we come to NYC and when they are booked we walk by and cry while we are there lol. It feels like home and ALL staff are very friendly and very helpful! The Hotel is very clean and nicely located.;5
Back against and just as good. Great location and always welcoming. Clean, comfortable and well maintained. Just far enough away from the noise of Time Sq but an easy stroll to the park, 5th Ave and museums.  Very happy with my second stay;5
It was our first trip to New York City, and the hotel was in such a great area which allowed us to experience all of the touristy activities NYC has to offer!!!  The staff was extremely nice and very helpful. The bartender helped us with directions regarding the subway systems which we have never used in our lives. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful.;5
On Broadway . Near everything,central park 5 minutes , Time square 5 minutes. Metro station not far.  À lot of restaurant near . Hôtel lobby is beautifull . Perfect service at room and lobby. Perfect for familly;4
Very clean room. Amazingly comfortable bed and very well appointed. The room service is provided by another party (from my understanding) and this was a bit average and was delivered to my door in take away containers and a plastic bag. Only other fault is sometimes I would see vacuum cleaners and bags full of garbage in the hallway when the rooms where being cleaned. Other than this, the hotel was wonderful. Helpful and friendly staff, great location for all the tourist spots ands Broadway shows. I walked almost everywhere. 5-10 min walk to Times Square.;4
Stone's throw from Times Square, Bryant Park, Grand Central, NY Public Library, Central Park and 5th Avenue. This place was a vacation haven. We hardly had to sweat it. Yes we ended up walking 7-8 miles because its so easy to be carried away by the beauty of Manhattan..We literally walked around the Times Square on our coffee run every morning. The beauty of it all was breathtaking and this hotel is the best location for it all. The staff were very friendly and Jeff especially was such a great help, be it for directions or things in general! Thank you Jeff.  One great point about this hotel..rather 2 great points about the hotel are - one, you just have to cross the street for subway and two, they hold your bags for free after you check out and you can pick it anytime you want;5
Stayed one night after visiting Met Opera (15 minute walk away). Friendly efficient check in. Bright lobby area with plenty of seats to use complimentary WiFi. Room on the small side but very clean with mini bar and enough storage space for clothes and suitcases. Bed comfortable. New bathroom with excellent shower. Some inevitable traffic noise. Overall great location and good value for money through hotels.com. We would stay here again.;5
My husband and I booked this hotel for 2 nights on arrival preparing for the marathon. As we were coming as part of an International Travel Partner, the following 3 nights were with a different hotel that we weren't overly keen on so we wanted our first couple of nights to be at nearby hotel so the commute would be easy.  We arrived quite late on a Wednesday evening and check in was a breeze. We had a king room on the 11th floor facing another building and we didn't get any street noise. I'm not one to want to stay in or around Times Square but I was happy with the location of the Ameritania as it was easy to get to multiple subway stops and just a short stroll from Central Park.  NYC rooms are notoriously small but our room was perfectly serviceable. There were a few bits and;4
heard great things about the hotel but arrived in the lobby where there were cheap and childish furniture and design. still hope that the rooms would be better but extremely small rooms with horrible views of pigeon poo and brick walls. wifi was terrible and heating absolutely pointless when we needed to dry our clothes after heavy rain. the only thing good about the hotel was that it had a lovely shower and was a short walk to timesquare;1
Great central location between time square and central park. Walk or short metro ride to all the tourist attractions. Cafes, restaurants at your door step. We got in at 7am in the morning and they were able to check us in to a room, which we really needed! Jeff at the door was so helpful that in our sleepy state, we didn't have to ask for anything, he had it covered.  Bags, the bag storage, leaving time, the car, etc etc. Enjoyed our stay. Tks Jeff and ameritania.;5
I needed absolutely for a free wi-fi net in all the rooms. If you travel for business it is the least you are waiting for the money you pay! The room was very comfortable, may be a bit old, but anyway very good.;4
We stayed here for 4 nights for my partners birthday and is was great.  The hotel is in a fantastic location  for Broadway and Times Square.  We stayed on the 6th floor, and our room faced onto Broadway. There was some inevitable noise from the street, but wherever you stay in Manhattan you are going to hear sirens and street noise. If you want peace & quiet, you're looking at the wrong city! The room was comfortable, and had everything we needed.  It was cleaned to a high standard, and the bathroom was modern and fitted with an excellent shower.  The staff we encountered were fantastic. They clearly understand what their customers need. From facilitating early check-in, to providing local knowledge, they make this hotel a great experience.  Jeff was particularly helpful and;5
The hotel is in an excellent location, with a number of metro stops in close proximity. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the hotel was generally very clean. Can't say anything about the breakfast as we didn't have it... but the complementary coffee was pretty decent!   The rooms were a good size, decent (if a touch worn) bathroom, with a nice comfy bed. Surprisingly for the location, the rooms were also pretty quiet, which was a nice bonus.   Overall, a very pleasant experience.;5
I was travelling alone and only had one day before my connecting flight, but really wanted to soak up the atmosphere of NY. the Ameritania is perfect for this as it is literally 5 mins walk from Central Park, 10 mins walk from the Rockefeller Center and 5 mins walk from the middle of Times Square. Jeff, the doorman is brilliant - he showed me how to get to the places I’d hoped to see and gave me lots of tips and the confidence to go out there, jump right in and have fun - I was a little nervous as I was on my own and am not used to big cities. I arrived at 11am, had some good complimentary coffee, my bags were put in the luggage safe for me, and then two paces outside the front door and I’m walking along Broadway! I walked to Central Park, bought a pretzel on my way to;5
Location location location! This hotel is in a great location. Close to central park, Broadway shows, times square, and all other must see spots. Jeff, the doorman, gave us great brunch suggestions. Front desk made the check in and out process very easy, and they held our luggage before and after check in/out. We really enjoyed The 3 Monkeys which is literally next door. Very cool spot with good food and drinks!   Bring ear plugs! You will hear the city sounds all night long. Housekeeping was a bit aggressive and entered the room/cleaned while we were in there after denying services. She also entered even though the do not disturb sign was on the door and without knocking.;4
Hubby and I spent five days/nights at Ameritania in August 2017, and we enjoyed our time there.  Pros 1) The bathroom was small but well appointed.  It had one of the best showers of any hotel we've visited.  The shampoo, shower gel, and soap were fantastic, too.  2) We enjoyed the location - 54th and Broadway.  We walked to both Broadway shows, restaurants, Central Park, and Columbus Circle.  There were plenty of subway stations to choose from, too.  3)  The room was small, as I would expect most hotel rooms are in NYC, but it had everything we needed after long days of sightseeing.   4) It was quiet.  We stayed on the 10th floor, away from Broadway and 54th.  We didn't have a spectacular view, but we did sleep well.   5)  All of the staff that we dealt with were polite and;4
We picked this hotel based on it's high ratings and were not disappointed! The room was excellent including a decent sized bathroom with modern facilities and a very comfortable bed, great after an active day.  All of the staff were very friendly and always willing to help and assist. Jeff helped take our luggage on our arrival and regularly chatted to us during our stay. He was very helpful in arranging a taxi for when we had to depart for the airport.  The Hotel is located closely to Times Square and not too far from Central Park.  Would definitely book here again if we were to come back to NYC in the future.;5
Location is perfect, centrally located between Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park.  Rooms are immaculate and updated.  Love the rainfall shower head.  Staff are fantastic and very accommodating.;5
"I felt that this hotel was in an excellent location for my city break and provided us with pretty much everything that we needed. The room itself wasn't too bad however was quite dark and there was no free Wi-Fi in the room; just in the lobby. Free coffee in the morning was great and the value for money fantastic.";4
A big shout-out to doormen Jeff and Mourad (and their colleagues), who are the very very best I've ever met: very helpful, genuinely friendly and interested, always in for a chat and full of tips and information.  Housekeeping staff also very nice.  Front desk staff on the contrary seem completely disengaged from their guests.  Rooms are decent size, and the beds are very good.  Unfortunately, the windows let in WAY too much noise, which in this bustling area in Midtown makes for interrupted nights of sleep (too much street noise in the room).  Bathroom was OK, but could do with a renovation (paint coming off, door stuck, a small leak in the shower screen, uneven shower floor).;3
This is a perfect location to see all the highlights of New York City.  We told them we were celebrating our anniversary and were given a lovely corner room on the 8th floor overlooking 54th and Broadway streets with complimentary wine to celebrate.  The room was very classy and the bed SO comfortable!  Lovely shower, good blackout drapes.  We were amazed at how quiet it was as far as other guests.  Outside noise...not so much!  Constant honking, sirens, whistles, beeps, etc., but that is NYC.  The subway station was right around the corner for convenient traveling, but Times Square, Central Park and other sites are within easy walking distance.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, attentive to any need.  Yes, the elevator is slow like everyone says, but it gets you there;5
Pleasantly surprised.  Very nice hotel and great location. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Jeff, the doorman/concierge, went out of his way to please.  Although it wasn't included, we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfasts.  Room service was prompt.  Thanks for the lovely stay in NYC.;5
The room was small and dark, and the view - nadda.... but it is NYC so expected.  The hotel staff were very helpful.  Wifi is only free in the lobby, but we didn’t mind chilling there checking our messages.  The room comes with a mini bar, umbrella and safe, although the safe is on the floor in the back of the closet so you have to get down on your hands and knees with a flashlight (no light in the closet) to access it.  We found the bed comfortable.  We didn’t partake in their morning breakfast as there is a deli on the corner which we enjoyed.   Their car service offered to the airport is a better rate than the one at the airport but we suspected that.  The location is really perfect for walking and subway.  Easy walk to Central Park, the Met, Rockefeller centre, MOMA, time;4
Great place as ever, stayed here for the 5th time. we stayed this time for the marathon which my wife ran!  The hotel was great, the guys on the front (Mourad & Said) are assets to this place!  We had breakfast here and it was loads better than before, options for bacon & eggs this time.  we had a deluxe twin and the room was great, front view on the 8th floor, even tried the steps a couple of times!  The hotel is immaculate, the breakfast staff were fantastic.  The reception team were polite & helpful.  The beds are the comfiest I've ever slept in, the bathroom was nice with a great shower.  Will definitely be staying here again!  Thanks;5
After a lot of travel issues getting to New York, Vanieta provided wonderful customer service!  Vanieta went above and beyond to ensure our hotel accommodations were in order after our nightmare of air travel.  I️ am already impressed and look forward to the rest of our stay!!;5
I was travelling solo to do tours and sight seeing in new york. Location of the hotel is ideal. Right on broadway, walking distance to everything. I was there to watch MISS SAIGON primarily and explore the city, and the broadway theater is just across.  Plenty of restaurants to choose from. Staff Tiffany and Jeff were amazing. The rooms were a bit small but I guess it’s expected in new york. Just request for a room away from the elevator so it wouldn’t be noisy. The rooms were clean, linens changed everyday.. you can get breakfast for a charge , I just wished  there were more choices on the menu..otherwise, I enjoyed my 5 nights stay there.;4
My granddaughter and I and my husband and I always stay at the Ameritania Hotel in NYC every time we visit the city.  It is very comfortable and the staff is very accommodating.  The location is great, close to Rock Center, Broadway, Radio City Music Hall etc.  we always enjoy our stay there.;5
Our 4th stay at the Ameritania and wouldn't stay anywhere else! Perfect location for Times Sq & Central Park as only a really short walk. We were there over the Marathon weekend so a fantastic atmosphere, The hotel had put the buffet breakfast out earlier especially for us runners which was very much appriciated! Massive thanks to Maurad & team who is always there to welcome us and makes us feel very at home!! Thank you and we'll be back next year I'm sure.One final note, the beds are the most comfortable i have ever slept in!!!!;5
Just the best staff. Nothing is to much trouble, friendly and so helpful. Ask for Majid he can organise and work wonders, sorted out my booking and even moved my friends to the next door room. Thanks Majid!!! They give advice on where to go, what to do and even posted a letter for me;5
"The hotel is well centred and ideal for a ""touristy"" manhattan stay. The staff were lovely especially Jeff who was on the door for most our stay, gave us lovely pointers and was an absolute gem. Would definitely stay here again :)";5
Everything was absolutely wonderful! The staff was great! We asked where the location of the ice machine was and the concierge brought it up personally! That was outstanding! Very pleased with everything!;5
This is a very nice trendy boutique hotel that central to the theater district and very close to theaters like the Neil Simon Theater and Broadway theatre! The hotel room was very neat and spacious. No issues with noise except the room cooler/radiator. I especially loved the fully stocked bar and snacks (available for purchase of course)!  Even so, it's still very convenient.They even had a pleasure kit amidst the snacks!!! Well what do you know! Great hospitality! The shower was very large and you definitely can't go wrong with the rainfall spa shower head.  The lobby furnishings were very fun, upbeat and trendy. I enjoy the smaller hotels around the city...the larger ones can be very crazy especially when using the lift.   My only issue was with check-in.  I had an appt at 3;4
Fairly small hotel in a great location. Situated easy walking distance between Central Park and Times Square. Free tea or coffee is a welcome service. Staff very helpful, especially Jeff who has been a Doorman/Concierge for many years. Feels like home away from home.;4
My wife and I travelled to New York for the first time on our honeymoon in Aug 2017 and stayed for 6 nights in the Ameritania. On arrival we were too early for check in so the very friendly and helpful doorman took our bags for storage and we went out to explore. The location of the hotel is fantastic on the corner of Broadway and W 54th Street. Within 10 minutes we were stood in the middle of Times Square.  On our return to the hotel, we checked in and were helped up to our room with our bags. In the room the manager Matthew had very generously provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and a card to congratulate my wife and I on our marriage. A nice touch, much appreciated! The room itself (10th floor) was large, surprisingly quiet and clean with a very comfortable;5
Very clean, comfortable and affordable.  Nice location, safe and close to Time Square.  No need to pay for fluff that is not needed.  I will return for any business trips or even vacations in the New York area.;5
I was please with the hotel.  The beds are SUPER COMFORTABLE! The location was convenient to just about everything.   Shout-out to the doorman, Jeff. He was wonderful. He was able to give us direction on anything we asked!   My only negative review is that the carpet in the room needed to be shampooed. We walked around in our socks and in just an hour, the bottoms were filthy. Everything else seemed clean though.;5
balance between services and price is negative only the location near times square and Julian at the entrance of the hotel are worth it. Apart from him, the welcome at the hotel was not warm and the noise in the room unbearable;2
We stayed here for three nights. Had a good stay, clean rooms, average sized, no issues with the mini bar (we didn't use it), friendly and helpful staff, Jeff was kind, the concierge at check out the same. Over priced parking as it is all over Manhattan, but free if you leave it for at least 24h. Same block with Studio 54. Just around the corner downtown on 8th you can have a good breakfast at Pick-a-Bagel and awesome coffee at Ground Central;4
We have just returned from a week long stay in a deluxe double room and are so impressed we are planning on rebooking for a short break in January. The room was more spacious than we expected in New York and all the staff were welcoming and friendly especially Jeff who helped us out with a transfer back to JFK at an excellent price.;5
On arrival we found our room had the most  amazing views. .  The hotel was perfectly placed for easy access to everywhere we wanted to visit.  Room was very clean, and the bed was the best- really comfortable! Reception staff also very helpful, booking taxi's etc.  Ali was especially helpful.  Would happily return if visiting NY again.;5
When we arrive on the first night, the HEAT was not working and the room was very cold (corner room Broadway and 54st), I had to report it 3 times before the person at the front desk could only give blankets and not solve the problem until the next day. The next day Adam chief of engineering came to the room and apologize for the inconvenient, he was very friendly and willing to help, he fix the ac in seconds and offered us Free WIFI or Breakfast, we choose breakfast. I'd like to report a lack of willing to help to the front desk staff, but Adam was great, great service attitude and willing to compensate the bad experience.;4
If you are going to charge high rates for a room, don't charge $5 for a bottle of water in the room, make the wifi free, don't charge $3 for a cookie etc etc. Are you modeling yourself after the hotel keeper in Les Miserables?;2
The lobby was well decorated with nice fancy colors. The lift was small, and took a long time to each floor. The room was small and the heating wasn't working. The bed and shower was very good. Jeff was very helpful compared to the staff on reception.;4
We chose this for the location, but what great staff!   It was a cozy room, but we were out and about so much it wouldn't really matter. Our check in was easy with great advice from staff about the locale.  The bar man shared a great restaurant for our first night there, just our style. But one of the bell men, Jeff, made our trip at the end.  He made sure our luggage was stored all day after we checked out, and arranged a transport to be there to take us for our evening airport reservations. I was really weary, during our trip, from six rounds of chemo over the last months. Just the comfort of waiting there in the warmth and kindness of the staff made such a difference. I can't thank you all enough for a great stay!;5
Sleeping was very difficult , no sound proofing with plexiglass windows , room located on the street side 11 th floor , at the front desk the attendent suggest a hear top , as the other rooms are not quiter;1
Stayed at this place recently and really enjoyed it.  It's in a great location on 54th and within walking distance of some great restaurants, subway's attractions and pubs.  The room was great, very clean and comfortable, the staff were super helpful and there was a continental breakfast and a small lounge.  Overall great value for money.;4
Wonderful location/clean and fantastic staff!  Only negative was we could not keep ac running. Minimal wait times on elevator. Clean rooms/clean and eclectic lobby area.  Check in/out was speedy and easy.;5
The Ameritania is a fine hotel.  Beautifull and clean rooms. And after a day of enjoying the city, its nice to drink someting at the bar. The bartender Javier was very helpful.  We can recommend this hotel!;4
Great Location just beside Times Square & Broadway and a very short walk to Central Park!  Hotel is lovely and clean, lots of amenities including free tea & coffee in the morning. Staff are friendly and very helpful  Our room was a little tight but all are in NYC - with handy storage spaces. Bed was very comfortable, the shower very powerful. Noise not an issue as couldn't really hear much at night.  If anyone was going to NYC I'd recommend here in a minute, and if I was going back - I'd definitely stay here again.   Perfect!;5
Very nice hotel.  Room was larger than I expected, clean and friendly, helpful staff.  Hotel is located near Time Square.  Easy walking to Broadway theaters, Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Enjoyed our stay and will stay there again.;4
Loved the Ameritania Hotel in NYC. Daughter and I visited for a fun girls weekend. The location was wonderful, the staff was even better! The only tiny thing was that it was noisy outside (although I am sure that is typical) but the hum of the AC was enough to drown out most of the sounds! We did not afford breakfast but the bar was also great!;5
Pros:  Good position near Times Sq and Central Park, two subways and coffee shops for breakfast.  Friendly staff. Quick and efficient check in and out.  Comfortable but small beds  Good double glazing and black out blinds.  Great shower and modern bathroom  Cons:  The brown hessian walls   The mustard yellow and black swirly carpet ... who on earth chose that!  Would definitely stay again;4
Stayed at Ameritania for 4 nights and it was great. The room was a decent size and the king bed was very comfy. Room service came daily even later in the day so I was pleased with the upkeep of the room which was decoreated very nicely and had lots of character. The bathroom was really nice but would like to have a shower door. But atleast the bathroom was modern and shower was all tile. nice Bigelow toiletries. I would've like there to have been a coffee maker with coffee in the room but walk  right outside and there are plenty of cafes. Our room was right across from the elevator so it was loud in the mornings and there was work being done (sounded like nailing/construction) right outside our door around 8am on a Monday morning so that was no fun. Outside noise in inevitable;4
I stayed at the Ameritania Hotel in Times Square, NYC from October 4 – 9, 2017. This hotel is amazing, super clean and the décor is really nice and chic. This hotel has a great location and you can easily walk to many touristy areas of New York including Times Square (for Broadway shows and some amazing restaurants), Central Park, Radio City, 5th Avenue and Macy’s. The staff at this hotel were awesome as well, including the front desk staff especially Yassin, the Bell Hops, Julian, Morad and Geoff. Geoff also arranged our car service for pickup at the hotel and drop off at the airport, which was greatly appreciated and reasonable priced. And course you cannot forget the Twist Lounge staff, Javier and Maura. The staff at this hotel certainly made our trip even better. Can’t wait;4
Hotel was everything you can ask for in New York. It was clean, perfect location, beds were comfortable, and staff was friendly.   The room is small, but has everything you need. The shower was absolutely amazing for New York standards, and overall the room was very quiet. We stayed on the 10th floor (not facing the street), and could hear no street noise.   We will definitely be back!;5
Excellent position near to Times Square and Central Park. Door staff very helpful and knowledgable, receptionist very welcoming. Bedroom clean with comfortable beds. Overall the hotel is a bit dated but given that we were out all day it served its purpose. Shame no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Room was very noisy at night with Road works outside.;4
During my stay in NY City, I got the privilege of staying at this amazing hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff certainly made us feel at home. All the staff was fantastic...Yassin, Morad, Julian and especially Geoff.  He arranged all transportation from the hotel and greeted us with a smile and welcome back, every time we returned. Can't forget the Twist Lounge....Javier & Maura were amazing as well. Hotel was spacious, exceptionally clean and way beyond our expectations. This Hotel is getting 5 Stars!!;5
Overall, we were pleased with our stay. Staff was very friendly and professional.   Room 507 sink did not drain properly (gross)!   It feels petty because they charge guests  for Wifi, over and beyond the room rate. I’d much rather have the cost embedded in my room rate than have to go through the trouble with the online form.;4
Clean and comfortable small bedroom, great bathroom. Just wish the lighting was better. The light bulbs were way too dim. Staff was friendly and the lobby bar is very nice. Location was perfect for our needs.;4
This hotel is in a great location close to time square.  The staff is very friendly, and Jeff is happy to hail you a cab anytime.  I  have stayed at this hotel several times  and have never been disappointed.;5
For 4 nights we stayed in little room 1222. Tiny but so comfy. Staff was extremely nice and our stay went well. Perfect location, 54th and Broadway. All kinds of everything a few steps away. Special thanks to our hero Hugo H for helping us with our bags, a great ride to JKF and everything in between. See you next time.;5
Wanted to be close to Broadway shows, restaurants and subway. Ameritania fit the bill. Excellent location.  Very friendly staff, especially doormen. Room comfortable. Many diners, restaurants were nearby. Could walk to Broadway shows. Recommend;5
The rooms in the hotel are quite small but very clean and comfortable.  The staff were excellent both on reception, the concierge services and the maids. Said particularly went over and above what was required when my friend lost her phone (she did get it back).  The hotel is convenience for the shows and near to several subway stations, its also in what appears to be a nice safe area, we didn't have any problems walking anywhere. I would definitely stay there again if I visit New York again.;5
Location is definitely the selling point of this hotel, close to Times Square, Central Park, and Empire State.   When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded and was in room 214, which had a bigger bed and bathroom. To be honest, I think a room on a higher floor would have been nicer, as we had the street noise and a view of a wall. The bathroom had tape all over the window, the mirror was cracked at the bottom and the shower fitting was broken. The bed was really comfortable though and the shower powerful, and the hotel was just a base really so had all we needed.   The staff were always friendly and helpful, the lady at the bar made really good french martinis so there was a nice atmosphere in the hotel. I would go back as it was a good base in a good location.;4
"The hotel was ""fine"" at best and most definitely not worth what we paid for it. First of all, upon checking in, the person behind the desk felt the need to confirm that 1 queen bed was fine for my husband and I. Two men sharing a bed is super confusing, I guess. The room was small but fine. The problem in the room was that there wasn't a fitted sheet on the bed. This doesn't hugely impact your sleep, but feeling the mattress creep in under your feet by the morning isn't exactly great. We figured they would deal with it when they made up the room the next day...but they never made up the room the next day. When I mentioned all of this at checkout, I was told they would look into why our room wasn't made up and we were sent on our way. So I'm out 550 bucks and left with 2 nights";2
Third consecutive time at this hotel at a deluxe king size bedroom. Position is excellent at a few blocks from Times Square. The hotel very friendly and the staff polite. Deluxe rooms clean and wide: highly recommended;5
The price for the location of this hotel was fair. Other hotels were extremely overpriced. The front desk staff and doormen were extremely nice and helpful. The rooms were quaint, not too big and not too small, and clean.;4
I have provided my feedback - please see earlier page. Average room, dark and dingy and toilet smelt. when told hotel staff. no one advised outcome or if they fixed the problem. Or upgrade to a different room, poor service given the amount you pay for per night,;3
The Ameritania Hotel in NYC is a great location for people looking for a hotel within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park. The location allows easy walking to both locations, Rockefeller Center, and multiple subway stations that make it easy to get around town. The service from the staff is excellent. The concierges were friendly, and the baggage handlers made sure to treat your bags properly if you needed them held for the day (shout out to Jeff who helped us out with our bags on multiple occasions in an excellent manor).   The complaints I will bring up is that some services, like wifi and breakfast, are pricey. I'm not a big fan of having to pay to use wifi at all at hotels. The other complaint is that you will hear the bustling streets all through the night. It;4
Nice find! Rooms were recently renovated. Hotel was clean, rooms well appointed. Room service, restaurant, fitness center. Hotel staff very accommodating. Access to subway, Times Swuare & Broadway all walking distance. Would stay here again.;4
Make your plans in advance, pay in advance, and this is a super value deal. Rooms are clean, well appointed, location super. Staff is friendly. Location is just blocks south of central park. Right near where Steven Colbert films his show.;4
Excellent location, staff are very friendly, especially Jeff, room quality excellent, very comfortable beds, excellent room service couple minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park, very central location.;4
"We were thrilled to realize we could walk to Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, the Theater District and beyond!  Subway access is within a block for destinations farther out.  The room rate was reasonable, and accommodations exceeded our expectations (yes, room was small but it is NYC and we weren't in it much).  We were greeted by smiling faces every time we went through the lobby.  We send a shout out to Jeff for anticipating our needs, and giving great suggestions.  Iced water in the lobby was a nice touch.  The rooms were impeccably clean; comfy beds and mini-fridge were appreciated.  We had an interior room and heard absolutely NO street noise, which led to restful sleep all 3 nights.  We will return!";5
I'm so glad I found the Ameritania.  I searched and compared hotels for weeks before booking a reservation, and the Ameritania was the perfect fit.    Location is great - a few blocks from Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other.  It's next door to the Late Show on one side and Studio 54 on the other.   All of the staff members were friendly and helpful.  I mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary when I made the reservation and when we checked in, there was complimentary wine in our room.  How nice!  The room was clean and the size was sufficient.  NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small, but the Deluxe King room was a good size for two people, with enough room for storing suitcases without tripping over them.  The bed was comfy and the shower pressure;5
Was a little nervous about what I would get as the price was very reasonable for the location. Was very pleasantly surprised. Great staff. Very nice place.  A couple blocks from Times Square. I will surely be back.;5
Excellent stay here. Great location in the centre of New York. Loved being able to walk to Times Square in the evenings and Central Park in the day. My friends and I all enjoyed the room which had a lovely view. Thank you to Jeff.;4
We just departed.  If you’re looking for a quiet hotel, don’t stay here. Windows are paper thin and street noise 24 hours.  Mattress on bed requires replacement  Shower was great and highlight of stay  Room generally stuffy and required noisy aircon to be on most of time.  Drink card a joke. $16 for 2 happy hour drinks and we got one free.  And then as we’re leaving a staff member gives me a card asking I mention his name even though he did nothing for us.  Suggestions -   1.  Given the price of a room, offer a free drink or ‘something, complimentary as a sweetener / inducement to stay there again.  2.  Staff smile a little more and do something to endear yourself to the customer;3
We have stayed in many different nyc hotels, and The Ameritania has been our least favorite. We have very realistic expectations for a hotel, but this one was definitely below normal standards for cleanliness & upkeep.  Pros: - Great location (midtown is a good area to stay in when planning to visit many areas of the city. As its name denotes, it's centrally located in the middle so it cuts commute time & many things are within walking distance) - Friendly staff (we haven't had much interaction with the staff but when we have they have been helpful & friendly.) - Windows open (this is typically not the case, and being able to let fresh air in during the temperate October weather was nice.) - Mini fridge did not have a weight sensor (items are charged only if seal is broken or if;2
My wife and I visited New York for our 50th. Wedding anniversary. It was our first time in New York, and the visit was made even more memorable by our stay in the Ameritania. The staff and service were excellent in every way. Hotel is superb, cannot recommend highly enough. A nice touch was the card and wine presented to us on our anniversary.          Alistair & Jean.           Scotland;5
Great find for the value and location in NYC.  We were only there one night but it was a perfect spot to rest and explore NYC. Rooms and bathroom S were cute and modern. And the beds were very comfortable.;5
We really enjoyed our three nights at the Ameritania it is a very old hotel that has definitely been renovated to be more modern. The room is cozy and did the trick for what we needed. Will say that their all of their bellmen were incredibly kind and welcoming and Jeff quickly became our favorite. Also the hotel is incredibly convenient to walking to various subways and easy trek to Times Square. We would definitely stay again!;5
My daughter and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is not big or fancy, but very stylish and clean. The rooms were compact but very well appointed with a great shower! For being in such a central location the rooms were very quiet. I come to New York regularly and this was one of the best value hotels I have stayed at in the past 5 years. The staff was helpful, especially Julian who helped us get a car to LGA. We had a problem with the toilet the first night and someone came up to fix it immediately.;4
Me and my girlfriend stayed here in September for 4 nights, We jumped on a bus from the airport and it dropped us off near Times Square, we got lost as we didn't have a map bur it was about 5 minutes walk away once we got our bearings. Staying near Times Square is a good idea as you always know where you are and your close to the action. The hotel was really nice with friendly staff and bars and restaurants next door, YOU GET FREE WI-FI IN THE LOBBY. It's about 10 minute walk to Central Park and right on 8th Avenue which was our favourite road for bars and action. We got the Hop on Hop Off  bus Tour package for 3 Days, with the boat trip which was our highlight and Rockerfella Centre. Catching the subway is the fastest and cheapest way of getting around New York, Brilliant city,;4
Very clean, hip, great location just blocks from the southern edge of Central Park. Didn't break my budget. Staff were friendly. I had a late check in and called a few days before to ask for an upper floor. When I checked in around midnight, there was a paper taped to the desk with my room request already addressed. I was so pleased! I'll look for this hotel  again!;5
Recently traveled to New York for a business trip.  Excellent location to Times Square.  Javier the bartender was outstanding.  Great recommendations of eating and tourist attractions. Room was great, staff extremely attentive.;5
"The hotel was perfectly situated for all things midtown. Rooms were updated; great rain shower and Bigelow products. Front desk staff were generally very friendly as were the door man and bell hops. Delays in room cleaning bring the rating down a bit but overall would recommend. Javier the bartender at the lobby bar was exceptional; friendly and gave great restaurant advice.";4
"We stayed for five nights at the Ameritania. The location is excellent; never to far from anything. The staff was very helpful and friendly.The room was well kept and always serviced. We were on the third floor and the noice levels was not  problem at all. Easy to get the hotel from JFK airport using the train services. You will need extremely comfortable shoes to explore this great city!";4
Stayed here for seven nights in October 2017 with my sister. It was our first trip to America and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring a new city.  The Ameritania Hotel is fantastically located right in the heart of New York (literally a five minute walk from Times Square) and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The reception, restaurant and rooms are modern and stylish, as well.   One slight problem with our room was resolved incredibly quickly and one porter on the door (whose name we unfortunately didn't know) was incredibly helpful and always said hello to us and asked us how our day had been.  We definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to anyone visiting this incredible city.;5
I contacted the hotel prior to arrival asking for a high floor room and a rollaway bed. We had the roll away bed but were given a room on the 2nd floor which looked out onto a brick wall. The room we had was so small that when the fold away bed was down you could not get into the bathroom or out of the main door, in fact you really could not move! I rang reception to request bigger room but unfortunately they were fully booked right up until our last night. We had a problem with mosquitos in our room. So much so I was bitten 20+ times in one night. Don't forget your repellent! The reception staff were very friendly and always willing to help. The  hotel was very clean. Had breakfast here on our first morning which was ok. Not quite sure it was worthy of $18 per person though.;4
Spacious Room! We checked in late after traveling all day. The front desk staff was prompt and courteous. The room was fantastic! Comfortable king bed, quiet room, nice amenities, grwat location near Times Square.;5
"This is a boutique hotel with great value in price and location. The single room I had with one queen bed was ""European"" small but clean and well appointed with amenities. WiFi costs $9.95 for 2 devices. But it is the location that is the star. Adjacent to Times Square, Theater district,  and the Ed Sullivan Theater, it is extremely convenient.";4
Hubby and I scored this hotel at a reasonable cost on a sharing site.  The front desk staff were warm and welcoming.  We had a room with a view of Broadway....if you fancy people watching it was perfect for that.  However I now understand why they provided ear plugs as the noise from the streets was unbearable (Well its NYC)  Ive stayed elsewhere in the city and was unaffected by noise .  Decor was nice,  room and bedroom had ample space (bed was very comfy and had additional pillows).  Crowd at the hotel seemed more European and older....so the lobby bar was not booming...just saying. Mini bar stocked nicely too.  For us the location was perfect, it was central enough to walk and Uber.;4
Clean, spacious (for NYC), and modern by any measure.  The Ameritania offers guest rooms that are similar to competition on the block from Novotel and others.  As long as you are ok to forgo a fancy, but overpriced lobby and lounge (Ameritania has a small version of each), this is your place for half the price!  I cannot believe I’ve been staying in poor, run-down, bad location hotels in Midtown, when trying to stay on a budget, with the Ameritania sitting right in the middle of it all!;5
An unpretentious main entrance leads in to a modern open plan ,nicely decorated reception /bar /seating area . We were checked in by a curtly efficient, but charmless automaton who did not create a wonderful first impression. A lot of other reviewers rave about the staff..I found them so-so...neither better nor worse than anywhere else. The rooms were slightly on the small side , but this is New York after all, so maybe they were the norm.  Well enough decorated , just not a lot of space to store luggage or clothing if your stay is more than 2-3 nights. The wet room looked quite recently modernised and was fine except for the fact that spray from the shower soaked almost the whole floor, no matter how you angled it. Location is good if you want to be close to all the Buzz of the;3
an excellent hotel with good service throughout. The doormen were always polite and eager to help.Mourad was particularly helpful helping us to book a car back to the airport. I have stayed here many times before and have never had a bad stay.;5
Excellent location and very helpful staff, especially Mourad. He was available for any questions that we had and gave us tips on where and what we could do in the city. The rooms were very good with very comfortable beds that are well needed after a day long walk in the wonderful city!;5
We've just returned from a week's stay at the Ameritania Hotel. Everything in New York is expensive, so there was no quibble about price. This is the sister hotel of the Empire Hotel, so we expected similar. Unfortunately the amenities didn't match up at all. This is a far smaller hotel with only a breakfast room and a small bar. No rooftop bar, attached restaurant or feeling of luxury that the Empire offers. There was room service to eat outside food brought in, but with the whole of the Times Square choice of restaurants on our doorstep, who would want that? Our room was reasonably sized, but we either had to have the window open and endure the noise even during the night, or have the extremely noisy air conditioning on. We opted for the open window. The bed was very good and;3
The rooms are quite big for NYC standard. The bed was comfortable and the service and people were nice and really amazing. The wifi for a week was really stable and not once whacky.   I would really have enjoyed a more thorough house keeping service. I'd advice to put a focus on there. As well the location of the safe (bottom of the wardrobe) seems unfitting, especially if you have health issues.  An overall excellent hotel with tiny flaws in operating.;4
We like to come back every time to Hotel Ameritania because it's location is nearby => Time Square, Centrale Parc, Metro, and so an. Jeff, the doorman is a dream come true. You can ask him anything and it will be done:-);4
Beds were comfortable but the room was very, very small (I had to block the door to open my suitcase), view was terrible, water pressure wasn't good and it was hard to get a good water temperature (too hot or too cold), the room temperature was also either too hot or too cold, bathroom door handle was dangling,  and it cost me $500/night!! Plus I paid $40/night to park my car. The location was great so that's what you're paying for.;3
Truly amazing staff friendly and helpful. I could not ask for a better stay . Read views of bad . But after my stay  it was amazing. Bad reviews are people who can’t be pleased. So I love all of my trip & my room;5
had a wonderful week, hotel clean and tidy, only problem was with the shower screen not big enough which allows water to go over bathroom floor, in the hotel the staff were very helpful especially Jeff. close to everything you need to see, within walking distance to the subway and times square/central park;4
This hotel is kept very clean and is really friendly. Helpful staff, great location, incredibly comfortable bed, I had no problem sleeping. Location is great, wi-fi worked well. This was my second stay at the ameritania and it's been great both times.;4
"Great staff; clean comfortable hotel.  Jeff the doorman help tremendously providing great insights to the area, helped plan our subway travels, great restaurant suggestions along with great insights into the area, what to do and what to see.  THANKS and commend him for us.";5
My brother and I visited this hotel on a road trip from England - it was our last stay, we were very tired and exhausted from travel.  Elena and Majid were incredibly kind and welcoming to us both, and very much made us feel at home at the hotel, as well as giving advice about where to go in the city!  We were in a high room, so there was no traffic noise and the hotel is brilliantly located for Times Square and walking around the city as well as using the subway to visit downtown.;5
I stayed one night and it was a very comfortable modern room. The bathroom had a waterfall shower which was great. The lighting in the bathroom is dim but the the full length mirror by the bed helps with the process of getting dress and doing your makeup.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 4 days. Our stay was great, with a few complaints. The breakfast... OVERPRICED. $18+HST for scrambled eggs, sausage, and potatoes. The shower was another issue we had. Only one door to the shower, so everytime floor got soaked. Other than that, the hotel was great. JEFF WAS AMAZING. Very helpful and knowledgeable.;4
We stayed 8 nights at Ameritiania in July 2016. We had the most pleasant time there. Our room was on the higher floor, so the city noise was not a problem for us. We were able to wak from here everywhere, to Times Square and Central Park. The staff made our stay very pleasant and big thanks to Vladi and Elena and Alaa, who were all very helpful thourought our stay. We liked the hotel's decor and the rooms were very clean and well equipped, although its size was small, only 11m2. We liked high quality toileteries and we had our breakfast once there. I recall it was ok, but we preferred to eat somewhere else. Overall, great stay for the reasonable price for NY, especially in pea time, so if you need a pleasant hotel in the heart of Manhattan and don't expect big rooms, as you tend;5
This hotel is well situated - close to everything including great restaurants and pubs. The bell hops are very friendly and give great advice.  I found the check in staff slow and didn't speak English well so communication was a little frustrating. The room we stayed in was super super small - we were unable to leave a suitcase open because there was no floor space!;3
Best possible place regarding Midtown, nice, but small rooms with too much heat,( ac a little difficult to manage) but what really matters: excellent service and friendly professional staff - especially the bellman Said Jalal Mourad and bartender Maura made a good time for us. The lobby is nice with good conditions, also while waiting to leave for further travel. Clean and proper,  We recommend it to anyone who wants a good place in centre of NY.;4
Ameritania was great, you can walk to most attractions from here or get in the subway and explore the city.. all theatres are very close, and times square was really close too. We had a great stay in here;4
Very friendly staff, clean rooms and a perfect location. The hotel did exactly what it said on the tin, and I wouldn't hesitate to book a room here for my next trip to NYC - which I hope is very soon.;5
As a NYC local, I’m hard to impress. Ameritania was a surprisingly fantastic stay amongst a slew of other hotels along Broadway. Our bag service member, Jeff, was phenomenal as well as the bartender at Twist, Javier, (who made us a special cocktail). We are staying a second night just because the stay was so pleasant and our beds were so comfortable.;5
Great location to everything in walking distance Central Park, Time square, 5th Ave Hotel is clean and the bellman Jeff is the best. Jeff looks after you and takes care of everything from bags to cars to a friendly conversation. Jeff is the only reason I would go back there. Bar is only open at limited times. There breakfast is over priced for food sitting on warmers all morning.The bartender was very friendly. From the time we walked in the doors at hotel it was Jeff that provided all the service for us.Anything we needed and also directions Jeff was always there.The hotel doesn't have a restaurant and the room are very small but the location is great Thak you Jeff for making our stay remarkable;5
Considering the fantastic location (not itself beautiful, but close to lots of Manhattan's top sights) and the cleanliness and efficiency of the place, this hotel offers visitors pretty good value.  Our bedroom was quite small and we were tripping over our bags a bit, but the bathroom with shower was a decent size and modern. The A?C was noisy, but worked well. The bed was clean and comfy and, if you are in the city to be out and about rather than stuck in your room then this place could suit you well. If you're just after a good bed in a good part of town, this will do nicely!  Yes, we'd go back.;4
Great Hotel, Great Location, Great staff! it's my 9th time in NYC and i can not believe i didnt know this hotel before! will come back for sure next time!! clean, cosy, great location. staff especailly Denise, were friendly and kind! highly recommanded !!!;5
Just returned from 4 days in this hotel.  Location is excellent with a subway stop around the corner.  Time Square is only a few minutes walk away as is Central Park.  The room was spotless and modern.  The bathroom was gorgeous and the shower was excellent.  The room itself was small but that is standard for Manhattan.  We were on the ninth floor and the noise outside from traffic was very loud but we still slept ok (ear plugs were provided free).  The bed was extremely comfortable and the room nicely decorated.  There was a safe in the small wardrobe which was great including an iron and hairdryer.  The cleaning staff did a great job every day and left us with fresh towels daily.  The reception staff were very friendly as were all the doormen especially Jeff.  He sorted out;5
This place is ideal for central Manhattan. A few minutes walk from Times Square in one direction, central ark in the other. Hotel room was a little small, but clean. Service desk people very helpful and efficient, spent time to help us with our Fort Lauderdale hotel and flight connections during Hurricane Irma. The doorman always had a tip for places to drink, and the bar man Juliano has a little Black book of the best places to eat at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend a stay at the Ameritania Hotel.;5
Great accommodation, modern, clean, brilliant location - only 5-10 minutes walk to Central Park and all the main areas of Times Square. Very comfy bed, friendly staff, especially Jeff and Javier who were so friendly, professional and welcoming and made our trip. We had a great stay, would fully recommend.;5
Great hotel: it’s perfectly clean, amazing location and the staff is extremely nice. Thank you to Elena for the warm welcome upon arrival. Fully recommended - you can not go wrong with this hotel.  —-;5
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights, while we were in NYC for a wedding. The lobby was very clean, friendly and helpful staff, and the rooms were beautiful! We had a corner suite, which overlooked a busy intersection so there was always something to look out at. The rooms were clean and the decor was pretty. The concierge was VERY friendly, and helped us with our bags and greeted us every time we got back to the hotel. His name is Jeff. Very helpful and friendly man. He even hooked us up with a great deal on a cab back to the airport, and put our bags in the car for us.  The only thing I'd say is the breakfast was $18.00 a person + HST, which was not in our budget. From previous experience at other hotels, we expected the breakfast to be included. Therefore, we chose to;4
Stayed here for 5 nights in September and would highly recommend this hotel, will hopefully be back. Beautifully decorated, gorgeous decent sized room and bathroom. Clean and cleaned daily. Location perfectly between Central Park and Times Square.;5
Clean updated rooms but small, limit your luggage due to space. Staff was great as was location. I was surprised on my Birthday by two small bottles of Champagne and gourmet cupcakes in the room. Would stay there again.;4
Me and my now fiancé stayed from 9/29-10/1. It was her first time in New York City and this place blew her mind!   I've stayed in some very high end Caribbean resort hotels and the Ameritania was at the same level.  Clean, safe, friendly place that offered us two days of comfort and relaxation. The price I received and the attention we received from staff was hands down the best I've had.   My girlfriends birthday was the next day and they made it very special for us.   I then proposed to my girlfriend in room 810 and received a congratulations bottle of champagne from the hotel, incredibly thankful.   The morning before leaving the city, me and my fiancé has a chat with the doorman Jeff. He URGED us to work hard and travel the world. Very humbling conversation he had with her,;5
"When I first walked in it was super quiet & had a doorman opening & closing the door. I checked in very quickly and the customer service I received while checking in was efficient, room was a bit small but very modern & had a huge mirror in the bedroom which is a plus because as a female you always need a good mirror in the room. The rooms were very close to together that I can here anything outside like as if it was inside. The bed was extremely comfortable & loved how heavy the curtains were that they didn't let any light in, in the morning. When checking out, I first got out of the elevator and saw so many people & in my head the first thing I am thinking about is ""oh my gosh I'm not checking out any time soon"" but I walked up to the desk a female by the name of Tiffany asked";5
Ameritania is at a super location.  Times Square is outside the front door.  Central Park is only a few minutes by foot.    The staff were all friendly from check-in all the way thru the stay.  Jeff found us a ride to the airport at a reasonable price and helped load the luggage.  Great Stay!;5
Clean rooms and lobby area, friendly and helpful staff, fun decor, great bar and drinks were buy one get one free! Location was perfect for walking to Times Square and other big name attractions. Loved it!;5
Great hotel and really near to all New York attractions, we were just in love to stay there, and the personal in the hotel the best especially Yassir Ialata. If I return definitely I will stay again. The rooms are really clean and nice;5
We stayed in September 2017 and found it a great place to stay as it is right in Broadway and close to Times Square. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were kind, caring and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The doorman also organised our transfer to JFK for the same price as a cab but much more luxurious and the driver did make the effort to return my wife's mobile phone that she left on the back seat  of black SUV after he dropped us off at the airport. Phew!!! If we were ever back in NYC we would definitely stay here again.;5
The hotel is perfect if you want to be near Times Square, Broadway and Central Park.  The hotel itself is in good shape and the staff are great.  Given the age of the hotel, the rooms are understandably smaller than normal, but our room had a good layout.  The views from our room was limited, as it was an inside room, which made it quiet.  The only concern that we had was the room was usually last to be cleaned, which was usually when we returned just before dinner.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel for it's location alone, but add in the staff and and you have a winner.;4
My daughter and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for one week. The staff were very friendly. The hotel is very modern and clean and the location is fantastic, situated  between central park and Times square. The room was extremely comfortable with comfy beds and a big walk in shower in the bathroom. Julian and Jeff were very helpful. Julian pre-booked our taxi back to the airport for us which cost less than our taxi to the hotel when we arrived. Therefore it would be advisable to contact the hotel directly to book your taxi before your visit. All in all we had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend.;5
Stayed at the hotel for 6 nights. Check in was easy and the staff very friendly. Location is great with Times Square and Central Park a short walk away. Room was lovely and clean bathroom was modern and a good shower. Staff was very helpful and arranged our taxi back to the airport. Will definitely stay at this hotel again.;4
We booked this hotel last minute not really sure what we will get for the price. We were actually pleasantly surprised. We walked into the lobby and it was modern and clean. The hotel decided to upgrade us as we had booked the hotel thru a hotel app and did not have the option to choose a room type. We were pleasantly surprised again at how spacious the room was, for a New York City hotel. It was nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable. It had plenty of pillows. The bathroom was modern and clean and had a nice big shower with great water pressure. We will definitely stay here again.;4
The hotel is great. The staff are all very pleasant and friendly.  You cannot fault the location. Ideal location and very close to the subway and all the local amenities.   The room had all I needed! It was very clean, modern, massive bed and decent sized bathroom.  Thankfully the room had wifi and the wifi was fast.;4
Great value for a very friendly, good hotel. The check in/check out was easy, cold water available in the lobby, reasonable bfast. Rooms had everything we needed. Easy walking to Central Park, Time square and Rockefeller Center. A pleasant surprise for the room rate.;4
With only a 2 minute walk to Central Park, Times Square and with multiple subways around, we found this hotels location perfect.  The room itself was very big and the bathroom nice and clean. However, the room and lobby had a bad mosquito problem. We did buy a can of bug spray and that fixed the problem quickly though. All in all this was a great New York experience.;4
Just visited here recently (oct 2008), enjoyed the stay. Fab location, visited Empire State Building & went to a show or two ( young Frankenstein & mamma Mia). All within walking distance etc. Hotel was bijou, but fitted its description perfectly (smelled of cigars throughout tho) !;3
The location is awesome! Straight beside the times square but not to close to be in the big noise. BUT: No wifi included? How can that be today? That’s no service at all and actually unacceptable. Every “hillbilly-Motel” offers free wifi. And by the way, the rooms are very small and you can hardly turn around. Also there is water, where they charge you for and not even a fridge or something. I can recommend it for the location and the good room service but the rest 👎🏻;2
The location of this hotel is great - close to subway stations, central park and Columbus Circle. I had high expectation for this hotel based on its high rating. However I was disappointed the first night after checking-in. The front desk receptionist who assisted me checking-in and changing the room to a two-bed room had an almost-rude manner to my request of changing rooms..   When we went up to the room, the door was broken. The same receptionist came up and looked at it, and then offered to put us in a different room although previously he insisted that he only had one available room that night. When we went to the second room, I asked for wifi password, and he emphasized and made sure I understand that usually the wifi has to be paid but he will offer it to me for free.;3
Conveniently close to several subway lines. The internet was fast enough to stream TV and get work done, but it isn't free unless you book a particular deal. They offer breakfast for a cost and free coffee, both of which I didn't try. Elevators are slow, but there are three so the wait wasn't horribly long. I'd stay here again.;4
We stayed for 6 nights commencing 12th September 2017.  The hotel is conveniently located and our room was comfortable (Deluxe Double) on the 7th Floor.  For us the all the hotel staff were excellent. Very friendly and helpful, made us feel welcome and offered good advice.  The Hotel has a small bar, managed superbly by Javier who had a great rapport with all his customers and we enjoyed our conversations with him and other guests.    A mention to Jeff and his colleague on the door. Thanks for your friendly nature and help with the taxi back to the airport.   keep up the good work;4
I stayed at the Ameritania with a friend and we both loved the location. It's so easy to get anywhere from there, by using the subway, walking or taxi. It's a good value hotel given its proximity to major sites and broadway shows. We booked a deluxe with two double beds. The beds were extremely comfortable. The ensuite was very modern and clean and the shower was lovely and powerful. We expected more noise than there was given where it's located and only had interrupted sleep due to jet lag! I'd definitely return to the Ameritania on a future trip.;5
Great hotel, staff so helpful and location ideal for visiting New York city.  I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel again.  Beds were so comfortable after an exhausting day shopping and visiting sites.  Bar staff and atmosphere Great!;5
Firstly i will say this hotel is in a great location near times square and the subway.however there are many hotels in NY in a great location.this hotel has a a very low level of facilities,inc poor bar and eating facilities.my room was small with nasty decor inc vile brown walls.it faced a wall so no view and a poor level of natural light made worse by poor interior lighting-my partner struggled to do her makeup in the darkness.the room reminded me of a prison cell.on hotel staff,some were friendly and helpful others not so.im amazed this hotel ranks so highly on this site.iv stayed in better in NY and cant recommend purely on the basis of good location.overall poor.and poor value.;2
Big thank you to Rod for your great hispitality. We had an enjoyable stay. Comfortable bed, lovely bathroom and got upgraded. Amazing location, very easy to get to places from there. Only quarm is that there was no kettle and complimentary tea/coffee or water...;4
Hotel brilliantly situated on Broadway and near to Times Square and subway. Our room was smallest by American standards but well equipped. Outside noise was 24/7, probably a good idea to request a room not facing Broadway. Hotel staff were very helpful particularly Jeff whose local knowledge was excellent.;4
Small room. Minimal amenities. They didn't have razors or shaving cream, which I thought was odd. However, service in general was very good and if you're just traveling for business and need a bed, this gets the job done.;4
Great location just off Broadway & Times Square. Issue with hot water the evening we arrived but was resolved the next day. Small rooms made to feel even smaller with giant furniture, but very clean and functional. Service good. Don't breakfast here, very basic .;3
Hotel has has made an attempt at modern facelift in lobby and rooms.  Looks like its trying too hard to be modern.  Only real complaint with the stay is its in a very busy area and windows do very poor job of keeping out the noise.;3
+  very good location, you're in the middle of the town, close to times square (10min. walk)!  kingsize room is very big&comfortable, with a modern bath&great shower.   -  very loud (bad&dirty windows, street);3
Great staff, rooms, and excellent location to Times Square.  Will definitely return when back in New York.  I had a very easy check in process, great corner room with two views!  The front door staff were excellent providing directions, too!;5
Perfect location if you want to be right in between Times Square and central park. Amazing beds. Furnishings and staff are amazing. Everything about this place is amazing! The noise from the streets could hardly be herd from our corner room of broadway and 54th which suprised me. They provide ear plugs for you if you wish to use them as well.;5
This hotel was close to everything!  Just a few blocks walk to Times Square in one direction, and Central Park in the other.  They have a wonderful and helpful staff.  Ameritania is exactly what we were looking for!  The rooms were cute, updated, and clean. The beds were so comfy!;5
Although the rooms are teeny tiny the bed makes up for it and the location is perfect. You couldn't be closer to time square but don't worry the hotel is very quiet. The lobby has free wifi and is spacious enough to relax from a long day.;5
Location was excellent, staff very friendly and helpful, however room was noisy with all the traffic starting at 5am. Cleaning of room each day was not of a standard I would have expected. No dusting done hovered once in a week, and on one occasion had to request the room be serviced as it had not been done by 4pm so had to wait in lobby until it was completed.;4
This hotel was recommended by 2 different friends of ours and it definitely was up to expectations. It was in the perfect location for everything that we wanted to do - theatres, tours etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful.;5
Great staging spot for a visit to NY. It was super easy to walk to the conference center and back to the hotel. My Uber drivers had no trouble finding the place, and I really enjoyed spending time in Time Square and walking up and down Broadway.;5
We stayed at the hotel for three nights and have to say the customer service was amazing,the hotel atmosphere is very relaxing and the rooms are very well equipped (on the small side) but comfortable and decor retro and up to date,Denise the receptionist was very helpful and got our rooms ready ahead of check in,Javier the bartender was also very pleasant making you feel welcome and had plenty chat,The concierge Jeff couldn't have done enough for us from advising us on where to go,restaurants,shows to see and booked our transfer back to the airport I have never received service like it he was absolutely amazing 6*, I would recommend this hotel 100% and would definitely stay here again;5
I stayed here for a week. Without a doubt a great location, can't be beat.  Value - was OK, but expected for the great location. Always compare prices with the hotel's website, they have promotions sometimes.  Size - big enough to put my one large and one medium suitcases on the floor. Would be a bit tight for two people but doable.  Rooms - the blackout curtains are good, but they are in front of the air-conditioning and blocks it. If your room has this layout, try using the blinds instead.  Food - my room didn't come with breakfast but there are tons of places around the corner. Coffee is free though!  Great staff, especially Jeff the doorman. Thanks Jeff for the great conversations, advice and being ever helpful! Take care and all the best!!  We also enjoyed chatting with;5
The room was extremely small even though it was a standard Queen and not a standard one double (which is even smaller!). In order to go to the restroom the space between the bed and the wall was about 50 cm.  Additionally, in the room there was space only for one suitcase. The second had to be placed above the first and each time we needed to take sth out we had to put the one of the top down on the floor. No need to say that the closet was tiny and there was space only for a few items. The breakfast which is not included - as it is usual in Europe - was continental, served in plastic dishes and cups and costed 12$/person. Fortunately, just across the street we found Pret A Manger where we had delicious organic breakfast half the price of the hotel. In order to have wifi in the;3
This hotel was in the perfect location to get around NYC. Subway just down the street, a stones throw from Times Square & Central Park. The staff were always polite and willing to assist. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We would definately stay here again. We love NYC.;5
Basic accommodation in an excellent location, beds were very small, breakfast  option worth the $10 each. Front door staff excellent and helpful.  Guy behind the bar was great, but on one night there was a woman behind the bar and she tried to charge us twice for drinks very poor.;4
This was my first stay at the Ameritania and I chose it because of it's proximity to Feinstein's 54 Below as I was attending a show there. The hotel is a little farther from the Theater District than I normally stay but the walk to a theater and restaurant there wasn't that bad, and being so close to the venue for my late show was ideal. We were welcomed at the front desk and were able to check into our room early which was a wonderful surprise as it allowed us to freshen up before our matinee. The room was fairly spacious by NYC standards and 3 of us had plenty of room. The bathroom was well laid out with good lighting and the bath lines were nice and fluffy. The beds were very comfortable. I will definitely keep the Ameritania in mind when booking future trips.;5
My sister and I stayed there for 4 nights and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. They were happy for us to have the room a little longer on our last day at no extra charge. The doorman booked us a car to take us back to JFK which cost less that the cab.  Would definitely stay there again.;5
Great stay! Would recommend hotel to anyone. Great location not too close to Times Square but close enough to be near to everything. Walking distance to most things. Staff were helpful with any question and soo accommodating. Would definitely recommend to anyone!;5
We got in much earlier than expected and they were very accommodating.  They gave us our room at 8:00am no extra charge!  When one person in our party forgot their broadway show ticket the front desk printed it for us in minutes.  The room and bathroom are tiny but we didn't care we weren't in the room except to sleep and shower.  The location is so convenient we could uber anywhere in the city and it never cost more than $20.  The only problem was we did not prepare for rain and they refused to loan us more than one umbrella so half of our party was drenched.  Otherwise a great place to stay.;5
Stayed at Ameritania during four nights and will never return! My computer was stolen out of my luggage while moved by hotel-personnel from one room to another. The change of room was requested by myself and I was told to leave my luggage packed in the room. Upon arrival later the same afternoon in my new room I discovered that the laptop computer had been removed from my luggage and missing.   Most annoying was the indifferent and almost arrogant attitude shown by the reception staff and management. They simply concluded that their staff was trustworthy since they had been employed for several years and therefor couldn't be responsible for the theft.   No formal apaloghy or compensation was offerred. I am stunned by the ignorance and unwillingness to satisfy their guests!;1
We stayed here for 7 Nights for our Honeymoon (Aug 17)   First appearance as you arrive in the lobby is very clean and modern.  We had room 1112 which was on the 11th floor.  Bed was very comfortable, lovely to sink into after a day of walking around sightseeing. Room was always cleaned and bed made everyday, fresh towels.  Shower was decent and had 2 different heads to use.  The view from our room wasn't great, however this didn't bother us as we only used the hotel as a base to sleep.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel arranged a Taxi for us back to JFK for $65 which inc Toll and Tip which we thought was a great deal.  Very central but a nice distance from the craziness of times square which we liked.  We didn't have breakfast here however my husband had a few;5
The hotel is really close to almost alll the interesting stuff in New York. Very convenient for the price. You can pretty much walk to broadway or Central Park or time square. Nice bar and restaurants and club close by.;5
The location of this hotel makes it, it is ideally situated 5 minutes from Times Square and is also close to Central Park, there is also an amazing diner called applejack that is just the next block for breakfast. The hotel rooms are very clean and modern the shower is especially nice. Our room was however exceptionally small, I have looked at other guests pictures and realise our room was indeed tiny, not a huge drawback as you are never really there but still it was verging on the point of uncomfortable. I mentioned this to the staff upon leaving and to be fair to them they offered us a free up grade should we return. The room is quiet and we had no issues sleeping if you use the air con ( we did not) it's very very cold and very noisy! The staff were all extremely nice and;4
All I have to say is all the best. The room was big enough, the bathroom is brand new and clean. maybe a little noisy because it was on the 5th floor, but not too noisy for us. Friendly staff and Julian was very helpful. sometimes the wi-fi was a too slow. there was a complimentary coffee for the guests in the breakfast room which was very nice. Near Times square (10 min) and the metro and bus;5
Very good hotel in good location just away from the madness of Times Square but close to lots of restaurants,theatres etc. Amenities at the hotel were adequate as we came to see New York not a hotel. The hotel honoured our request for a quiet room ( if it can be quiet in NYC) with view. Room 1215  facing 54th street on top floor did this. Julian the doorman was always helpful and friendly. We stayed a week and liked to call the Ameritania home!;4
Great location close to Times Square. Overall quality facilities and service. Special commendation for the service given by Jeff the concierge/porter who has a wonderful demeanour and focus on greeting people and providing help at anytime.;4
We stayed at Ameritania Hotel for one week during our American road trip and we truly enjoyed our stay. We chose this hotel as it offered a good balance when it comes to location, cost and comfort – in other words, great value for money - and we weren't disappointed. It's close to metro, restaurants, theatres, souvenir shops and anything else that Times Square has to offer. Central Park is within walking distance as well. If you are a coffee drinker and need a cuppa before you start your day, Starbucks is just in front of the hotel. For those interested in experiencing street food - there are plenty of food trucks parked just around the corner. All staff members were great and welcoming. Javier, the barman was fantastic - we truly enjoyed our late night conversations after our;5
The location of this hotel is brilliant, minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park. There is a pub next door and plenty of food places very close by.  Check-in was quick and easy, and the staff were all very friendly and knowledgable. The room was clean and comfortable.  The only critiques we have, was that the room was quite small, so there was not much room once we'd opened our suitcases. Also, there was no free wifi in the room, which is a pain when you're travelling from abroad. Wifi is only free in the lobby.  Would definitely stay here again!!!;4
We loved this hotel. Clean, reasonable price, nice rooms, friendly staff. Best of all, the location - right next to Times Square and all the tourist attractions within easy reach. Very highly recommended.;5
I loved this hotel.  Location, location, location!!!  Times Square, Central Park, shows, shopping, restaurants all within walking distance. Clean room, comfortable bed, well appointed bathroom.  Staff was friendly.;5
This is our favorite hotel to stay in NYC!  Was there recently and very good experience as always.  Close to things we like to do in the area.  Very conveniently located between Times Square and Central Park.  Highly recommend and wil stay here on next visit!;5
Easy walk to Time Square, all Broadway theatres, supermarkets, starbucks across the street, & subway stations.  Rooms are small but neat, modern & clean - great because there's too much to see in NYC to be spending all your time in your hotel room!;4
Great location close to Times Square (corner with Broadway), overall a nice hotel. It is newly renovated and has a modern design, but the rooms very noisy because of the air co (even when switched off).;4
We stayed at the hotel for a week during our family trip this year. The location is of the hotel is top, it is very close to Times Square, Center Park, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue etc., but also close to Hell's Kitchen where there are a lot of good and diverse restaurants.  The rooms look as in the pictures. Everything was very clean and the we could regulate the air condition ourselves. The hotel offers free water, tea and coffee in the lobby. It is true that staying in the city center, you hear noises from the street, but it was not disturbing and each of us slept very well. All personnel was very friendly, especially the receptionists Majib and Matt. Matt helped us with several reservations and bookings and gave us tips for some good restaurants. The doormen were very;5
My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The hotel was clean, new, and in a great location right in the heart of NY, a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park and close to several subway stops. The staff at the hotel were so helpful, always giving great recommendations for day and night activities. We loved our 4 night stay in NY and can't wait to return again. We especially enjoyed speaking with the bell boy (which I unfortunately I can't remember his name) who was always so welcoming and full of tips. Looking forward to staying here again. I Highly recommend it if you're looking for a central, clean and reasonably priced hotel!;5
Great hotel, good beds!  Very helpfull people and Very Nice !  Ali was a Great help to us and Very Nice !  The location is Very good just at time squar and a small Walk away from central park. Very good neighbourhood ! Def coming back;4
In town for a few days to see the city and Billy Joel.  Very nice hotel.  Clean, quiet and great value ( had a August sale on).  Julian at the door was fabulous in providing recommendations and arranging transportation. Beds are excellent and rooms small it very clean.;4
We spent six nights here during a summer vacation - what a lucky break, finding this hotel!  We had seen reviews from several sites, and all were positive, so we booked two rooms for two couples (we travel together regularly).  The price was excellent for the area, the room was beautiful, and everyone onsite was incredibly helpful, above and beyond in every way.  Shout out to Jeff the doorman, we were impressed especially with his advice and interest in our specific needs, plus he's a truly nice person.  The hotel even provides ear plugs with the room amenities -- you may never have used them before, but you WILL, here.  Not that the noise is excessive within the room, just that it's a busy area, and you know, New York never sleeps and all that.  Sunday night was pretty quiet,;5
We were celebrating our honeymoon and stayed at the Ameritania for 3 nights before moving on to Antigua.  The hotel itself is relatively basic with small rooms but what you'd expect of a hotel in the centre of NYC. Location is perfect, close to times square, broadway, Central Park etc so ideal for tourists.  Our stay started off poorly as we had an awful experience at check in. We had booked the hotel over a year in advance and our travel agent had emailed to let them know when we would be arriving - 2pm so we had asked for an early check in. We had also specifically asked for a room on one of the higher floors.  When we arrived, there was no friendly greeting and the lady told us that our room was not ready and we'd have to wait. When I explained that an email had been sent to;3
we stayed in this hotel in November 2016, {an early xmas gift} and could not have picked a better hotel, location was great the staff were very friendly we had a beautiful room with a very comfy bed and a massive bathroom with the best shower we have ever used, We would use the Ameritania again no problem, we loved it!;5
We had been very well received by Ali at the check-in. The room had already been booked and paid over the internet through a Swiss travel organisation. This did no prevent Ali from upgrading us to the Junior Suite without an obvious reason. What a nice gesture! We enjoyed convenience of the additional space. Although the hotel building itself was built long time ago, everything inside is modern, refubished, very clean and tidy with the necessary amenities. There is no ice machine on the floor however, the reception staf is very helpful to provide it from the hotel bar. In general the hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. We would definitely use and recommend the place as it is very close to the next subway station, the famous musical places on Broadway e.g. Wintergarden,;4
Excellent Hotel perfect location was worried about noise on Times Square but didnèt hear nothing at night Staff very professional and friendly Rooms very clean and well equipped Recommend this Hotel and cant wait yo go back!;5
Stayed here so we could view a Broadway show. It was a great experience. Front desk staff and bartender were awesome. Rooms and bathrooms are fully renovated but the halls show the age. Noticed a slight smoke smell in hall and our door fully shut fine but did not seal fully tight. Old bones in NYC are expected. Beds were very comfortable with great AC unlike other hotels we've stayed in. Hotel was great in appearance, close to shows, food, stores, and a pub/bar.  Wifi is $10 for 2 devices but lobby has it free. I would definitely stay here again.;5
This was our first Trip to New York. My son was playing in Game Day Allstar baseball games on Randalls Island. The hotel was perfect. Staff were helpful, kind and courtious. They made suggestions to guide us places. We loved New York and hope to come back someday! Thanks everyone for making this trip special!;5
Very nice hotel.  Jeff was very kind and helpful, and room was good.  Close to the city and good room service.  I would highly recommend for anyone to come to this hotel if they wanted to stay in New York.;4
The hotel is convenient to theaters, subway and Central Park. Rooms are small but comfortable. Very clean Bathrooms appear to be brand new. The staff were excellent. Matthew the manager was very hospitable and professional.;4
Matthew was super friendly and accommodating, he upgraded our room to a 2 bed room with an awesome view. He told us all about the surrounding area! Even gave us a BOGO drink coupon for the bar downstairs. 10/10 would recommend.;5
We had an amazing stay. The staff at the front desk, bar and doormen were phenomenal. Very friendly and accommodating. Clean and quiet rooms. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling in NYC. Great location!;5
Jeffery and the team at Ameritania were fantastic. I would come back again and again for business or pleasure. Thank you Jeffrey and the rest of the team.  We arrived and asked for a bigger room and they accommodated and there was a summer special as well as an inexpensive car service to JFK.;5
It's our first time in New York and the hotel is in the perfect location for all the sights. On arrival we were greeted by a really friendly doorman who helped us with very heavy luggage. At the reception, both Majid and Vlad were so helpful. They  gave us a free upgrade on our room and free wi-fi for the teenagers which was very much appreciated. Our rooms were modern, very clean, with huge beds and luxury shower rooms.  Very pleased with the hotel and the staff were amazing. Would definitely stay again.;5
We recently stayed at the Ameritania during a week-long visit to New York.  We were not familiar with the property before reserving at the hotel, and we were very impressed with the hotel when we arrived.  The hotel's staff made an effort to get to know us personally during our stay.  The room service was quick and easy to order.  The room had everything we needed and was always very clean (the rooms are small but not for New York standards).  The fitness center is small as well, but it has 2 working treadmills, other cardio equipment and a weight area--more than many hotels offer.  We found the hotel in excellent walking distance of everything New York has to offer and the bellstaff was particularly friendly and helpful with recommendations.  When we got the reservation, we;5
If you're looking to be right there in the heart of NYC, close to Broadway shows, Times Square, Central Park, Stephen Colbert show, Madison Ave, Empire State Building, luxury and mid level shopping, restaurants, bars, etc, then this is a wonderful hotel to stay. Despite all this action, and the complimentary ear plugs they provide, you really don't need them because it is not noisy and we slept wonderfully in their incredibly comfortable King size bed!  I would highly recommend requesting a room higher up, as they kindly upgraded our room on our second night to the 7th floor instead of the 2nd floor. The first room was not awful, but really no comparison to the size and view of the 7th floor room.  My only complaint was that they don't have free wifi, who doesn't have free wifi;4
Had a brilliant first experience in the big Apple! Hotel was in a great location - easy for tube or just walking everywhere to all the landmarks. Few blocks from Central Park which was lovely for a morning run and to chill at. Times Square around the corner - not too in your face but great vibes. Would defo recommend as room was spotless and staff very helpful.;4
Had two week stay at hotel. Room was clean tidy and adequate. Hotel in good location and was easy for us to walk to most attractions. All the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. Big thanks to reception staff, who were outstanding and helped us print out our tickets for attractions. Also big thanks to the doormen, who gave us helpful information, as it was our first time in New York.;5
It has been our second visit to their establishment, as it has always been a correct stay within the average, the rooms begin to feel the passage of time, otherwise everything the same, the bathroom, perfect, and the location of the establishment its strong point . We had problems with the room keys (cards), of the 11 nights we stayed we had to go down to Reception 6 nights to reprogram the card, we were told it was by credit cards, but it was not true, we did not bring the keys Along with credit cards, was quite annoying. Thank you for taking action on this issue. We did not opt ​​for the hotel breakfast, since it was quite poor, plastic plates and glasses and very little choice. Thanks for everything.;3
While this hotel is a little older, it is clean, comfy, and updated as much as possible.  The doormen and bell captains were fantastic.  So much better than staying at the large chains.  The location was absolutely perfect.  Had I realized that Stephen Colbert was literally around the corner, I would have tried to get tickets.;5
The hotel was nice. Our room though could barely fit the bed.  Julian though really helped us.  We had to buy new luggage and he really helped us get everything together and called cabs for us when needed. Super nice guy. Hope management realizes what a great employee they have. Brian and Yvonne Carter.;4
The Hotel was very nice , clean and ideally situated  for sight seeing around Manhattan. Jeff the doorman was outstanding , nothing was too much trouble for him a great credit  to the hotel . We would definitely use this hotel again;5
This was my second visit to New York but first to this Hotel. The room wasn't very big but was clean and comfortable.   The staff were very friendly and willing to help - and not expecting to receive tips. Those who helped us the most were Said, Jeff, Mourad and Matthew.   We had a problem with the AirCon in our room but Matthew got it sorted very quickly with the minimum of fuss.  Only two negatives (and they are very minor) one is the breakfast - only a continental available, however it was the use of paper plates & plastic cutlery that I didn't like! The other one is that there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Overall we had a very enjoyable stay :-);5
We recently spent 4 nights at the hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful from those on the front desk to Said and Jeff on the door who dealt with our inquiries with great efficiency and local knowledge. Our room on the 11th floor was comfortable, well laid out with all the amenities expected of a NYC hotel. We thoroughly recommend this hotel for its position just off Broadway and near 7th Avenue subway. And at the end of the day there is nothing finer than a beer and cocktail- cosmopolitan to be enjoyed propping up the bar with a great bartender;5
The front desk staff had a wealth of information and multiple options for each question I asked, whether it was a dinner recommendation, directions to a nearby attraction or how to best catch my flight.;5
Room was very clean.  Staff was courteous.  Avg b-fast/brunch places within 1-2 blks away.  Overall, hotel room/floor was quiet.  I was on 8th fl.  Roomy shower booth although the design of it made a lot of water splash out onto the floor.;4
Ameritania is in a perfect location with walking distance to nice eateries, shops, Times Square and Central Park. We were especially impressed with Rob & Mathew who upgraded our room to suit the needs of our stay & their hand written note added a personal touch. Room was spacious and clean. We will definitely recommend to others and stay again!;5
First of all I'd like to thank the floor area manager for giving me such a great deal on this hotel. It is beautiful, clean and welcoming. The staff are kind and friendly. Elena was wonderful. She offered to get me aspirin at the pharmacy and even brought me water to my room. Oh and the king size bed was wonderful. I definitely would reccomend this hotel. It's so close to Central Park and Times Square.;5
This hotel is in a prime spot in Manhattan, all the main attractions are in walking distance. In fact one day we walked around most of Central Park and then walked down to the very tip of the Financial centre at Wall Street.  The rooms are on the small side but not tiny, just beware though that even the bottled water is chargeable in the room. Breakfast is a little expensive for what you get, and it's worth just having a look round for a restaurant that does breakfast as they are better value for money. The bar in the hotel is quite reasonably priced compared to some other bars nearby. All the staff are extremely helpful and this does really make your trip more enjoyable. Angelos pizza place next door is worth a visit if you're after something quick and reasonably priced. Just;5
I would definitely recommend this hotel- when we checked in last week for a 7-day stay Majid at the front desk was amazing- he upgraded us to one of the larger rooms free of charge! It's perfectly situated- right in the middle of the theatres, tons of possibilities on your doorstep.  The staff were so helpful and always polite, and the room was lovely- v swish bathroom!;5
Perfect location, very close to Times Square. Very helpful staff especially a man called Ali. They helped us with maps, sightseeing, etc. We were offered a complimentary bottle of champagne since we were honeymooners. Nice contemporary decoration. Highly recommended.;5
Great value for one of the best located hotels in New York. Clean rooms with a spacious bathroom. Would stay again.  A special thanks to Jeff for providing great tips on getting the most out of our time in the city.;5
"This was our second stay at Aneritania Hotel and we were not disappointed. Yes, rooms are smaller but this is NYC and the staff of this hotel makes up for some of the minor things. We always feel at home and welcome at this hotel. They call themselves a concierge and they live up to those words; when we need hot water or a tea kettle it was delivered pronto! The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms have updated showers and are clean and well appointed. The hotel is convenient to ""Theatre District, Great restaurants, Central Park."" After checking out and finding our flight had been cancelled we were welcomed ""back"" by Matt (Front desk manager).  Not only did Matt find us a room in the booked hotel he sent up a bottle of wine to ease our stress!!  I bellmen Jeffrey and";5
very small queen bed room. About the size of a European room.  However the bathroom had a large shower. The bed war GREAT !  Love a soft bed and this one was great. Arrived at 3am and had no problem checking in.;4
The hotel is super clean everyone was very friendly.  I had booked a room for my son and I in a King Suite, when we checked in, Ari upgraded our room to a double suite.  Rooms were very Clean. Jeff the Doorman, was extremely helpful in getting us a car to our airport, and also the best way to see some of the sights.  I would definitely stay there again. The only downside, was that our room faced a brick wall alley. Other than that, top notch.  Ice was brought to our room, and the room service Breakfast was HUGE.  And it is right around the corner from The Colbert Show.;5
Stayed at the Ameritania a couple times the past month. First stay was good. Check-in staff was indifferent and clearly not too interested about being friendly or anywhere to close to it. My first room was tiny, which was expected. However, the bed was extremely comfortable, room was spotless, and the bathroom was excellent. Amenities were good, so was the hot water and pressure. Location, like everyone has mentioned is absolutely perfect. Close to Times Square, all the food, shows, subway, etc.   My second stay started on a high note. The check-in staff was absolutely friendly and welcoming. He upgraded me to a double room, which was considerably bigger than the last. He also took the chance to welcome me back to the hotel, little things like that make a lot of difference.  The;2
Family of 4, stayed 4 nights in a deluxe room with 2 queen beds. Nice and modern room and bath, everything worded as expected. Service-minded and attentive staff above what I am used to on Manhattan. Great location just north of Times Square. Did not eat breakfast at the hotel, plenty of options in the streets around there. Couple of suggestions: The queen-beds were a bit small. Also, internet in the rooms should really be included these-days, although I was made aware at booking that I would have had to pay. Free internet in the lobby though, and the lobby is very nice and offers good seating. To sum up: Having stayed at a large number of 3-3.5 star hotels between Penn station and Times Square over the years, this hotel ranks higher than most of the ones I have stayed in so;4
The Hotel is fantastic. Very well located, both the metro and many of the tourist sites there is to see. The room was very comfortable and always with good cleanliness and with all the necessary toiletries for these days. If I ever go back to NY I will definitely be back in the Ameritania.;5
Staff in this hotel genuinely friendly and interested, very helpful and go the extra mile. Hotel in good position, within few blocks of Times Square, 5th Avenue and Central Park.  Hotel decor dated but was clean and comfortable.  Would stay there again.  Thanks to Said, Jeff an Mourad and especially to Manager, Matt!  Only down side was th noise of the air conditioning but wouldn't put us off staying again.;4
Prime location right in Midtown, easy access to the metro and only a few blocks from Time Square. Very friendly staff and gorgeous updated rooms (the bathroom is amazing). Definitely staying here again.;5
I just stayed at the Ameritania for 2 nights. My husband and I had stayed there once before and liked it, so I looked forward to staying here again. One of the best things about this hotel is its location. While the hotel is described as being in Times Square, it is a few blocks away from the craziness of Times Square. Columbus Circle is nearby, which is great for transportation, and many restaurants and theaters are also close by. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. I think it was a pretty good size for a NY hotel. My only complaint is the amount of street noise I could hear throughout the night. I was given a room on the 3rd floor facing 54th street, so that probably added extra noise into my room. I found ear plugs in the bathroom, and now I know why! I would recommend;4
Great location- a little hard for cabbies/Uber to find, but has a great energy. Value for the $ spent. Rooms were clean, Bed was very comfortable. The experience was very good.  I'd stay there again if I need to be in the same area.;4
Nearly forgot to write this review but couldn't not share this gem! The situation is perfect, the rooms very comfortable and clean and the staff were extremely helpful. A big shout out to JEFF and JULIAN, polite and full of useful advice. We came as a family of 4 and would certainly love to come back. I have recommended this hotel to many. We look forward to seeing you again 🇺🇸;5
Very friendly staff and great location. Room and facilities were very clean. The hotel is an easy walk from Times Square, Central Park and Hell's Kitchen. Due to its proximity to bars and restaurants, it's a little loud throughout the night, but that proximity could also be a plus for many travelers seeking nightlife.;4
We had a great stay at the hotel. The staff was very friendly. I had actually by mistake made my reservation for the wrong day and they were able to accommodate me anyway with a room to my liking. It was clean, comfortable, and just perfect. I would definitely stay here again.;5
Stayed one night in city to visit my son. Booked a room on Priceline- big mistake. We had 3 people and could only buy 1 room not knowing we'd show up and get a closet. Spoke with Rob 2 nights before and asked if we could secure a room with 2 beds. Was rudely informed of a $50 upgrade fee and then informed that the room I had would not allow 3 people (fire hazard) - basically being forced to pay $50 bucks more. Noted on other sites that several ppl were given free room upgrades. Extremely small room - we bought an air mattress and suffered through 1 night. Could barely move. Sheets were filthy and covered in blood (pics), makeup on pillow cases.. clearly not cleaned. Called for new sheets- took two trips to get actual sheets bc the man was confused and kept brining mattress;3
Empty shampoo bottles left for days in shower base (obviously not cleaned) rubbish bin not emptied , we had to call cleaner back to clean toilet, bathroom floor not swept or washed carpet not vacuumed. In fact most days only the bed was remade. We spent 7 nights there. When called housekeeping never answered nessitating a trip down to reception. Location is excellent   However I would hesitate recommending this hotel due to their lack of care.  Ed was;3
Through booking.com, I obtained an amazing deal in this boutique hotel. As a designer, looks were important and it met my expectations! The front desk staff gladly accommodated my addition of one more day and transferred me to a better room.  It is a busy neighborhood - not great views but captures Times Square area. Everything was near.... including Columbus Circle and Central Park.;5
Our room was two double beds, looking out on W 54th.  Room was small, besides the beds, there was a desk and an easy chair.  Bathroom was small but surprisingly nice.  I consider it just fine for what we paid.  Most rooms look out over 54th or Broadway.  We were on 8th floor - not too noisy, sleep fine.  Lobby staff helpful.  Only gripe - seemed to have free wifi only in lobby.    Location, of course, is great - Broadway and W 54th.  Seventh Ave E train subway station across the street, about 5 blocks to the Columbus Ave subway station and several others.  The hotel is right next to the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  Close but not on Times Square -- that's a 8 block walk to most prime theaters.  Quick bites nearby include a few pubs, Starbucks;4
Very clean & nice looking hotel.  Room cleaned everyday and bed linen & towels changed.  Great location very close to theatres and Times Square.  Staff very friendly & drinks were reasonable in the hotel bar.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because we appeared to have the 2 smallest rooms on the floor with no street view which meant the room was always dark.;4
Thiis was our first visit to NYC. After a long flight from Australia, the staff at the Ameritania especially Mathew, Said, Javier and Duke made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived and continued to provide excellent service throughout our stay of 9 days. The arty interior of the Ameritania reflects its proximity to The Museum of Modern Art and the theatre district. Centrally located, it is a short walk to Times Square, Central Park, choice of restaurants, theatres and a number of subways to take you all over NY. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. Continental buffet breakfasts with choice of croissants, freskly cooked waffles, bagels and fruit set you up for a day of exploring New York. When I return to NYC I hope to stay here again.  Karen from Sydney.;5
Amazing location very close to Times Square, with friendly helpful staff, even down to the taxi driver on the journey back to the airport (arranged by the hotel). Lovely stay with a quirky modern twist/ decor in reception - thanks;5
Frist time om the east coast. And the hotel has a great central location. Rooms are a little small but the service is great - thanks jeff.  Its very close to times square and the walk to anything is easily done.;4
First time in New York and we found the hotel to be right in the heart of Broadway and Times Square, brilliant for getting bearings. We had a delux room as we were 3 adults but room was quite small with limited storage but bathroom was very nice and clean. Rooms were also quiet, no street noise or from other hotel rooms.  Staff and door men were very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was limited choice and more expensive than restaurants in the area so easier to go out.  Overall given the location this was a very good choice of hotel.;4
Loved the location of this hotel and the staff was so helpful.  The rooms were clean and modern. The rooms are a little on the small side but average for NYC.  All the doormen were super helpful especially Saied and Jeffery.  We loved walking to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave, theaters and MOMA all were within 5 to 15 mins.  The would stay here again.;5
Excellent service and well located hotel. Very friendly and helpful people. Wonderful experience. My experience at Ameritania Times Square NY was very good, we received very kind help from the people who work there, specially from the Manager (Matthew) and front desk staff (Majid).;5
We enjoyed our stay at Ameritania in the month july 2017. The staff was very accurate & friendly, especially Said & Mathieu. The suites were very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect: nearby Central Park and Tomes Square ans a few minutes walk from the metro. Only breakfast can be improved (wider range (pancakes, ommelets etc) and no plastic cutlery and breakfast plate);4
Stayed here a number of times, staff is friendly, hotel conveniently located.  Even got an upgrade!!  Rhe view was not so great, view of a brick wall.  My fault for mot asking for an upper floor.  Won't stop me from staying here again.;5
My amazing boyfriend surprised me by taking me to New York for my birthday in January and changed my life forever!. Everything was arranged and all I had to do was literally turn up with my passport!!.  From the moment we arrived at the Ameritania Hotel in Times Square, we were greeted with nothing but warmth and out of this world hospitality. We have stayed at so many hotels across the world but the service at The Ameritania really took our breath away.  Before I go any further, I have to say Emily, you truly made our trip!. The service the front of house staff provided was first class right down to the lovely maid who cleaned our room. Nothing was too much trouble. Obviously I didn't know the full extend of the effort that went into my surprises but upon arrival we walked into;5
Very nice hotel to stay aat and is in good location. Close to central park and a 2 min walk to timesquare. The room was nice a bit on the small size but didnt bother me as i only slept there. Bathroom good size and very comfortable bed. I was given free wifi as i stayed for 2 weeks which was awsome. I didnt hav breakfast in the hotel but they do have complimentary tea and coffee in the morning. All on all it was a good stay i would definitely stay again;5
This hotel is very modern and chic.  The staff was friendly and accomdating.  The rooms were comfortable.  The bed and shower were amazing.  We were so pleased with this hotel.  We will definitely be back.  Loved it!;5
its very close to Times Sq and Central park, which makes it attractive. Also Broadway is right round the corner. The rooms are a bit cramped, espl the ones with 2 Queen beds. no free Wi-Fi in the rooms. there is a bar in the lobby, but the food options outside are better. deals on room rates are available;3
Amil was a great concierge. Excellent service and great room! Plenty of space and the bed was extremely comfortable. There's also plenty of space in the Bathroom and shower. Definitely check this place out!;5
Excellent location, and specially the staff, very friendly and helpful. 1st choice next time to visit NY. Very near Central Park and Times Square. Also, metro stations are very convenient near the hotel.;5
My sisters and our significant others stayed 3 nights, M-TH, at this hotel and every single person we met that worked there were so kind and accommodating. We've stayed at many hotels and have never came across such nice people. Two doormen stick out, Hugo and Mo(night time door man can never remember his name so I called him Mo) they were both so kind. The hotel is also located perfectly in the city. Close to both time square and Central Park. MoMA is also right up the street. And the room was clean and comfortable. Everything you want in a home away from home was this hotel and more, I highly recommend staying here!;5
Stayed here between 13th and 17th July 2017. Checked in by Ali who was speedy and efficient. Was given a room upgrade which was a bonus.....this is my 5th stay at The Ameritania so it was lovely to be 'recognised' The Ameritania is on 54th street and just off Broadway so in an ideal location.....not far from Times Square but far enough away to not have too much noise. Hotel, clean and tidy although housekeeping didn't turn up until late on two days......4pm and 3.30pm which was annoying. We had to chase in one of those days also.;4
Great place to stay!  Will return with more family! The doorman was the best we have ever encountered.  He set the atmosphere for our stay.  The hotel is beautiful and located in an area close to many things to see and do.  Thank you!;5
Thank You so much for your service : Matthew, Majid and Alaa. The best congierces we have met in New York . You gave us good big rooms. Cool water in the nice decorated lobby, a great breakfast and a warm welcome.;5
"I had a room with two queen beds. The room was small, with little space to move or unpack; a desk and chair could hardly be used because they were too close to one of the beds. Requested and received a luggage stand so that I would not have to keep luggage on top of a bed. Bathroom was roomy and clean. Bathroom window did not close properly, which I reported to the desk, but nothing was done to fix it during my stay. Decor in lobby and room is dated, and there were signs of water leaks on room ceiling. Room was quiet (upper floor, facing away from street). Location very convenient to midtown and multiple subways. Staff very polite and helpful. Very decent accommodation for a short or medium-length stay (5 days). Convenient to a Starbucks and other dining options, though the area";3
We absolutely loved our stay here ... highly recommend room 1205 for amazing city views.  Probably the best part was how helpful Jeff was with our bags and helping with a car to the airport.  We will definitely stay here again!;5
Not your run of the mill cut out upscale hotel, as soon as you enter the lobby you there is a creative flair. The rooms and bathrooms were very well down. Located next to the famed Iguana Bar & Restaurant, you're within shot walking distance to Times Square and the trendy 9th Ave strip of clubs and restaurants.;5
Really had a nice time staying at the Ameritania Hotel. Friendly staff and a good location at a really decent price in NYC. We booked pretty last-minute and still feel like we received a good price.  Clean, comfortable room and all that we needed. Would not hesitate to stay here again;4
We had a great experience with everyone especially Jeff he was knowledgeable and friendly  The front desk was nice and it was easy to check in and out ! The location of the hotel made our stay even better easy to get to subway;5
Great location and beautiful hotel.   Clean rooms and very nice staff.  Don't pay for the in room WiFi, it doesn't hold a connection.  Lobby and hallways were always very clean and well kept.  We will visit again!;4
Matthew and the rest of the staff at the Ameritania were top notch. Not only were they all friendly and fun, they were helpful in every way they could to ensure we had the best stay possible. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to stay within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square.  We hope to be back soon!;5
"The location was just great. The staff was very friendly and so helpful. They were very well-informed about the city and the suburbs also. The lobby was very trendy; maybe not for kids under 10 years old. only one minor complaint is the rooms are a little small. but the shower was awesome for the amount of time we spent in the room the size didn't really matter. I recommend this hotel to everyone. Please try it out just once and you will definitely be back.";5
Me and my partner stayed here 9 nights whilst in NY and loved it.  Great location in Times Square which is good for first time visitors to NY, like us, which made it easy to get around. It is loud, but expected.  The service by the doorman (I forget his name!) was superb, always a friendly smile and greeting us when we came in and out.   The room was big, the shower massive! It has everything you need. We stayed in a deluxe king room.   I recommend this hotel and would stay again.;5
"I logged onto Hotel Tonght app and this hotel came up in Midtown where I found myself having to stay for the night.  It was the best rate I could find and was actually quite affordable.  But rather than look at the hotel website and beyond the ""basic"" listing it was described under, I had no idea as I walked toward the entrance what to expect.    Imagine my surprise when, walking in from the rain soaked afternoon, I was greeted not only by a clean, inviting lobby but a smiling gentleman behind the front desk named Rob.  He took notice of my t--shirt which--a vintage Malibu logo on the front--and said with perfect sardonic humor ""I hope you brought the weather with you.""  I said ""if you can allow me to check in early, I promise you, tomorrow will be sunny.""  He accommodated me";5
I stayed in the hotel during my holidays, with my wife and other relatives, and the experience was excellent. The location is great, the hotel is in excellent condition, and the staff was very helpful at all moment.;5
We had a wonderful time in NYC. The staff here were always smiling & willing to help. The bartender remembered our drinks from 2 days before. The rooms were very clean. You could not ask for a better stay. I love how they have ice cold water in the lobby.;5
We had booked two nights at the Ameritania Hotel before our trip back home to Australia. We found the reception very helpful, we even received a free room upgrade upon arrival. The hotels proximity to Times Square is great, its one of the reasons we chose it. The rooms were in immaculate shape. After a long night of walking through the city, we headed to the hotel bar where we met Javier. He was very friendly and even made us our favourite drink even though he had not made it before. He really made our night by doing that and we greatly enjoyed our time at the bar that night. We were extremely pleased with the Hotel as a whole. We'd certainly enjoy another stay here in the future.;5
The Ameritania is a convenient and friendly hotel. The rooms are typical NYC sized rooms comfortable. The staff was great particularly Javier in the bar. The location was great as we could walk through time square or board the subway a block away.;5
The rooms were actually more spacious than I expected for a NYC hotel. We had three rooms for a family trip. Our room on the 3rd floor had no view and it was a little dark in the room, but the bathroom was large and had plenty of light, so it was fine for getting ready. One of the rooms we had on the 8th floor did have a nice view. Our rooms were all ready very early and the check in process was very quick. Jeff, the bellman, was super helpful and friendly throughout the trip as well. The location is excellent for getting to Central Park or Times Square. Perfect for being a NYC tourist!;5
We really liked our stay in Ameritania Hotel since the location is perfect, we were able to walk to any place we wanted to visit and the personnel is very friendly and attentive.  The rooms are a little small but they are really nice, clean and with very good decoration.;5
Travelling with 13,5 yr old son. NYC 24 hours. This hotel team and location was the best. Welcome team with Matthew and Maura, friendly, efficient on advice and bookings around town. Hotel is clean and well equipped, next to it all. Vas-y les Français il parle french aussi;5
Booked a hotel room since we were visiting Broadway. When we arrived we were greeted by Matt and Mejid, who were very friendly and extremely helpful. They provided us with all the information we needed and gave us some advice to make our trip easier. They were totally amazing.  The room was clean and extremely comfortable. It was well furnished and had all the amenities. I loved the crazy huge mirror and the neat light fixtures.  I'd totally recommend. Great staff and great room.;5
So as my title said Matt and Majid are amazing. They were both super friendly and super helpful. They got us set up in our room really quickly and answered any and all questions we had. They literally made our entire weekend! The room is very nice as well.;5
Room was kind of small. Yet who spends a lot of time in the room anyway! Great location, great staff, and the bed was super comfortable. I will definitely recommend! i will definitely be coming back to stay!;5
Room was small, but cozy and very clean. We had a great time as it was a good location, walking distance from Central Park and the nicest, most polite staff I've encountered staying in NYC. The lobby is artsy and fun with a nice lounge feel to it.;5
We stayed here for a week-the hotel is a few blocks away from Times Square, right in front of a Starbucks and close to the subway. We travelled in a group and our rooms were large and comfortable, bathrooms included. The staff were all generally friendly, especially the doormen who helped us with directions or calling cabs every morning. Matt  at the reception was great, went out of his way to help us book a dinner for 38 for the very evening.  We would definitely come back.;5
Upon booking, I checked the reviews and was a bit hesitant as some people mentioned the hallways being musty and small rooms, dirty carpets etc... so I was expecting the worst. Well we booked a small room, however, Johnny was kind enough to upgrade us and give us a King room for no extra charge! That was $50.00 savings per night. The hotel was clean as a whistle, the elevators were plenty and the LOCATION was amazing!!!!! We walked to central park and times square from our hotel! Internet wasn't free but we were so busy we didn't even notice!   This will be our GO TO NYC hotel. Loved it 100%.;5
Highly recommend this hotel. Majid at 'reception, other reception and porter all helpful during our visit. I will definitely come here again. Their tea was better than Starbucks! Majid please get electric sockets in the lobby. We living in digital world. Wi-Fi in lobby but could do with charging. Thank you;5
Fantastic location! Very close to Central Park and Times Square. Most comfortable bed ever! Friendly/helpful staff! Jeff the doorman even stayed late to mark up a map for us to tell us where to go and how to get there.;5
My husband and I recently visited NYC for our honeymoon and booked Ameritania via the Secret Hotels option on Lastminute.com.   Upon arrival, we were asked about the reason for our visit and when we told them it was our honeymoon, we were informed that our room had been upgraded and by the time we got to our room, we had a bottle of champagne on our bedside table. Great service.   When we first entered the room we were slightly disappointed to find that our windows looked out on to an inward facing courtyard, so there was no natural light and we couldn't have our lights on at night etc without people being able to see directly in. The airconditioning was also on and it was incredibly noisy. We asked the porter if the air con sounded like this in every room and he told us it did.;5
The Ameritania is located half way between Times Square and Central Park.  It is a beautifully renovated hotel, with tastefully decorated rooms.  The staff are really lovely. Vlad, the Manager was especially amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for him. I was travelling alone and he made sure that I was well looked after.  They have breakfast available and coffee, but no restaurant. This is not a problem though as there are heaps of restaurants, cafes and small supermarkets nearby.   The little bar they have is great for chatting to people. The barmaid was very friendly too. I'm very glad I chose this hotel.;5
Great location next to Ed Sullivan Theater and times square and Central Park. A Good value for down town Manhattan. Our room was very clean and with a swanky design. Super comfortable bed and linens. Amazing shower.  Staff treated us well.;4
Our experience inside the hotel was very good, we had a good week in Manhattan with a good place to sleep, that was very clean and the service was very gently and kind, i recomend ameritania if you want to stay very close from the top of mind places in New York.;5
We always choose a hotel near  Central Park, we found it in Ameritania. Hotel. We were so satisfied.  near central park, théâtre district, Time Square. This is the place  we will go to for our future visites to NYC.;5
A very well positioned and comfortable hotel. Great access to the sights of NY and the Times Square area. Staff were extremely accommodating and Mourad on the door was particularly helpful with his colleagues throughout the hotel also providing great service. Well worth a visit.;5
Nice hotel with a convenient location.  Reasonable price, nice size room. Friendly and helpful staff. There's a nice bar in the hotel and a great variety of restaurants within two blocks,  many of them on the same block. Convenient to Times Square and to subway stations.  Great stay.;5
"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The lobby and bar are decorated in a quirky, contemporary style.  Location cant be beat and the price is quite reasonable. Rooms are small but very clean. Bathroom was modern with rainhead shower. Only drawbacks were our airconditioner did not have a control panel and ran all night. And for a double room with three people there was no where to set your luggage so we kept ours on the floor,which made it pretty crowded.  Check in and check out was a breeze.  This is my new "" go to"" hotel in NYC.";5
Had a great experience at this hotel, excellent location and friendly staff. They kindly upgraded our room which was a huge bonus for us! Free wifi in the lobby - only downside there was no wifi in the room itself - you had to pay for it and it was quite expensive which was slightly annoying otherwise this hotel is perfect!;5
We stayed there for a week. Great location and price. Excellent and friendly service. Basic rooms, but priced accordingly. Interior design is nice, but old brick exterior of the building is shabby and needs a face-lift badly.;4
Classy hotel in the heart of Time Square. Honestly such exceptional staff. There was one particular doorman named Jeff who was outstanding at his job. Unfortunately there was a bit of trouble with our room door not locking, but luckily there was a member of staff up to our room in minutes to fix it. We still made our show on time! Wish they had an early check in option, but other than that, I would most definitely stay again! Worth every penny!!!;5
Love staying at the Ameritania when attending events in the Carnegie Hall/54 Below area. Rooms are fairly small, but cozy and the beds are very comfortable. Also love the showers and bathrooms-beautiful!;5
Pros: location, comfortable bed, well-appointed bathroom, location Cons: no handicap accessibility at front of hotel  I recently traveled to NYC with my husband and 2 of my children. We stayed at 3 hotels of similar price. The Paramount, The Empire and The Ameritania.   The Paramount was right in the middle of Times Square the the Theater District which made it extremely crowded and the room was cramped. The lobby was nice and the room was quiet with a city view. There was almost no room between the foot of the bed and the wall.  The Empire Hotel has an amazing rooftop terrace and a small pool. It was the only one of the three with a pool, so it made a huge difference in entertainment/relaxing environment/and wow factor. There was a lot of staff and the lobby is amazing. The;5
Excellent hotel value near Times Square.  The Americana Hotel offers comfortable rooms with rain showers and nice amenities. The front desk staff is especially nice. The locations is the best too.  Javier - the bartender in the lobby bar- is very friendly and accommodating - even locals come to his bar.;5
Avoid this hotel. Do not go here never stayed in anything like it....... the staff was rude and the room was terrible the sheets on the bed were ripped. I know you don't go to New York to stay in the hotel but I expected it to be nice and clean but his hotel is terrible avoid this one;1
"I recently stayed here for 5 nights.  It is an excellent location for sightseeing between Times Square and Central Park. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  The lobby and rooms are very modern looking; beds are very comfortable.  Free wifi is supposed to only be in the lobby area, but we were given a code for free to have wifi in the room as well.  They have good deals in the bar (2-4-1).  There isn't any coffee in the rooms, but there is a refrigerator (and umbrella).  The fitness center is small but has decent equipment.";5
I can't recommend this hotel enough- and I am a little fussy. The location is perfect, close to Times Square and Central Park. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are very nicely decorated. We paid for a superior room which I would recommend, it was a very good size and the bed was the comfiest bed I've ever slept in. Several of my friends have stayed here too and similarly could not fault the hotel.;5
The location of the hotel is great. It's right beside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway. A few blocks from the heart of Times Square so not quite as noisy.  The air con in the rooms was great. The rooms were a good size but the beds were a little small for 2 adults and the room could use some extra storage like a drawer by the night stand. Close to subways and Times Square and Central Park.;4
Great location close to Broadway, Time square and Central Park. Friendly and helpful staff. Room larger than expected comfortable bed, we stayed for seven nights and will stay here again in the future.;5
"This is the third time a school trip has visited NY and this is by far the best hotel. Great location, handy for Times Square, the subway, Central Park, ESB and food outlets. Excellent rooms of superb quality. Very helpful staff. Buffet breakfast is the only disappointment as it is rather low key and ""fast food"" like.";4
We were mother and daughter in NYC for holidays. Dissapointed with room provided. Room was ultra small and there was not enough floor space for luggage. The air condition unit was noisy and we were uncomfortable spending time in room.;2
Super clean! Great service and nice decorated.Close to everything, I think it was a good choice, rooms are not so big, but for 2 people it is comfortable. I will come back for sure! No coffee machine at the room, this will be a plus if they get one for the rooms😀;4
"In May 2017, a college friend and I enjoyed a mini reunion in Manhattan, staying 2 nights at Ameritania Hotel before I had to change hotels (boohoo) for another gathering. We loved the Ameritania lobby's whimsical ambience + the charming & helpful desk team. A man named Jeff was especially on top of things and gave a great restaurant recommendation. Our double-bed room was quite small but very comfortable + the bathroom shower was so modern and fabulous. Great water pressure from the ""rain head."" I will make a beeline for this hotel next time I am in New York. (I live in Santa Fe, NM.)";5
The Ameritania is an excellent hotel, located perfectly off Broadway -- within 10 mins walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. I have recently returned from a family trip and couldn't be happier with my stay in the Ameritania. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were pleasantly greeted by a wonderful Ameritania staff member named Jeffrey. Jeff was incredibly friendly and helpful and was one of the the main reasons why we enjoyed our stay so much.  The rooms are very nicely designed, spotless with a superb bathroom and shower. The lobby has a lovely atmosphere and is very pleasant to relax after a long day in the City. The hotel is located perfectly with anything you need (cool bars, restaurants, shopping, pharmacies, grocery stores and diners within 5;5
The rooms are quit big. There is a mini bar, iron, some snacks. If you're in one of the inner rooms, you do hear the airco installed there. The noise is always there so ask for a room at the street is if you don't like the noise. For the rest, nice rooms. The breakfast is server on the ground floor but everyting is in plastic. I find it very unpleasant to eat in a hotel on a plastic plate with a plastic knife. That's for me unacceptable.;4
Just back from a fantastic 4 night stay at this hotel. Our first time in New York so was unsure what expect. When we arrived at the hotel we were not disappointed. Staff are excellent and were very polite from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. If you need to know anything at all speak to Jeff. The room was considerably big for four people and after reading previous reviews I hadn't been expecting the room to be as big. It was extremely clean, bathroom was lovely and beds are very comfortable. House keeping was done to a high standard everyday. We had breakfast in the hotel each morning which was basic, but nice. The location is great being on Broadway and only a few blocks away from Times Square and Central Park. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will;5
America is very centrally located at 54th & Broadway.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, room with King size bed had enough room. Have to pay for in room wifi and small refridgerator.  Great waterfall shower.  Check your towels supply....not always up to par. Overall a nice hotel.;4
Hotel is very close to times square but also easy walking distance of Hells Kitchen where we had some great cheaper meals.  Also handy for central park and the hop on/off bus.  Staff very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  We had breakfast in the hotel every morning which was OK and reasonably priced.  The air conditioning is noisy as previous reviewers have said, they are not just being picky, and the street below is busy and noisy all through the night but this is to be expected due to its location and it wouldn't put us off staying again. The bed was really comfortable, the best I have ever slept in and the room was fine.  Free tea and coffee is available in the mornings and iced water is available at all times in the lobby and nice bar area too.  We really liked this;4
Great location, Friendly staff, all you could ask for in a hotel for short break in NYC. Thanks to Jeff for arranging transport to JFK for our return home after our booked taxi failed to show, thanks to Ali on front desk for easy check out, would definitely stay here again.;5
Friendly staff, very & very comfy bed and perfect location( close to Central Park ) with a view on Broadway! Upgraded our room to deluxe due to wedding - felt very special! Good price-value hotel! Will defenetly recommend!;5
If your room is on the small side ask to be put in a bigger room and they will accommodate,our first room was rather small compared to the room we had 2 years ago. They have us anther room which was fab and a bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon 🎉;5
Overall good expericence for the $140 plus a night room! Hipster vibe with nice location worked well for our needs! Room was nice view was not good but it's the price point that most likely determined that? Good find!!;4
I stayed here in the height of the busy summer season, & was absolutely floored with the service. I came to NYC with my niece and her friend for her 11th birthday. The hotel is chic and modern and located right in the heart of Times Square, and was expecting that to be enough. Well to my delight, the staff here was incredibly personable! None of that cold NYC attitude. The manager checked us in, early, and upon hearing  that it was my niece's birthday, asked if he could send up something for her and her friend. Not a few minutes later he came up with treats for both of them- and us- cupcakes! Throughout the stay it was the little touches that made us feel incredibly at home. I could not have asked for a better experience for my niece's first overnight stay in New York City. I;5
Convienant location in times square. Check-in and out was super effiicient and friendly. The room was very spacious and quality shampoo soap etc. Gym was perfect for quick morning workout. All in all a great stay.;5
The Ameritania is a smallish hotel on a very busy street on the high end of midtown. It's a few blocks south of Columbus Circle and Central Park. The location is perfect for all of your touristy needs. The hotel itself is in an updated beautiful old building with modern decor. It's very clean. My room was tiny and faced the inside of the building so no views but the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was lovely and modern with CO Bigelow products.;5
"I must say that I enjoyed my stay at the Ameritania. And yes, like most NYC hotels, the rooms tend to be on the smaller side. However, my room was nicely appointed, very clean, had a nicely sized closet and bathroom (loved the shower), and the bed was very comfortable. Yet best of all - for its location - it was amazingly quiet. I slept without a problem - didn't even need earplugs! LOL Sadly, the only real ""downer"" was the lack of wifi in the room. You have to pay extra for it. I did, but I was unable to get it to work. Although, it seems the wifi did work in the hotel lobby without issue. Luckily, I was only in the city for two days, so it wasn't a big deal.  All-in-all, it was a great place to stay and it is right in the midst of the theatre district. I would definitely";4
My new fave hotel in NYC! The staff is knowledgeable, int'l, friendly and jump in to help even before you know you need it! Special thanks to Matt (mngr), Jeff (door), Rob & Jonathan (desk) & Kunga (b'fast). You ALL go that extra mile and people feel that. I will be booking you again this year. Hard to get rid of happy guests. Sorry!;5
Had a brilliant stay at the Ameritania Hotel Times Square NYC. Hotel is ideal being close to many tourist attraction withing short walking distance if central park, tines square and broadway. All staff are extremely friendly and helpful.. a special mention for Jeff, extremely friendly and helpful gentleman, if you need help with anything or have any questions Jeff is the man to ask!  Would definitely stay at this hotel again !   Visited from Scotland UK !;5
"I was on a business trip; average hotel, good location. I fund the hotel quite expensive compared to other hotels I have been in the neighborhood. Quite poor the breakfast and small the common areas at the reception level.";3
Superb staff, great location!  We brought our three children into the city and would certainly recommend the Americana.  Said was wonderful and was always helpful with our kids, stroller, directions and perfect recommendations for restaurants!;5
great hotel near central park and subway, ideal for visiting museums , RockefellerCentre etc. The staff especially Said, Ali,Jeff and Julian went out of their way to help us make the most of our stay. Good rooms with very comfortable beds.;5
The room was very small and had no fridge or coffee maker. No free WiFi in the room. There was no view despite the very high price for the room. Staff was friendly and helpful though and the location was good..;3
First let me start off by saying the hotel as a whole us fine. You can't beat the location as Times Square and Central Park snd great shopping are all within walking distance. The hotel is old, of course, but clean.  We found the rooms are very New York small (you'd be hard pressed to get 2 adults and two large suitcases in one room and the room is very dark, the lighting is horrible Also, buy water somewhere else as they charge $5 for a small bottle if you drink the water in they supply in the room! You can buy it down the street for $1.  I probably wouldn't stay there again just as a personal preference. I think for the price you could probably find a little more upscale room, but like I said the location is great and you probably won't be in it much.;3
Firstly, I am loath to sing the praises of this hotel as I am trying to organise a stay with my husband in October - and will be gutted if we can't get a room! Everything about this place exceeded my expectations.   First impressions count - we arrived late after 24+ hours of travel & the doorman was quick to assist us with our luggage. Front desk check in was like catching up with an old friend – Majid went out of his way to find out where we were from, share a little insight and get us checked in quickly. We went with a deluxe room and weren’t disappointed. This was one of many hotels spanning our USA trip and was by far the best in terms of value for money, location & staff.  Bathroom was huge, beds super comfy, shower pressure & temperature were fab, housekeeping spot on,;5
Just back from a great visit to NYC. Nice hotel, great location between Times Square and Central Park on Broadway. Really nice friendly staff especially Said and Julian. One downside is, if like me you aren't the type to be up and out at 7am is that housekeeping knock on your door really early, was fine with the do not disturb but then generally they didn't bother with your room. Beds are extremely comfortable and shower amazing.   Now the disappointment. After returning home I noticed the hotel had taken £190 from my account- there was no reason to do so as if only had a $4 box of snacks from the room. Tried contacting the hotel via Facebook and email just to be totally ignored. 4 days later and still no answer or refund. This was going to be the place I stay on my frequent New;3
Very nice, impeccably clean, and absolute best location. Great attention at the front desk check in and check out. Jeff at the door was great, very helpful everyday.  Made for a very pleasant stay in NYC. Unbeatable price for the services and quality provided!;5
Stayed here for 5 nights in January, would be happy to return. Offers good value at the price point. As other reviewers have said, the location is convenient. Rooms are not big but well designed and overall, offers a good base for exploring NYC.;5
A great modern, clean and sleek hotel located just off Broadway and walking distance to parks and attractions. Location is great for guests looking to catch a show or hit Times Square. Great spacious rooms, friendly staff, and awesome lobby bar.;5
Everything we needed to enjoy the neighborhood​, all within walking distance. Great advice from Jeff and other staffers. Times Square, Central Park, MoMA, we had a great time. Good advice on near by places to eat.;5
Central location between central parc and times square, rooms are small but newly renovated and exactly as on the pictures, nice italian shower, staff was always very helpful. Good breakfast USD12. We will come back.;5
Beautiful and very clean friendly and helpful staff. Young man at the counter was very efficient and very helpful specially when I had to print my fight tickets. It's in a great location  close to time square, theaters, great restraunts, shopping, and Central Park.;5
Matthew took care of a pressing wifi issue I had just a few minutes before a very important webinar I was hosting.  Most front desks would have pushed me off to their vendor to figure it out.  Matthew went above and beyond to take care of my issue on the spot.  Service like this is a rarer and rarer commodity in the hospitality business.  I'll be back!;4
Second visit to this hotel in 8 months. Great location for all the sights, Time Square and Central Park. Friendly concierge, Juliano and Jeff in particular and staff couldn't help with questions enough. Only slight downside is the air conditioning unit in the rooms is very noisy and despite the fact ear plugs are given it is a bit annoying. All in all would book again;4
Very nice rooms, great location, modern hotel with great staff! If you have any questions or need recommendations, Mathew at reception is very friendly and helpful. We had a great time at the Americana and would recommend it to anyone travelling to the US.;5
Location is great. Service is good. Rooms are small and not comfortable. In room safe is on the floor. There isn't placebo store personal belongings.  the closet is tiny and the two drawers are small for two people.  The lobby is poor.;2
As expected being in NY, the rooms were small. The room was clean and nice. My sink didn't drain very well, but that wasn't a problem. The staff in encountered was very nice and friendly. I only stayed one night and basically just slept there, but the trip was nice.;4
I stay at hotels over the weekend to get out of my neighborhood I try different hotel all the time the ones I like I return too so far I have 2 favorites sign Me and my wife. Until next weekend bye thk u;3
No better location, many subway stations nearby and we were surprised because of the service (friendly, lovely people). When we arrived to the hotel we didn't have to worry about our luggage and when we left a very nice person called Julian(?) got a taxi for us so we just relaxed and enjoyed our last hours in New York. I really recommend the hotel. Thank you!! :);5
As you would expect in New York, my single room was tiny. It was clean with a good sized closet. The shower has only 1/2 a door, which saves space but means the bathroom floods when taking a shower. Unfortunately, I was next to the elevator and was kept awake by a cell phone user. I did not see a coffee maker, but a Starbucks is right across the street, and the location is perfect to see a Broadway show (why I was there.);4
Moderate price for a Great Hotel that seemed worth well more. Rooms were big for NYC standards. Clean, friendly, location was perfect for us and our travels all over Manhattan. I would highly recommend.;5
We had a great time here. The service was great. It had an overall nice feel. Cold water in the lobby available 24/7. Cute bar with drink specials to hang out at. The room was great. Nice big bed and lovely bathroom. Spacious and clean. We will return !;5
We had a great time. Our first room was not as desirable as we would have hoped, but the staff was wonderful. Majid, in particular, was extremely helpful and was a great representation of excellent customer service. We were moved to a better room and had a great stay. Really liked the Ameritania!;5
We stayed in a queen room which was more than adequate.  The hotel was extremely clean and the beds exceptionally comfortable.  The staff were all extremely helpful especially Mourad and Majid.  The only negatives were that the air conditioning was a little noisy at night and on one or two occasions we were unable to have a hot shower, the water being luke warm.  Excellent location and would definitely stay at the hotel again if we ever find ourselves back in New York;4
Love this hotel, love to go back again.  Front desk service was over and above.  Also bell service excellent.  Beautiful stylish room.  Very nice breakfast with a view and great service. My daughter and had a wonderful stay !;5
This is a great location.  Rooms are clean.  Within walking distance to Times Square, Carnegie, and Central Park. Go to Bryant park instead of Central Park. It's cleaner and much cooler.  Take the Big Bus hop on hop off package and use their app. Great way to see the city;5
First time staying at this hotel and we were impressed. The bellhop named Jeff was very helpful, assisting with bags and providing us with some much needed guidance. The room was small, but clean and well appointed. Wish the hotel had more night life inside, restaurant/bar. Location was perfect for Times Square, everything in walking distance.;5
I stayed here with my sister for four nights in May and find it hard to fault it.  The location is great, just far enough from the madness of Times Square, but close enough to be able to walk a few blocks down there, and a few blocks the other way to Central Park.  The staff were extremely helpful, especially the wonderful Jeff who was always eager to help and arranged a car back to the airport for us.  The room size was good, we had the double double deluxe room with a Broadway view from a fairly small window, but nevertheless it was great to be able to look out on to Broadway in the mornings and evenings.  I only have one small criticism, and it is a very small one, and that is that our room didn't get cleaned every day.  OK, the first day we did put the Do Not Disturb sign;5
My wife and I stayed at the Americana Hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary.  I spoke to Yassin on the phone about our special day.  Yasmin went above and beyond making or stay so enjoyable.  Jeff greeted us at the door with a big smile and when Jeff saw us waiting for our room he offered to get us tea or coffee.  That has never been done in all the hotels we have stayed in.  Check out was simple room was spotless  Read some reviews that they hear some outside noise at night.  People it is New York City the place never sleeps but you will like a baby in there great beds. Came home and booked for Thanksgiving 2017  That is how great our stay was.  Yasmin and Jeff Thanks again  Mike Geldmacher;5
The rooms are clean and decent size for NYC.  The lobby is basic and has a lounge that is a good meeting spot before heading out.  Close to the subway lines and only two blocks to Times Square.  The property is a good choice for anyone looking for a basic fair price hotel.;5
Clean and tidy hotel in an excellent location. Ideal base for seeing the sights of New York.  WiFi available free of charge in the lobby. Breakfast is available if required but not included in the price.;5
OMG this IS the best placed hotel in NYC. It is literally next door to Stephen Colbert theater, it is 2 blocks from Time Square, walking distance to Central Park, NBC theaters, Rockefeller Center...great bagel places and any Broadway play you want. Parking is $40/night which is literally 1/2 block from the hotel. Jeff the door man even gives away his own umbrella in pouring rain when all the other umbrella's were taken...the bartender is AMAZING-not only can he make amazing drinks, he can figure out what you would like without you even knowing yourself...so fun! The rooms were clean, comfortable beds and good coffee in the morning! I would DEF-inately stay here again!;5
Our 2nd stay at this hotel. Location and staff are great. Comfy beds and smart looking room. By mad NYC standards it's pretty affordable - we paid £165 per night including all the taxes.  Handy for the park and subway.  Efficient and helpful check in with Matthew. Kindly given a room upgrade. Doormen Jeff and Julian both funny, knowledgeable and professional.  Well done to all!;5
I had not been to NYC in many years.  Chose this hotel based on reviews to stay for one night since we had tix to a broadway show.  We were lucky to have Matt to check us in as the other guy had terrible customer service.  He did not smile and was giving his patron attitude. Matt, however, was very friendly and helpful.  Matt was able to get us in our room early and he even left a bottle of wine, cupcakes and a note in our room later on because I had mentioned we were celebrating my daughter's birthday. The hotel is modern. The rooms are very tiny and some of the furniture is worn.  The colors are not appealing at all - brown and black.  The bathroom was nicely updated and very clean. It was an easy walk to our show and nice not to be in the middle of Times Square.  Noisy at;4
"I checked in to the Ameritania after a horrible experience at a prior hotel, the manager, Matthew checked me in and could probably sense I just had an unpleasant experience. When he asked me how I was doing and I ""vented"" -he magically took all my worries away and assured me I was in a much better place. And it was exactly that. He made my check in extremely smooth, assured me my room was taken care of, showed me the bar area, and even gave me a complimentary drink card to enjoy during my stay. As much as I want to rave about the cleanliness and decor-the staff really made my experience so pleasant. From check-in to check-out; everyone was so kind. The door guys were helpful with my luggage, Matthew was top-of-the-line, and during check out, two women were just really";5
a nice place just a few steps away from Times Square, Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Friendly staff. A bit noisy in the nighttime. No use of car or train necessary - a lot of good restaurants near the hotel;4
Perfect location, swift and easy check in on arrival.  Room was rather small, considering we were staying for 5 nights, both myself and my other half had large suitcases which really had nowhere to go in the room. We did however manage to rearrange things slightly and make more room.  The room itself was lovely, comfortable and well decorated just too small. Not sure whether the receptionist knew we had been given a tiny room and gave us the WiFi password as a bit of a perk (much appreciated!).  Free tea and coffee in a morning was a nice little perk although in room facilities would be better (maybe not possible in the small rooms). Bathroom was clean and tidy, shower was huge in comparison to the rest of the room!  All concierge staff were great but Jeff was a fab character,;4
This is our third stay at the Ameritania-it's our home away from home when we visit NYC. The location can't be beat and it's far enough from the crowds of Time Square.  Great for museums, Christie's, shopping and sightseeing.  Comfortable, clean, friendly...it's the best!;5
We stayed here for 2 nights, great location and really comfy beds! Hotel staff were really friendly & helpful especially yassir on reception and Jeff on the door. Would highly recommend this hotel for tourists who want to be near Times Square etc and just want a pleasant room to sleep in at the end of a busy day! We will be back 😊;5
Great value and nice place at a reasonable cost! Excellent rooms and lobby. Book and reserve with great confidence!! We spent my fiancé 40th birthday here and we both decided that the best part of the trip was the hotel!!;5
Being on Broadway you cant go wrong with where this hotel is located. Just a few short blocks and you will be in the centre of Times Square.  Modern hotel room with very trendy decoration. Shower was nice and big but a lack of places to put your things in the bathroom meant having to put the toilet seat down to use as a shelf when getting ready.  No free room wifi, however there is free wifi in the lobby.    Overall a very positive experience and would stay here again.;4
All you could want from a hotel with an excellent location. The only possible criticism is that the wi-fi is too expensive for this day and age and tricky to connect a second device. Staff are outstanding.;5
"I booked this hotel for my 23 year old daughter, even though she has travelled with us extensively worldwide (New York included) she has never gone there on her own. I liked the sound of the reviews so I booked two nights there. After an unpleasant experience with a ""rip off"" driver from the airport she arrived a bit shaken & said the moment she arrived the hotel staff were amazing. They were sympathetic & ensured she was comfortable and took care of anything that was needed & kindly gave her a couple of drink vouchers (much appreciated). She said the foyer was bright & welcoming & her room was beautiful, nicely appointed with one of the most comfortable hotel beds she has ever slept in (quite a statement coming from her). She loved the location & even though it was close to the";5
Perfect location, attentive staff.  Small but comfortable. Cool water all day in lobby, fresh coffee in the morning.Quiet, safe.  Cozy bed, big t.v. Nice bathroom, shower.  Nice bar in lobby.   Will definitely return.;5
We booked an 8 night stay as we were getting married and honeymooning in New York.  We chose the Ameritania as it is in the perfect location with Central Park, Columbus Circle and Times Square all within 5 minutes walking distance.  From the second we arrived, everyone could not be more welcoming.  Said, Julian, Jeffrey and the all front door staff were amazing and very knowledgeable with advice and organising anything we needed.  Yasir and the reception team were a dream to deal with and went out of their way to arrange an upgrade when they realised we were getting married.  We also had numerous dealings with Matthew, the Front Office Manager and Adam from engineering, who were both exceptionally professional and efficient in providing assistance over our stay. We encountered;5
On the surface it looks like a nice place, but our stay was less than satisfactory.  I stubbed my toe on the Metal Bed Frame the very first night.  Housekeeping didn't replace cups and or washcloths during our 5 day stay. When asked to bring up ice, which was not available on our floor, it took way too long. The worst part was that you could  hear everything out on the street at night, especially the garbage trucks at 2 am that lasted for over an hour.  I think they need to improve their windows, as I have stayed in NYC before and never heard this much noise.  On top of all that, we payed an average of $300 per night.  I have stayed in less expensive places in NYC that were much better.;2
This hotel misses the mark. There is no shortage of hotels in NY but the time it takes to select a quality hotel is daunting. We stayed in room #416 for 5 days and will never return. The room itself felt very dank and dreary. The front room looked like it had been pried open with a crowbar and slammed loudly each time it was closed. There is not adequate lighting in the bathroom which makes it very difficult to apply makeup, shave or groom your self. Our room had a TERRIBLE view which overlooked a disgusting alley and mangled outdoor building equipment. There also weren't enough outlets to plug electronics. The shower had mildew around the perimeter and the floor was always soaked because there isn't a shower door. The TV channels did not come in clearly and took about 5 minutes;1
I stayed for  two nights.The location of the hotel is excellent, and a few steps away from the heart of Times Square and Subway Station. The staff were very professional and friendly. Checking in and out was very quick, the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. I will like to thank Jeff, my stay was excellent, and I would highly recommended the Ameritania Hotel to family and friends;5
Letter will be sent detailing our stay. Reservation was made over a month in advance and upon arrival, were told they were cancelled. You advised we were called. You did call on the day of our stay approximately two hours before our arrival but your call was not answered. We were then given a downgraded room with a view that was so bad, we left the shades down our entire stay.;2
We booked this hotel online through a third party website because it appeared to be in a good location and the price was reasonable. We took the subway to Manhattan and expected a hard time finding the hotel, but it was right across from the station. We were met at the door by the most helpful and friendly person in the city, thanks Julian. The lobby area looks fantastic and in keeping with the ambience of the building. The reception staff couldn't be nicer and booking in couldn't have been easier. Our room (a deluxe) was clean, tidy and met all our expectations. A nice touch was a bottle of bubbly in an ice bucket as a birthday gift to my wife. My concern about sleeping was unfounded as the drapes shut out every bit of external light, and the windows kept out all noise, apart;5
I stayed in the Ameritania Hotel one night.  The location of the hotel is excellent, few steps away from the heart of Times Square and Subway Station.  The staff was very professional and friendly.  The room was clean and comfortable but in needs of some updates (windows, rugs and chairs).  Our room had a Broadway Avenue view and it was really noisy, I really appreciated the complementary earplugs.  Free wifi only available at the lobby.  Not sure if I will comeback.;3
"The room was nice, fairly large and very clean. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It was conveniently located to walk to Times Square .  Minor negatives:  no ""decaf"" coffee in lobby,  no morning newspaper,  no ""guest"" computer available.";4
Would have liked a restaurant in the hotel. Would have been more convenient. Since this was our first trip to New York we weren't sure where to go and given we were waiting for someone a restaurant right there would have been helpful. Ending up having to skip lunch due to time restraints.;3
My husband and I stayed here to attend a Broadway show in May 2017. We found the hotel through a last minute booking app, and we were extremely satisfied! I had read the rooms were small, but we had a double room which was very spacious. Everything was clean and well attended to. The staff were all excellent- very helpful doormen who were great with directions, the front desk staff was friendly and held our bags for us after we checked out, and the bartender was very knowledgable. Plus, the drinks were great! You must try the french martini. We had a very comfortable night's sleep. The only downside was all the traffic noise outside, but they do their best by providing complimentary earplugs...not much you can do when you are right downtown! Great trip, great stay, and we were;5
We had the best time here. Hotel was amazingly located and the room was fabulous and large for NYC! They have the most amazing toiletries too :)   Staff were very pleasant and full of information would definitely recommend staying here.;5
Excelent work ethic of staff, eager to help, knowledgeable. Clean, nice design, comfortable. Great location, easy access to restaurants, shopping, entertainment, museums, Central Park. Good area for walking.;5
Best location, best doorman, best bed.  Windows stil to be changed but else, home away from home in the Heart of NYC. As good for business as for personal trips. Breakfast is now ok, in winter the room is a bit sadish;5
First time in NYC. Liked the fact that hotel is close to times square and many other attractions. Our room was very small. Could barely walk around the bed. BUT the bed was comfy. Did not need much more than that as we were not in the room much. Staff very friendly and helpful;4
Excellent location for Time Square and local sight seeing trips. The hotel room was very clean however a little on the small side. Water cooler in the reception was excellent. Excellent gym. Only 2 devices can sign into the wifi per room.;4
Upon arrival, Jeff greeted us and took care of our luggage.  He was wonderful for our whole stay with recommendations for a close quick bite and getting us a car for departure.  The rooms were more spacious than I expected for NYC and very comfortable.  I only wish there had been more instruction on leaving your key card in the wall to keep the AC running and also that there was a power strip kindof hidden under the bed (we figured these things out on our 2nd day).  There were plenty of elevators so it was never much of a wait but you did have to go to the lobby and ask the front desk for ice.  Overall though, very clean, nice establishment in a great Times Square location!  Would highly recommend!;4
Upon my arrival - was given an upgraded room - CHECK Very comfortable & very clean accommodations - CHECK Excellent customer service - CHECK Special shout-out to JEFF - If you have a question, he has the right answer!  Very personable & highly professional. The only downside - free wifi only available in the lobby.... Will definitely return!;5
Best location ever, 2 steps away from Central Park , Times Square and basically everthing in Manhattan. Our room was very quiet, didn't have a view but it didn't matter because it was very quiet. The only minus: they charge for internet in the room. I would love to be able to stay there  all the time.;4
All the bellmen, especially Jeff, were kind and very helpful. The hotel was clean and beds were comfortable. We all sleep very well. The room was quiet! We didn't hear any outside Times Square noise during the night. The hotel is the perfect location if you're looking for a hotel near Times Square but also near Central Park with easy walks to the Subway. We would definitely recommend to family and friends!;5
We had a great stay. Vlad checked us in. He was wonderful. Everyone that works at this Hotel are very accommodating and happy. We were just a couple of blocks from everything! Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Broadway shows. This was a great staycation for us. We usually go out East On Long Island, there was so much more to do here and more reasonably priced. We will definitely stay again.... I will probably ask for the mini bar to be locked and get all the pricy snacks out of the room, too much room for error.  The beds are almost as good as home.;5
Visited NYC for a couple of days. Been upgraded to a king sized room without even asking for it. Best location and very quite and clean. Staff were awesome. Jeff the doorman showed great care regarding taxis and rates. Receptionist were so kind and helpful. Definitely going to stay there again next time.;5
Very nice room with outstanding beds. I did not want to get up in the morning, I was so comfortable. The location was great for us as we were attending a yearly festival, so we definitely plan to come back again. Every staff person we encountered was pleasant and helpful.;5
Our double room was a squeeze by situation. Beds very comfy!  But no room for our bags. Modern decor and clean bathroom but tiny. Dark room with a wall clock that didn't work seemed weird that no one noticed;4
On check in we had our room upgraded as we were staying for a week and given access to the hotels wifi at no extra charge.  The room was spacious and had everything we needed. It was located at the back of the hotel so although it didn't have a great view it was at least relatively quiet.  The hotel is located in the heart of the theatre district and only a five minute walk to Times Square and ten minutes to Central Park. We couldn't have wished for a better location.  We didn't really use much of what the hotel has to offer as we only slept there due to long days doing all the tourist things but did find all the hotel staff very friendly and helpful.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and stay here again in the future.;5
Clean, comfortable and all staff was extremely friendly and accommodating! Jeff hotel staff offered great directions on navigating around the city and Jouvier bartender completely listened to me and my friends cocktail request and delivered quickly and efficiently.  Will definitely come back next visit!;5
The location of this hotel is great no question as was the rate paid compared to other hotels. The bedroom and bathrooms have been recently updated and it shows.  Clean, modern, comfortable...however....there is no getting away from the noise of the external fans outside my room 814 or the air-con noise. But the hotel does provide earplugs and they did the trick. All in all no regrets in picking this hotel.;4
The location was fantastic, right next to the Ed Sullivan Theater in the heart of the theater district. We walked to the theater every night. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. And the beds were super-comfortable. i would definitely stay there again!;5
Good, but pillows lumpy and remote control dead.  Hotel was pretty quiet for sleeping so that I would choose it again and can walk to Central Park and Lincoln Center.  The room needs more lighting. Not enough lighting to pack or write.;4
Very very noisy street, and noisy old air conditioning system. WiFi not included despite the high price of the rooms.  Great location, in between Time Square and Central Park, and close to the subway.  Too expensive for this kind of hotel, even in Manhattan.;2
comfortable, not too loud and close to everything. got a good nights sleep. rain shower, very tall. spacious room. no HBO. small closet. helpful staff and lots to eat right around there. bar looked ok, but didn't  use it;5
I arrived at 8am on a Monday morning and the person working reception managed to find me a room so that I could shower and put a suit on for business meetings. The room itself was unremarkable if a little unimpressive. It was a very small room, so much so that the maintenance man that came to fix the safe could barely fit in it at the same time as me. The full length mirror was not attached to the wall and covered one of the electrical sockets. The room itself however was in very good order, modern and recently redone. The ensuite shower room in excellent order too. The view from the room was of the 'courtyard' overlooking the other side of the hotel. However as I stayed here it all made more sense. I barely spent any time in the room as I was working, and the early check in was;4
The Americana Hotels is located near the Central Park, easily accessible via the Metro, and a short walk to many good restaurants and sights in New York!  We did not eat at the hotel, but the first evening we at at a neighboring Mexican restaurant called Iguana! Excellent choice!!;3
A very good hotel! Excellent rates for the area and great location in Time Square. Very friendly staff. Would recommend if you are looking for a hotel close to everything at a good price. Restaurants, bars, and shopping are within walking distance.;4
Clean, comfortable, great staff (especially Jeff, the doorman, he was helpful and a wealth of information, the title of concierge would suit him better)! Excellent location, in the heart of everything yet very quiet. Looking forward to our next stay!;5
Meet by a good door man ( Jeff ), great reception service, room was spacious, clean, beds great ( best we have slept in a hotel) room cleaned, bed made everyday,great bar, only down side nowhere to get a drink during the day unless you go to a coffee shop, spent 5 days there will go back again;4
The Ameritania Hotel was excellent.  The value was very good.  The staff was most helpful.  Jeff, the bellman was very helpful with directions and storing our luggage.  We were able to leave it at the hotel before and after our stay. Yassin at the front desk was very friendly.  They called my cell as soon as our room was ready, about an hour before check in.  The room was efficient, clean and the bathroom was modern and also very clean.  The location could not have been better as we were there for a play. I will look for a room at the Ameritania the next time we visit the city.  Will also recommend to our friends.;5
We stayed here May 2017 for 5 nights and found it to be in the perfect location. The reception desk were very friendly and helpful, we reported a broken towel rail in the morning and by dinner it had been fixed. We found Geoffrey the porter the best!! He recommended places for breakfast, area's to visit, what to do when it rained and also told us they are able to arrange a nice car to take you back to the airport. FYI the Cascade diner about 200 yards down from the hotel does a fabulous breakfast, I would also recommend the Stage Coach Irish bar which is just around the corner from the hotel on 7th Avenue. The only problem we encountered was the noise, do not expect a quiet nights sleep. We repeatedly checked the windows to see if they were open as they kept no noise out at all.;4
I have never came to New York before so I had a hard time in choosing the place to stay. Later I found Ameritania which is located closed to Times Square. The staffs are really friendly and helpful. Mr. Majid, one of receptionist is really understanding. He helped me with all of the things that I need. He was patient. I would recommend this hotel to people who want to stay in Midtown area. The room is clean, I was also upgraded to a bigger room which is located at the highest level. The bathroom is clean and new.;5
We spent 9 amazing days in the Ameritania Hotel. When we arrived everyone was very nice at the reception. Because of the long stay we received free wifi in our room. In addition our room was bigger than what we booked and it was on the 10th floor. The room was clean well equipped. The heating was useful since we had some cold nights. The bathroom looked elegant and had Bigelow toiletries. We did not expect but we had complimentary tea and coffee every morning and also there was a huge water container with ice where we could refill our bottles whenever we wanted. We did not try the breakfast. Our room was cleaned every day and it looked perfect whenever we got back from a trip. The staff was very kind, I have to mention that Jeff, Julian and Yassir were extremely helpful as well;5
The Ameritania hotel has a very central location, on the corner of Broadway and W 54th street. So, if you desire to be very close to Times Square, this is a good choice. This area of the city can be extremely crowded in the afternoon and at night, due to the proximity of musical theaters - and simply because: It's Times Square. So, if you prefer your hotel to be in a calmer area, you're better off selecting a hotel in another area of Manhattan. For instance SoHo or Greewich Village.   The room was nice, with a nice bathroom and good beds.   Also they make good cocktails in the hotel lobby bar. We even received a little thank you drink on the house, one evening after we had enjoyed a few cocktails there.   What was not a good experience, was thw wifi. It's free in the lobby, but;2
My daughter had a 10 am curtain call at Carnegie Hall. We decided to stay the night before for a stress free transition from sleep to performance. We also booked the next night so we would have a base of operations. The level of service we required was vigorous. Vlad checked us in with ease and panache. The room was excellent. We didn't need a view but we did need comfortable beds and room for our Diva to get ready. Ameritania delivered. I called for ice and extra towels and there was a knock on the door with what I asked for almost as soon as I hung up.(amazing). I have to say the beds are out of this world. Vlad and Elana was an amazing, kind, efficient team.  I love when a plan comes together, thank you Ameritania for making that happen.;5
We love the hotel. It convenient to everything.  Staff is awesome.  We stay her usually several times a year and have gotten to many of the staff. they have made me feel very comfortable.  They go out of there way to be sure we have what we need.  I recommend staying here to anyone.;5
The location of the hotel was perfect. Situated just off Broadway, within walking distance of Time Square. Plenty of restaurants, coffee stops and theatres. You definately won't be bored. Quite central to major attractions.;4
Great Location to Time Square, Broadway Shows, Rockefeller Center and Central Park. My daughter and I  stayed at the Ameritania Hotel  in November 2016 went to Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Decided to come back to spend more time in Central Park in the Spring, did not disappoint. I Love NY!!!;5
"The Ameritania is a nice hotell close to broadway and central park. The room I stayed in had a nice bathroom (Newly renovated) It was also right next to ""The Late show with Steven Colbert"" and that was great for me.";5
I have been staying there on and off for years.  This was by far the best experience I have had.  the room was great , the people at the front desk were great.  I feel like the hotel has reached a new level of customer service and look forward to many returns.;5
Doorman, Jeff and clerk Mathew were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast at the hotel had pastries at least a day old and hardly edible. The room, was small and the mattress was too small for the base and one could easily damage a foot getting around it as there was very little room between the bed and the wall. These need replacing to fit the mattresses. There should be a restaurant in a hotel of this size but it seems the owners have no wish to spend any money on the hotel.;2
this hotel is in a great location as its within easy walking distance of central park, times square, fifth avenue and many more of the famous attractions in Manhattan. the rooms were spacious and immaculately cleaned every day. the staff were excellent. they were all very helpful, especially Jeff who was fantastic with advice on using the subway organising taxis and generally the best way to get around the city. he also has great advice on places to eat and visit. we stayed at the hotel as a family of four our kids being ten and eight and the hotel was perfect for us. we will definitely be staying here again when we return to New York next year. highly recommended.;5
A perfect location to stay in New York. excellent service and good rooms. Almost Every where in new york is free wiffi but not for free in the hotel rooms. Only in the lobby. The airco in the rooms are very noisy. But overall it was a perfect place to be. we enyoued.;5
Very helpfull deskmanager Eli who upgraded us from a very small room that webooked to a nice doublebed one!  doorman Jeff  was veryhelpfull!  Nice and trendyhotel with a very excellent location near time square and metro !!!;5
The Ameritania has excellent front desk staff and doormen. We had a lovely spacious room on 10th floor with walk-in shower. Extremely comfortable beds. The location, on the corner of Broadway and 54th Street was perfect for walking to Times Square, theatres  and all attractions. Also only a short stroll to the subway, so very conveniently situated.;5
What a fantastic location, close enough to the action, but far away enough for some peace and quiet. Great staff and the room was spacious and clean. Its close to Central Park for that early morning exercise and you can stop by 2 Bros pizza just across the road for your 99 cent slice of pizza for breakfast (or anytime of the day since its 24 hours!)  Close to subways and the port authority bus terminal and walking distance to all the Times square sites.  My only criticisms were the fitness room was quite small and cramped and the air conditioner in the room worked fine but was quite noisy at night.  Great value and would recommend.  If you are getting a private car to get to the airport, be weary of what they charge. When I swiped my card it said $71.5 on their device but came;5
The Ameritania Hotel located in Midtown New York really did my new wife and I proud for our first time visit to NYC on our Honeymoon. Our Irish eyes were always smiling as the moment we arrived Julian the Porter took fantastic care of us. Vlad at Reception upgraded our room and arranged complimentary Champagne which was a lovely touch to set our mood on our romantic stay. While Emily at Reception organised upgraded seating at a Broadway theatre located nearby and a final mention for Jeff the Porter who seen us off safely to Newark Airport. We both want say thank you all for an excellent experience and brilliant service.;5
The hotel is great with splendid customer service. Julian did a great job taking care of my mother and me when it came to our bags and getting a hotel back to JFK. My only complaints are that the breakfast wasn't the best for the price that we were charged and our toilet kept making noises throughout the night. Granted, we didn't expect the best, but we were in a rush and hoping for something more... balanced? for the price. If i recall correctly, it was approximately $11. As for the toilet noises, it was distracting trying to fall asleep at night, but was not horrendous. Overall stay was great though.;5
Great Hotel with good price and nice location! Near to the Central Park and Times Square! There is a Subway near the hotel. The bedroom is ok and renovated. There is a pub next to the hotel that´s very good for those that like many kind of beers.;5
"The Ameritania at Times Square is a wonderfully unique hotel with a caring staff and great accommodations.  It's location on 54th and Broadway made all of the theater district accessible while being a little ""off the beaten path"" made it a quiet oasis after a busy day of theater and sightseeing. The Ameritania will be at the top of my places to stay list for my next trip to New York.";5
Even though I live in NY, I wanted to stay at a hotel in the city on my wedding night. Unfortunately I wish I chose a different hotel. The front desk person was not welcoming at all. There was no hot water when I tried to take a shower in the morning. The only plus was that the hotel gave my husband and I complimentary champagne to celebrate our wedding.;2
My experience of this hotel was ruined on the last day.  The hotel itself is fine the room was quite large and good view of times square from the window. It was constantly noisy but we didn't really mind. They gave us free wifi as well.  However on checkout we paid in cash. We then realized they took the whole payment off our debit card as well. They charged us twice for a 4 night stay. I had to ring them to escalate this and it then took nearly two weeks to refund the money that was taken off our card without any approval (Over $1000.00 including deposit!)  New York was an amazing trip and I have been three times and will probably go again but will definitely not be staying at this hotel again.;2
the location of this hotel is perfect to me. It can be reached timesquare, central park, 5th avenue, as well as subway easily. Nearby, there are a lot of restaurants and one 24-hour supermarket.   the neat of hotel cleaning is ok. the reception service is average only without smile (am i doing something wrong ?!) . no wifi in room but in lobby, please get prepared before if you are going to online in room.   everything needs to pay in room , including bottle of water. but the hotel still offers water in lobby that is appreciated for such dry weather.   the people staying at the gate whose attitude is much better than those in reception. They are helpful and friendly.;4
Brilliant location in walking distance to Time Square, Central Park and Hells Kitchen. Good subway connections located nearby. Hotel room was small as expected in New York however was perfect for two adults to sleep and get ready in. Room was clean and bathroom also clean. Room was cleaned daily and bathroom supplies replaced daily. Iron provided in room and safety deposit box free of charge. Reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Each day they either helped us locate our destination and offered alternatives when it was raining. Maps were provided for free. Also free water cooler available in lobby with free wifi. Overall excellent stay and would definitely stay there again.;5
I was very impressed with this hotel.  We were greeted by the bellman who was very kind and helpful.  The room was a good size, clean and comfortable.  The location of the hotel was perfect, easily walkable to the theater and Times Square area, but a much quieter atmosphere.  I would recommend this hotel highly.;5
"Spent 6 nights in this hotel and recommend it very highly for its convenience to the attractions New York has to offer. Central Park is in easy walking distance. The subway is close-by - and on a straight line that takes you Downtown - and thus most of the main ""must dos"" such as Statue of Liberty, World Trade Centre/Observatory/Observatory.   A bit further away - but an easy walk - is down to the High Line and Hudson River Park (Intrepid Museum and a lovely walk along the river for its own sake). Get a 7 day Metro Card - great value at $33 dollars each and saved us a lot of money! Avoid cabs (expensive). Although addressed as Times Square - thankfully the hotel wasn't right in amongst the Times Square bright lights and mayhem (having been there I would not recommend a hotel";5
"Great location, just next to Broadway. Close to subways, Times Square and Central Park.   Staff was always helpful. Doormen greeted every time, helped with luggage. Special thanks to Jeff and the curly haired black man.  Breakfast was ""too American"". No veggies or healthy sandwich toppings available.";4
Really liked this hotel, it was in a great position between Times Square and Central Park. From arrival to check out all of the staff were friendly and very helpful especially Jeff who recommended a lovely Mexican restaurant and arranged a car to the airport for us. The check-in was simple and our allocated rooms were great. I had let the hotel know that our friends were celebrating their wedding anniversary and they had a card and a bottle of wine waiting in their room. It's little touches like this that make you want to go back. If we visit NY in the future I would definitely stay here again.;4
Our party of 4 stayed in the double, double room for four nights and it was perfect for our needs. Plenty shower gel etc and the room was clean and big enough to accommodate four large suitcases! The staff were very welcoming and friendly and even printed off our boarding passes for us. They left us a bottle of champagne in our room as I and another member of our party were celebrating our 50th & 30th birthdays!  Jeff deserves a special mention, he recommended places to eat and organised our return taxi for us. The Ameritania is ideally located for Broadway, Times Square and Central Park. If you get the chance... stay!;4
Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel . Fabulous staff, extremely comfortable beds. If you like a firm bed, you won't like it, but we loved it. Great location . Close to subway stops and times Square. Will return!;5
comfortable hotel in good location in Midtown. Kind staff always available. good quality of the room (Queen Standard) and efficient housekeeping. we didn't use others services and we can't give our opinions.;4
Our only reservation when booking the Ameritania was the number of reviews that mentioned the air conditioning was very noisy. So when we arrived in our cosy little room and turned on the air con we were not surprised that it was quite noisy. However, it was effective and cooled the room down quickly so we would go for a quick blast then turn it off. If only we had mentioned the point before the moment of our departure because we were assured that it is possible to improve the situation. Just tell the desk and they will send Jeffrey to come and fix your air con to make it as quiet as possible. So please, don't let this point put you off staying here.  The hotel was lovely overall. The rooms are indeed a little small (exactly as described) but they have a lovely comfy and quite;5
We visited NY in November from the UK and stayed at this hotel. The location is perfect, rooms very nicely decorated and bathroom a good size and very clean. The bedroom itself wasn't huge but that was fine as we were out early for breakfast and didn't return until late evening as there is just so much to see and do in this fantastic city. The staff are very efficient and helpful, special mention about Jeff, very helpful and informative with really good advice especially as this was our first visit to NY. I would highly recommend this hotel.;5
Great hotel to stay in location is just far enough away from the craziness of Times Square but close enough to enjoy. Only two blocks from Central Park.  Staff were very pleasant & helpful. Room was modern & a lil bigger than expected from NYC we had a double room 911.  Only issue was noise from street at night;4
Excellent location in a walking distance from many main attractions, i.e. Times Square, Theater District, MOMA and much more. The property is well kept, the room rather small but the bed very comfortable.;4
Very good hotel in a great location, staff were friendly and efficient also good selection for breakfast. The only negative would be there are no tea/coffee making facilities available in the room and the shower wasn't that great.;4
We were looking for a reasonable priced (by NYC standards) hotel in the middle of the city since we were planning to be visit with friends in TriBeCa and Harlem and were pleasantly surprised by the Ameritania Hotel. Just a few blocks from Times Square and close to Central Park, this was the perfect location for our stay. Check-in was a breeze and the hotel staff were very helpful. The rooms are not large, but very modern, clean and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable — almost too comfortable since we didn't want to get out of bed. The only downside was that our room was on the 3rd floor with a not-so-great view of the brick wall/patio of the restaurant next door. The noise from the patio was very loud at times, but it was tolerable. We never heard our neighbors;4
everything about the hotel was great, the location was excellent, we could walk everywhere.... friendly staff , comfortable rooms , two thumps up for everything When I come back to New York , and I will one day, I will stay at this hotel again;5
This is my 2nd time at the Ameritania. What I love about the Ameritania is the staff from the doormen to the front desk - they are efficient & friendly. Our room was excellent w/ fun decor. & though tight w/ two beds-- we had a comfortable stay. I stayed here 4y ago w/ my older teen daughter & we had a great time. 4y later, the hotel still feels fresh & looks nice inside the room. The only update that would have made our stay a little better would be outlets or USB access bedside for charging.  The city view rooms are nicer a stay (4y ago), but if your out & about your entire visit (this stay), you'll probably not notice.  Recommend this hotel  :);5
We had a good experience - the location was good, here was nice modern decor and I enjoyed use enjoyed the gym. The free wifi was just in the lobby. We appreciated the complementary upgrade and good customer service.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights on a trip to celebrate a 50th and a 30th. Hotel is in great spot for all the major attractions I.e. Rockerfellar, Empire State, Central Park etc. We were on the 10th floor and there was a fair bit bit noise from outside, but it is in a busy area and it is NY. Room was the double, double and we had no problems with space or storage. Very clean room and sheets were changed after 2nd night. Good shower and clean bathroom with plenty soaps etc. Staff all very pleasant and helpful with printing off our return boarding passes. Guys on the door really friendly and give good tips on where to eat, directions and such like. Jeff in particular is worth a mention. Friendly, helpful and even arranged champagne for our room when we said we were celebrating special;4
The Ameritania's location was ideal for us in selecting the hotel but the friendliness of all of the staff sealed the deal.  A minor problem with access to wi-fi was corrected easily by the front desk staff and otherwise no problems were encountered.  A request to change the check-out time to one hour later was quickly accepted.  The hotel is clean and the room comfortable.  We will definitely stay there again.;5
This hotel is amazing. The staff are wonderful and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and are so helpful. Perfect location and the bed was so comfy, I've never slept so well! I would definitely stay here again.;5
Lovely hotel near times square staff were great especially Jeff always there to help and give good advice also would like to mention Javier the bar tender and Said they were great too, the hotel was very clean and well maintained , rooms a bit on the small size beds were comfy but overall was happy i would recommend this hotel and definitely stay there if i get the chance to return.;4
My standard queen bed room was so tiny but nice. Really comfortable bed and linens. Very clean. Speedy check-in and check out. Friendly and helpful staff. Great midtown area close to everything. Would definitely recommend. Wi-Fi in rooms should be included in price though.;5
We had a room that overlooked an outdoor bar patio -- it was only an issue that we were jet lagged and wanted to nap during happy hour.  Thought the room's lighting could be better-- felt a little dark. Also, first night bedding smelled like the air fresheners one hangs in cars and the second night it smelled like another disinfectant.  BUT...the staff was incredibly friendly (even though they forgot to text me that our room was ready) and I loved the free coffee in the morning.;3
The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I will surely return to the hotel when I return to NYC !!!! The next time I would like to have a room with a view of the city as this time touches an internal view;5
This was my second stay at the Ameritania and I want to recommend it again. The location is outstanding, very close to multiple subway stations, Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall, etc. The staff is terrific, including Jeff and the rest of the extremely helpful bell staff. My room this time was small and starting to show a little wear but still comfortable. Lots of relatively inexpensive restaurants in the immediate area for breakfast and lunch. Right next door to the Ed Sullivan Theater where Colbert hosts his show.;5
Friends of ours recommended the Ameritania Hotel as they were very satisfied last year when they visited NYC. It was indeed a great choice as the hotel is very well located, right between Times Square and Central Park. The staff has been very courteous and helpful throughout our stay. The room was very clean and comfortable, just what we needed after a long day wandering the city!;5
This hotel is in a great location, a short walk to the bright lights of Times Square or a short walk to Central Park.  I highly recommend this hotel, just thinking of my stay makes me want to come back. New York is the greatest city in the world!;5
"I am lucky enough to own a travel company and get to see the world for a living.  This hotel has been great for my groups in NYC (anywhere from 25 to 125 people), along with my choice for an individual stay.  The staff is knowledgeable and accommodating, especially Vlad at the desk and Jeff the bellman.  They have managed to move my groups in/out effortlessly.  Breakfast is good (with hot waffles), and the rooms are a bit larger than some NYC ""boutique"" hotels.  The location can't be beat for student groups.  It's a little off the ""Times Square"" path, but an easy walk.  Having access to the subways within a couple/few blocks is helpful.  I've worked with the sales staff who do an awesome job.  The front desk is always prepared (and the rooms ready upon arrival).  This is a gift";5
The Ameritania is a boutique hotel situated just off Times Square and is only around the corner from a subway station which is probably the best way to navigate New York.  The rooms are fairly small but they are spotlessly clean and there is complimentary tea/ coffee/water available in the small breakfast area on the ground floor.    The beds are very comfy and the showers in the bathrooms are top notch.  The staff at the hotel are very friendly and they will help you out with any queries that you might have and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any potential visitors to New York.;5
The Location of the hotel is excellent! Very near to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park. The Customer Service is excellent and the complete Staff is very friendly and helpfull! JEFF and his colleagues are great! Jeff gave us great tipps and informations during our stay and he organized also the transportation to the Airport!;4
"Want to be in the middle of everywhere? Then this is the place. Staff are excellent the location is amazing. Only down side for some would be the room noise, but I liked it, I knew I was in NYC!    TIPS: Go to stardust! Especially in the morning (no queues)  DO NOT buy tickets from GrayLine (Sight Seeing Pass) doesn't work at a number of attractions and you either end up paying again on the gate or you have to walk miles to get tickets validated then walk back to the attraction and wait in queue again! I wish we'd gone with the Explorer Pass like I was going to.  Shows: a number of empty seats every night, if you're flexible for time; go to the show and wait for everyone to go through and pick up spare tickets for a fraction of the cost! But do go and see Kinky Boots, an";4
I stayed at the Ameritania while on an arts trip with a large group. The rooms were very clean, with amazing waterfall showers and comfortable beds. Although getting anywhere in New York requires some walking, I was pleasantly surprised with how accessible most subway stations were from our hotel. Additionally, the staff were excellent, especially Jeff, who helped our group store our luggage before check-in and check-out and arranged our transportation back to the airport. Overall, it was a wonderful experience!;5
We have been coming here for years. Best value in Manhattan.  Great location and service. Very friendly. Well staffed.  Theyvgobiut of there wayvto accomodate your needs.  Continental breakfast is a great addition.    If you have a car the public parking is validated and price reduced from anout $60 to $40;5
This hotel was simply a place to sleep whilst visiting New York at Christmas time (a must do experience). We left most mornings before 7am and arrived back at 11pm for the whole 7 days.   But on saying that he hotel was clean and tidy and was in a brilliant location. Right below central park and above times Square. The staff were all lovely and helpful. We never ate here and we didn't use the bar. Only thing was I don't think we had doubled glazed windows because it was so so so load on the road below us but we mostly didn't noticed because we were so tired from being tourists all day.;3
Great location,clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Staying in New York is not cheap but this hotel was reasonable. Only complaint was the lightning in the room was not great and the bar was closed one evening;4
Hotel is close to Time Square but just enough away from its noise and at times excessive crowds. Room was cleaned well daily, spacious and the bed was comfortable.   Big shout out to concierge staff Said who was a big help in getting us around New York and Jeff who helped us check in and check out seamlessly, both a massive asset to the hotel.   All in all a great stay, great value for money and I'd definitely consider Ameritania for my next visit to NYC.;5
Caveat: My first mistake (hindsight is 20-20) was staying so close to Times Square.  What a circus!  Sure, it's something to see and experience (for ten minutes or so) and my tickets to a Broadway show had me wanting a short walk home after, but knowing what I do now, I wouldn't hesitate to stay outside this tourist-trap disaster and take the subway in for a show.  So, if you are like me and are a first time visitor to NYC and are traveling on a budget, but still want to experience, eat, and stay outside of the tourist-trap zones, please keep reading.  If you are happy as a clam to be packed inside Times Square for the duration of your stay (only venturing out to the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, perhaps), then our travel tastes differ greatly and you probably;2
Very good service and execllent location at W 54 street and Broadway. A bit old-fashioned rooms with perfect beds. The restroom was new and fresh. Personell were polite and friendly. Exellent Bar in the lobby;4
Good hotel to be into and the location is good and quite place. 5 min walking from Times Square . They have a bar in hotel , people are very good. Recommend to stay for all people who are in vacation or in business trips;4
Great location, slightly away from the noise of Times Square and just a few steps to several subway stops. We had a deluxe room and it was very good, plenty big enough and a nice bathroom with natural light and a window! After quite a bit of confusion checking in, Rob helped me out and even upgraded our room free of charge so my friend and I had two beds instead of having to share! Thanks so much! Would definitely recommend if you can get a good deal, expensive otherwise. But you get what you pay for in NYC;5
I recently stayed at the Americana Hotel in NYC for a girls trip.  It was a great location for the theatre.  The rooms were nicely appointed.  Everyone associated with the hotel was very pleasant.  Breakfast was good.  I needed an expedited  checkout and Majid, one of the men on duty was very accommodating.;5
Great location and best night of sleep in a very long time!  The staff was very welcoming and the room was spacious, relaxing, and quiet (usually tough to find in New York City)!!  I definitely recommend this hotel to those wanting to experience a piece of NYC!;5
Hotel was very clean, sheets and towels changed everyday and great walk in shower. Rooms were spacious for NY hotel and only complaint would be is that general area is noisy at night but nothing ear plugs wouldn't sort out (it is the city that never sleeps). Staff were great in particular the door men, and Said the door man was brilliant, also Haviar (probably spelt wrong) the bar man. Said made my fathers holiday, it was his 1st time outside of Europe and Said was great fun with good advice. NY eating out is expensive, go with staff recommendations and cheapest breakfast with best value is the hotel buffet. Staff gave great tips and help to holiday in NY. Overall would recommend and return;4
We were extremely pleased with our stay at Ameritania.  Matthew at the front desk was so welcoming and friendly. The bellmen were engaging and helpful. We will certainly return. Great location, but it's the customer service that will make us return.;5
Nice hotel close to everything on mid Manhattan. Had a room with 2 queen size beds and it worked good for our family with 2 daughters of 13 and 15. But the room isn't very big... Air condition was quite noisy and a bit bad adjusted (too small span from when turned off until turned on again or the opposite). Very nice support from the doorman. Poor refilling of practicalities like shampoo and toilet paper.;4
This is a typical smaller hotel for NYC.  The room was somewhat small, but believe me, I've stayed in some much, much smaller!  It is fine for one person for a few nights, but could get pretty crowded for two.  For instance, there is no sofa or side chair (there is a desk chair).  The staff are extremely courteous and nice.  There is a bar there, but on the same street there are several restaurants from high end steak places to a classic burger bar, and of course, each of these have a bar.  I would stay there again for sure.;4
Overall was good as the location is right on Broadway so if Time Sq and Broadway is your thing its fabulous. WiFi was a paid service in your room, unfortunately it wasn't working for the 6 night duration of our stay. Worked in the lobby however. Room was spacious and comfortable, but the outside noise was relentless through the night but hey you're in NYC.! Staff was friendly and helpful and Jeff at the front door was great. Breakfast was far too basic however plenty of places around give good breakfast!;4
Very nice place and awesome people. I want to give special thanks to Duke for his attention. I only missed a better breakfast but it wasn't a problem because the location of the hotel si perfect and there are a lot of restaurants in the zone.;4
Rob was the most helpful, kind, and charming person I have ever had the pleasure of talking to. He brightened my day by making me smile. Rob truly is a great human being and made me enjoy my stay at the Ameritania hotel that much more because of his exquisite service;5
Location is perfect. Broadway directly in front of the door. Times Square 5 min. away by foot. Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center are both reachable by foot within 10 min. and you get a great impression of Manhattan on your way to them.  I booked through a online holiday portal and booked a room for 2 adults (me & my brother) but it turned out it was a one with a single bed. However, the hotel staff (here Rob) was very attentive and arranged another room with two separate beds at no additional cost.  The doormen are also very attentive, most of them are multilingual (I heard at least French and Spanish apart from English). They have great tips for having lunch or dinner etc.;5
Great location near Time Square & Theatre District. Staff was efficient, friendly, and helpful.  Our doorman Jeff  was so friendly and helpful. He gave us the best tips & tricks to navigate the city. Room was nice -- I would highly recommend staying at this location.;5
Nice clean smaller boutique style hotel.  A bit surprised by no in room wifi included in rate, but probably just a NYC thing.  Maybe I just couldn't find the right line to wait in:)  No issues with the room or service.  Good room service at a reasonable price.  Just big enough room for 2 adults/2 kids with very small carry-on luggage.;5
I have stayed at the Ameritania Hotel two times while visiting NYC.  I will not stay any other place on my future trips.  The location is perfect.  Very close to Central Park.  Close to Times Square as well, but not right in the heart--which makes it less crowded than those other places right in the middle of Times Square.  The service is outstanding.  The minute you walk in you feel valued, important, and very excited about being there--from the door person to the desk staff.  Rooms are clean and very stylish.  This place is top notch.;5
When arrived, were greeted by Happy and we welcomong staff! Without asking, our room was upgraded free of charge! Our room was unexpectedly large! We had a great view of broadway also! Our room was cleaned thoroughly everyday and clean towels replaced daily. The location is perfect, a short walk from Times Square and Central Park. A huge thanks to Jeff who organised our shuttle to the airport which cost us half the price of our taxi cab to get to the hotel from the airport. We had a fantastic time! Thank you NYC, see you soon!;5
Having read good reveiws about the hotel we were disappointed when we stayed there for 2 nights recently. Our bedroom was at the back and was described as'quiet' - in fact it overlooked a noisy ventilator and we could see into the bedrooms opposite. The small breakfast room had a poor selection of food choices, I suppose most people went out. On the plus side, the staff were helpful and pleasant and the hotel is in a great position for Central Park and Broadway. Pity about the room!;3
I did not realize that the hotel was on the corner of Broadway when I booked, but was pleasantly surprised to find that out. The location was amazing. The rooms were beautiful. The lobby was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful. I will be back!;5
Our stay was absolutely perfect, nicely decorated and renovated rooms. Amazing bathrooms with awesome showers and complimentary name brand shampoos etc. Location is perfect as a short walk to Times Square and many many MANY A choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Highly recommend.;5
very good hotel close to everything you can possibly do and see in new york staff are amazing from the management to jeff on the door would certainly recommend this hotel to friends the rooms are modern but not spacious but then in new york you dont expect spacious but are cleaned daily one little thing that goes a long way for me was the way they treated an elderly lady called mary with the respect she deserves who lives in the hotel as she was an original tenant when it was apartments the way the staff cared for her ie checking on her if she didnt come down all day was fantastic she should consider herself a very lucky lady to have such caring people around her all in all book it and you wont be disapointed;4
An eclectic hotel, close to the subway and many attractions.  Confortable with a nice and helpfull staff.  Rooms are big (very rarely in NYC).  A great option if your are theatre lover.  The Central park is quite near, so you can run every day;4
Ali on reception was so helpful and friendly, nothing was to much trouble.  He made sure our stay was not only comfortable but provided us with information to enjoy the city. The room was lovely and clean and we never noticed cleaning staff around but it always seemed to be clean.;5
In room, there are snacks and beverages are expensive. No need leave there in rooms.  Should be in gift shop rather than room. Outside MM candy cost 99 cents compare your hotel $6.00.  12 oz water cost $5.00 compare 12 bottles cost $3.99.;3
Wonderful stay.   One of the better hotel stays we experienced. Desk staff very friendly and helpful, Door man terrific! We have already recommended Ameritania to business associates and  will continue to do so.  Thank you Ameritania for making our NYC stay relaxed and enjoyable;4
Excellent hotel and staff, from the very beginning from the moment we booked 11 months before our arrival for our first wedding anniversary, nothing was too much trouble for this hotel!   Hope to return to this hotel again this year. Great location we have stayed in many of a hotel in NYC now and this most definitely is out our favourite.   Loved every bit of it.;5
"Excellent service and accommodating staff; comfortable spacious rooms...everything in walking distance. I would definitely come back to this hotel. and great value.... comfortable beds, and nice bathrooms";5
Ok so review is a bit late as computer has been broken!   This hotel is a great little gem, great price and fabulous location!  On arrival we were upgraded to a room with two double beds, on the corner of the 12th floor, (Room 1201) for New York (so I've been told) the room was huge! Beds were comfy and shower was amazing! The location is literally a walk from Times Square and in the other direction Central Park!  Jeff on the door was really friendly and informative, as was Elena on the reception, there was a little confusion on checking in as they wanted a deposit of $100 for extras which we didn't know about from our travel agent so maybe making it known would save others a lot of embarrassment!  Habvier (spelling?) on the bar the first two nights was lovely, he came out to;4
My experience at this hotel was very good.  The employees were very friendly and the room was very clean.   The location of the hotel was very convenient to everything.  It was very close to subway and very close to Time Square and Rockefeller Center.  I will recommend this hotel.;5
very good location near many hotels that are very expensive since tourist centraly...but this hote has nice rooms and amazing staff while being very reasonably priced...  you probably miss sometimes but worth a look when you're coming to NYC...   Matthew Stewart at front desk is excellent;4
Room was tiny, bed uncomfortable, room was tiny, temperature gauge did not work, room faced an alley, loud outside, weak water pressure..I felt like I was at a prison getting a conjugal visit. I was embarrassed to bring my girlfriend here - shame on you Ameritania;1
Another delightful stay at the Ameritania, made even better by Jeff and the rest of the friendly and helpful door and front desk staff. Other reviews have mentioned noisy stays at the Ameritania -- if you want quiet, ask for a room on the Broadway side of the hotel. Okay, not the classic scenic New York view. But if you want scenery, it's all right outside the door of the hotel. And you'll have slept well.;5
I will for sure stay here again. Very clean. Close to many attractions, bars, lounges, and restaurants. Whole staff was great. Matthew at the front desk was very very helpful and polite.! You and your family will be happy you stayed here.;5
This was a reunion trip for me and a friend I hadn't seen in many years. NYC was halfway for us. I was searching for a decent hotel in a great location, but one that wouldn't break the bank. Well the Ameritania isn't a decent hotel - it's a very nice hotel! They do not have valet parking, but validated parking at a garage across the street is $40 for 24 hours, which is $15-$20 less than any other hotel I checked. One of the nice bellmen took the luggage out of my trunk and kept it while I parked. The lobby is modern, very tasteful and pretty, and check-in was quick and easy. My room was modern and clean, and the bed very comfy. The lighting in the bathroom made my complexion look flawless (I'd like to take that lighting with me wherever I go), and the shower was the best ever.;5
Surprised my husband with a long weekend away to the beautiful New York City. Ameritania hotel was central for everything. Beautiful hotel, clean and tidy, very comfortable beds, lovely friendly staff who spoke to us on a daily basis and helped out with lovely places to eat. Both door men Junior and Jeff were just brilliant and couldn't do enough for us. Keep up the good work guys was a pleasure to meet you's 😁👍. Look forward to another visit in the near future;5
The hotel is centrally located on BROADWAY. On 54th st. Easy walking access to many attractions. The hotel is clean well maintained and has helpful staff. Room and bed are excellent,as are the usual facilities. There is a small exercise room and sauna.,neither of which did I use. There is a bar,open in the evenings. Breakfast is available in a smallish dining area. There are many eating places to cater for all needs in easy walking distance. Wifi is available free in the lobby,and in the rooms for a charge.  Free WiFi is accessible in the rooms from a citywide service too.;5
Had a great night stay and walked to meeting and then to Central Park.  Great location. Right on 54th Street.  Good restaurants are all around.  If you want a nice quite hotel at a reasonable price this is the place to stay.;5
Very good hotel and staff thank you all! If CAN i will return on your hoTel and i will recommand it! Good location and safe place ! Unfortunatelly you don't have free wifi on the it's really good if you CAN provide this service;4
Amazing staff that go out of their way to accommodate your requests, everyone is friendly and helpful. The hotel has a fantastic location that lets you explore the city easily and trendy decor for you to relax in when you return. Love this hotel!;5
The employees at the Ameritania went out of their way to make sure our stay was a pleasant one. Our reservation was complicated and got a bit messed up. Upon arrival the front desk staff were more than accommodating and fixed all of our rooms. Jeff the doorman offered excellent suggestions on restaurants and sights to see. Javier the bartender took care of our large group at the end of every day with a smile and kind word. The hotel was clean and comfortable with no city noise. I would recommend the hotel and plan to make it my go to place to stay in NYC.;5
Stayed here  for  4 nights in march, the location was ideal 10 mins walk from central park  and 5 mins walk   from times square.  The hotel  has that modern feel  with lots of black and red leather  and chrome in the main lobby area,  however   the furnishings  are showing signs  of wear  and tear.  the hotel is very clean and our sheets where  changed  everyday,  however our rooms  where not serviced until quite late in the day sometimes  as late  as 3pm. the  beds  and pillows  where very comfy,  there was an iron and ironing board in  the bedrooms. The bedrooms  do not  have tea  and coffee facilities, complimentary  coffee is only available  at breakfast time.  THE HOTEL ONLY OFFERS CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST which  included fruit, yougart cereal muffin, bagels  and toast for $12;4
There's nothing better than a boutique hotel. The staff was so helpful and our doorman took care of our bags when we arrived and when we needed to get a taxi. He literally chased down a taxi for us. We also got food delivered from Angelos pizza and it came in 15 minutes. It's right in Times Square and super close to Central Park.;5
We recently stayed here, the staff are great and could not do enough for you, big thank you to Matthew and all the team at the hotel.  The hotel is located just a few blocks from times square and many other main attractions, we have no hesitation recommending the hotel.;5
This is our 20th visit to NYC but our first visit to this hotel, it won't be our last.  What a gem of a hotel in the middle of everything you need to get as a tourist.  We had a great welcome and had a lovely club room on the 7th floor facing out on broadway. The room isn't big, but the bed is amazing and the bathroom is perfect. How long are you going to really spend in the room anyway when you have all this great city to see.   Every member of staff has a smile and is friendly and everyone offers to help when you need it. Special mention to Jeff who helped us out on our last day.  The hotel itself is five min walk to time square and same to Central Park. What we loved is that it's two mins to 8th and 9th street which for us is the most exciting part of the city now with all;5
Jeff and the other door guys couldn't do enough what an asset you have there in Jeff. Yes the rooms r small but no smaller than other rooms I stayed in NYC. Breakfast was so much better than I had expected. It rained the whole time I was there but it was a sunny atmosphere at the Ameritania .;5
The hotel was just beautify decorated to start off with. The staff was so accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay special! Once in our room again was amazed at how clean and comfortable the feel was. The bed was made for a perfects night sleep, and the shower was one of our favorites! the waterfall shower head and the beautiful tile truly made it a wonderful experience. I would definitely return every time were in the city! its in a great location to make travel very easy.;5
Stayed a week in this hotel. Extremely friendly and helpful staff and rooms were very very clean. Only free wifi at reception which was a little annoying but other wise couldn't fault this hotel! Would definitely stay here again;5
We thoroughly enjoyed our recent trip to NYC and our stay at the Ameritania. It was so convenient to theaters and restaurants and shopping. Jeff greeted us at the front door and the staff were all very welcoming and helpful. Check-in staff was very helpful and the bartender was delightful. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room nicely appointed. The closet is teeny tiny but numerous wood hangers were available. We stayed 3 nights and walked or used the subway.;5
If you want a cuppa tea/coffee anytime take your own travel kettle and buy your own teabags or coffee in a supermarket because you will only get them free between 6.30am and 10.30am other than that the hotel was fab  especially Jeff the concierge;4
If you want to spend your holiday in Manhattan and not in the suburbans, it's definitely the best place for you! Literally 5 minutes from Times square and you could be anywhere in Manhattan in 20-25 minutes by metro. Rooms are clean, staff is very friendly, the bed is very comfortable. They offer free coffee and tea every morning until 10. The only negative side is because of the location, it's VERY noisy. They give for every guest a pair of earplug, but if you can't sleep with earplug (as I can't), it's not the place for you. We had the luck because they had an other room on the 10th floor and after the first night, they've changed the room for us. After that, I could sleep like a baby :)    They offer free wifi - unfortunately, only in the lobby. So every time you need;5
Supper small room, no space for a second luggage. Very noisy environment, noisy air conditioner, the location is good though. Never go back because the room is too too small, uncomfortable. Won't recommend.;1
Our experience was most enjoyable. All the staff were great but especially Jeff the doorman, he was very helpful and friendly and a credit to the Ametitania  His knowledge and suggestions of Whatton do during our visit was priceless. And the transport arranged by him to take us to the airport was fit for a president;5
Its a great hotel thats in a very good location the doormen are very helpful has 3 lifts and have been told that there is disabled access the bed is extremely comfortable and we will be returning ....... thanks jeff....;5
Great hotel for the price. The staff is all very kind and helpful, and manage to stay organized and pleasant despite having a constant flux of people coming in and going out. Want to mention Julian and Jeff definitely, who helped me both when I arrived with all my stuff, and helped me when I left as well. Not only that, but both were pleasant every time I saw them, and remembered me throughout the week.;5
Very Noisy. Staff was ok. Bartender was the best part, has great advice on local services. Gym was small and irrelevant. Overall average. BUT VERY Noisy inside and out. It would not be on the top of my list, but as a back up hotel it is ok.;2
Picked hotel due to proximity to Ed Sullivan theater.  Couldn't have been closer!  We had a great room, king deluxe, and we were quite happy with it.  Bed very comfortable.  Could not control the heat/cooling.  Price very reasonable.;4
Had a great time staying here, the staff were all fantastic, a special mention goes to Jeff at the door and another member of staff whose name I forgot to get who gave us some great travel tips. When we first arrived we started to wonder out of the hotel to find somewhere to eat and and explore a little bit he pulled us aside and gave some great tips on where to go and where to avoid, invaluable to us who were visiting the city for the first time - every hotel should do this!   Rooms were very clean and housekeeping did a great job too.   There were only a few things that are worth pointing out:  1. The lifts in the mornings were very busy and often had long wait times, we were on the 9th floor so using the stairs was a bit of a pain!  2. No tea & coffee in rooms, I knew this;5
We stayed here for the last 5 nights, with it being our first time in New York City the location of the hotel was perfect, 2 minutes from time square, all the door men who great you when entering or leaving the hotel were very nice and if you need any tips on New York they are happy to help,  Jeff on the door was more then helpful and a friendly face when getting back after walking all round the city,  We were given free wifi which works all round the hotel and rooms, a great + after when we booked it said they did not have wifi in the rooms, I would stay again and recommend this hotel to anyone, rooms cleaned daily,  Thanks to everyone at the hotel who made our stay in New York wonderful.;5
Had a really good visit here. When we first got here we didn't get a room wth a view and the man who brought our bags up over heard me and got us moved the next day no charge. We got given free room wifi. Rooms are standard but when your in New York you don't want to spend time in the room. We stayed for 5 nights. The only downfall are the lifts, one always seemed to be broken and they take forever to arrive. There was 2 door men that were wonderful the one who moved us who I don't know the name of. And Jeff he was brilliant always a smile on his face and happy to assist. All the staff here were very well mannered and accommodating. Hotel is in a perfect place just near Times Square. I would recommend and visit again myself. Thank you for making our stay a great experience.;4
Located near Theater District and very near to Times Square. This hotel is a great place and it's very well organized starting from cleanliness to environment inside or outside the hotel.  A great location, rooms are small but very satisfying!;5
Lovely central hotel, clean and close proximity to key NYC areas... rooms are small (like most in NYC) however I would certainly stay here again and would recommend to friends & family. Rooms were cleaned every day and lobby area was clean & welcoming.;4
Good clean friendly environment. Good location. Some staff I felt were inapproachable. Although door staff and bar staff very helpful. Nice room and ensure good. My son used the gym often and found it well equipped;4
This hotel has good reviews for a reason, that is because they are very true. From the moment of our NYC adventure starting to the last, this hotel delivered.  Our visit was to celebrate my wife's birthday, we did all the usual tours and sightseeing which were amazing but always had the Ameritania to return to.  Excellent location, cleanliness, reception, rooms but the best were the staff, Emily, Julien,  all were superb.  Big thank you to you all for a fantastic stay.   All the best and be well. See you again hopefully in the not to distant future.;5
Noisy all night long! There was a girl crying in the hallway in the middle of the night along with a loud conversation! Outside noise was hurendous. A man nocked on a door at 5 am and had a loud conversation with a person who answered the door.;2
Duke was a great manager!  !He was very helpful and always willing to improve. The room was very comfortable. The hotel was in an excellent location. Cleaning does need improvement in the rooms though.;5
This was our second stay at this hotel, and certainly won't be our last! The lobby is gorgeous when you walk in, and the staff is always so friendly and helpful! The bed is like a cloud, in a room that is just beautiful and always clean.;5
We had an amazing experience overall. Location, cleaniless, staff friendliness and value makes this hotel one of the best options in NYC.  Broadway and subway station so close that makes experience really enjoyable.;5
You couldn't ask for a better zip code when in New York, step right out the door and you're a stones throw from Times Square. Really short walking distant to Central Park and all the shopping streets. Front desk staff and doormen really helpful when needed advice on where to go/eat. Bed was super comfortable and although noisy (to be expected in NY) the hotel provides ear plugs which is a great touch.;5
Everything about the Ameritania Hotel was excellent - all of the staff were extremely helpful and courteous, the rooms spacious and comfortable...I will definitely be returning. Jeff on the door gets special shout out for being so helpful in every way!;5
This hotel was booked through a friend who is an independent travel advisor, and came by recommendation.  Hotel was perfect location for Times Square, Broadway and Central Park to name but a few. Could not fault anything during our stay, doormen were exceptionally helpful each day.;5
Stayed over St.Patricks day weekend. Rooms were a little on the small side, but to be expected in NYC. Rooms were clean enough but didn't get the sheets changed the whole four nights - not sure if this is standard procedure? Staff were great especially Jeff - thanks for all your advice and recommendations! Amazing location, hotel is 5 mins walk to Times Square and in close proximity to all the theatres too. Good value for money and would return if coming for another short break!;4
This hotel is well positioned for access to the the activities around the times square it is clean and the staff are mostly friendly  There is a lack of information in the rooms regarding hotel facilities;3
Fantaboulouse hotel 2 minute walk to centre of time square,excellent customer service ,very clean ,has to be one of the best hotel I have stayed in for short break .mathew was very helpful when we checked in ,smooth guy that for sure.;5
This hotel is a great place if you want something right next to the E line to get to LGA or downtown. It is only a couple of blocks from Central Park and Times Square. It is on a good side of Broadway so no worries walking back late at night, plus grab a slice of pizza from 99C Pizza across the street if it's late.  Room: Clean, Small, Comfy, just what you need. Bathroom was up to date and had nice finishes. Room was on the top floor and although you can open the windows toward Broadway, other that the occasional police siren, it is very quiet, even during rush hours.  Hotel: All staff very nice and helpful with all questions. Bellman does offer free luggage storage for late departures.  Great hotel. Definitely recommend.;4
Hotel room was comfortable  (especially the bed). I did not pay for the wifi. Staff seem to be very nice addition accommodating. Great location..close to Broadway shows, Times Square, and Central Park!;4
No  Broadband in bedrooms i sa huge disadvantage. Some of the furniture in the bedroom was in extremely poor condition and was reported to staff but nothing was done. Noise levels outside by Garbage staff was ridiculous at 4am.;3
This is a very conveniently located Midtown hotel, around the corner from the Ed Sullivan theater on W 54th Street.  The lobby was a shock in a way, with a great deal of bright red and while they say it is furnished with antiques it seemed more like dated 80's garish to me.  The amount of scarlet is just too much--certainly it doesn't make you feel restful or cozy.  They may be striving for a high energy vibe although I just wanted respite from the city.  Our standard room was very small, which was expected.  The bathroom had been upgraded somewhat recently and while small it was organized and had a walk-in shower.  From our room on the 8th floor we still heard a lot of outside noise, which is perhaps par for the course in an older building in New York.  The beds were quite;4
First of all great price. The location gave us excellent access to all things mid town. Subways very close by. Staff professional and very helpful. Mathew at the desk was above and beyond an asset. Continental breakfast in the morning , happy hour til mid night. Wifi is adequate and negotiable. Rooms smallish to fairly comfortable. Most beds are queen size ish ... Kings can be had and are available. Hotel has been remodeled and is up to date. I recommend this highly;5
Attendance from all the hotel staff, services offered and cleanliness of the rooms, in my stay, were of great quality. Even though I did not enjoy the hotel bar, the little time I was there was very well treated.;5
The best thing about the hotel is it's location! Thereafter, it's all about good value for a NYC property.   The standard rooms are absolutely tiny but just ok for sleeping and washing. Beds are smallish but fantastically comfortable. Door staff are super-helpful and the Reception team are good too.  Overall, the decor of this place is modern and, if room size won't ruin your city break then you can't go wrong with The  ameritania.  Would be go back? Not really sure. I would probably try and find somewhere with bigger rooms in the same area for a similar price however, if that fails then I would be happy to revisit.;4
Excellent central location. Considering   the reasonable price the facilities and staff exceeded expectations. Helpful and courteous Doormen, in particular Saíd who arranged at relatively short notice ground transportation to the airport. As we had a helicopter tour on the afternoon we were leaving Saíd took great pains to assure us that he had informed the Driver of our plans and therefore even if we were to be slightly delayed in our return to the hotel, the Driver would wait for us. A huge thank you to all the staff at The Ameritania for positively enhancing our NYC experience!;5
I booked for my wifes birthday and we both loved the hotel. All the staff were great and our room was fab. 12th floor and had a great view of Broadway. Staff even put a bottle of wine in the room for the wife's Birthday.  Great location as only 10 mins to Central Park or Time Square. Plenty of Subway stations nearby for journeys all over NYC.  Yes there is some street noise but that is to be expected when in such a busy location.   Will stay here again. The only minor thing was only having a shower, after long days with lots of walking a bath would have been good.;5
Situated between the 57th and Broadway this hotel is convenient and cheap by NYC standards. Rooms are ok, the bed was truly comfortable. The staff is friendly and efficient. All in all a good choice if do not aspire to luxury and function is what you privilege. There is also a small gym open 24/24.;4
Hubby and I stayed here for few nights - king size deluxe room (11th floor). Staff very helpful, location great for walking to major landmarks or jumping on subway. Would defo return and recommend to others.;5
Great stay for the money. We were close to many major attractions. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The only issues were it's a bit noisy but to be expected in the city and our room door & keys didn't always work properly.;4
My partner and I came to NYC for our 5th Anniversary.  Everyone at the Ameritania went above and beyond our expectations.  It was always refreshing to have Jeff greet us in the morning as we were leaving to explore the city.    Will definitely return to this hotel, if I am able to book a room.;5
This was our first stay at the ameritania and will certainly return. All staff very helpful and friendly. From checking in and given a free upgrade sorry can't remember staff name but so helpful. Got to mention Jeff and Mourad on the door, full of helpful information and advice. Also got to mention Javier who tends the bar, what a great guy. Can't wait to return thank you all;5
Me my wife of 3 weeks and daughter visited here for one week beginning of March from start to leaving on the  last day the staff from cleaners, to mourad and the rest of the doormen, the front desk staff and management and finally Javier the bar man they were so friendly and helpful. We were on our honeymoon and when we arrived there was a card congratulating us and a bottle of champagne nice touch it was also our daughter's 16th while we were there and they did the same for her a couple of bottles of pop and a muffin.  Javier the bar man was so friendly we had quite a few drinks with this guy ( also really funny) overall fantastic holiday fantastic hotel . Also walking distance to time square and central park if we ever decide to go back to Newyork this hotel will be my first;5
Excellent hotel very central everything was within walking distance. Staff were very informative and helpful. Doormen Jeff & Julian were always smiling and helpful. Bartender was a lovely guy made some fantastic cocktails. Lovely complementary tea & coffee provided in lobby every morning. Room on the 12th floor, could still here traffic but slept very well, earplugs are provided. Bed was very comfortable, wardrobe space could have been better, maids very good room always tidy. Would definately stay again.;5
Excellent. Can't rate the place higher than 100 percent. Fab location. Staff are awesome and help u with absolutely anything. Nothing too big or small. Rooms and public areas spotless. We will definitely be back;5
Great hotel. Excellent location. Staff really friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. Doormen are excellent. Can't do enough for you! Will definitely be back! 🗽👌🍎🖒🤓;5
Great location and great staff.  Just around the corner we had Broadway and around the block a lot of restaurangs to choose between. Times square was just 500m down from the hotel. For the money we paid for the hotel we couldnt ask for more :).;5
Nice hotel, very close to Times Square and Broadway. Good base for visiting NY. The room was clean and well appointed, lack of a view but that didn,t bother us. The only thing that let it down was the breakfast.;4
Hotel was nice and clean. Easy check in, from the time we walked in to the moment we were in our room was about 10 minutes. Doorman Jeff was excellent and helped us with any questions we had about New York! Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to New York.;5
My friend and I stayed at the hotel for a couple of days, which happened to be the days of the recent snow storm. The room was a good size for NYC, very clean, modern and updated, and a GREAT LOCATION! We booked the hotel at a great price on Trip Advisor. Especially compared to other downtown hotels, this was a great value. It is about in the middle of Times Square and Central Park, right next to different theaters. Jeff at the front door was really helpful when we were trying to find transportation to the airport, which happened to be cheaper than UBER that day. I recommend it!!;4
The lobby and shared parts of the hotel have an interesting style, not full classy but it has a fresh, modern look with a zest of kitch.   Decently sized room given it's NYC. I loved my bed which was very comfortable. Being just a few blocks away from Broadway and Times Square enhanced my experience.  I was there during hot sommer days - and was happy that the (noisy though) aircon worked perfectly.  Per se having free wifi in the lobby is a rather good idea, however as a consequence lots of people do stay/sit there, which on top of the ones checking in and out can make the place crowdy.  I'll definitely consider this hotel next time I'm in town. Had very little interaction with the staff there, reason why I can't rate it anything else than average.;4
Stayed here in early March on a trip with my grandmother, originally booked standard room but decided to upgrade to the deluxe room and I'm glad I did, the room was great, it was on the 5th floor, overlooking Broadway, room came with two very comfortable double beds, one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept on in a while, a big TV with plenty of channels, was even able to watch some of the English football, a big closet which came with a safe, iron and ironing board and a free to use umbrella. The bathroom was also very good with a large shower, again one of the best hotel showers I've had in a while.   Room also came with a mini bar which was very well stocked, even included chargers and other similar accessories, although I think it was over priced, but good nevertheless. If;5
we stayed in The Ameritania for 3 nights to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. From the minute we arrived everything was absolutely fantastic. The hotel is in an amazing position: sandwiched between Times Sq. and Central Park(both walkable). we were upgraded to a double/double room which was extremely comfortable and had everything that we needed and more. The staff cannot do enough for you : They go out of their way to help and to make your stay an enjoyable one.  When we arrived in our room a bottle of fizz had been placed on ice along with champagne flutes and a birthday card for my daughter. What a lovely touch which got our amazing weekend off to a great start! You cannot go wrong booking The Ameritania. We will definitely be back next year;5
My sister and I came to New York for 4 nights & stayed in this lovely hotel. We got a warm welcome from Mathew who was fab with us. All staff were great & the door men were great as well. Jeff & his team (doormen) were great, they helped us where to go, with our cases etc. We had the maid in every day with clean towels & fresh bed sheets. Defo coming back to these hotel when we visit again.;5
The lobby is quite pleasant and modern.  Free wifi is available in the lobby.  The room was in good order and reasonably clean (the top of the mini fridge was pretty dirty though).  The bed was a good size for 2 people and very comfortable.  Lost 1 star as our aircon unit broke and leaked water all over the floor while we were out.  The hotel sent someone up promptly and offered us another room.  They also offer a free breakfast but the choice was so limited we didn't bother with the breakfast.  We were on the 12th floor.  It was reasonably quiet but still the usual street noise from the city.  The staff were friendly and the door was mostly manned.  Jeff took our bags out when we left.;4
This hotel is by far the best that I have ever stayed in when visiting New York. Matthew gave us a room upgrade which was amazing - the beds were so comfortable! Jeff and Said on the door were just lovely - in fact all the staff are lovely - so friendly, courteous, helpful and everything you could wish for - and in an amazing location. We will be back! Thanks so much, Cassie and Claire;5
This hotel is excellent. I made a reservation for 2 and were upgraded upon arrival! Very friendly and helpful front desk, and while it was very hot in the bedroom, the maintenance man can promptly and sorted out the problem.  Also, you can beat the location as it is at the corner Broadway and 54 st, I.e very close to Central Park and time Square.   I would certainly recommend other tourists to stay there and we would love to come back there again!;5
Modern industrial look. All the staff were friendly and eager to help. A concierge contacted me upon arrival to ask if I needed anything.  Had left an item in a room which they had in lost an found- very pleased!;5
Upsides: Very good location for access to Times Square and Central Park. Downsides: really tiny room and WiFi only in the lobby. Room was ready early and as requested it was on an upper floor so was quiet.  Great service.;4
We booked to this hotel because it was in the heart of the city. Prior to checking in, we called the hotel to tell them that we are running late because of our delayed flight.    Our flight was a disaster and were already not in a good mood to begin with. We were both greeted by Enrico and Duke at the front desk with enthusiasm. Welcoming us to the hotel like family. Telling us how happy for them to see us and that we got to the hotel safe and sound. I was taken aback by the genuine concern of these two gentlemen. We have been to many hotels but we have never seen this type of concern coming from any of them.   My mood changed because of what I heard from those two, I calmed down and proceeded with the check in. Duke gladly explained all the amenities at the hotel including the;5
From the minute we arrived we were look after. The Staff were do friendly and the place looked amazing. It was my Wife's 50 Birthday and she was overwhelmed by the wine and complimentary drink on checking in. The Front Door guyou were so helpful with directions for getting around New York canto wait to stay here again;5
Had a wonderful time in the Ameritania Hotel, it was close to time square and Central Park, staff were very friendly and helpful. Jeff in particular gave us some good advice on we're to go and eat. Hope to return soon;5
Rooms are very basic but you only sleep in them! Can be very nosey but tbh you don't sleep much anyway.  Staff is great and helpful especially Jeff.  Also the man with the waistcost  :)  . Rooms were tidy .;5
Beautiful rooms and exactly where we wanted to be located for our first trip to NYC. We didn't even need to use the subway for our first 2 days because the location was so convenient. Some of the rooms are very small but that is to be expected, and both rooms we were in were clean and stylish. Reasonably priced and the air conditioning was a huge, huge added benefit.;5
Just returned from our second stay at this hotel within the space of a year. Always impresses with the friendly staff, clean room and great location. Matthew on the reception was extremely helpful and even printed our Warriors Knicks tickets at no ckst so we could go to the game, he's a credit to the hotel. Also have to mention Jeff who is a bit of a character and makes you feel right at home. Will definitely be booking again and staying at this hotel.  Tim and Kylie Hosking;5
"Matt was very helpful and super nice. The hotel was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. Nice bedding. Great location. Great service. We would definitely recommend staying here to friends and family;)";5
Could not recommend enough! brilliant atmosphere, so clean and close to everything (just blocks away from Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other) the staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful, especially Julian recommending the best ways to do things etc.. as well as providing us with a lovely chat! Everyone welcomed you back after a long day of walking all over the city. Room was so spacious. Everything was always pristine. It was our first holiday together to the US, and they couldn't have made checking in, organising a car to the airport, etc.. any simpler.  Will be booking again, to come back later in the year, as soon as we land home! Thank you all so much, and see you again soon!!;5
Small hotel in an excellent location, rooms are small and basic but clean. Mini bar as always way over priced. Road noise through night was at times unbearable with roadworks, construction and garbage collection going on.;3
I was just happy with the whole situation everybody what professional and knew what they were doing. Been going there for the past four years and will continue. There was no I in that team and I really appreciate that;5
Really nice Hotel! Stayed here for the week and cannot fault it! Clean and tidy! Gyms smaller than it looks on pictures but all round lovely service! Jeff the doorman went above and beyond to make sure we didn't need anything! Hats off to the guy he's awesome!;5
Great location within a few feet of the 7th Ave E-Train station.  Super convenient for access to Central Park and the Theater district.  Within a 5 minute walk to MOMA.  I have elite status with one of the major hotel chains that has many properties in Manhattan, which I would normally stay with for the points or points redemption.  However, for this recent trip,  I chose Ameritania based on a package offer from one of the major Airlines that flies into JFK (think Terminal 5 tenant).  I am glad I gave Ameritania a try!  Stayed in the 12th floor two-room suite.  Very nice!  I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it.;5
Great location , right inside the heart of Times square so can't get any closer if you tried. We visited this hotel for 5 nights in February 2017 as soon as we even checked in Jeff made us feel wright at home. He went the extra mile with vital information and no job seemed to difficult for him also. He was the main reason why we loved our visit so much and would definitely book again ONLY if he is working again. Hotel its self was nice had a nice American atmosphere around it , nice receptionist and bell hops.;5
Only draw back was no tea/ coffee facilities in rooms but available in the lobby. Jeff the doorman is brilliant, very helpful and informative. If you need anything ask Jeff. Beds are amazing! So comfortable.;4
Good overall experience. We had a pleasant stay and we will come back surely. Thanks Jeff and all the staff for your service. Hotel at the heart of Times Square but quiet in the room. A lot of restaurants and subways are near.;5
Times Square at your door step! Booked via Hotel Tonight, we were able to stay in the heart of Times Square for $150! The room was small but clean and perfect. Overnight parking was just $40 and directly across from the hotel. We will never stay anywhere else in NYC again!;5
My husband, myself and our two friends stayed here at the end of February for 7 days, the hotel location was perfect and the staff were fabulous on the front desk and at the front of house, recomended great places to visit and where to eat, this was our 4th visit to New York,  and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, a big thank you to said and jeff you were so helpfull  Look forward to next time,    :);4
This hotel is a good find. The staff is friendly and very accommodating.  The lobby area and rooms are very clean and the beds exceptionally comfortable. It is in a very good location right outside of Times Square and close to Central Park and MOMA. There is a quiet little bar off the lobby and a breakfast room if you choose to eat there.;5
We ve just returned from a five night stay in this hotel.On arrival the guys on the door were very helpful and friendly.The reception staff were too.We were shown to our room which was perfect Two double beds,a lovely big shower and plenty of  space for our clothes.The minibar was pricey but probably in line with prices we found elsewhere .Handy though for storing drinks we bought each day from a small pavement van round the corner,much cheaper.The safe was a bonus too.We ve been in many a city hotel with no safe.Jeff on the door was great.He told us how much he liked his job and how he enjoyed helping people and it was obvious he did .We asked him if there was any chance of a later checkout on our last day and he was only too willing to help,thanks again pal.The hotel is in an;5
Hotel lovely and very convenient for Times Square, Central Park, etc.  Staff were very helpful.  Unfortunately we got very little sleep due to the road noise.  It's on a corner with two very busy roads outside.  We were only there for one night, otherwise we would have asked to be moved to a quieter room (if they exist?) or moved hotels.  It's a shame, because the hotel itself seemed lovely but I guess there is little they can do about the road noise - if you want the good location you have to put up with the noise!;3
The Americana is were I try to book first when I travel to NYC. It is clean and comfy and so close to lots of interesting city amenities. Central Park, Theatre district, Times Square, good restaurants are all close by.;4
Just back from staying at this hotel, would highly recommend it, it was beautiful and very clean, the staff where so good very attentive and helpful , especially Matthew, Julianne and Jeff, I would definitely stay at this hotel again , it was my birthday and Matthew up graded are room and had champagne sent to are room with a lovely birthday message.which was a lovely start to are holiday. Could not praise the staff enough, definitely would stay here again .;5
It started the wrong way even before I arrived! I was trying to call the hotel in order to notify my wife on a cancelled flight, but the only telephone available would go through to a call center, where the option to speak with the front desk was not working. The people at the call center REFUSED to acknowledge this !!! and only after shouting and after calling them three times and spending half an hour I was able to speak to someone that manged to get me through to the actual hotel ! Then, they charge the WIFi in the room!!! In 2017!!! SO, if you have to do some work just forget about it! Then the front desk personnel except from a manager there that was very polite, everybody else treated me impolitely, I asked once for the lobby WiFi and instead of just giving it to me the;2
Hotel was in the best location for access to all major sights. The decor was to a very high boutique standard and friendless of staff was excellent. Bonus of free coffee and tea each morning. We would definitely return.;5
Great Hotel, great staff, great concierge, great locations just outside of the noise of Timesquare, close to subway. Easy access to get to highway and to quick ride to airport. Would like to give a shout-out to Jeff who made our departure very easy, holding on to our luggage for us, and then getting us quick transportation to air port.;4
If you look for a small (but not tiny rooms), charming boutique hotel in the heart of Broadway and central Park, that is the place.  Nice quiet room, in my case facing inwards which I prefer, good size bathroom, cleanliness appropriate (I liked the architecture style of the beds and so inspected a lot under them)  Good toiletries.  And a great price /value!!  Rush to book it.;5
The hotel was spotless clean, comfortable beds, excellent staff & beer at the bar is $5.00 an absolute bargin in NYC. Julian at front door was extremely helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone;5
My sister and I stayed here in the middle of February. The hotel has a fantastic location for exploring all boroughs of New York. Really close to subway stations and very easy to navigate around. The staff were helpful and not overbearing. There was no expectation from them for us to leave tips every time they held the door etc. The room was compact but more than big enough for two of us. The only complaint we had was that it was so dark in the room, even with all of the lights on it seemed like dusk. There was a charge for using the wifi in your room but we didn't mind not having this and it was free for all in the lobby. Overall a fantastic stay, incredibly reasonable, nice room and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend it to friends and would come again.;5
Very clean and friendly place-convenient to all parts of NYC. Front desk was helpful with any request we had. Comfortable room. Our second stay-would definitely recommend for future stays. Restaurants and pubs nice and convenient close by.;5
"Can't beat the location of this place--close and walk-able to everything in and around midtown Manhattan.  Although the clientele (on both of my stays here) seems like you are staying in a hostel, this quirky hotel has everything you need, and if you don't have it, just ask for it. Front desk and bellmen were both extremely helpful with my dumb tourist questions, and quick to offer help in booking show tickets and basketball tickets. The single room was relatively small, but the bathroom was quite large, and I loved the ""rainfall"" shower head in the bathroom. I didn't really use the lobby amenities such as breakfast or hanging out using wifi, but I did go to the lobby bar for about 30 minutes my first night there. Other than that, it was mainly just a pit stop on my various";5
We stayed in the Ameritania hotel this last week and it was great! When we arrived Matthew the manager helped us check-in and upgraded our room for free. We were even gifted a bottle of white wine for free as it was our 7 year anniversary whilst we were there. Also Jeff and Julian, two other staff members, were great and they greeted us every day. The rooms are a little on the small side but this is normal in a city like New York (it didnt bother us at all). They're also clean and modern. The best things were probably the view from the room (facing starbucks) and the location. Only 5min walk to Broadway and Times Square, and 5 min in the other direction towards Central Park. A lot of restaurants, cafes, supermarkets and stored nearby. I would definitely recommend this hotel and;5
Me and my friend stayed here for 10 days and it was truly a gem found in new york from Julian and jeff at front door to Matthew on the main desk all the staff delivered on all levels of making you feel as comfortable and welcomed as possible. Each of them going above and beyond to make sure we were having a great trip and all the best places that suited our needs to go to from food to jazz bars! The location is as perfect as you can get with Times Square a 3 minuet walk away and all the main attractions maximum a 15 walk away! Also local to all the best food spots! We ran into a few problems during our trip from leaving our phone in the taxi to our flight being cancelled and the handsome wonderful Matthew at front desk truly done all he could to relax us and still make our stay;5
The staff is great. Jeff at the door was so helpful - just excellent service. Highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are good size which is sometimes hard to find for this price point. It's sometimes hard to sleep in NYC and I found it to be very quiet and comfortable. Hotel also works with a car service if you need one and they will take great care of you.;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Ameritania and cannot rate the hotel enough! Perfectly located minutes from Times Square, clean, comfy rooms, perfect for resting your head (and legs) after a long day exploring NYC. We were greeted by Jeff the doorman upon arrival who checked we were doing okay throughout our stay. Nice quiet bar area to have a drink before heading out in the evening (barman also very friendly, unfortunately can’t remember his name) Will definitely be a returning customer :-);5
I really enjoyed my stay together with my Son on our trip to New York visiting a game of the New York Knicks. Hotel Staff is very friendly and helpfull. Rooms are comfortable and clean. I would like to recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a visit to New York. I will certainly make a reservation again on my next trip.;5
The hotel staff is very professional and courteous. The room is clean, modern, and has character. The location is convenient for sight seeing and is minutes walk from Times Square. I was very impressed when I arrived.;5
If you want to stay central and affordable, Ameritania offers this with good rooms. The TV signals were poor as they were upgrading it during our stay. We had a corner room on 7th floor, with view both upBroadway and west on 54th. Noproblem with noise from traffic, but the aircondition is pretty loud.;5
Great hotel with great staff, especially Jeff and also the personal at front desk:-)  The room was big and clean and the facilites had all what we needed: bathroom: hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, bodylotion sleepingroom: minibar, some Snacks and an adapter (all 3 with costs)  Good Position near to central park and times square.   we would love to stay again in this Hotel if we come back to New York.;5
The Ameritania is mere blocks from Time Square, theaters and convenient to the subway. The staff are exceptional. Doormen are friendly, helpful and looking for ways to make your visit to NYC and their hotel the best. (Keep your eyes out for Jeff at the  door...he'll take good care of you!) The rooms and lobby areas could use some updating, but our room was always clean with towels and toiletries restocked. Very reasonable rates for this location. Has become my go to in NYC.;4
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were updated and clean. Location was central to shows, Central Park and Times Square. They had a nice little bar with some good specials, but we didn't have time to try it out, We would definitely stay here again!;5
It's perfectly located near all the major subway lines. Easy to get to from Penn if you're taking the train into NYC. Great staff, a bit congested in the lobby at times, but the rooms are a good size for NYC and all you need while exploring Manhattan.;5
We had a fantastic 3 night stay at the Ameritania .  Great location 5 mins walk to Central Park , Times Square ,5th Avenue . The hotel is spotlessly clean and the beds are really comfy. Would like to thank Jeff for our warm welcome and for looking after us and booking our return taxi to JFK .  Monkey Bar next door was great for a few drinks and Pick a bagel ( left then left again )  was superb for breakfast .  We look forward to returning .;5
Very nice hotel, perfect spot in the center of Manhattan, very kind people at the desk and at the door, good beds and a lovely room! We had a great stay, the only minus point was the sound of the Airco, but we are used to hear no sound at all at home. So maybe we are a bit spoiled when it comes to hear noises during the night. We had a wonderful time in the city of New York!;5
Location was great room and facilities awesome ... very clean could not fault it ... will book again .  Room was great size bathrooms and facilities where fantastic could not ask for more .  So close to everything , Broadway, time square .;4
Perfectly situated, minutes walk from Central Park, Times Square and subway station. Free upgrade, spotless room, helpful staff. I usually look forward to my own bed but honestly these beds were the comfiest I've ever slept in.;5
we stayed at the hotel for one week (family vacation). the staff was very helpful. good location (5 minute walking distance to Times Square). rooms are a little small, but I guess that's quite usual in NYC!;5
The hotel was perfectly placed, well within walking distance of Times Sq etc, but not in amongst all the noise. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the rooms excellent, beds comfortable, and good sized en suite, the staff were also extremely friendly and helpful.;5
You can't go wrong with this hotel, perfect location for Times Square,Central Park & Broadway. We had room 1110 on the 11th floor, it was comfortable & clean everything you need as a Base. WiFi in lobby was brilliant & the staff will do anything for you. Jeff helped to book a transfer back to the airport & stored our luggage. You will not have any problems finding somewhere to eat as the choice is vast. We would definitely recommend booking the hop on hop off bus around the city & the 9/11 memorial & museum is a must. We had a guide for an hour & half telling his story on the day.  Don't hesitate in staying at the hotel !!!!;5
Small rooms but super clean! Matthew at the front desk was fantastic. I wish I was staying longer! Right off time square, for a perfect location. Nice and very reasonably priced for a midtown boutique hotel!;5
Everything was great! I especially appreciated the free room upgrade! Almost perfect except the television reception was terrible. I think there may have been only 2 channels that didn't have any problems. But who stays in their room for that long when you're in right in the middle of New York?! The location is probably the best perk about this hotel. For my short stay, I'm proud to say that I didn't have to take a train to hit the tourist spots I needed to.;5
Highly recommended!!! Brilliant place to stay that is central to everything you need. Staff where all excellent they even helped us get tickets for the baseball match which made our trip so thank you again, we will definitely be back on our return to Newyork.;5
Room was very clean and tidy with a super comfortable bed. Jeff and the concierge team were very polite and friendly. The reception staff also were very accommodating considering we arrived way before check-in time and allowed us into a room with options to come back later that day and ask for a better view if we wanted. One negative thing was the tv reception wasn't wokring that good but we didn't mind.;5
We have just returned from a fabulous weeks holiday to New York staying at The Ameritania at Times Square. We travelled with 2 daughters aged 12 & 14. The hotel is in a prime location and once you get used to being in the city that doesn't sleep( it really doesn't!) and the sound of car horns and police sirens you do fall asleep! The hotel staff are excellent from checking in to checking out they couldn't have been more helpful. Providing us with any information we wanted from subway routes to bus/ train times and car hire. Jeff the concierge was incredible. He was always on hand to give advice providing us with maps and advice on journeys to make. He had a lovely friendly manner. We even took his picture with us to remember him. Thanks Jeff! We would have liked tea/coffee;5
We have just come back from 8 days staying at Ameritania Hotel. The location is fantastic and the rooms are just perfect for an 8 day stay.   We would like to make special mention to Jeff the doorman who always greeted us with a smile and some great yarns and made sure we were sorted for the day ahead.  What a lovely man and we hope one day we get to visit Amertiania again and enjoy the friendliness & comfort of the hotel.  Thank you.;5
We had a fantastic time at the Ameritania Hotel as the location for us was just perfect, the staff were great being helpful, friendly, informative and just fantastic from the management to the door men who welcomed us one was Jeff and the other name escapes me unfortunately.;5
We stayed here whilst visiting the big apple for three days, the hotel is excellent and has very friendly staff. All the door staff were very helpful , friendly and knowledgeable especially Jeff who helped us during our stay and with our onward journey, there was also another member who helped us by providing us with a map and directions to make our day a enjoyable one!  The hotel is very modern, clean and tidy. The rooms are spacious with all the facilities apart from wifi, but you can add this onto your room for $10 dollars a day for two devices. Wifi is free if you are in the lobby. The reception staff were just as helpful and check in and out was made as easy as possible.   It's location is spot on too. You are right in yeh middle off Times Square and only a five minutes;5
I had never heard of the hotel and was a bit hesitant but the price and reviews were were so good I had to give it a try. I requested a quiet room and was given a nice, albeit  small room facing an alley. It was more than adequate for the less than 12 hours I was in the room. The bathroom was modernized and had a nice big shower. TV was out of service when I got to the room at 12:30 and in the AM, it was working but not well. Other than that, I couldn't have been happier. Staff very helpful and friendly. I did not eat the breakfast as I had other plans. To be that close to the park and TImes Square (but not too close to the Square) for that price you'd be crazy to go anywhere else.;5
We stayed 3 nights at the Ameritania and were amazed at the proximity with major attractions for a very resonable price.  A must near Times Square for those who don't want to pay a fortune.  I will surely choose the same hotel next time.;5
Just back from a 6 day break after staying here. Modern boutique style hotel with average sized room. Staff friendly especially Jeff doorman who organised car to the airport. Our room was clean and tidy but being New York didn't spend much time in it. Would definitely recommend it as it's location is great near Time Square. Can be a bit noisy but it is New York!!;4
This place was great. Pleasant staff,great room size for nyc( I did receive an upgraded room as I booked for 5 nights). Clean room, mini fridge,asked for and received a hot pot for making tea. Quality linen and towels. Room amenities like toiletries including ear plugs (which should be standard in any big city!).  Best of all I found the location great!! Right at corner of 54th/broadway. Great for theater/Central Park/ Lincoln center/Carnegie hall and subway at 50th/or 59th.....also just 3 blocks from 5th Ave.    A great location and guality place for the price.;4
We have just returned from The Ameritania, Location is fantastic, Staff excellent, Rooms excellent with a great shower, Bed great and comfortable, What do you want in a hotel in NYC, we left the hotel at nine returned at six most evenings, quick change then dinner, it was just a place to sleep and right in the heart of theatre land.  Nothing was to much bother for the staff with knowledgeable door staff always willing to help and advise, and off the negative comments on here I really don't understand, is there nicer hotels, probably, is their nicer hotels at the same price as this hotel, I would doubt it, try it, you will not be disappointed;5
Hotel lobby and room were clean. Staff was very friendly. The only negative was that our television picture was scrambled on every channel. I reported it to the front desk and they never fixed the problem.;4
The place and price point was great BUT the bed was super soft and so although I didn't get a great night sleep I would give it a second chance because it was clean, convenient, and service great. Be aware that we stayed in a room the size of a closet but that was no problem as we were hardly in it.;3
Every time I need a hotel in Midtown Manhattan, I choose the Ameritania. It's proximity to Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller Center/5th Ave will ensure an amazing stay with great restaurants and bars close by.   The rooms are cozy and the beds are super comfortable! They even provide earplugs if you're sensitive to the sounds of the city. Every staff member is friendly and super helpful!;5
Jeff was always very hospitable and helpful during my stay.  He was a positive persona that helped me get settled for my three day stay at your hotel.  As a result,  I will book future dates.  Jeff is a positive attribute of this establishment.;5
This hotel was right in the middle of the action.  Walking distance to Times Square, Central Park and 5th Ave. shopping.  Good access to the subway as well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.    The downside:  While the room was clean, were many small items that needed maintenance such as loose plumbing cover plates, thermostat that needed to be reset, broken wheel on desk chair, windows that wouldn't latch...  Nevertheless we liked our stay because of the location, staff and price.;4
The deluxe king room was very spacious for a room in the city and the bed was very comfortable! The location is perfect for walking to Central Park, Time Square and Rockefeller Center areas. There were good options near the hotel for drinks (Three Monkeys) and breakfast (Pick a Bagel). Jeff, the doorman, was very helpful at checkout! He stored our luggage and set up a car for when we needed to leave for the airport later that day. He made our departure day very carefree so we could enjoy our remaining time to visit NYC. We will definitely stay here again for our next visit to NYC!;5
Hotel is a budget type hotel, rooms are a bit worn but staff are fantastic.  Location is center of the tourist area and very busy. Plenty of subway stations nearby and 5 minutes walk from Central Park.;3
We stayed here for four nights in February '17. It's a great hotel. It has very modern decor, well equipped rooms, and friendly, helpful staff. In terms of location, it's spot-on. It's just up from Times Square and right on the middle of mid-town Manhatten, so you're not far from most of the iconic attractions of NYC. It's also good value for money when compared with other local hotels with similar amenities.   My only gripe is that, in the city that never sleeps, you need good sound insulation and double glazing. Our window let a lot of noise in from the street and I was disturbed from time to time in the night. The hotel gave earplugs, which is an understanding gesture, but the New Yorkers' affection for the horn on their car still made it through!   All in all, it's a great;4
This hotel is right near the theatre district, Carnegie Hall, and Central Park.  Staff is very helpful.  The bartender, Javier, was sociable and helpful with suggestions about restaurants.  The room was clean and nicely furnished.  And the price is right.;5
We stayed here for 4 nights over new year and it's on time square but at the quieter side of it . It was a fabulous location . The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful and welcoming . We ate breakfast in the hotel on 1 morning which is continental style but did waffles it was 11 dollars I think but you didn't pay for children .;4
Couldnt be better, exceptional staff.Rooms were so clean and super comfy beds ,a fantastic cup of tea in the morning and free wi-fi for my son in lobby. Loved the location , very central for everything we wanted to do.Will always stay there in NY ! Thank you;5
I booked to this hotel based on the recommendation of my friends. I was a little bit early when we got to the hotel. I was greeted by the Jeffrey and helped us with our luggage. Since we were a little bit early, we asked the the front desk if we can check in early. Duke asked us if this was our first time in the big apple, we told him it was and he was more than welcoming and always with the big smile. Duke was able to not only get us to check in early but he was also able to get us an upgrade for free. Talked about a good start. He explained to us about the breakfast and the bar being open a certain time and that this hotel also has a small gym.   Me and my girlfriend tried the bar that night, and was impressed by the bar tender. I think her name was gina. She told us all the;5
Stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights it was a double double room which had really comfy beds and a great rain shower very clean and great housekeeping. Jeff and his other colleagues on the door were always helpful and offer a great service in ensuring your return journey pick up is arranged and offers peace of mind thanks for all your help;5
Amazing, cozy, and perfect for a weekend get away. Literally,  minutes from Time Square. First time in New York was nothing short of perfection. The staff was so pleasant and helpful, the room was clean and the bed was so comfortable. I will definitely be back!!;5
Perfect location in time square near to central park, good time with good people particulary with Said, Majid and Jalal. Good quality of information from the entire team..  Guillaume/François  Switzerland guys;4
Perfect location to enjoy New York, especially Time Square and Central Park and the Upper part of the city. Easy walking around day and night ,city very clean. Easy to get buses (Hop on Hop off) and get a deal to cover various areas, we even had the ferry crossing thrown in for the Staue of Liberty (Two day pass) & covered upper/mid and lower NY. No need to prebook Hop on/off buses or day passes this time of year, work out before you go what you want to go in and see as we found the day passes over expensive even though you are supposed to save $ on entrance fees as we did not want to go into all that they cover, so we were glad not to buy them before we left the UK, even though people had said you need them. Slight moan on hotel heating/air con unit in room was noisey and units;5
Very well located, the Hotel is not a luxury one but convenient, clean and with outstanding staff and service. They are very helpful for your demands and very friendly to sort your problem out The rooms are not big but confortable, Missing some restaurant and bar facilities. Ther is one in the lounge but it is not a bar to sit down and have a relaxing momment in front of a drink;5
We really enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania Hotel. Would definitely stay there again! Nothing is over the top but all is very friendly and perfect in itself.  Special thank you to the staff, you were all amazing and very helpful. Room was always tidy and clean. Location - everything you need is near by, very central.;5
The Hotel is located in midtown Manhattan. Perfect location for all activities. The downside ist the noise. So even though we were on the 8th floor the noise was quite disturbing. Additionally to the street noise there's a loud elevator sound every single time the elevator stops on your floor. Rooms are very clean and well equipped. Hotel staff and especially the doorman are very friendly and helpful. Room was always clean and had an ok size for a mid-prize-range Hotel in NYC.   So overall an ok Hotel...but be aware on departure: When you leave to the airport they offer you their own limo service. That costs you 10$ more than a yellow cab + it even takes you longer because they're trying to save money by avoiding tolls.;3
The location is perfect, the room is comfortable but the window of the bathroom isn't well isolated and it made it extremely cold. I spoke about the issue with the reception and they were kind enough to accommodate me.( they will be working on changing the window soon);4
Great location just north of Time Square and just south of Central Park. Short walk to the TKTS for discounted broadway tickets. The hotel was very clean and very accommodating. Jeff the hotel porter was extremely helpful and nice. He helped with arranging our shuttle to the airport.  The only minor problem could be the noise. We were staying on the 2nd floor and the noise from the traffic outside was noticeable. However, you are in New York City so it was to be expected. The room did come with a set of ear plugs to help with that.  Overall great experience would definitely stay again.;4
Comfortable Hotel at a prime location around 2 blocks from Times Square and a 20 minutes walk to Central Park and your now President Trump's Tower.  Hotel is excellent and staff were courteous and helpful ,with a special shout out to the doorman Jeff.  Would definitely recommend and would like to stay there again if I ever find myself again in the city that never sleeps.;5
From start to finish I couldn't of asked for more, fantastic hotel, we flew over on the 8th February for my friends 40th birthday on the Saturday, we arrived late due to being delayed at Manchester, we walked in to a modern and well decorated large reception everywhere was perfectly clean, check in was great, fast simple and both the guys on were really friendly  and helpful, we got a complimentary upgrade and the room was fabulous. We paid extra for wifi in our room and it worked brilliantly ( it's free in the lobby ) Every morning there's free tea and coffee out in the bar area, I thought that was a lovely touch and anything you need the staff are willing to help, I ordered a cupcake for delivery to our room on the Saturday as that was my friends birthday, asked at reception;5
Greet location, Jeff doorman up there with the best all staff very helpful over all great hotel &staff will go  back.only a blocks from central park.10mins walk to time square get for subway  BRIL pub next door 2 monkeys great staff as well;5
Overall a nice hotel, really friendly staff. Jeff the doorman was a really nice and helpful guy. I would stay there the next time I travel to New York as well. :) The rooms are a little bit small, but very comfortable bed.;5
The hotel is well located, on the corner of broadway and west 54th. I stayed here for a holiday for 10 days and had exceptional service and support from the staff and in particular Julian the door man. A mere 10 minutes from the heart of Broadway's theatre district, MOMA, Central Park, Columbus circle and easy access to the subway, makes this hotel great for work or pleasure. Easy access to restaurants along broadway and down eighth avenue.  The room I had was big enough for one for an extended stay, with a spacious bathroom and all the amenities. I had a couple of minor room dramas (my doing) for which service were really helpful in responding to.  To top it off, the lobby bar makes the best dirty martinis!;4
King deluxe rooms have a very comfortable bed and a great bathroom with plenty of light.  Expect loud street noise, so request a higher floor. Excellent location close to theaters, good restaurants and Central Park.;4
Wonderful. It was a pleasure staying at this establishment.  Emily was a so kind and helpful and we look forward to returning for another visit.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the location was prime.;5
I found this hotel from a recommendation of a friend that is a travel agent.  What a great find it was.  Reasonable prices for the rooms and a perfect location.  The rooms are small, but not closets.  The staff are very friendly and willing to make your stay perfect.;4
I been in this hotel last week, is nice the location is perfect, close to Central Park, 5th avenue, Times Square. The room is not bad, is it clean but the bed was uncomfortable, to small and short and the was all night long the AC noises.  If you are in vacation you need a good bed to sleep in the night and relaxing and this is not the right hotel for that!;3
Wonderful staff and beautiful rooms. Would recommend and visit again. Perfect location and newly renovated. Perfect for couples or single occupancy. Will most definitely absolutely without a doubt be back.;5
Loved our stay, in the heart of the City. Central Park and Time Square almost on door step. Clean rooms,comfortable beds and not a bad view from room. Staff very helpful especially doormen Jeff and Julian who helped us with advice, great fellas. Would recommend to everyone.;5
Amazing location, 5min walk to Times Square. Very kind service, always helpful. Modern, renovated rooms. Clean. The only issues are noise (dificult to sleep) and medium quality materace, ok for short stay. In general very happy, good value for money.;4
I booked this gem-of-a-hotel during a medical emergency and was absolutely delighted with my stay. The staff was professional and helpful and reinforced my theory that New Yorkers are still the best (I lived in NYC for several years). Flying colors! Better than many 5-star, impersonal hotels. Really!;5
In eally like this hotel. It's the third time I've been there! The localization is the best quality. Wifi is free in lobby and a little bit expensive in room. The room is clean and the staff are very gently.;5
Very good place to stay, very close to Broadway, Times Square, and Central Park . Doormen Julian and Geoffrey, very helpful giving us information about where to go to eat and places to go, overall very pleasant place to stay , would recommend to anyone.;5
This was my second trip to New York and Ameritania, what another fantastic stay - from the moment we checked in the staff were very hospitable and accommodating with any request made.   The location of the hotel is great with only a 5 minute walk to Central Park and Times Square. I would also highly recommend having a cocktail (or two!) at the hotel bar as they are well and truly delicious - they can even tailor one to you! The rooms are very clean and decorated to a high spec and also the beds are extremely comfortable.   Another fantastic trip to New York and another lovely stay at Ameritania. I would highly recommend staying here if you are after a friendly, modern, quirky hotel with a great location!;5
Loved how hotel was so conveniently situated between Time Square, theater district and Columbus Circle.  Subway station was nearby.  Made it easy getting around the city.  Was able to see several theater productions, TV shows,  museums and other attractions.   Took advantage of NYC Restaurant week and ate at several highly rated establishments.    Hotel staff was always helpful and courteous.   Room was well appointed and comfortable.   Had everything you would need including an umbrella.;5
Fantastic hotel. 5 minutes from Times Square. Hotel staff very helpful especially Said and Javier always helpful and always had a smile to welcome you- keep up the good work. Room was clean and tidy and nothing was to much trouble. I would definitely recommend this hotel  We will be back;5
Fantastic staff and service, location is brilliant, why stay anywhere else! Mention your planned day's activities to a concierge or front desk, they can really help with local information and ideas, even if you know where you're going!;5
This was my family's first ever trip to NYC and I must say the Ameritania was a great hotel to stay at. The location was great and the hotel staff were unbelievable. They were helpful at all times and very nice. The room was very comfortable and had any & everything you could ask for. The bed was the most comfortable bed I think I ever slept in. I would recommend to anyone if they are staying in NYC the Ameritania is the place to stay. I will definitely be back!!!;5
Just back from NYC staying at this hotel. Very modern, rooms were larger than expected and tasteful decorated. Beds were massive and large closet to store clothes, shoes, suitcases. Room cleaned daily. Room offered a fully stocked mini bar and snack though very expensive. Staff were very friendly especially Jeff who attended the front door, arranged airport pick up for us. Will definitely use this hotel again. Very Central to Central Park, Times Square without the noise.;5
This is a good, basic hotel with a great location. Disappointed after all the good reviews on Trip Advisor. Found staff at reception very unfriendly. There is no double glazing at all which means you hear anything and everything at street level and I was 4 floors up! My room was an interior room and was so noisy.  By the way my room’s windows were leaking. Not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady! Beds were very comfortable - unfortunately pillows were not. The clock in the room was broken and overall a bit of TLC requires. No Wi-Fi in rooms, unless you pay.;3
Extremely well situated hotel at a very good price. Friendly personell and large and cleam room. The bed could have been longer as i am quite tall (1.90m). Coffee every morning, which is very much appreciated. Personally havent made use of the gym.;5
Only arrived back in Scotland this morning and already planning our next trip. Arrived before 3pm to check in and our room was ready and it had been upgraded. The room had no view but we were hardly in the room, big spacious room that was immaculate and the bathroom was very clean and modern (lovely big rainfall shower). This hotel is in a great location with friendly and helpful reception staff, the room was cleaned daily to a high standard. Big thank you to Jeff as well, he was really helpful with directions and any other enquiries. Hoping to return next year as a repeat customer.;5
Myself and my sister spent 3 wonderful action packed days in New York.  We booked this hotel because it was in a great location and was well priced for a limited budget!  We had a double room on 8th floor, nice en suite big shower which was great!  We had complimentary tea and coffee at reception each day (including very nice calomile tea!).  Also we had a water fountain in foyer to replenish supplies for room.   5 min walk to broadway, great shopping & loads of great restaurants (something for every diet and pocket!!).  So message here great location good hotel with clean linen, new towels as required!  Very welcoming staff no hidden charges.  We didn't use the mini bar (too expensive).  Great staff, reception doorman cleaning bar staff all friendly and efficient all doing;5
The Ameritania was excellent! The beds are so comfortable and the location couldn't be better. Its between Times Square and Central Park with subway stations surrounding you. The rooms are small by most standards but fairly typical by NYC standards. Regardless if the small space they are well decorated and modern. The staff are very polite and eager to help. Marcus at checkin was our hero! We were exhausted and he got us into a room early. Julian at the door was so friendly and fun. He never missed a beat and was always smiling and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania and recommend it highly. My only complaint is the housekeeping staff was extremely loud, slamming doors repeatedly in the hall. It was annoying on days when I wanted to sleep late and felt;5
I traveled to New York for a vacation ahead of a work trip. The Ameritania is in a wonderful location close to many museums, Broadway and most of the subway lines. I was greeted with a free romm upgrade and the staff were always helpful.   You can hear some noise from the street at night, but that's to be expected from the location. Internet is only free in the lobby where it is very quick.;5
Great location, so close to Times Square and easy to work to many other sites and places to visit. The staff are lovely, very helpful and happy to advise if required. We received a free up grade and bottle of wine in our room as we were visiting to celebrate a special occasion. Thank Ameritania for this. The room was spacious and clean. The air con/heating was noisy but we rarely needed it so this didn't bother us.  The only downsides were no WIFI in the room which surprised us. You could have it but had to pay extra and the amount was $25 for 2 days? I would have thought in this age it would be available. We like to relax in our room and plan our next day, hunt out places to eat etc which meant we couldn't do this. Also no tea and coffee facilities in the room, yes you could;4
I travel to NYC for business every month.  I have tried out several properties in midtown and found The Ameritania to be my go to Hotel. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff are what truly make this place! now don't start thinking the rooms are palaces - this is NYC and Hotel rooms take full advantage of space to maximize high rent and high costs so some of the rooms at this property can be tight and others are spacious!  The beds are platform and while not my kinda bed for home, they are comfortable. Decor is a funky charm. The location cannot be beat for times square and midtown west. now to the staff - I have stayed here over 15 times in 3 years and the staff are what makes this a great place - I hope corporate treats them well!!   3 staff on this visit really went;4
Always stay here on business. Great location for mid-town business connections but also for Times Square and Central Park, both just a short walk away. Comfortable place to stay, very clean. All the staff are very helpful and friendly - particularly Jeff, who sorted out my luggage and taxi with professional ease and good humour.;4
"This hotel is a great value.  The location is excellent. The staff is very good and pleasant.  The rooms are always great. Well maintained, great décor.  Everything works. When you walk in, you don't think it's a decent room, you think ""nice room!""  Not sure why this isn't listed as a 4-star hotel.  I've stayed in 4-stars in midtown that aren't as nice as this hotel.";5
We stayed at the Ameritania for a four night break in early December.  Fantastic location so close to Times Square and Broadway, 10 minutes walk from Central Park or about 15 minutes down to the river.  The hotel was very clean, friendly and suited us perfectly as we chose to eat out for all our meals. The room wasn't very big but comfortable and not too noisy as we were on the 6th floor. Would highly recommend this hotel and the reception staff, especially Said for all his helpful advice.;4
Great central location with access to public transport and all the major attractions of New York.  However the lobby bar hours need reviewing by management because it is not open for guests at reasonable times or sometimes not at all.;4
We live in Seattle. Celebrated our 18th anniversary at New York.  Ameritania was a great place to stay.  Excellent service and clean room.  I want to thank Elizabeth R for keeping our room tidy and spotless.   Julian you were a great host and thanks for your help as well.  I would highly recommend this hotel for special occasions.  We were surrounded by great restaurants and bars.  Times Square is just 10mins walk.  Overall we enjoyed our stay here.   Cheers! Venki;5
wi-fi available only in lobby.  Great location: times square, Broadway is very close ( Got free upgrade. Thank you, Vlad! Appreciate that. This hotel offers good service for a fair price. I'd recommend this and will hope to visit it again;5
Love the location and love the service. Friendly staff. They also help us booking transportation for our group.  Clean rooms and very modern. Easy to access and just walking from time square  Breakfast area can improve but we are in NYC so it is ok!;4
Would like to say a huge thank you to everyone at Ameritania hotel for a perfect stay in NY! Before we even arrived to New York someone from the team member was already in contact to offer any help we might need whist we was in the big city and if we had any special requests! This was so lovely as it was my fiancés birthday surprise trip so when we finally arrived not only did we have a beautiful room with great views, there was also a bottle of wine with a happy birthday card from hotel staff was a really nice touch. The room that we stayed in was a corner room on the third floor with two huge Windows and views onto Broadway so was nice and bright. The room size was great actually id say this was a huge room compared to what you get in New York. The location is perfect 5 minute;5
This hotel is perfectly located for you to explore NY. Great hotel service too. I ordered a present from ebay which was safely stored at the hotel waiting for our arrival. This was charged at $5.  Internet is only free at the lobby but this was not a problem for us as we were out exploring most of the time.  Check out was great and Said took our luggage and stored at the hotel free of charge so you can enjoy  your last day in New York without having to carry your luggage around. This is free of charge for up to 24hrs.  Overall we were very happy with our stay and would recommend this hotel.;5
The Ameritania is an excellent located venue. Its interior designes are fun. The service you receive is very kind and helpfull. The rooms are extremely confortable and the beds and bath provide just the right rest you need after a long cultural day in the big apple. THX ELENA in the front desk, you are a smiling and very willing person¡¡¡ JEFF, thank you for your service. To all the staff a big thank you ¡;5
I stayed here for myself and my partners 8 year anniversary I had booked through travel agents and told them that it was our anniversary and if they could do something nice in the room or at least have a nice room. We arrived to the hotel and was greeted by a lovely door man called Jeff who couldn't of been more helpful Unfortunately our room wasn't ready until 3pm and a certain staff member at reception called Elina was very rude and unhelpful!! Once we got to our room it was like a small box with a bed in it only fit enough for 1 person which I was not impressed with as I asked for a nicer room or expected a bottle of champagne for the room or even a glass. I contacted reception and got the room changed which was much better and what we expected. I then got speaking to a;2
Honestly wouldn't be a 3 only for some staff! Not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady! Door man Jeff was so helpful and a great person! Bar staff Gina and javier made our holiday to New York a pleasure. Hotel rooms are nice but as for anything to do in the hotel, Rubbish! You cannot even relax after a fun day in the city, your basically room bound.. Not really much of a seating area! There is no restaurant within the hotel. All you get is what you see in the picture! Crap. If you need any help what so ever javier is the man to see! Such a lovely man and actually will be missed by all of my company I was with!;3
This is a  great location,  and a great price.  We were welcomed by a  friendly and accommodating staff. All our needs were met.  Overall Very Satisfied.  Only  complaint was the outside noise at night was very well heard in the room.;5
Love this hotel, convenient location and beautiful rooms.  Modern but with character.  Terrific customer service, highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in this part of the city for business or personal.;5
I have nothing to fault. I had a lovely stay and will definitely be back. I guess the only thing I would point out, is that the storage space is very little and for two people we would have no where to put our cloths. Not much that can be done about this, but that was the only negative aspect as to the room that I would have. The complimentary coffee / tea in the lobby was a very nice touch.;5
Geoff or Jeff the doorman (not sure how he spells it) the concierge was a pleasure and so helpful. Always will help with any questions or any job you want. Elizabeth kept the room clean and tidy and was a pleasure also. Location was perfect. 3 streets from Central Park and only a few 2 minutes away from Times Square and all the subway lines.   The downside was the Bar was closed when we looked for it. I did hear The server say she was dead all night and would probably close up early so maybe this is what happened the previous nights. A little training might have been needed for her also. It's right beside a bar the three monkeys which is fab so not to bad. Would stay here again though as its a lovely hotel with helpful and friendly staff;4
The hotel is in Manhattan near to the most important Museums, Theaters and magazines and many subway. Full comfortable, good bar in the hall and free coffee in the morning. A small but complete gym in the underground. Roominess room fully equipped for a pleasant stay.  Excellent receptionists, collaborative and helpful. Possibility to receive parcels at the hotel desk. Mr. Jeff very helpful and kind organizing my transfer at JFK on time and a convenient price.;5
First off the hotel emailed me prior to my arrival to ask if we needed anything when we arrived which was awesome I found out from The awesome receptionist Ellen that we could bag check our luggage until check in at 3pm Since we arrived at 11am, since our room wasn't ready at that time she offered us a complimentary room to freshen up or relax until our room became available, very helpful front desk gave us directions then the bellman Jeff was extremely friendly and arranged transportation for our departure, the room was a good size for two people very clean and the Bed was super comfy, can be a little noisy at night but to be expected on a street so close to time square, hotel was in a prime Location many things in walking distance or a  Short cab ride. Will be coming back to;5
My fiance and I stayed at this well located hotel in NYC and were very impressed with the service both at reception and also at the bar. All the staff at the bar were very friendly and we enjoyed speaking with them during our stay. Our room was nice but not very spacious and the shower room was nice too.  The location was fantastic - just a short walk to Times Square. Would recommend.;4
We were one staying 2 nights and the hotel was great for that length of stay. But, it would have been fine to stay longer! The staff was really nice, the hotel bar was quaint, the location is in Times Square but not right in the middle which I prefer. A lot of people complained about the WiFi but that didn't affect us, really. I would definitely stay again.;5
This is the best place to stay while visiting NYC!  Location is perfect! The staff are friendly and accommodating ... the door man 'Said' went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed including arranging our airport transportation, and being there the day we left to ensure everything went smoothly.  The rooms are beautiful and the beds are comfortable! I will always stay here when I travel to NYC!;5
I arrived at the hotel around 12am and the reception person's behavior was not so good. My room was quite and clean overall. But it was a pity that previous user's soap was dropped in the bathroom and the electricity plugs was broken. When I checked out, the reception person and doorman's attitude was good. Totally, I would like to stay this hotel for the next time.;4
"The Ameritania is super convenient (minutes walk to Times Square and Broadway). Modern hotel, friendly staff, decent bar (try the house""Ameritania""), and quiet, quaint rooms with wi-fi. The prices for my company are pretty solid so all in all I'd say this is a top notch boutique hotel if you are in New York for a working business trip. If you are a tourist... its a an ideal location for checking out the City as well.  4.5 stars.";5
A friend from Italy found this hotel for us. The location was really convenient to the theaters, 5th Avenue shopping, MOMA and restaurants. It was easy to get to Central Park and a good head start on reaching the MET and the Frick museums. Especially helpful for some cost savings....there was a Subway shop nearby with soup for just $2.50! Also had Duncan Donuts and Starbucks on the block.;4
My New York trip was a work related trip which I chose to do because I couldn't bare the thought of hating New York. The Ameritania Hotel helped me re-evaluate the city of New York thanks to its location and its helpful staff!;4
Ｈｏｕｓｅｋｅｅｐｅｒ　Ｅｌｉｚａｂｅｔｈ　ｗａｓ　ｖｅｒｙ　ｎｉｃｅ　ａｎｄ　ｋｅｐｔ　ｔｈｅ　ｒｏｏｍ　comfortable　and clean so we were able to enjoy are stay. location was very easy to access to all the subway and had all the shopping area in walking distance so that also made us enjoy our trip.;5
Best location and very cleaned. Housekeeper Susan made the room very cleaned and always had enough amenities. Bed was also very comfortable. First time in New York and the map which was hand over was very useful too. All good and enjoyed my stay.;5
Great Hotel, every single staff very helpful, especially front desk manager Matthew Would definitely recommend  Hotel was very clean, nice and tidy.  All was as requested and wifi is was also very good  Cheers;5
Great hotel and location. It's a few blocks north of Times Square, but that's good. TS is a bit full on!   The only issue was the noise from the street. Ear plugs were provided (although mine kept coming out!) Other than this, the hotel was great and would recommend it.;4
I stayed last weekend and it was amazing, at the entrance the bellman welcome me, staff at the front desk were nice and they helped me with all my questions that I had, when I arrived to my room there was a bottle of champage, chocolate and a note from Emily Nichols, she was wonderful during my stay, she took care about me and my friends, everything that I needed she was always there to help me,the hotel has a good location, you can walk to Times Square and also its near by the Metro, the hotel bar it is really nice and the drinks are better. Definitely I will stay again at this hotel, nice and clean room, great location and wonderful staff.;5
My husband and I booked this hotel for my birthday being 21st Jan. Hotel is great for location centre to all your usual tourist areas.. Times Square, Central Park, rockerfeller centre. Rooms are great, beds are fab after you've been walking all day. We received a complementary upgrade of our room. Jeff the doorman is fab anything you need or want he'll point you in the right direction. Fab stay and if anyone needs a hotel to stay I'll b recommending this hotel.;5
We read the reviews and stayed here for 5 nights paying £400 GBP for the privilege which was cheaper than hotels with a worse rating on TA.  For this, breakfast wasnt included and there's only wifi in the lobby (costs extra in the room) but we didn't care for the price.  We visited for a 30th birthday and were greeted with free wine and chocolates which was a nice touch. The bed was SOOOOO comfortable and a decent size. Bathroom had a rainshower and there was a fridge.  Concierge was a gent called Jeff who has been mentioned in previous reviews and he really was fantastic. I don't think we tipped him very well, but he was fantastic with us for the whole 5 nights and can sort anything you need.  The location is perfect. 5 mins to the park, 5 mins to time square and only another 5;5
I just placed a call to reserve a room for our annual St. Patrick's day trip. I was connected to a gentleman named Matt.  Turns out Matt is the night manager.  He was so kind and generous. I have been staying at this hotel for 5 years and the service has not changed at all. Our room was always clean and the doormen were funny and very helpful.;5
This hotel was great. It is located so close to everything. We had a great room on the 10th floor and although the room does not offer complimentary wifi, the room is just great: so comfy beds. And as this was a planned city trip, you were to exhausted in the evening to even think about free wifi. There is free wifi in the lobby. The staff was really nice and helpful. We will definitely come back to NYC and this will be the hotel we would book again, definitely. Thanks for having us:);4
We had our first trip to New York city last November and it is somewhere we will be going back to. When we do we will be staying here again. The room was not the biggest but clean and for the few days we were there just the job. It was the staff that made the stay great. Nothing is too much trouble. The location of the hotel is just right. Close enough to time square and central park. Just great value all around.;5
We've just got back from a 5 night stay at The Ameritania. I can't fault the hotel and they looked after us really well.  It was booked to coincide with my birthday and was also a return visit for my wife. We were given a complimentary room upgrade and also a free bottle of wine in the room on my birthday.  Check in was easy and all the staff were very polite.  The room was more than adequate for a trip to NYC. Ample bathroom and storage space. The bed was also very comfy.  Wifi was available for free in the lobby but is chargeable in the room at a cost of $10 per night. My advice would be use the WiFi in the lobby and then whilst you are out and about as most places have free WiFi.   The hotel offers a basic buffet style breakfast with limited but satisfactory food selections.;4
Location at top of Times Square, near central park is fantastic. Super close to the subway too. Rooms were clean and my room was reasonable size. Bartender in small bar downstairs was great.  Aircon/heating quite noisy but not unbearable.  Wifi charge was a little annoying and the phone signal in the room was very up and down. $5 charge for small bottle of water beside the bed was a little cheeky.;4
Perfect location in Hell's Kitchen. I always stay in this part of midtown it's close enough to Times Square where I can just walk to watch my Broadway plays and close enough to Central Park where I lime walking around. Hotel slightly dated but still has a fun, vibrant lobby and bar. Small breakfast room... my room did not come with breakfast it was an additional $11 for breakfast but hey I'm in NYC I could walk to any corner and get a great cheap breakfast. Great staff! Check-in was at 3pm but since I got in on the redeye they were kind enough to check me in. Got a room with 2 double beds. Very spacious and comfortable. They later on moved me and my boyfriend to a room with a queen size bed on a higher floor but room was much smaller. Still nice and had all the comforts for;4
The Ameritania Hotel is in a great location. We enjoyed a drink at the bar before heading up to a comfortable room. The bed was comfortable, the big rain shower was great after a long day. We will most differently return when we travel back to NYC.;5
The hotel is very close to Times Square and also nearby to some great restaurants, with Central Park only a short walk away.  The staff were great and the hotel was clean and well presented.  You can hear the noise of passing traffic and numerous sirens during the night, however I would say this is the case in most central locations in New York!  The room was spacious, beds comfy and a very nice en-suite.  The hotel made for a great base for a weekend break and the hotel provided a driver to do airport runs (65USD to JFK) which made our trip back very easy.;5
We could never get either the TV or the heat/air conditioning to work, despite having staff up to instruct us on both, and the beds have stands with legs like exposed square pipes that each of us accidentally kicked with our bare feet during the night. Ouch!;3
Nice hotel in Times Square close to Broadway shows.  There are no coffee makers in the room but it's avaiaboe in the lobby every morning.  The staff was excellent!  Very prompt whenever we needed anything.;4
Close to everything, didn't  have to travel far for Time Square on New Years Eve. Corner of Broadway and 54th Street, only a five minute walk to Subway.   Plenty of food choices close by, best part was Starbucks just 5 meters across the street so my mornings started off well.;4
The Ameritania staff was very welcoming among before arrival and during check in. I was celebrating my 40th birthday with a friend and they provided champagne in our room to help start my celebrations. They were also readily available to answer any questions or concerns during out stay. We were even given a great recommendation for a dinner at a local restaurant (ElCentro)!  Rooms were small, but well appointed. If you are a light sleeper I would suggest requesting an inside room. We had a 10th floor room with street view and had to use the hotel provided ear buds (which was a nice accommodation) in order to sleep.  I had two complaints regarding the room... 1 The housekeepers could use better vacuums. There was blond hair all over the carper when we arrived. The housekeeper;3
"My husband & I rarely stay in hotels, but when visiting NYC, we have twice been  blessed with good luck and great accomodations at the Ameritania Hotel. It's located in the heart of the theatre district, close to numerous eateries, cultural hotspots and a lot more! Their facilities are beauitiful,  relaxing, comfortable and the service is terrific. Bellman, JEFF, was very personable, as were all of the staff. We got a great rate since we stayed 4 nights. It is a cozy, romantic place which we now consider our ""home away from home"", when munching on the ""Big Apple""!";5
We stayed on 10th floor and it was very quiet. Staffs (especially doormen) were very friendly and helpful. Public areas were clean. The location is perfect as you are near to NQRW, 1, E lines.  However sometimes the room was not made and the clock in my room didn't work.;4
We went to New York to celebrate my husband's 50 th birthday and stay at the Ameritania Hotel for 3 nights.  The room was lovely. All the facilities were excellent. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  The hotels location was ideal to explore all the main attractions in New York.;5
This is a good, basic hotel with a great location. I'd normally rate this as a great budget find, but unfortunately I can't give it a good review because of the customer service. The door to my hotel room was left visibly open for about 12 hours after it was cleaned until I returned. Not very comforting to happen in any big city...The room was in front of the elevators, so it was easy to see the door was ajar and open. Anyone could have walked in. When I mentioned this to the manager, she politely acknowledged that it shouldn't have happened, but didn't go out of her way to take my concern seriously, compensate for it, or give me any reason feel inclined to be a return client...all that was offered was a breakfast voucher for an underwhelming cereal spread. There are lots of;3
Traveled to the city to watch my children perform at Carnegie Hall.  It was a wonderful weekend and this was a great place to stay.  Beds were comfortable and rooms were clean.  Perfect location between Times Square and Central Park.;5
Excellent location close to everything!! The staff was friendly and courteous.  Would definitely stay there again. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The shower was real nice and up to date.;5
Visiting New York ia Always an experience, by doeing this in the Ameriatania you know that you can walk everywhere and see manhatten is the best possible way. Central Park, Times square, The Moma, etc, are all in 5 minutes walking;5
No wifi. Unless you pay. Disinterested front desk staff. One elevator broken all weekend. The baby bar in the lobby was never staffed when I was there. Location was convenient and bell staff was helpful.  Nothing terrible but certainly nothing great.;3
Can't beat the location for an NYC trip! Received an upgrade when we arrived early and came back at the usual check-in time. Jeff the doorman is very accommodating as is the rest of the staff. The room is cleaner than most hotels we stay in anywhere. HIGHLY recommended!!;5
Location of the hotel is good. Few blocks away from time square and central park. Room was small (okay for the price) and dusty. You can hear the noise from the corridor and the street. The 3 elevators were slow.;2
We always enjoy our stay at The Ameritania.  This was our 10th year.  Great location to Theaters , Food in Hell's Kitchen and transportation. The Staff is always friendly,helpful and remember us. We will be back next year.;5
Perfect location right near times square, the bellboy Jeff was very helpful giving me tips on how to use the subway, places to eat and even sorted out our return transfer which I must state was prompt on time top guy unlike the others who cant even crack a smile, apart from the bar only opening at 5pm this is a great hotel right next door to the 3 monkeys Irish bar which I found one of the best we visited in new York, bit pricey though like the rest of the city;4
Comfortable, beautiful and a design hotel. The bed was extra comfy, room very clean and the shower was just amazing! Staff was very helpful, and the location is an A+. Close to the subway, Broadway, a walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and many more highlights of NYC.;5
My fiancé and I decided to spend New Years in NYC. We looked at a few hotels that were in Times Square and the Ameritania Hotel had good reviews with fair pricing. Upon arrival the people at the front desk greeted us very nicely and had our room ready right away. The room was a little small but couldn't have asked for anything better for the price we paid, especially on New Years weekend. We even asked to be transferred to a room with a bigger bed and they helped us out as best they could with no hesitation. We would definitely stay here again if we were to come back and visit!;4
In a great location near Times Square. Upon arrival at 11, they checked me in to my room with no early check-in request. Also upgraded my room with no request or charge added. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Always a clean room. Would recommend this hotel to friends/family. Greater than expected!;5
It was a nice and comfortable hotel, a clean room and good service. Also, the location of the hotel is just perfect - close to times square and the subway that can take you anywhere you wish to go. We enjoyed our stay and can definitely see ourselves coming back here again. We can highly recommend it to others going to NYC.;5
I chose this hotel for new years because it was close to the ball drop. well, i still didnt get to see it up close because they block it anyways and you need to be there early to be able to get a good view. The hotel it self is located in a perfect place, close to central park, rockefeller plaza, broadway, time square, and all the major attractions. All within walking distance. the customer service is the best I have experience in a while. I left my souveniers in the hotel's transfer to the airport and didnt realize it until I got home. I contacted them about it and they were very helpful and were able to ship my souveniers back home. they were very delligently and responded to emails with in minutes. totally recommend this hotel! the rooms are small but so are all the ones in;5
Hotel with a wonderful location, on one corner of the Broadway Street and very close to the Central Park. Everything is very new, employees are awesome and very receptive (Jeff is a great guy). The room was big, cause we received a upgrade to double queen bed room. I recommend this hotel and in a later trip we will be glad to stay there again!;5
"We've just left The Ameritania after spending 4 great nights there. On arrival, we were given a free room upgrade and nothing was ever too much for the staff. On one occasion, whilst waiting to borrow a telephone from the receptionist, ""Jeff"" a lobby employee, lent me his personal mobile to make my call. Service like that is second to none and should be commended. If we ever visit NYC again, we would definitely stay here.";5
Ameritania is well located for a range of NYC attractions.  We got a very good rate via Booking.com, so it was a good value.  We were given a room on the top floor, so it was relatively quiet for NYC.  Staff was friendly and helpful.;5
I love this hotel. Great location and prices! Emily, Michelle and Jeff all outstanding people that made my stay SO much better!. i highly recommend this property! Beds are comfy and the rooms are very nice and bigger than most hotels I have stayed at in NYC;5
Clean, small room but nice. Heat in room was sporadic. Way too many items in the room available for purchase.  To the point that there was very little desk space and absolutely no refrigerator space. Friendly staff. Great location.;4
Fantastic experience with the AMERITANIA Iwill definetly go back the service was excellent it was a great stay and a memorable one thanks to the staff of the hotel and look forward to go back the location is the best;5
Stayed here for 5 nights in June and it was really nice, clean, great location and great staff. The guys on the door are very helpful. First time in New York so loved the location of the hotel. Looking at coming back to New York in late dec or early January 2018 and pitty this hotel is already booked out as its amazing.;5
Very Nice rooms, the Shuttle Service shout be inclusive! Very good Position in New York City. Is very loud in the room at Night. The men in at The door Speek more than they hold open The door. All in all it was an very Nice Hotel an very Nice trip;4
I stayed in the Ameritania hotel with my two daughters for a week sharing a room with two double beds.  The room was a good size with a nice bathroom and comfy beds. We were on the 11th floor so street noise was minimal and the view from our room was interesting. Great location for getting to Times Square and Central Park. The  staff were friendly and helpful special thanks to Jeff on the door who was great.;4
Excellent location, easy access to Times Square.  We were on 4th floor so had some noise from street.  Staff was helpful and polite.  We experienced long delay in getting our room, then had some confusion about which rook we should have.  Rooms are small, even for NYC, but adequate and clean.  Bathrooms were very modern, but limited space.  Nice lobby, cold when we were there and not sure why HUGE fireplace was not on.;4
Upon arrival we were greeted professionally by the door staff who got our bags for us, although the hotel didnt have available the room we'd booked, because of this, they offered us complimentary breakfast everyday and free Wifi. The room was tidied every day and the bed was very comfy. Also big thanks to Jeff the door man, who was very helpful when we were checking out!;5
Great location. Close to Times Square. Staff definitely went the extra mile. Special mention has to go to Jeff the Doorman for his knowledge and advice on attractions close to the hotel. No request was too small.;4
Disappointed after all the good reviews on Trip Advisor.  Found staff at reception very unfriendly.  There is no double glazing at all which means you hear anything and everything at street level and we were 4 floors up!  Requested a room change and we got a quiet(ish) room facing onto a brick wall with the company of pigeons in the morning - no discount for the company! Make sure before booking you know about city tax, hotel tax and room tax .... it adds more than a few £'s onto the overall bill. Also on arrival, make sure the items placed in your room (ear phones, chargers etc) are unopened - we noticed both boxes had been opened when we arrived.  Any broken seals means you pay for the items.  All of which are cheaper at the department store one block away.  Beds were very;3
We stayed here for a pre Christmas shopping weekend in December. Our room was very small, so much so that we kept tripping over the bed legs when trying to manoeuvre around the beds. The mini bar in the room was extortionate with a small bottle of water costing $7 !! We had no view from 9th floor room .... just a view of a brick wall.  However, the location was so convenient for mid town New York and we could walk to most places we wanted to see from our hotel. The bell men were helpful and friendly .... location great .... hotel basic;3
Great location to Times Square and Central Park , great hotel very clean with great staff , hop on hop off buses are well recommended , subway is really easy to use and gets you about quick to where you wish to go .;5
The location is excellent. The hotel is located between Times Square and Central Park. All the staff are very friendly and helpful, and are available at all times. The room is not very big, but it is equally comfortable. I recommend it!;5
Such a wonderful stay once again. Went for New Years with my husband and another couple. Room was perfect for the 4 of us. Hotel is very nice and clean. Staff is wonderful! It's located only a block away from time square so you're close to all the restaurants, fast food, bars, gift shops, Starbucks is right across the street and Dunkin' Donuts is a block over for you coffee lovers. Considering we were on the 11th floor it wasn't noisy at all. Beds are comfortable and the flat screen tv is nice. There's a bar down stairs in the lobby. Breakfast was great! I wouldn't choose any other hotel!;5
The staff was very friendly, the room was spotless upon entering! Every need was tended too quickly and professionally! The hotel is located in a very good spot right next to broadway everything is in walking distance! Overall a very great stay! Would recommend over and over again for people traveling to New York!;5
Can't wait to come back here again, amazing hotel, amazing location and amazing staff. Jeff on the door is a credit to the hotel and will do anything for you, as well as Julian. Javier and Gina behind the bar were incredible to us and made our evenings very enjoyable. Couldn't recommend the hotel enough. Thank you!;5
Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in the first week of December.  Excellent accommodation very clean and friendly helpful staff.  The location of the hotel is tremendous! A short walk from Times Square & Central Park. Would stay again. Car service to return to the airport provided by the hotel was excellent and very reasonably priced  Highly recommend staying here;5
As soon as I book the room I have gotten one email from the Hotel asking about the arrival time. I knew that the check in was only at 3PM but the hotel could get me a room way before that (around 1PM). At the same time I have also received one email from Sarah, the Concierge, asking if I would need any tickets for any events (Broadway, etc). Although I could not get the tickets (sold out event) I went to the same place to see a late night jazz event. It was a unique experience. The location is perfect, in the middle of Central Park and Times Square. Not so crowded area with good restaurants. Elena, at the reception was super friendly and helpful.  The gym has two treadmills, an elliptical, a indoor cycle.;5
We stayed with friends at the Ameritania the weekend before Christmas.  The hotel was clean and the room quite large for NYC.  My only complaint is that the building is very old and, while it has been renovated, it seems there are some structural issues (floor sinking 5 inches from baseboard in some areas) which caused a slight bit of uneasiness.  Nonetheless, we thought the room was very clean, the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job and the hotel was conveniently located.  We would stay here again.;5
What a great stay, stayed between Christmas and new year. Hotel was lovely and we were thourougly looked after. Rooms are just what you need for New York, not massive but perfect for a couple. Complimentary tea coffee was nice also but would have been nice to have breakfast included.;5
My friend and our two daughters took a quick last minute trip for New Years and were very pleased with this hotel.  There were 4 of us in a double room and had plenty of space.  After reading the reviews we were expecting a teeny tiny room, but had no issues at all.  Yes, we did bump into the (padded) bed frame but it was not a major nuisance.    The bathroom was on the small side but if you need more mirror space for hair/make up there is an oversized full length dressing mirror in the room.  We didn't watch tv, but it was a nice flatscreen and seemed to have basic cable.  We arrived early and were able to check in at 1pm.  The parking garage is across the street with friendly attendants.  Don't forget to validate your parking, the $40 is a bargain.    Plenty of food options,;5
This was our first time in New York and we have been amazed at how helpful everyone at this hotel has been. Jeff the bell man has been exceptional he will go above and beyond to try and make the experience the best. Jauvier behind the bar was brilliant aswell he also made the holiday for us. Jeff and juavier are a credit to the hotel so we would definitely stop again thanks again for everything.  Em and Sam.;5
Excellent overall experience at Ameritania's , special commendation goes to reception personal ,would like to thank  Mr Majel and Ali for the   excellent customer service , as well as bell man and dining area ,  love the location and the atmosphere of the hotel , I would return to the facility my next visit to new York city and also  recommend the hotel to a friend;5
We really enjoyed staying at the Ameritania. Perfect location.  Friendly staff from front desk to bellman to staff in breakfast area.  Jeffrey, the bell man, was very helpful.  He arranged for a car for our family upon departure.  Desk staff went above and beyond...called us when our room was ready (we arrived at 8:00am).  Just a considerate & friendly staff!  Beds were comfortable.  Room very clean.  Bathroom up to date.  Cool lobby! Very nice!;5
My fiancé and I both loved this place. The location was perfect, just 2 blocks from Times Square, and still quiet enough to sleep. I had an amazing experience at this hotel, and can't say enough how pleased I was. Would recommend to anyone 100%.;5
I stayed here four years ago and feel the Hotel has gone downhill. The air conditioning unit did not work and the bathroom door was hanging off the hinges. However the staff are very friendly and helpful. It is in a good location.;3
Pros: The location is great, the room was tiny but clean and the staff was helpful. In addition, there was complimentary coffee every morning and cold water during the day.  Cons: The toiletries, except soap, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, were never refilled. The air conditioner in our room was very noisy. The safe is located on the floor in the closet and it's very unuseful since you need to get on the knees in order to use and access it. In addition, you cannot place your luggage in the closet because of that and there was no suitcase stand or other surfaces to place it rather than on the floor. The hotel charges $5 for every letter/parcel that you receive on your name. It appears to be a new policy and isn't mentioned on Booking.com (the info appears on hotel's website;4
Super friendly staff - Emily and Sarah provided us with exceptional service. The hotel is centrally located in Midtown close to many attractions and transportation to others if the need arises. The property was recently renovated and is well maintained and appointed. We will definitely revisit the Ameritania when we return to NYC.;5
Very well situated ... a very good staff ... we really enjoyed our stay at the ameritania hôtel. Thank you very much for the help and the kindness provided. Special thanks to the French speaking members of the staff.;4
We stayed at this hotel as the first part of our honeymoon. It is in a great location just off Times Square, the staff were great but as with all hotels in New York, the noise from outside did keep us awake.;4
Good hotel in the crossing of 54th street and Broadway, one of the best places if you are interested in theatre, live music or other cultural activities. A lot of restaurants, cafes and subway stations around. At night it's a little bit noisy if you are staying at the lower floors. We chose a big room and it was worth the higher price to have that space in the center of the city. We barely didn't had any relation with the front desk team, just check-in and check-out, but Elena was pretty helpful on those occasions.;4
It is a good hotel close to everything, the attention was very nice, especially from Julian, the only detail, was an annoying noise in the wall of the bathroom which was annoying to sleep.  Everything else was very good.;4
Stayed at the ameritania for a week back in September for our honeymoon. This is hands down one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in! I think most other reviews have covered most points so won't just repeat everything-everything is excellent from location to comfy beds! We had the holiday of a lifetime in the big Apple and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this brilliant hotel. Thanks ameritania!;5
Stayed here for 3 nights, was great location near Times Square/Broadway. Hotel lobby was welcoming and had a quick check in. Room was lovely, very modern with huge walk in shower/no bath. Large flat screen TV, minibar,safe and even an umbrella you can borrow hanging in the wardrobe, nice touch.  The staff  were very helpful and dealt quickly with an issue I had (not with the hotel) and made phone calls to assist with my transfer. Very efficient. Thank you for a great stay, would recommend.;4
Just a little history, this was known as The Hotel Bryant. The Rockettes used to live there as well as having other famous guests who stayed. Dean Martin, Billie Holiday, Tony, Bennett, etc.   The Good (which far outweigh the not so good): Beds were comfy, room was clean, shower was great, staff was excellent, especially the front desk staff. Viktor K. was so kind and helpful as was everyone else including the doormen. I can't say enough about them to express how accommodating and helpful they were. The parking garage was just across Broadway and very convenient to the hotel. Only 1/2 block away. Discounted rates through the hotel are worth it so make sure to get the parking ticket stamped. Great location!!!   The Not so Good: (but overall fairly minor except for the AC) I;4
I'm Back!! Back in The New York Groove!!!! Had another great experience at the Ameritania Hotel in Times Square!! My last visit here in January was matched by yet again a delightful stay. The front desk staff was friendly and professional just liked I remember . Janet at the desk was very helpful in regards in helping me extend my stay. Emily, a manger I believe was amazingly friendly and welcoming!!!! The room was exceptionally  clean and fresh!!! Great price for a great location!!! Can't wait to be back in NYC and the Ameritania. Hopefully, it won't take as long!!;5
We stayed for the weekend with some friends to check out NYC. We had so much fun! The rooms were so clean and the workers were so nice. We had great advice from Emily & Jeff on where to go. So much fun and loved the lounge. We will be back!;5
We had a fabulous time on family holiday. The staff was so nice and answered all of our questions! Jeff at the front door and emily at the front desk were great! We had a very nice room with 2 beds that was very clean and comfy. We hope to return again one day.;5
We had such a great holiday trip in NYC staying at the Ameritania! The staff was very helpful! The lobby was cozy and the rooms were very clean. We had cocktails at the lounge which was very fun. The location is perfect, very walkable to everything. We will be back!;5
the employees were very informative and very helpful they were also willing to help you the prices in the room were very high for the items housing housekeeping should've done a rotten could've done a better job never left extra toilet paper sometimes the towels were the same and the  vacuum in the the room was horrible;5
Great location for shopping, theater, central park. Small but nice room overlooking broadway, very comfortable bed.  We called and Jeffrey (doorman) made arrangements for a private car to/from Laguardia that was perfect.  Thanks Jeff!!!  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful too.;5
Emails between reservation booking and check-in were a great touch and appreciated.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Wonderful on the complimentary wine for our anniversary, and room assignment (top floor corner room) .. all awesome!  Room and bathroom were clean and modern.  Everything was top-notch for the reasonable price!!  Will stay again in the future and recommend!;5
Hotel was ok, needs some tlc refurbishment. Advertises free wifi but only in the lobby not privacy of ones room. Doormen were great other staff were satisfactory, it was ok, wouldn't rush back to stay;3
Excellent hotel, good location. Very helpful and friendly staff. A very big thank you to Yassir, Majid & Kathy and all of the staff at Ameritania for making my stay at the hotel and NYC as pleasant as can be. I had requested a twin bedroom however was given a double bed instead..due to no fault of the hotel staff, however they dealt with my matter as quickly and efficiently as possible and I was given a double twin bedroom which was great. 😊;4
Fantastic stay, couldn't have picked a better location. All staff were helpful & friendly, room was spotless & always toastie (it was COLD outside!) Had a definite charachter that corporate chains lack, not pretentious in any way. If you look really closely, or are one of those moaning fusspots that loves to pull places apart on Tripadvisor for attention, there are little things you could moan about I suppose, but nothing that would warrant a complaint or would spoil a stay. Definitely recommended.;5
I stayed 2 nights for business and the staff was so friendly. Emily and Javier and the entire staff were very welcoming. My room was very clean and the shower was great! I will be back on my next trip to nyc!;5
Booked this place last minute because my other option fell through. Came here from a small town in North Carolina to propose to my girlfriend. And before I even did it, received superb service from all employees. But if you are coming in and you want someone in particular to treat you like family, ask for Majid Chakir. He really knew how to give us that homey feel. Cannot thank you enough Majid and the entire Ameritania family!;5
We Stayed 4 nites this hotel.. Location great, less than 10 minutes walk to heart of NYC Fabulous Time Square... Staff was great, door man n front desk were friendly. Room  a bit small, watch out for bed foot not really good, my kids getting hurt of it, iron corner.;4
We stayed for business for 10 days in this hotel, the location is great and the rooms cozy and clean, but the real jewel of this hotel is its staff! I have been in new York a few times and have traveled quite a lot this is the best and most friendly staff I have ever encountered!!  From Emily, the general manager, who was literally all day there solving every problem we had very fast. Javier and Gina at the  bar, who every night were very friendly and kept us laughing. Julian, Said, Jeff Hugo and Mouvad, the bellmen who were extremely friendly helpful and polite! Ofcourse all the people from the front desk during the day and Enrico at night shift who were not only very helpful in every turn but also very friendly. Even the cleaning ladies!!  In 10 days we learned the names and;5
Clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff, decent Wi-Fi, close to some great restaurants and bars (including one in the lobby), a few blocks from Central Park to the north and a few blocks from Time Square and the main subways to the south. Great overall!;5
Great hotel in a great location!  The staff was wonderful and the room was comfortable and clean. The price was very reasonable for the location. The hotel was walking distance to many of the great tourist spots.  I highly recommend the hotel!;5
What a fabulous time! From the moment we checked in until our check out days later. The staff was incredibly professional and helpful. Suggested fabulous restaurants, activities, and things to avoid due to traffic. The room was clean and beautiful. Centrally located to Times Square and the Theater District. Loved it and highly recommend it!;5
This hotel was absolutely fantastic. Upon arrival we had an upgrade on our room - which was spacious with 2 double beds and a great view of broadway! The service was second to none - nothing was to much trouble for any of the staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we would definitely return 😊;5
Great location, clean modern rooms and pleasant staff. Highly recommended.  Nice lobby. Not a huge hotel, which is advantageous. Easy to navigate. Restaurants are close by. Great front desk.  Close to times Square and central park.  Cool vibe.;5
Came for a wedding. Nicely updated hotel with clean comfortable rooms and a very convenient location. Incredibly quiet, great shower, I do wish the room was a little larger, but it'seems NYC, so you expect small;5
Booked for a second time as the hotel is close to main Broadway theatres and easy access to subway. Ideally situated for tourists. Staff helpful and courteous. Breakfast expensive considering no cooked items other than eggs.;4
I stayed at the Ameritania during a weeklong stay in November 2016.   The booking process was incredibly simple as I booked online through the hotel website and payed for everything in advance – there were also no nasty surprises at the checkout in terms of costs.  Having never been to New York, I put in a request to have a room in one of the higher floors so that I can see some of the city. This request was honoured and the view I had was amazing!  On my first night I there was an issue with the air-conditioning unit but having spoken with the very helpful reception staff, they did send someone up to fix it immediately. Overall, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with all questions that I had.  In terms of the location and value for money this hotel was outstanding.;4
Nice place, very clean and really close to Times Square and Central Park.  Service was great and they even texted me while I was in the city to see if they could help me with anything.  I would definitely stay there again.;5
From the moment we arrived we felt very welcomed. My friend and I were visiting to celebrate both our birthdays and upon entering the room saw a complimentary bottle of Champagne on ice! All the door staff were very helpful especially Said, Julian and Jeff! Always had good advice and useful info. The rooms were a good size, considering all you really need them for are for sleeping, clean and comfy. One of the only negatives would be a kettle in the room and WiFi other than in the lobby as quite expensive and very bad connecting considering how much it cost! Also as we were late in we didn't have the champagne first night, so when phoning front desk for more ice it never arrived!  Apart from that it's a great location and very friendly hotel to be.;5
I booked a last-minute stay here for a night and was very pleasantly surprised with the location, service and room.  This hotel has a lot of character, especially the downstairs bar, which is cozy and has a great cocktail menu.;5
I Loved this hotel, highly recommend it, Excellent location ,Close to all the places that I need to go and Wonderful Service. People very Friendly, Rooms very clean and Front Desk very Helpful .I am already planning my next visit and I will use this Hotel.;5
I love how they have an attendant for the front door 24 hours a day. Nice hotel, my only comment is to get rid of all the snacks in the room, I wouldn't trust how long the snacks have been sitting there and I would wish it was an empty refrigerator that was provided, instead of all the beer,wine and soda. Not all guests eat or drink unhealthy foods. A microwave would've been a plus too! Would come back, location is great!  Thank you Ameritana!;4
Great place to stay. Close to Times Square, Central Park, subway entrances. Easy access to any area you wanted to go. Room was clean and restocked every day. Staff helpful with food recommendations. Will definitely be staying again!;5
This hotel is in the most convenient location!!  Loved everything about my stay here. Always received quick and useful information about the subway, shopping and Broadway shows.  Jeff, the door captain, was so helpful in reserving a car for me at 4:00am to get me to the airport.  I will definitely stay here on my next trip to NYC!!!;5
The Facility was very nice. The staff was excellent especially the doormen. The room was very clean. The location was perfect. The only problem. Our room was facing the street and the noise was almost unbearable. If we stay her again we will request an inside or backside room.;4
"We were on a short trip to NYC and this hotel location was the best: next to Colbert's (we went to the show) very close to all NYC ""attractions"" as Central Park, Rockefeller Center, MoMA, Times Square and so on. The rooms were very comfortable, the staff was very kind (we asked for a late checkout and they extended our stay until 2pm (checkout is at noon.) We'll be coming back!";5
When I walked in, I was already in love with the hotel. The decor was sleek and modern and very much my style. The check in process was easy (I ended up in a room with double beds, but was checking in early so I did not care enough about trying to get a different room), and I liked the room a lot. Same style as the lobby and the bathroom was new and really nice. The bed was very comfy. However, the room was FREEZING. The thermostat was set on heat, but it would not go above 62 degrees and it seemed to be blowing cold air. I couldn't even turn it off when I tried. Probably related to this issue, there was not nearly enough hot water in the shower in the morning so I was taking a cold shower in a cold room when it was 20 degrees outside. In fairness, I did not reach out to try to;3
My room was always cold, the bathroom window was broken and the wind constantly went in, the air conditioning did not heat and despite having made the comment never solved, the two days I did not have hot water in the shower. I travel more than 4 days to get to your hotel and the only thing I asked for was a pleasant break but apparently ruined my vacation, canceled my last day of Reservation and changed my hotel. The only one great Is the location;1
Only location was perfect and rest was between poor and average , rooms are so narrow , no kettle or compimenetary water at rooms, no employee is wearing a name tag, doorman were perfect and helpful, I asked for key no size bed and I got two small beds;3
Just returned from a visit to celebrate my wife's 70th birthday. Fantastic location 10M off Broadway and a short walk to Times Square, excellent for access to the theatres. The hotel is very clean, decent sized bedrooms and bathrooms, and the staff very pleasant and helpful, special mention for Jeff the doorman.;5
Great location, very nice room, spacious, confortable bed, could have better lighting in the room. Great bell man service, always opening doors and asking if you need help, should have free internet in the room .;5
I have actually stayed here a few times and enjoyed it.  This time was not good! Impossible Wifi which is a real problem for work. No solution offered except to say they'll fix tomorrow. No business center so there is nowhere to work  The smallest most claustrophobic room of all time Lukewarm shower with freezing weather outside.  If you are on business this is not the place for you.   Great location for tourists though.;1
The hotel has an excellent location, close to many attractions and subway station. The personnel is amazing, they help you on everything you need. Special mention to the people on the front desk and the bell men on the door, I will definitely consider this hotel on a next stay in NYC.;4
Honestly I'm torn on this hotel. For the location the price was great. The hotel staff was all super friendly and accommodating, and our room was clean and nice. The view from the window was of dirty windows from the building next door but that's not their fault. However the elevator took 5-10 minutes to reach you from any level and when I tried to use the stairs they ended at the second level. That doesn't seem to safe. It seems like the entire building is falling apart with walls that are bowed out and one of the hall closets was open revealing a collapsed ceiling. Our room also had a outlet in the restroom that didn't work and when I went to unplug my curling iron the entire front of the outlet fell off! Our deadbolt also did not lock.  I honestly loved my stay but was left;3
Very nice older hotel building - modern bathroom typical size bedroom. The lobby bar offered 2 for 1 wine each evening. 3 :00  check in was OK with us. I saw other guests waiting for their rooms. I had to call for room service every day. This should never happen.;3
We stayed here for 5 nights and were really happy with the hotel. The room on the first night was far too small (1020) the bathroom was tiny and the bed took up almost all the space however on ringing reception they were really helpful and upgraded us to a bigger room for the rest of our stay. Clean rooms and v comfy beds. Jeff in the lobby was really helpful with getting taxis and looking after our bags while waiting for our transfer. 10 min walk from Times Square and close to lots of bars etc.  The only problem was no drink making facilities in the room. Tea and coffee available in the lobby in the mornings along with a limited breakfast for $12. With so many diners close by we never ate there. Good hotel can highly recommend;4
Excellent place to stay.  Loved the proximity to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the theaters.  Hotel had a retro feel to it. The room and bath were very clean and modern.  We absolutely loved the giant mirror in the room and the lighted mirror in the bathroom.  With three women getting themselves ready each day, the mirrors were a huge help.  Awesome shower too!  The bell man was awesome and helpful with storing our luggage.  This hotel totally served it's purpose for a girls getaway to NYC!!!;4
Had a great stay at The Ameritania hotel, great location just 2 min walk to times square and the same in the other direction to Central Park. Got 2/3 good wee bars next next door to the hotel which is handy. The room was great, nice and spacious and  comfy beds. The noise in the room isn't to bad either,had great sleeps whilst staying here.  All in all would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and a great stay, also would like to personally thank Jeff who is on the door. He handled our transfer very professionally and if we wanted to know anything about New York he was there to answer any of our queries.;5
Great hotel but don't stay on the second floor. They have resident that lives there and he plays his trumpet at all times of the night and day. 3:00am 4:00 am 5:00 am. He's good but I would rather sleep;2
First off, this hotel is in an amazing location. You're in the middle of everything and there is a subway station right around the corner.  Upon arrival, we were informed that we had been upgraded. The room was very clean and very spacious.  The staff were very friendly and always willing to help. We needed to print tickets for the ice hockey whilst visiting and the reception staff were happy to print them, free of charge. The bellhops were very friendly (especially Julian who always had time to have a chat with us). We were always greeted upon arrival, whether by bellhops or the cleaners that we passed in the corridor.  The only very small downside was the free wifi only being available in the lobby (however, I was able to connect to the LinkNYC wifi from the room). I would;5
Overall hotel was excellent ideally situated staff all very help especially Nouri and Jalal. The only downside was the noise of the air-conditioning coming on all hours of the night sleep very disrupted. Double glazing might also help with the the street noise.;5
Hotel is in a fantastic location, in between Times Sq & Central Park. Very clean & our room was a nice size! The shower was awesome! Emily from Recepción was very pleasant & efficient with a problem I had with wifi! I'll definitely be staying here again.;5
"If you are coming to NYC to visit the sites/go to a show on Broadway/shopping, this hotel is in the middle of it all! You can easily walk to many things on your ""list to do"". Our room was generous in size (not at all what I was thinking for NYC), comfortable and clean. Loved that the bathroom was modern and had nice amenity package (baht soap/shampoo/lotion, etc). Lobby & bar area was nice, open and inviting.";5
This hotel was in an excellent location for all our needs. Friendly and helpful staff. The rooms were not particularly large but that is expected within hotels in city - they were well furnished and very clean. Jeff, the doorman was extremely helpful and friendly.  A very enjoyable stay for all, would highly recommend.;5
The Ameritania is situated in an excellent location,  equidistant to Times Square and Central Park.  The rooms are a little on the small size, but as you spend most of the time visiting the the numerous sites around the city, perfectly adequate.  On booking in, the receptionist did say, if we were not happpy with our room, as it was on a lower floor and may be disturbed by traffic noise, they would find us a room on a higher floor, the following morning. We had no problem at all, although a couple of people in our party did request a move, which was acted upon. We will definitely return to New York and the Ameritania.;5
Staff is friendly and helpful.  Rooms are clean and cozy.  Just an absolute wonderful spot for a couples  stay.  I want to give a shout out to Mouhrad, very helpful and friendly.  Thanks for all the advice for a couple on our first trip to NYC!!  Would definitely stay here again!!;4
Stayed here as part of my 30th birthday with my husband on arrival my husband mentioned the celebration we were upgraded to a king room which was great spacious clean great views and big comfy bed. Its was in a great location 10 mins from central park and times square  the staff were all very nice and happy to help at anytime espcially elizabeth jeff and julian who on our departure arranged a limo to pick us up at last min as we struggled to get a taxi arriving at the airport in style was the best way to end an amazing stay.  The only 1 thing i would say could have made the hotel a little better would be free wifi so at the of the night we could have chilled out in our room rather than sit in the lobby all in all though a great stay we will defo be returning to this hotel in the;5
Great boutique hotel at reasonable rate. You should try it. I will go back. It is right in the center of everything which makes walking easy. The hotel staff is very pleasant an helpful. When I arrived there was a gift from the hotel manger waiting for me. Very nice!;5
Stayed last September and again last week till 5th December. Free wi-if in lobby and complimentary tea and coffee 6.30-10.00 a.m. Unfortunately no tea,coffee making facilities in rooms but there's a Starbucks across the road. We had good sized room with 2 double beds, good shower , safe and cupboard for hanging clothes. Rooms kept clean.We mainly saw JULIAN and SAID on door this visit and thank them so much for all their help and advice. They are so knowledgable and can help you with lots of questions. We had also had lots of assistance from JEFF last September. This was good time to visit for the lights and sales and weather  was good. Staff from Radio City were handing out leaflets for Christmas Show which gave half price for a fabulous show.;4
Location great. Hotel OK. Room good size and comfortable. Jeff the doorman was superb and helpful. Cleanliness in reception was poor. Expensive hotel for what it was. View from rooms terrible. Minibar and snack prices hilariously expensive;3
Location is great - just around the corner of Broadway and W. 54th St. - walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Trump Tower and all subway lines, but that's the least of the great things about this place.  It is very modern and very clean (entire facility, not just the rooms).    The entire staff acts as if their entire job is to make sure that YOU are happy and comfortable.  I've never experienced that before.  Very special kudos and thanks to Majid and Ali at the front desk.  They were so helpful, so funny and personable and so professional!  They deserve a shout out!  We stayed for 2 nights in a single queen room.  By New York City standards, the room size was pretty good.  It was immaculate and well-appointed.   Two complaints though:  1.  The heat was;5
Visited with 4 friends for a 50th birthday. Fabulous location and close to Times Square. Friendly welcome on arrival. Our room was at the back of the hotel, but we were located to the front immediately and a bottle of champagne left in the room for the birthday girl. We were room only so cannot comment on the breakfasts.  Lovely comfortable beds and rooms very clean. Julian and Jeff the concierges were helpful and nothing too much bother. Would definitely recommend this hotel for an enjoyable holiday.;4
Hotel in a very good and  central position. Very clean. If you choose the deluxe room, it is wider and more comfortable. The staff is very helpful for every need and always with a smile on the  face which helps a lot!!!!;5
Nice hotel. Good location and friendly staff. The wifi is terrible though. Free in lobby only and paid connection was so slow to even use! Also they said you could connect a second device but a code was not provided. Had to call and get one from the front desk and it never worked.;3
Listen let's be real for the price you pay here you are paying for location location location! I don't stay in the room but to sleep and shower...and saying that it was very clean and perfect...staff was very nice ...got there early but called us when when room was ready right when they said it would be . Let's be honest this is New York City...I have had studio apartments bigger than this but it works for me ...I just need to sleep and shower and I'm off to explore and the stafff was very friendly:);4
Fantastic stay in a great location. Would definitely book again. Super comfy beds and pillows. shower was fantastic, powerful and hot. Only glitch was that keys had to be reset most nights as they wouldn't work when we returned in the evening.;4
Stayed here for three nights in December, hotel is clean, rooms are clean and functional.   The staff are all very friendly especially Jeff on the door!   One thing to keep in mind is that the rooms do not have double glazed windows and as mine faced out onto Broadway the noise through the night was terrible and sleeping was a struggle however other than that it is a great hotel in a brilliant location for access to Times Square, Grand Central Station, Empire State Building and Lower Manhattan etc. I will certainly recommend staying here.;4
The hotel is very modern form the inside, it is very nice. The staff is super friendly. The rooms are small but very comfortable, The hotel´s location is very good it´s an eight minute walk to Time Square, close to restaurants and subway stations.;4
Loved the hotel, rooms and the staff were great and friendly, they couldn't do enough for you.  Would definitely stay again, but avoid the Bagels and crossants if you are staying for breakfast, they were stale.;5
Maurad is the best.  He will help you with anything that you need.  The rest of the the staff is also awesome.  The hotel is great and convenient to everything.  We stay here all the time and will return again soon for another stay.;5
"Perfect location if you want to be in ""the centre"" of Manhatten and close to 5th avenue-shopping and Times Square. Short distance to Central park and Close to Subway which leads you up to Harlem/Queens or Down to lower Manhatten";3
comfortable rooms, if a little small, excellent room facilities, shower etc. Very convenient to major tourist sites, shopping, theatres etc in Manhattan. Air-Con was a bit noisy. Friendly and helpful staff. Overall very happy with our stay here;4
Nice service and location, the rooms are very comfortable, our room was small but with all the services, the location is the best, in the best place, you can walk everywhere.. the gave us a champagne bottle 👍;5
It took three tries before the hotel gave me a room where the lock worked. The furniture was worn out, the lights difficult to turn on and the doorknobs/shower tap came off in my hands. I had to pay $10 per day for internet connection that still took a call to the help desk every time I connected and the connection was crap. The bar offered two for one drinks but then doubled the price of the drinks - so it wasn't two for one. I won't be staying again.;1
Having stayed here before, we re-visited the Ameritania but probably wouldn't a third time sadly! Location is excellent but this hotel is now very tired and not worthy of the 'Boutique Hotel' title it once was. Comfortable, clean bed  and a good shower - that apart the rest is showing its age and could do with an extreme make over. More of a hostel than a hotel. Service was reasonable and the staff pleasant.;3
from the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by friendly faces who helped us though out our stay ... gave us good advise for planning our days and nice restaurants to try.   Jeff at front of house was a great help and really made our stay and departure so much more relaxing and smooth.;5
It is located at very busy neighborhood, and so room was very noise during day and night. Staff was great, very friendly. Room was clean and tight. Small room but fair for low price. I would recommend to stay for a short period of time, but wouldn't stay longer than 4 nights.;3
Hotel is situated within easy reach of all popular places to visit. Staff especially Jeff are extremely pleasant and very helpful. Hotel is very comfortable and clean  but room is on small side. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.;5
We enjoyed our recent stay at the Ameritania.  It's a European style hotel with contemporary décor. The location at the NW corner of Times Square (8th and Broadway) is convenient to many theaters, stores and restaurants-- but much quieter than central Times Square.  The rooms were very clean.  Rawsir (?) was extremely helpful in securing a quiet room  for us. The concierge also kept in touch by text to answer any questions that popped up during our stay.;4
Whole experience was really good from first to last day. Bar staff very friendly and Ali on the front dest was very helpful. Champagne for our anniversary & my birthday was very nice surprise. Location was perfect and all staff very helpful;4
I found the Ameritania to be a very good value for a New York hotel, Location was excellent for the business I was involved with this trip. The hotel is within walking distance to many attractions and restaurants;5
What an amazing hotel! Couldn't do enough for you! Room always clean! Coffee and water complementary every morning, the receptionist were brilliant we wanted a Chinese one night and they googled the nearest one for us and rang them for us! The doormen were fantastic always a warm welcome especially Jeff! What a guy! Couldn't fault anything about this hotel well definitely be back! Thankyou!!;5
Fabulous stay,It was our honeymoon and the room was great. Good size,comfortable bed and a great shower when you get over the shock of it coming down above you. The staff where extremely friendly and very knowledgeable.;5
Goid location,   Helpful staff, near time square and central park. Nice area. Close to subway and public Transportation. Several restaurants in the same block. Might be a bit loudly at nights. Free-wifi only in the lobby.;4
This was a great experience! Great service, very nice and helpful staff! Our room was small, but very nicely decorated. The hotel is well located and walking distance to MOMA, Times Square, Broadway, … Highly recommend this hotel.;4
I recently returned from New York City for a short visit with my dad. I usually like to stay in midtown on the east side as it is convenient to where my dad lives, as well as close to public transit, most notably the subway, as i use it to get around town as well as to and from the airport. Anyway, this time of  year, hotels in New York are brutally expensive. I'm not talking about luxury, five star, but your normal, branded hotels (Hilton, Marriott, etc) were all trending well north of $300/night, and sometimes past $400. So I did some looking around. I kept checking Hotel Tonight (good app, I would recommend it) and the Ameritania pops up, at a reasonable rate. So I also checked their website, found the same rate and booked there, as it gave me a 24  hour cancellation it;4
Hotel was as described, staff lovely and helpful. No tea and coffee making facilities in rooms which is my only negative comment. The room we stayed in was noisy but everywhere in New York is noisy. We would return to this hotel.;5
It was a pleasure staying at the hotel, i defenetly recommend it , since manhattan is beautifully city to be around,  this hotel had all I needed  .. it is around of time square and the main things to do;5
This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Clean and spotless rooms and a courteous and helpful staff. Nice bar and very friendly and accommodating bartender. There was a nice buffet breakfast also. All of this and a great price. I'll definitely be back.;5
I would recommend this hotel to family an friends really enjoy my stay staff very helpful at all times happy an polite room we're cleaned every day fresh towels everyday and u didn't have to wait all day for rooms to b cleaned very nice hotel;5
Just returned from a 4 night stay in NY at the Ameritania Hotel - you couldn't pick a better location for a hotel - 5 mins from Times Square and 5 mins from Central Park. Hotel is quirky and modern and all staff were helpful, particularly Said, the doorman. Rooms were larger than expected for  NY although still not huge. The bathroom was excellent with large walk-in shower and a plentiful supply of fresh towels and soaps etc every day. Wardrobe was ok for 2 people on a 4 night stay but would be small if staying for longer. The only down side to the room was the radiator/air con unit which made the room too hot even when switched off at the wall (still emitted heat) - there was a control unit on the wall which I couldn't get to work. However, when I reported the room as too hot;5
Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights , rooms where big , staff were fantastic especially Emily and Jeff ! Nothing was a bother to them . Come out of the hotel and turn right and you are on broadway .. with a short walk (4 mins) you reach Times Square ! Loads of great bars and restaurants nearby .. great transportation links to anywhere ! All in all a great hotel .. you must try it :);5
I went here with my mam last week and stayed for 3 nights.  When we arrived we were booked into a double room but as they had a twin available, it was changed with no hassle.  Was a really spacious room considering i was warned of the small size of NY hotel rooms so was very pleasantly surprised.  The room was really clean and couldn't fault the hygiene.   The location is super close to everything, esp times square, which made getting around the city so convenient.  There is a lovely diner for breakfast around the corner (literally) with great food at a great price.  Again, so welcoming without being over the top 'fake' nice. The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Jeff on the door who helped us out with a lovely car to travel back to the airport with when leaving.;5
I found a bug (like a worm) walking in my bed and i need to recquest a new room, also the Second Floor Hall smell very bad and if you buy something in Amazon you need to pay at the hotel 5usd per box. The only good thing is the location;2
great location and staff all very friendly and willing to help. The evening porter went above and beyond - even ordered a taxi and a limo turned up! The rooms were clean and had everything you would expect. A little noisy on a night but you can't really complain when staying in the centre of NYC! Would have preferred tea and coffee making facilities in the room itself as opposed to the main reception but maybe this is the American way?!;5
This hotel met all our expectations. All staff were helpful but I would like to mention Gina(bartender) Julian(doorman) and Rob(front desk) these staff members very polite cheerful and extremely helpful made our holiday. Rooms were cleaned daily and very clean. Beds were very comfortsable I would recommend this Hotel to my friends and the location was perfect  Karen Manchestet;5
This hotel is a delight - I cannot say enough about the excellent service provided to us, specifically by Yassir at the front desk and by Jeff at the lobby entrance. Yassir was very knowledgeable and friendly about the subway questions we had as well as the inquiries we made to him about the NYC holiday markets at Union Square, Grand Central Station and Bryant Park.  He even remembered us upon our check out and inquired on our feedback for our holiday market experiences and to insure that our subway travel had gone smoothly.  This employee is truly a value added asset to the Ameritania! Upon our checkout, Jeff was most helpful with holding our luggage while we happily went off to enjoy the Rockettes and was efficient and timely in getting us a taxi to Penn Station upon our;5
My friend and I traveled to NYC over Thanksgiving. We found a great deal for the Ameritania. We stayed November 22-26. (Before we even arrived, we had asked the hotel to make reservations for us at restaurants during our stay. Which was a big help!)  Our checkin process was wonderful. Gina welcomed us and gave us all of the information we requested. She also was bartending one evening and we had such a nice chat with her! Our room was very clean and comfortable. The decor is very modern and funky. We loved the view from our room!! The beds were so comfortable. Even though it is on Broadway, the noise from the street wasn't too bad. The hotel's lounge area was great. Javier was bartending and was such a pleasure to talk to! He gave us a lot of great information about the city.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania from 20th November 2016 for 7 nights. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman and an equally frriendly reception staff who ensured a quick and smooth check in. We stayed in room 1203 which looked out over Broadway. The hotel is located at 350 West 54th Street on the corner of Broadway. It is very handy for Time Square (a 10 minute walk south down Broadway, Central Park (a 10 minute walk north up Broadway) and a 10-15 minute walk east to 5th Avenue. Our room was fairly quiet considering the business of the street below. The room was clean and spacious. the bathroom having a good shower and the usual complimentary toiletries. The bed was a queen size bed which was nice and comfortable with 4 pillows provided for 2 of us. The bedding was changed on;5
Love staying at the Ameritania, have stayed here a number of times and have always been treated very good.   Great location, fabulous rooms and friendly staff.  Close to briadway theatres, times Square and;5
"Me and my partner stayed here for 9nights over thanksgiving. The staff were all very helpful and friendly; especially Jeff the doorman.  Check in/out is simple. The rooms are a good size, clean and with a very comfy bed!  There is complimentary water in the lobby and tea and coffee in the morning, which is a great way to save a few dollar. It is excellently located, within 5mins of Times Square and Central Park. We would definitely stay here again!!";5
My Fiancé and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights just recently during thanksgiving and Black Friday.  The location is brilliant as it is in the heart of Times Square.  When we arrived we were informed we had an upgrade to a bigger room which was nice however, upon arrival the room was small and the view....there was no view. It was of a courtyard with no natural light. I decided to ask Reception for another room with no sunlight. I was offered another room which was a standard room to then arrive, and the room was even smaller! The windows of the room had 2 massive cracks with tape on them and the room was not in the best of conditions. I asked again and due to the time of year there was no other availability so I stuck with room I was given.  The rooms are far too small;3
Stayed here from 12 to 23 November 2016. From arriving to checking out the staff were polite, professional and helpfull. Asked for a room with a view as this holiday was for my wifes 50th birthday. We arrived early and room was not quite ready so they looked after the cases and we went for a wander. On returning at 2.30 room was ready and we were given a room on 11th floor and there was some fizz provided by the hotel.  Reception staff helped us out when we needed to contact the transfer company. Many thanks to Ali, Yassir and especially to Majid, cheers for a great stay.  Majid suggested a deli/cafe for us to visit while waiting for the room to be prepared and we went there most days for cooked breakfast, it was that good.  Susan our chambermaid was fantastic and changed sheets;4
The staff make this hotel what it is, the building is very well located only 5 minutes walk to Time Square or Central Park.  Standard rooms are small but always very clean and well presented.  Deluxe Kingsize rooms are great size and would recommend paying that bit extra for one of these.  If you get to ask for a room ask for one that ends in a 5 (305, 404........1205) as these are the corner rooms and give great views out of both windows. Rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels left too.  Reception staff we extremely helpful with the bits we needed as were there concierge staff (Mourad & Said that we dealt with) giving us the help we needed with our baggage and advise of where to go etc.;4
This was our first trip to new york and we had a great time , the hotel was in a fab location really central to everything all the staff we had dealings with where really helpful jeff & said and the reception staff , hopefully will return to NYC and would definitely stay in the ameritania again ❤;5
Our stay was amazing . Great location for the city. Staff are very professional and helpful. We enjoyed the gesture form the hotel for a birthday. Doormen have great help. I would recommend tonhve a set up for a basic kitchen requirement to serve quality food for the guests .;5
This hotel is fantastic, very comfortable and stylish. The staff are extremely helpful, a special shoutout to Said, who was so helpful and brilliant at his job. Also a shoutout to Jeff, who was extemely helpful. Great location and the beds are so comfy. The shower is fantastic and the rooms are spotless. We will be returning.;5
"From the outset when we decided that we were to spend our 3rd thanksgiving at the Ameritania we knew that we were in great hands.  Mourad sorted out our transfers via email, the driver was exactly where he needed to be at the correct times.  Mourad was waiting in the street to help with the bags, you can't ask for better service!!  Check in was a breeze and we got a great room 1205 on the corner, this way you get a view down & up Broadway & 54th.  One of the nice touches was when Mourad said NYC isn't a place to waste your time as there is always something happening & I can arrange anything to help you.  ""here my friend you are treated like a King"" People are the ones that make a difference and i can safely say that you have the best people there at the Ameritania.  Emily";5
Great experience! Room clean, bathroom small but cozy, modern rooms, pleasant staff, nice lobby area, complimentary water in lobby, located in area where walking distance is to all shops and staff went above and beyond!;5
We booked 3 rooms just 2 days before our family trip. Our apprehension about quality, evaporated  as soon as we stepped in lobby. Staff was helpful and made us feel at home. Good modern decor and clean.;5
We spent Thanksgiving in NYC this year and chose this wonderful hotel! Location was fantastic and accessible to everything we needed!  The staff was incredible from check in to check out. Said the bellman was so incredible and helpful with every need we had.  The gentleman that worked in the continental breakfast area was gracious and patient with my children's ever ask. Elena at the from desk at checkout was very quick, personable and friendly. Can't wait to come back and stay at this hotel.;5
Reasonable size room for a central Manhattan location, with good amenities and great staff at the hotel. Majid on reception was exceptionally helpful and couldn't do enough to help us find our way around New York. Reasonable breakfast prices, clean room and quick check out. You are 5 minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park and a 3 minute walk from the subway.;4
Lovely hotel with fabulous decor. Hotel staff were very accommodating. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and stylish. The hotel was situated in a very convenient place for Times Square, theatres etc.;5
We love visiting New York and returned a few weeks ago from our second stay at the Ameritania hotel - we will now always be staying here when we visit New York! I highly recommend this hotel and it cannot be beaten for value. Lovely decorated clean rooms with very comfortable beds and great facilities with the most helpful and friendly staff. A lovely bottle of wine was sent up to our room for us to enjoy which topped off a fantastic stay.  The location can't be beaten – moments from Times Square and Broadway as well as being near all the main spots with plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. Central Park is less than a five minute walk away as well.  An extra special shout out to the door man Jeff, an absolutely invaluable member of the hotel, who always goes above and beyond;5
Can't speak highly enough of this hotel. Helpful staff comfortable and clean rooms, and a location which made everything within easy each. Complimentary tea and coffee in morning and reasonably priced bar were also very welcome;5
We stayed the third week in November this year, we have been to the city many times but  have never stayed in such a friendly hotel , the staff were above and beyond helpful particularly Jeff at the front door who gave us helpful advice , always treated us in a friendly manner and made us feel very welcome . The room was great , stylish, clean and the bed and bedding were extremely comfortable after a long day exploring the city. Would stay here again without hesitation.;5
How come in 2016 a hotel in NYC charges for internet in the room, and for a internet that does not work properly? Reception staff were unpatient, rooms are ok, but matress are too soft, so the pilows, it is better to stay in the HIlton Gardens Inn across the street;3
Just got back from a long weekend staying at the Ameritana. The hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square, Central Park and loads of restaurants.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as we're all the doormen especially Jeff! To the manager - Jeff deserves a pay rise! He goes beyond the call of duty doing his job. He's very helpful and approachable and is a pleasure to talk to. The hotel was modern, clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 12th floor so noise didn't bother us but you're in New York!  It can be noisy! I didn't use the bar do can't comment but there are plenty close by anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying here.;4
Nice hotel, clean & comfy. Bathroom clean nice shower. Good location right by Times Square . Small bar breakfast not worth $11 no hot food. Can order room service that gets sent in. Staff very helpful & pleasant.;4
Had a very enjoyable stay at the Ameritania , and well placed for time square and the park. Staff friendly and very helpful . Rooms and facilities are very good and the hotel is very highly recommended;5
Here for a short break and my wife's and my first trip to the city that never sleeps. After are relitively short trip from Newark airport we arrived to a lovely reception and staff.   The room was spacious clean neat tidy but ear plugs definitely needed as the night time traffic was loud,but noticeably quieter at the weekend. Plenty to do and see and we did the usual places to see here, statue of liberty, time square, ground zero etc all easy to get to by metro or walk as u see so much more.   We'll be coming back and if u have ANY questions or issues chat to Jeff who's always on the door as you arrive. The man is a mind field of information about newyork.  Enjoy. .;5
Good location, comfortable beds, nice enough space. Would've been nice if wifi and lights/heating worked better. Was very disappointed that each package that I had delivered to the hotel was a $5 fee.;3
It was a nice stay. Employees were friendly, the hotel has an excellent location and provides a good service. Towels were and sheets were daily changed however, it should be nicer if dust was removed from furnitures, carpet was vacuumed and blanket was eventually changed.;3
Second time we stayed in Ameritania hotel. We selected this hotel primarily For its location (near Times square, Central Park, lots of nice restaurants). Very good value for your money, with a comfortable bed in a quiet room and a friendly staff. Breakfast is basic but adequate and relativily cheap. Wifi service in the lobby is free of charge and fast enough. In all we were (again) very satisfied with the Ameritania;5
Room amazing great rain shower beds very comfy. Tea coffee available free in lobby of a morning. Wifi also free in lobby. Towels replaced daily. In the heart of everything only minutes from Time square, same with Central Park, Subway easy to use. Jeff the doorman what can I say what a mindful of information worth the trip just to see him. Invaluable member of the hotel. Would not hesitate to come back here again. If I have one criticism it's maybe hotel needs to invest in triple glazing lots of noise. But Hey were in the city that never sleeps. 🇺🇸🇺🇸;4
"The Ameritania is in a superb location Midtown - extremely close to Times Square & Broadway; the striking & funky decor of the lobby is inviting for all patrons of the hotel to utilise the free wifi facilities. As a regular visitor to the brights lights of Manhattan rooms in most hotels are famously small but I felt that the rooms here were sufficient size - and I did appreciate the tasteful furnishings in our double room.  Huge thank you to the wonderful doorman who couldn't do enough to help; he organised a car for our return transfer to the airport which was much appreciated. The hotel offers excellent value for money & I look forward to staying here again in the future!";5
After reading a lot of good reviews I decided to book this hotel. It was well priced and compared to others for the same price it had the best reviews. I was a single traveller so wanted to be sure that I was in a central location. I booked this hotel for a total of five nights but with a break in the middle. I was able to leave my bag here while I went on another trip.  The hotel is very central in Times Square. It's on 54th street, next to where the ed Sullivan theatre is where Letterman was recorded. Very close to Boardway and other Times square activities. I felt safe walking to my hotel at night as there were lots of people around and also early in the morning when it was still a little dark.  It was close to the greyline bus terminal which was one of my objectives, but;5
Thais hotel is really nice! The staff are so good and helpfull. Its a great experience at NY. The location is perfect, really nice to enjoy theaters and good restaurantes. Enjoy NY at Ameritania Hotel!!!!;5
Good for a short business trip......very small rooms not good for a lengthy stay Only reason I rated rooms poor was due to size and doorless showers (flood on floor after every shower)...otherwise clean and nice;3
Had a sisters vacation during Election Week. What a friendly and welcoming staff greeted us on our early arrival. Cheerfully held our bags till room was ready. Loved the doorman Jeff and Hugo who were so gracious and helpful.  Yassir at front desk was also very pleasant. The location was perfect, rooms clean ,room size adequate, bathroom really nice. Near lots of restaurants, 2 blocks from Ellen's Stardust Diner and around corner from Late Night Ed Sullivan Theatre. Had a wonderful stay and will return there again. Beds were really comfortable.;5
"Very welcoming, well appointed room. The staff: Jeff who looked after our bags, and arranged our transport; Julian and Gina in the bar who saw to all our needs in such a friendly way. Our room was beautifully cleaned each day. Would not hesitate to stay again when in NYC.";4
Spent 2 nights at Ameritania to celebrate a bachelorette.  The lobby was elegant and comfortable.  The room was perfect for what we needed.  The shower was amazing!  The fridge is stocked with overpriced drinks and no room to put your own items in, though.  Right around the corner from the Late Show and Fiddler on the Roof.  Walking distance to everything.  Jeff, the bellman, was very helpful in getting us transportation for less and taking care of our baggage while we spent the last few hours in the city.;4
We chose this hotel for its location, which is 8 minutes walk away from Times Square. The bedroom was clean, good quality beds, and great shower. The size of the double room not that generous, and you ave to pay for EVERYTHING. Considering we paid 250 GBP for one night stay on a mid season Monday night, it did feel a bit like a rip off. The bottle of water in the bedroom was FIVE dollars, didn't want to check the rest of the goodies that were there. Not even wifi was included in the room.  Staff in the lobby was very helpful and friendly, always with a smile and ready to assist.;3
A very pleasant staying in New York, due to the excellent position of Ameritania, close to Central Park and all the main city attractions. Many thanks to the hotel guys Julian and Jalal, for their help and kindness.;4
The location is PERFECT, close to (time square). The staff is very friendly. The room is modern decorated, the bed is comfortable. The AC worked perfectly. The doorman are amazing, specially Jeff and Julian. The front desk staff is always available for good recommendations. The con is that the lobby has only one restroom which is not clean at all but not as dirty as well. I definitely recommend it for everyone going to NYC.;4
we loved the Ameritania for our 4 night stay in New York. The location is perfect: a short walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Broadway, Times Square, etc. we loved being greeted at the door with staff that were genuinely interested in making our trip to New York memorable. Fun conversations about living in the city, places to eat, favorite restaurants, etc. Rooms were clean and housekeeping very attentive to any requests. I would definitely recommend this hotel.;5
When I checked in on Saturday at 3pm, I requested a room above the street noise and was given a room on the 7th floor... not high enough. I should have been tipped off when I noticed one of the sundries provided in the bathroom besides QTips and soap was Ear Plugs. As it turns out my husband and I travel with both a white sound machine and ear plugs of our own. Even those measures were not enough to block out the sirens, car horns and thumping house music (from who knows where). I did eventually get to sleep, but the surroundings are noisy.   The AC controls were not obvious. There was no thermostat on the wall, nor could we see one on the unit. I didn't feel like calling down to the front desk, so because I was cold with the air running, we simply unplugged the unit.   Note;3
We stayed at this property to participate in the NYC Marathon. The Staff was very helpful in all aspects. Special shout-out to Jeff (The Doorman) as he helped us find the best way to get around town and provided great recommendations for Eating Out (Fancy and Quick Bites).;4
"Perfect location, very clean place, very ""boutique-style"", helpful and very nice staff... I am in NY every 2 months for work... the Ameritania is the best hotel I have experienced in Manhattan.Highly recommended";5
The location of this hotel is fantastic! It’s walking distance to everything you need or want: Times Square, Central Park, shops, and restaurants. The size of the room was bigger than I expected for a New York hotel and it was very clean. We stayed during a very busy weekend with the marathon going on and still experienced excellent customer service. Everyone was very friendly and helpful to answer questions and provide recommendations in the area. Overall, the hotel exceeded our expectations and I would definitely stay there again.;5
Whilst initially we thought the hotel was expensive we soon realised the proximity to the sites,shops etc this saved lots in extra cab fares. Amertitania hotel met all the requirements and made our stay of 8 days a welcoming refuge after some very long days. Jeff became our favourite doorman and greeted us each day with such care and attention to how we were going.we valued his care and attention to us.Javier was a super bar man  and looked after us with such professional care and grace.;4
Great location at 54th Street and Broadway. Can't get any better in Midtown Manhattan. I had a superior room which was of a decent size, at least by NYC standards.   The hotel only has (quite pricey) paid Wifi in the rooms.;4
We stayed at the Ameritania last week-end. We participated in the New York City Marathon.  The location was excellent for us.  We parked the car when we arrived (the hotel provides discounted parking) and didn't worry about it until it was time to leave the city!  The room was small, but very comfortable.  The staff was very gracious and accommodating.  There are many restaurants nearby. We walked to our afternoon play (Kinky Boots).  We will definitely stay at the Ameritania again.;5
The hotel and room had everything we needed, with the only downside being no free wifi in the rooms. I think the hotel made up for this by providing free wifi in the lobby and including free coffee and water.  The hotel is in a great location just a stones throw away from Times Square. The room albeit a little small was still very nice and clean and given that we were only ever in the room to sleep the size didn't bother us too much at all.  Overall we had a really good stay at Ameritania and would not hesitate in staying again. A special mention also needs to go out to Jeff on the door. He was extremely pleasant from when we first arrived and was always happy to assist us. He's a credit to the hotel.;4
A great affordable hotel. Great location, friendly and helpful staff, good size on the room, nice bathroom, clean. Will definitly come back to this hotel. 3-4 mins walk to Times Square, and multiple subway stations nearby.;5
This is an impeccable location on Broadway and a few steps to times square. This hotel has excellent staff and the rooms although small are modern and well appointed. Bathrooms are also nice. Surrounded by restaurants in any direction.;5
Good location with many eating options nearby and 24hr pharmacy which sells everything. Only downside is that the rooms are very small without enough lights. Although the hotel has high level but we were only given 5th floor and the one nearest to the lift(so we are totally unhappy about it). Bathroom was very clean. TV had bad reception, kept having static noise during the movies (couldn't hear a single word from the actors).  Very helpful staff - Jeff carried our stuff during check in and check out. Proactively suggested and arranged transfer from hotel to airport. Got everything plan out smoothly.;4
+ Modern hotel with a great location Small but well equiped gym Very comfy beds Clean and fresh bathroom Nice and polite staff  - Noisy streets on the outside and generators on the inside, choose a room as high up as you can get. Rather expensive;4
I loved the location.  The rooms were small but the hotel was friendly, helpful and clean.  I had a great bellhop who was very helpful in my arrival.  I had to park my car and ask him to hold my bags.  HIs name was Jeff and he is the guy to ask for. My stay was from this summer, but I just found his card and remembered that I gave him my word that I would give him a great recommendation.  Better late than never!  It's the second time I've stayed there.  No frills but pleasant, clean and helpful.;4
Attractive, clean hotel in ideal location at Times Square. Staff were exceptional, especially Gina, Vlad and Eugenia at front desk. Only problem was metal bed posts not visible from above the bed. Both my roommate tripped over them.;5
This hotel is an excellent find. It's located just 5-10 blocks from the theaters, which makes walking to them nightly a piece of cake. Furthermore Central Park is just a few blocks north. Also it's directly across from a 24-hour Starbucks, 1 block from a fabulous bagel place (Pick A Bagel) and adjacent to the Late Show with Stephen Colbert theater. When we arrived, a complimentary bottle of champagne was waiting on ice for my birthday. What a nice touch!!;5
List of positive and negative things about the hotel:  Positive: - Helpful waiter in breakfast dining area - Friendly and helpful door men - Location of hotel is excellent - Clean halls and rooms - Nice and comfy beds - Very little noise at our room (717) - Lobby personell helpful with turning off noisy machine at conference room.  Negative:  - Lighting in our room was poor.  - Lobby personell denied us coffee/tea at our conference room that we rented for 200$ for a few hours. We had to go out and buy at Starbucks and bring back to hotel. When we asked to have some water, we had to serve ourselves from the lobby and bring the cups into the conference room. Lobby personell were very unhelpful with this.  - Conference room was untidy, cold, did not have a projector and had a loud;3
Situated between Time Square and Central Park this hotel could be a little diamond if the staff were more attentive (not the door staff they were very helpful) The noise level at night was unbearable due to inadequate glazing and soundproofing, the lifts were a joke and the general appearance in the reception area was shabby.;2
Great location. Very clean, brightly lit. The coffee shop was not much but so what? It's New York, so a block over is the Metro Café and that's a better breakfast anyway. The bar was nice but the bartender always seemed hard to find. Overall, though, this is a good hotel in a great location. I had two meetings in the coffee shop, and staff didn't mind us lingering. A winner.;5
Good hotel in the right area of New York, right on the edge of Times Square. Close to theatres and shopping.  Rooms clean with big bathroom.  A little too small for two travellers with four pieces of luggage.  Aircon could be better.;4
Stayed 5 nights in this hotel which I would describe as clean and modern. The deluxe bedroom was spacious and the bed was enormous and comfortable. Free Wi-Fi in lobby was welcome. Cannot comment on food as we did not include in stay. As a first timer in New York was surprised by the relentless noise from the street and the air condition in the room. The heavy taxes added to the hotel stay could be a further surprise for those on a budget. Don't forget about these couple of issues as your holiday could be a disappointment if these issues matter to you.;4
Stayed at the Ameritania for 6  nights on a family break - 3 adults, 1 teen and one preteen. Can't fault the facilities, location and staff. Special mention for Jeff the doorman who was really helpful with advice about where to go and up to date weather forecasts.;5
"I just spent four days in NY and i must thank Americana since i could enjoy almost everything in NY: both, main attractions and the ""feeling"" of this city. The hotel is located in an old-style building, very nice; position is great, at the corner with Broadway, few minutes walking and you'll be in Times Square or in Central Park. The rooms are modern, comfortable and clean, i did not miss anything. Special thanks to Vlad/Rob at the reception who helped me in enjoying in the best way my first time in NY, setting me a room with a nice view (i just needed to ask that and their kindness made it all) and for Jeff too, who gave us some informations very useful and always smiling. Thanks Americana, i could have nice days!";4
My fiancé and I had a great stay at the ameritania! We stayed for 5 nights and couldn't fault one thing about this hotel. We stayed in a standard queen room which was lovely, the decor is modern with a authentic feel to it. Rainfall Shower was amazing after a long day out! The staff were lovely and very helpful, shoutout to Jeff who was the loveliest! Wifi was good down in the lobby. For wifi in the room u have to pay however if you're on holiday why do you want to be sat on your phone/laptop in the room, you should be out exploring the city!! The location of the hotel was perfect, Central Park is a 5min walk, Times Square is 2mins away. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops & bars nearby! Would definitely recommend this hotel to family & friends!;5
In addition to being well located, the hotel went under renovation only three years ago and is very clean and fresh. The staff is very helpful. The hotel has a nice location near the theater district but yet is quiet for sleeping.;5
This hotel is the only hotel I stay at when I travel. It's my home away from home! These are good folks. You'll like it too!  The people make it great. It's at the top of Times Square so you avoid the traffic and congestion but you can walk everywhere;5
This hotel is clean and the beds are very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful with all your needs. The hotel is in a great location for walking to the park or Times Square. I will stay in this hotel again. It is a good value.;5
"A well-located hotel for the Times Square area --- being at 45th and Broadway you are close to but not in the center of the activity. I was staying in a deluxe queen room, which was very clean and well-appointed (comfortable bed cover, pillows and linens; contemporary bathroom/shower). I didn't see any restaurant or bar in the hotel itself; but, hardly an issue with all of the bars, restaurants, cafes and street vendors in the immediate vicinity. Close to public transportation. My impression is that this would be a better choice for the solo traveler or couples rather than families with small kids.";4
Great place with a perfect location for NYC, close to the park and Times Square! I hope I can get in here over New Years. So cool to walk around the corner and be looking at the historic Ed Sullivan Theater where David Letterman spent so much time.;5
Good hotel with central location on Broadway.  Close to Subway and tourist attraction.  The room was large and clean.  The street naoise carries despite being on the top floor but this is New York after all!!;4
Located almost around the corner from Time Square, Ameritania offers lovely and cozy rooms, nice and helpful staff as well, especially seeing how I arrived very late at night. I spent only one night at this establishment, but it was enough to want to come back.;5
Shared a room with family member and got two comfortable double beds. No view but good room size and great bathroom with large shower. Best part of the room was the enormous mirror (underrated addition to hotel room). water cooler downstairs is a good touch. Best part of the stay was the concierge Jeff. Really friendly and combination of formal and informal customer service. Overheard a few times him recommending places to visit for food to others so his local knowledge is clearly top notch. Very helpful. Thanks Jeff!;5
Excellent location and very comfortable room. Front desk staff was very friendly and knowledgable. Clean and functional facility. Lobby bar was small and criwded and wifi only in lobby (unless you paid). Exercise room was too small and with not enough variety of equipment.;4
Stayed here for 4 nights in October.  Had our room upgraded and a complimentary bottle of wine as it was our wedding anniversary. Staff were really friendly and the room was comfortable and very clean. Great location not far from Times Square. Jeff the doorman was really helpful and booked our return shuttle for us as well as giving us a metro card. The barman was also great and gave us advice on how to get the most from our stay. Would definitely stay here again if we came back to New York.;5
Great location, friendly staff (especially doorman Jeff, he took great care of us), kinda small rooms, but clean and not as noisy as some other nearby hotels. Window facing the street was no problem at all.;5
The highlight of our stay at the Ameritania Hotel was Said, the best doorman ever.  He was always friendly when we left for the day and if we returned before his shift was over we received the same gracious consideration.;5
Great locación...A few steps from Times Square and Central Park. Plenty of shops and dinning. Two minutes from Moma museum and 5th Avenue. One block from subway. Rates aré good and staff is grey friendly. Definítely would come back.;5
Location - ideal for Times Square. The surrounding area is nice, if very busy as expected. Good for Times Square and pretty close for broadway shows/ Central Park. The lobby is nice and pretty classy. Staff very polite and professional.  The room was small despite being a double-double for my family. Two double beds with not much extra space at all - small bathroom but large and nice shower.  the room had no tea and coffee making facilities but i was told i could get free tea downstairs during the breakfast hours - i never did- i need a tea to get me going in the morning, not once i'm up and dressed.  The elevator to the gym was faulty and i had to exit via the laundry - I've read reviews about the elevator - it seems to be an ongoing issue over time. There are three elevators;4
I love staying here. Great location. Rooms are practical with great amenities. Super Decore. Bedding and linens impeccable and very very comfortable. Private yet in the middle of all the action. You could walk anywhere from this hotel;5
A place I've been going to for years. Location is excellent, rooms (king) are big and comfy. Only trouble is noice of air con and outside noises, better isolation would be a must.  Bell men are really nice and helpful guys.  Breakast is average but handy. Coffee for free;4
Excellent locations and all essentials done well.  Not a luxury property, but location, staff, good bed, good shower help it punch above weight.  Will certainly continue to use as provides all the necessities for a city stay.;5
Enjoyed the stay at this modern well located city hotel. Good comfortable beds, well appointed. Plenty of good restaurants and bars within walking distance. Would recommend this hotel to others and would stay again. It's expensive but then again, it is New York!!;5
While I usually stay at the big names hotels, I booked a room for the week at this quaint boutique hotel located in the heart of New York City’s Theater District.  This chic hotel was beautifully decorated and clean.  While I gave it 5 stars, mostly because of the friendly staff and the clean rooms.  It’s in New York and space is limited.  The rooms are not big but comfortable and beautifully decorated.  Also, there is only free WiFi in the lobby and spotty in the rooms (with an additional fee).  The continental breakfast is $10 and the choice is very limited.  However, Mutapha greats you every morning with a smile and will assist you with any of your breakfast needs.  The bellman were always at the door, so safety seems to be a great priority.  Jeff and Hugo were helpful with;5
Where to start?  1st time in New York, family holiday, short break, so wanted somewhere central and easy walking of attractions. Ameritania brilliant for that, the rooms are clean and beds very comfortable.  Staff were always helpful and courteous, special thanks to the doorman who was so helpful when we arrived, I was unfortunately ill on arrival, making sure we were taken to room and organised a cup of tea! Much appreciated. I am sorry I don't know his name, but thank you. given the location of the hotel I think they are great value for money, near to restaurants, theatres and shops, and easy walking distance for Fifth Avenue, Empire State and Central Park.  Also special thanks to Said for organising an 'upgrade' of our taxi to the airport, turned out to be a white stretch;5
For a city- trip to New York I can highly recommend this hotel to every body. In the middle of Manhattan, nice rooms, good service! The only negative was the connecting with wifi was poor and the beds good be a little bigger for the tall Europeans amongst us.;5
Had a brilliant time in New York. The Ameritania Hotel was fantastic, great location & the staff where lovely. Would especially like to mention Jalal on the door who always greeted us & organised our return shuttle to the airport and Wendy the maid.;5
Nice hotel in good location, two lovely pubs nx door the Iguana and Three Monkeys, for last drink of the night before bed. Good access to Central Park,Times Square, and the subway on 50th St ........enjoyed my stay, which was made most comfortable by the lovely JEFF.......a wonderful man who was always helpful and happy to help. Helped us with a taxi to airport and shown us the free coffee and tea........only downfall on the whole trip was somebody on the second floor playing a trumpet ....short bursts, i complained at the desk.....;4
Rob did welcome us very friendly! Super hotel , very hygienic. Rob did everything to let us feel confortable! Location is perfect. Broadway and times square is 2min walking. I would higly recommend this hotel for everyone.;5
Great hotel, very good location - about 7 minutes walking from Times Square, and about The same time walking to Central Park.  The rooms are very nice and clean.  The staff is great - very nice and helpful, Especially Elena and Jeff!   Thank you!!;5
Jeff is an exceptional doorman when leaving , he had an airport ride on standby for us at 6:45 am before he even started his shift! All the staff were helpful and friendly.  All the doormen assisted with an elderly guest in a wheelchair  who was in our party.   Great location . Many amenities close ( Starbucks / bars / reasonable casual lunch spots etc.) .  You can walk wherever you want to go in the Times Square and surrounding  area .;4
Beside a great location, great hotel decor and very fine facilities the hotel staff is remarkably welcoming and helpful. The reception (Janet) provided outstanding service, and the doormen (Jeff) did a great job.;5
Great stay. The rooms had such an old vintage NY style decor. Stayed for a small get away to find some artistic motivation. Service was top notch from front desk to housekeeping. Kathy at the front desk assisted me with some things to do around the city and at check in was phenomenal, great custom service and very accommodating. Will totally stay here again.;5
The Ameritania was a great place to stay and fitted our budget, close to Times Square and Central park an ideal base for our break. Rooms were clean and airy. Try and ensure a high floor as street noise can be intrusive   Special thanks to our barman Javier who kept us entertained with a wide range of cocktails and mocktails for the younger members of our party, his advice on where to eat and which sights to visit were invaluable. Special thanks also to Jeff the doorman who arranged transport to the airport for us on the day we returned home;4
Excellent location!! Couldn't ask for better! Small rooms with outdated furniture and very uncomfortable bed that sank in the middle. However, all staff were very friendly and we did have a great view of Broadway from our room upon request!;3
Got it as a substitute to the Amsterdam Court hotel, a couple of blocks away for one night. The receptionist welcomed us warmly. The room was large and comfortable, and the shower was very nice. Everything is clean and organized, and it's only a few blocks from Times-Square.  Highly recommended for the right price.;5
This place is greatly located near Times Square, but I think that means it attracts a certain group of people - the very touristy bunch or maybe first timers to New York. The internet here is not very stable therefore frustrating for business travellers.  The downside to me is the location -because of its nature, it is too hectic therefore attracting random crowd. You don't get to experience good restaurants or quirky cafes of New York around the hotel area.  Just a couple of international food chain restaurants which you don't need to come all the way for. Stay somewhere else if you have the choice. NYC is too fun to be stuck at this place.;3
We spent 5 nights at this hotell in october. The staff was friendly and serviceminded. Rooms where a bit small (queensize bed) but clean and a nice place to relax sore feets. The location was perfect, near subways, times.s, and great resturants in hells kitchen.;4
Excellent hotel. All the staff I came in contact with were extremely helpful, Katherine quinonez, director of front office who assisted my wife and l when we were obliged to move from a hotel we considered unsuitable.  I feel I must mention four other members of staff who made our staff so memorable, Said,Gyina,Jeff andYassir.  I would no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any of my friends, family etc. Rooms excellent, cleanliness excellent. The only drawback in my opinion, no tea making facilities in room.;5
Great hotel in a great location. Made to feel very welcome by doorman SAID who took the time to help us and guide us, perfect thank you SAID you are a credit to the hotel. A perfect start to our holiday in New York then on to our cruise. The only small criticism is that I would of preferred bigger pillow cases to fit the pillows which were poking out the ends of the too small pillow cases. I would recommend this hotel as a perfect base and will stay again when I return.;5
Nice hotel good hospitality. clean room very helpful staff. the location is close to the park MoMa and other sites. close to few subways lines . The housekeeping are vey polite same the personal at the lobby;5
Excellent accommodation and location. Staff were very attentive.  Must mention Jeff the doorman who went out of his way to help. A definite asset to the hotel. Will be recommending to firends and family.;5
Very helpful on getting around NYC, front door and front desk looked after you and gave out go advice. Jeff at the front door was very good and another doorman who helped us but did not get his name. Li Li looked after our room and kept it very clean for us. A bottle of wine was sent to our room mistakenly. I called down and they told me to keep it in my room. Very appreciative. Excellent spot to be near everything. Only 15 minute walk to Theatre district. Very close to subway and staff look after you very good.;5
This hotel meets all requirements of a good hotel. It is situated near the most important tourist spots in NYC, such as Central Park, Broadway and Times Square. Moreover, there are also excelent and very close bakeries and pharmacies as well as bars and pubs. Regarding the hotel structure, it's all very clean and airy. The room is spacious and everybody are very kind. I recommend for sure that all visiting NYC to host the Ameritania.;5
The hotel is ideally placed for Central Park and Times Square with also the yellow, blue and red subway lines just a street or two away. Wifi is poor (only lobby connection is free and that is rather sporadic depending on how many people are using it), however there is a free NYC wifi on the street just outside the door and there is a Starbucks nearby too. Room was nice although the air conditioning unit was very noisy. (Tip: take earplugs as the traffic noise is throughout the night including car horns and sirens) Bathroom was very good and nice sized but the minibar, tray of snacks and the water bottles are extortionately priced.  A nice hotel to be based from when sightseeing.;4
Friendly staff. Fresh water in the hotel lobby was very refreshing. Easy access to subway and walking distance to Central Park, many museums. Times Square was only 8 quarters distance. Good restaurants around the hotel.;5
Two weeks before my departure to NYC my Airbnb host cancelled my reservation and suddenly I was in a rush to find a new place to stay with my mum and sister! I came upon Hotel Ameritania during my search on TripAdvisor and thought I would give it a try since it had a ton of positive reviews! And wow! I was so glad I did! Hotel Ameritania is amazing! I have lived in NYC and know the city in and out and therefore I was so glad to be in a hotel with such a great location! Columbus Circle and Central Park are located just a few minutes from the hotel and it is also surrounded by a ton of places to eat (Especially the pizza place Angelo's on Broadway right next to the hotel is a gem!!) it couldn't have been located better! The hotel is super clean and the staff is friendly and;4
We spent 5 nights in Ameritania. Great location. Central park is a 4-5 blocks away. Times square is near by. The Chicago and Wicked theaters are very close as well.  The staff is very helpful. The rooms were maintained properly. We had a great time.;5
Location excellent, small rooms, no free wifi in rooms, clean, nice and helpful staff. Overpriced. Hairdryer sparking, clean towels and linen, changed every day. Maybe include wifi in room rate. Ac working fine except for condensation. Overall ok stay;4
The Ameritania was a good place for us location wise.  Close to Times Square, Theaters, restaurants, etc.  We had a room on the second floor facing Broadway.  It was really noisy.  It was almost as if the windows were open (they were not) or that there were not any windows at all.  We heard everything.  But the room itself was good and the bathroom clean and functional. It is the staff at the Ameritania who make it special.  They are so nice.  Said was especially helpful and informative.  He was great.;5
The decor of the hotel is quite stylish with a latter-day design. Not to mention, the hotel staff provides a delightful ambience that compliments the imagery of the hotel. Without a doubt, we look forward to staying here again-thanks to Kathy, and the rest of the staff.   Great Stay!;5
Close to everything, clean and very helpful staff. Room was small but well thought out and very clean. WoIlsley recommended this hotel. No food options available but restaurants are plenty near by. Starbucks right across the street.;5
we stayed in the hotel with 2 kids the location of the hotel was great! (7 minute walk to times square on one direction and 10 minute walk to central park on the other) service of staff was great and the room was very comfortable!!!;5
Great Location, Very nice (although slightly small) rooms, Very nice and helpful staff. From the front desk, housekeepers and doormen. Great experience all around. Also the price was very reasonable for such a nice hotel by New York standards.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania for 1 week at the end of September. We choose the hotel for the location, good reviews and price. When booking we upgraded to a deluxe room. For only a few extra pounds a night we felt it was worth it for a much larger room as we were staying for a week. The room was spacious, lovely large, high pressure shower. Comfortable king size bed, although a little soft for my liking. We used the wifi in the lobby several times before we headed out for the day or after returning. Had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which were reasonably priced (for NY). Ice cold water was available 24 hours a day and tea & coffee in the morning. The location of the hotel was great, just a few minutes walk from Times Square and Central Park and very close to a subway. There;4
From the front desk with Yassin, to the doormen Said & Julian who took extra care to look out for packages being shipped to me, Then we have our bar group Gina & Javier who stayed past to make sure myself & my group could meet up. Could not have asked for a better experience!;5
Delightful stay, the attentive staff is from bellman to bartenders we're exceptional.  Yasssin , Julian, Said took care of us throughout our stay with taxi's, baggage and questions.  The lobby bars Gina & Javier are complete delights and provided a fun and relaxed evening. I look forward to my next NYC visit and stay at Ameritania.;5
Although one of the coldest weeks for forty years and the heating system froze our room was changed when found un repairable, breakfast very poor and no bar on Sunday's but brilliant pub next door! Great hotel for short breaks and situated in a brilliant area for walking!;4
We liked the location of the hotell. We where also very satisfied whit the service. Thedoormen where helpfull and nice. The staff inthe reception whre also helpfull. We didn´t like the breakfast. The bread wasn´t fresh. The juice tasted like water. But the coffee was good.;4
Hotel in a vwrybstrategic position and overall good but frw things left me speechless if I compare the momey spent.  Windows with briken glasses keept inplace by tape....is it a safe environment for a customer paying to have an accptable service? The same window had damaged frame and once opened I have not been able to close it back....had to ask thenreception to send someone to repair it. Bed lining damaged (and not by me/us)...in 1 week I saw just once the shower gel refilled. I think these are minimal things which could be easily aieted out but that, on the other hand, can be very unpleasant for a customer. Hope Ameritania will put a small effort to offer an overall high level standard, to customers, as the rest of the steucture does. Lqst butnnot least, free wifi just in the;3
I spent a week here in October and it surpassed my expectations. I was staying with a number of friends and it turned out the room I was sharing with a friend had only one double bed. The front desk staff gladly changed us to another room with two beds at no extra cost and with no fuss. The room itself was great, small bit enough room to get around in and the beds themselves were just fantastic, very comfortable. I had a room which was on the inside facing an inner courtyard so can't speak for noise from the street however the aircon unit in the room was far too loud to leave on overnight- this was fine in October but could be an annoyance in summer.  Overall I had a very pleasurable experience staying for five nights on this hotel, the location is fantastic just a few streets;5
We loved our stay! Seeing how our bathroom looked like made us think that we need an upgrade soon in our house. Front desk were very friendly too! I believe their manager's name is Kathy, she was really approachable helped us with everything we needed. The best!;5
Great hotel in a great location right next to times square, short walk to central park, and good transport links to JFK. The room was quite small but completely fine for our needs. Two very comfortable beds, the shower was fantastic! The room and shower room were clean.  Shout out to JEFF! Very nice guy, helpful if you need any tips on where to go! All staff were great, from reception to breakfast, and the cleaning lady.  Breakfast was reasonable, quite standard but perfect to kick start your day.  My only quarrel is no free wifi in the rooms, I do understand this to be quite standard practice at many hotels though, so it didn't bother me too much.;4
Very noisy. Front desk staff not overly informative. Due to noise terrible for sleeping. (Outside noise). Very clean, but extremely small. Beds were comfortable but on low floor and all we heard was hooting and hollering throughout the night.;3
My wife and I recently stayed at in NYC, for 4 nights at the Americana. The staff, particularly Kathy and Jeff were very helpful to us. Jeff helped us with our bags and cabs and was particularly friendly. The room was clean and the hotel is conveniently located.;4
This hotel was very well located with close walking to the things we wanted to do. The beds were really comfortable, the staff was great. They were on top of things before we even knew we needed them. It was just far enough from the crowds at Times Square to be less noisy, but close enough to walk there easily.  I loved that it was so close to Central Park and the art museums.;5
This hotel is in an excellent location, but the best thing about it is the staff, they could not do enough for you.   Jeff, was so helpful and always smiling...look out for him!  The only downside was the breakfast, paper plates and plastic knives and forks...not good!  Go somewhere else for breakfast!;5
Very good hotel in the very heart of NYC. Close to Time Square and the Central park, nice staff that is very friendly (managers Elena and Rob), ready to help. Nice view from the windows. So I strongly recommend it for visiting.;5
I've just returned from my first ever holiday to NYC, and spent six enjoyable nights at the Ameritania.  The hotel is in a great position - it lies between Central Park and Times Square on Broadway, and is close to a few key subway stations making it an excellent base from which to explore the city. It is especially convenient for those not wanting to take a cab from the airport, as the AirTrain and E-line on the subway get you very cheaply to a block from the Ameritania (7th Ave station).  The communal areas were all spotless, and housekeeping was also very good, although on a couple of days I returned at around 4:30-5pm to find that my room hadn't been attended to yet. Only a minor gripe though, more than offset by Emily making sure I was allocated a corner room on arrival on;4
My girlfriend and I have visited New York 6 times and this hotel was by far the best value for money. Location could never be better with everything within a short walk. The rooms are small like every where else in New York but they are very clean. Don't look anywhere else.;5
We just got back from staying at this hotel and would like to say we had a great time. When we checked in our room was upgraded to a queen room with a lovely view. All the staff are really friendly and the room was cleaned to a high standard every day. The hotel is very central and a few minutes walk to time square. We would without a doubt stay here again and we are already planning our next trip!;5
excellent! The team was very helpful Room big and clean They gave us a room at 6am to take a shower after a long flight  I strongly recommend this hotel good location nice staff I will definitely come back;5
Just got back from 5 days at this hotel, from the moment we arrived until the moment we left everything was fabulous.  Very quick check-in, with a nice upgrade too, As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary during our visit the hotel gave us a nice bottle of red and some chocolates to help us celebrate. Room was very clean, kept clean and tidy throughout our stay too.  Jeff, one of the concierge staff was able to suggest great bars, and sorted our return taxi to the airport too. I cannot praise just how great Javier in the bar is, this friendly and informative guy makes the best cocktails ever - try the French Martini. Javier recommended some great restaurants for dinner and diners for breakfast - he even gave us some metro cards to use in the Subway.  A real gentleman, was;5
Me and my daughter stayed here for four nights October 2016. Nice hotel in the middle of everything! Big room, comfy beds, smiling people. Great to be able to have a morning run in Central Park only a few blocks away. I will mention Jeff at the door in particular, as always positive and helpful.;5
Everyone was very helpful, hotel was perfect for all the sightseeing, the staff were friendly and helpful and the price was good. My only small niggle was lack of storage. There were 3 of us sharing a room and only one single wardrobe. Maybe some drawers or a double wardrobe would be good. Was hard to live out of our suitcases when there wasn't anywhere to put them. We had an enormous mirror in there which I'd have gladly swapped for more storage!;4
Every time I stay here I  see improvements.  The Staff is great and helpful.  Room was clean , maid service was great. Location is bad a...  Easy to get to many of the trains and easy to grab a grab on the broadway corner.  TV was a little messed up. but I am not in NYC to watch tv.;5
Outstanding stay for our 20th wedding anniversary. Awesome place, gorgeous room, excellent location. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who want to have a wonderful stay in New York city. Thumbs up!;5
My first stay in New York, on business, so I was very pleased to meet the friendly & helpful staff at check in. Majid on reception was very helpful in sorting out a superb room for me and checking later on in the week if all was good, which it was. The room was modern, clean, quiet and the bed very comfortable. Although I was not tempted by the breakfast on offer, I did occasionally sit down in the breakfast area for a coffee in the morning whilst planning my day.;5
This hotel offers an amazing experience of the heart of Midtown. The theatre is right at your doorstep, along with access to every great restaurant and a plethora of options for any kind of sightseeing activity. Boutique offering that gives both comfort and style. Rooms are well equipped and fully up to date. Everything is purposeful and space is ample for the rate of the rooms. The staff is like a family away from home. Friendly and open to helping you meet any needs they can.  Enjoy this place...I do every time I stay.;5
We stayed here for three nights with a motor coach tour and loved it! It was our 1st time to NYC so we had many questions.  The doormen were helpful in helping us find our way to places we wanted to go. Doorman Jeff was especially friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic. Just steps away from Time Square and many other places, even the Soup Nazi. :)  Loved the breakfast bar.;4
We stayed at the ameritania during our whole stay. On arrival we was very impressed with the appreance of the hotel and it's location from the subway and times square and central park. I would highly recommend anyone thinking of visiting new york to stay here. The beds were extremely comfortable and bathrooms immaculate. The hotel lobby and general areas are very clean and very well presented. The breakfast is a good deal too at $10 a day each but is a buffet style and more than great to get your day started. Would definitely recommend for everyone to stay here.;5
We had a wonderful stay at the Americana Hotel.  Janet in the reception area was very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her.  She booked some Broadway shows for us and was a mine of information regarding places to go to shop for the specific items we were looking for.  She is a credit to the hotel and we can't thank her enough. Having someone like this to help is invaluable for travellers.;5
We had a great time at Ameritania. We started it having a reservation at Amsterdam court but Expedia overbooked so they sent us here and the staff was incredible. Brad at the front desk, Jeff helped us a ton leaving today. The rooms were comfortable and mostly just so happy with the staff. Thank you!;5
We have a really pleasant stay, thanks for receptionist vlad! Love our big room and beds. Hotel was a perfect location for young adults. Air condition work well, and the city noises dont bother us. There is so many pillow and towels. Clean is everyday;5
"We stayed at the Americana for five days while visiting New York. The location was absolutely fantastic! It was close to 5th Ave., close to Time Square, close to the Theatre District, across the street from a Hop On/Hop Off bus stop; the rooms were reasonable in price, they were clean, and we had a wonderful time. Our Bell Man/Concierge (Jeff) was so helpful and friendly. We will DEFINITELY stay here again!";5
The Ameritania was a really nice hotel in a good central midtown location.   + Easy to walk to Central Park, Times Square or the Metro. + Lots of bars/theatres/restaurants nearby + Really helpful staff + Nice decor and clean rooms  - Central location means there is plenty of noise outside. Earplugs are recommended. - No free WiFi in rooms - just in lobby.;4
Excellent hotel. Great service and room nice too. Door men extremely helpful and courteous at all times I left or returned to the hotel. I would recommend my friends to stay at the ameritiana when they are next in NYC and want a fab location.;5
Hotel AC didn't work for both nights I stayed and no one seems to know what to do about it. Room was clean but missing ironing board. Location is good, walking distance to Times Square and many restaurants around.;2
Travelling around the USA for several weeks, our first stop was here.  Met by Jeff, the concierge , we were shown to our room, with bags delivered directly. Jeff took time to tell us all about the the area, places to eat, attractions and directions.  He went on to organise our chauffeur to the airport for less than a regular taxi.  Breakfast was self service buffet, and delicious.  Ideally located for Times Square, all attractions within walking distance.  Lovely room and bathroom. Would definitely stay here again.;5
Ideal location for touring the city. It's close to so many of the sites that you don't need a cab. Good room size with very comfortable beds. The bar is good for an evening night cap. Excellent staff.;5
Just the job for site seeing in New York, clean and tidy room and well appointed bathroom. Should of had free WI-FI in the rooms though, Said at the door was very helpful with our bags upon arrival and departure.;4
"Very helpful staff,  Thank you Hugo H ,Said, Jeff,Jalal, Jeffrey Always helpful  and friendly. coffee always available! great location  10 minutes from Central Park uptown and "" minutes from Downtown. Great places to eat in vicinity.";5
Came for our first time as a couple to New York and stayed here! The room was clean the staff was friendly and we genuinely enjoyed our stay over all! Jeff was extremely helpful with taking our bags and helping us find great priced transportation to JFK and did it all with a smile! Thank you Jeff! :);5
I enjoy very much mi stay in the hotel, the only thing i have to say, its that i think its an excess to charge me u$s 5.- per package recieved, and also 10 dollars to have wifi in room, everything else it was really excellent. 100%  recommendable.;5
I was very impressed with this hotel.  Gina at the front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming when I checked in and it really set the tone for the rest of my stay.  The staff overall is very friendly.  My room was clean and spacious for NYC.  Bathroom was clean as well.  There is a great hotel bar in the lobby with the same friendly atmosphere.  I have yet to stay at one place twice when doing business in NY but I would definitely stay here again.;5
All excellent, very helpful, great location, also quiet, front desk very helpful and patient,   I would recommend it to anyone staying in New York City, good value and walkable to many attractions in the area.;5
This hotel is extremely cute and comfy. The staff was amazing ! Everyone encountered was helpful and friendly. I honestly have no complaints.  The only suggestion I would make is possible incorporating free wifi for rooms . However the lobby does have free wifi which is accomadating. I would definitely recommend to friends/family.;5
A very nice hotel with a perfect location. Nice bathrooms and very comfortable beds.  The room was a bit small tough but it didn't bother us much because we spent all days in the city. Some things in the room were quite warn out and should maybe be fixed or renewed. We had a room to the street side and it was a bit noisy in the evening but in the middle of New York you can't expect anything else. The staff was very friendly to us and especially Gina. She smiled, talked and really cared about us and gave us tips on were to eat and made sure we were okey at all times. That's how customer service should be like. We really felt welcome at the hotel and enjoyed our stay. We'll be back!;5
I won a vacation to NYC & it was my first time visiting the city. Even though I did not have to pay for the room, the staff was wonderful specially Jeff the doorman. He help me with my bags & made sure that the taxi driver took us to the correct door at Amtrak. All the staff always had a smile on their face & was helpful finding my way around the city. I would stay there the next time I visit NYC. I only thing that I found to be troublesome was the shower water always ended on the floor. Not door, just a glass wall.;5
We stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 4 nights. It was my first time in New York. We travelled by subway from JFK cost $8 compared to $80-$100 for taxi and it was probaly quicker too. To my surprise the hotel was only a block away from where we exited the subway. First impressions were great. We were greeted by the door staff and shown to the check in desk. Staff were very informative and friendly and we were given our room. We had room 219 which was an inner facing room with no view. Not a problem really though I suppose a view would be nice. It was clean and adequate, the bathroom was also clean and shower was surprisingly big. Room was clean and towels changed daily. There was a mini bar which we didn't use. The room had a safe which we did use. Aircon worked well and the bed;5
Value for money, especially since the hotel is located in the heart of a vibrant neighbourhood in close proximity to Times Square and Central Park. A special mention goes out to Gina at the reception for the great hospitality and speedy check in process.;4
The hotel is correct, clean and rather quiet for being so close to the Times Square's craziness. We did not encounter any trouble. What a shame about the wi-fi (25$ for 3 days) while there is free wi-fi everywhere in the city (street, subway, museums...). Special note to Jeff the doorman who is the best !!;4
The hotel is right in the middle of city! Charming old NY style building, helpful staff and super clean bathroom. There are many places to eat in the area, so there is no need for hotel restaurant. I recommend Ameritania signature cocktail.;4
The hotel is situated at the heart of theatre district having everything within a miles range. Top comfortable accommodation and very nice and helpful staff. We recommend a room at the upper floors with view to the street. We had a room with the de luxe two double size beds which was very comfortable although the rooms are generally small, but this is obviously the norm for hotels in NYC so no specific downside for Ameritania on this. Just be aware of this general issue in NYC. We strongly recommend this hotel for a pleasant and 'all-within-reach' stay.;5
Stayed here for one night. Checked in late, and front desk staff were super warm and efficient. Room was impeccably clean, modern, and spacious (certainly by NYC standards). Bed was comfortable. Hard to imagine a nicer place at a more reasonable price. Highly recommend.;5
We took this hotel at short notice after our AirBNB failed to materialise. In a great location, but lots of street noise and noisy aircon, Room small but comfortable and the staff were very good and helpful Enjoyed the $11 breakfast, and the best possible has been done with an older style building and facilities to make our budget conscious stay an enjoyable one.;3
Arrival was quick and easy with great information from the concierge about our location and what was immediately around the local area. We had a deluxe king size room and were so glad with the extra space and size of the bed. Although the desk chair needs replacing soon. On closer inspection we struggled to find any plug socket in the walls that we could use. As we looked we found there were plug sockets located in the bedside lamps which would have been fine except one of them was hanging out and my partner received a little shock from it.   To their credit they rectified the problem very quickly and gave us an extension cable so we had more sockets. Also looking around the bathroom we had a broken towel rail that was fixed quickly but a leaking shower that was not fixed;3
We stayed here for the New York leg of our American honeymoon in August. Room was small, but had everything we needed. The hotel was clean and inviting... ice cold water & hot drinks available all day and night. The staff were all friendly. Jeff was AMAZING... he went above and beyond to make our stay in NYC wonderful. We looked forward to seeing him each and and he seemed genuinely interested in what we had been up to (and was a valuable source in information about the city). The hotel is very close to Times Square and Central Park, so we were in the heart of the city, and loved it!!;4
Stayed here for two nights.   Positives - great location  - reception and door staff were great  - rooms were nicely decorated  - great bathroom   Negatives  - sheets weren't clean as shown in the pics (arrived late so just wanted to sleep). They changed the next day and they were then clean.  - wifi (they charge a day rate) but the signal was pretty rubbish;3
Loved everything about this hotel. Staff were always friendly, accommodating to requests and helpful in giving suggestions for directions, places to visit and eat etc, to get the most out of stay in NYC. The standard, look and facitiities as described on booking sight were very accurate. Highly recommend.;5
I booked two rooms at the Ameritania Hotel for our family trip in July of 2016. First impression of the hotel was excellent, the lobby was clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and helpful and was able to upgrade one of our rooms free of charge. They were able to accommodated our late/ early arrival (booked to check-in July 21st but did not arrive until 8am on July 22nd) and had our rooms ready as soon as we arrived.   The hallway leading up to our room was dark and dated. As for the room it was small but practical. We barely were able to fit our two carry on luggages on the floor. I won't complain as the price was very affordable for a location so central. We were practically steps away from Times Square and Broadway. The one thing that was lacking in the room was a;4
the rooms are rather small but adequate.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel because we did not want to be tied down by time, but you can find many places to have breakfast nearby. the hotel offers free coffee or tea in the morning. We had a front room which was rather noisy. The hotel is very central and was minutes away from Times Square.;4
My stay at the Ameritania has been very nice. Unfortunately once I got an issue with the lock of my suitcase, but immediately all the staff tried to help ! Everybody is very friendly and ready to suggest tourist places in NY;4
We came to New York in September to get married. We stayed in Ameritania hotel for 5 nights and it was excellent.   The room:  We were upgraded to a suite by our friends as a wedding present. We stayed in room 1209. The room was fantastic, it had a large bedroom with a large separate lounge area. The bed was huge and was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. There are blackout curtains so you don't get woken up with the light. We had a large flat screen TV in both the bedroom and lounge area. Air conditioning worked great and wasn't too noisy. Wifi was fast. The bathroom was small but great, large walk in shower and there was a window in the bathroom so it didn't get all steamed up.   The hotel:  All the staff that we met were friendly and very helpful. There is;5
Our stay at this hotel was nothing of a surprise that we had the 1st time. Which caused alot more disappointed this go around.  They neglected to pay attention to the little things that made a difference.;3
The Ameritania is excellently located on Broadway, right next to Times Square and minutes from Central Park. The hotel is very nice and the staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms, although slightly smaller than other hotels, are very clean, modern and comfortable. The aircon system was a bit noisy and you could also hear the noise of the streets, but if you have an issue with noise then you shouldn't be going to New York in the first place. All in all, the hotel was good value and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay right in the heart of Manhattan.;4
It was an amazing experience to spend our holidays there. We went in winter and the ambience was warm and charming. The service room operates 24 hours. Rooms are modern and clean. It is near from all shops and restaurants.;5
Mix emotions regarding my future stay at this hotel. Travel to New York often and I usually arrive exhausted don't want anything hampering my sleep and rest time. Our first night at this hotel was a nightmare.;4
Just home from five days in this amazing city. Hotel is in a prime location on Broadway and in sight of Times Square. All the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help. Decor is very stylish. Our room was very small, I've never stayed anywhere as small. The view from the window was of a brick wall and peeling wallpaper. It would be nice if tea and coffee were available all day.;4
Good hotel overall, especially for its location at the hearth of Times Square. Nice room and lobby styling. On the drawbacks, a little noisy (because of its location and improvable window insulation), the non-included Wifi connection (with poor access portal), and the outlets that are lacking in the room.;4
Went here for our honeymoon spent 3 days but wish wee added more days on there so much to do and see it's amazing and friendly. Hotel was just up from time square it was very clean and very modern the rooms were so cosy and staff and other guests very friendly. Can't wait to go back.;5
Great location , 54th and Broadway.  Next door to Colbert theater. Within easy walking distance of Times Square. Rooms small but nice. Service was nice and helpful Optional breakfast not worth the price.;4
Stayed here for work b/c of group rate. In the middle of TimesSquare. Staff was ok and door man helped me get a cab during the craziness of the UN General Assembly. Fine for a work trip, but wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again. Small things like no bath robe...;3
Excellent room and superbly located .right in the heart off Broadway and within walking distance off time square. Staff very welcoming and the doormen were wonderful. Thay really helped us find the way around .if u land at Newark airport the fare including tip should only be around 90.00 we got charged 125.00 but the doorman at the hotel sorted the situation. We are going again January 21 .staying in same hotel and hopefully same room .;4
"The hotel and its location provided an excellent base for exploring the city. Our room (Queen bed category) was clean and spacious enough for our 7night stay, the only down side for us was the LACK of a Tea and Coffee maker in the room.  The overall decour and cleanliness of our room and the public areas was very good. Both the Front Desk and Door staff provided and excellent and friendly service throughout our stay. Special thanks to both ""Ali""on the Front Desk for offering the loan of his personal iPad when I was having problems  with our check-in, and printing of Airline boarding cards using my iphone, and to ""Jeff"" on the door. His friendly and cheerful demeanour coupled with his excellent knowledge of the city contributed greatly to our enjoyable stay at the Ameritania. We";5
Great location near Times Square and Central Park, however there is no double glazing on the windows and the noise every night from police sirens and ambulances, not to mention people in the streets below meant very little sleep.  I guess this is New York and you expect some noise but not being able to sleep means  next  day's sightseeing is accompanied by a lot of yawning!;3
"* Walking visits: Times Square; theaters; Upper West Side (Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, American Museum of Natural History); Central Park; Upper East Side (Metropolitan and Guggenheim Museum); Rockefeller Center; St. Patrick's church; Madame Tussauds; Grand Central Station; UN; Penn Station; Madison Square Garden; Empire State Building; Chelsea Market etc. ** Near for the subway lines: 1, 2, 3, A, B, C, D, E, N, Q, R. *** JEFF, The Doorman: a great American citizen. God Bless you, Sir!";4
The location is fantastic, near time square and broadway and fifth avenues. Fast check-in and check-out The room was very small The doors were not in proper condition and made too much noises which interrupted sleeping.;2
I like the size of the hotel and the simplicity of staying there.  Clean comfortable beds, helpful and friendly staff.  Simple breakfast option. I gives me exactly what I need -  a clean, comfortable place to stay in a great location.;4
Ameritania Hotel is (as in 2013 and 2014 for our part) still very good value for money due to the atmosphere, the location and the overall comfort. Once again we really enjoyed our stay! Thank you so much to Emily, Jalal, Kozak... actually to all the staff! :-)  Mr. & Mrs. Wiborg from Denmark;5
Location was perfect. Trendy touches to make decor edgy. Friendly and helpful staff. My room was above a bar so it was a little noisy and one of the windows faced a brick wall. Other than those minor things, good hotel!;4
Excellent located hotel with very friendly personel, especially desk operator Gina and also doorman Jeff have been very helpfull. A minor point is the soundproof of the rooms. Too many noise during the night.;4
Was a grate place to stay we loved this hotel staff excellent and really helpful all the time door man jeff was so gd and help us with a cheap car ride to our airport for our next destination on our travels a grate place to stay;5
"This hotel is advertised as a 4 star establishment; it is not. No wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby. No working desk in the room. No coffee/ tea facilities in the room. Cleaning is very shabby, some days it seems as though they just made the bed and did nothing else in terms of cleaning. Rooms are very small, I'm talking very small. Aircon is noisy even when it is off.   On the positive; front desk staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is location is perfect; close to Central Park, time square and the MoMa.";2
Stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for 5 nights for a birthday and was given an upgraded room on the 12th floor. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was huge and so comfy which was appreciated after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is in a great location, short walk to the heart of Times Square and Central Park, close to subway stations too. Jeff the doorman was great, sorted out our transfer back to the airport which saved trying to hail down a cab during rush hour! Would definitely return to this hotel....Thanks Ameritania;5
The hotel is in the heart of the Manhattan district and close to Broadway. The staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you - especially Jeff who helped me with with a few minor teething problems with the room.   The room I stayed in was an average size but clean, had working ac, and a great shower.  Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, without reservation, if you're ever in Manhattan.;4
We stayed here for a week in September. The staff are all really nice and friendly, Jeff on the door is particular helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel is in a great location for getting around Manhattan. The subway stop from the airport is just a block away, which is great when you have your luggage with you!   The rooms are clean and comfortable, and have air conditioning that you can control which is a godsend in the heat - it was over 32 Celsius in mid September.  Central park, and times square are a five minute walk. If you're heading downtown, it's really worth walking as you will see so much, 5th avenue is a good way to go. But there's easy access to the subways, E train is the nicest, but we found the R train very entertaining!;5
My daughter and I stayed 5 nights in the Ameritania. We had booked a standard room with a note on the booking that we were mother and daughter. On arrival the desk clerk immediately upgraded us free of charge to double room which was lovely. The hotel is lovely and clean, rooms were made up everyday. Staff were helpful and pleasant. The Ameritania is really well situated and close to everything. I was extremely impressed and will definitely be staying there again when I return to NYC.;5
I recently stayed here for two nights.  The hotel is modern, but the rooms are small and the staff is so so.  AC was broken and needed tone fixed, and the room was never made up during the day.  We were compensated in no way, but thankfully the AC was fixed.;3
We spent 5 nights at the Ameritania at the end of our honeymoon in August. The staff is very nice, above all Mr. Julian at the front door... The room was clean but too small, I know we had a standard room and we didn't ask for any upgrade since we didn't spend much time in there, but I would suggest to make them a bit more comfy...   The WiFi is free only in the lobby, this is something they can work on, since many other hotels in the area give it for free also in the rooms. Cocktails at the bar in the lobby are delicious and the bartenders are very sweet and welcoming. The overall experience has been good, so I would suggest this hotel for the position and treatment, not too much for the room size (but you can also ask for an upgrade to a superior room).;3
We spent  7 nights at the Ameritania,we had asked via email for a high floor with a view on arrival we were given a very nice room on the 6th floor and was told we could move to a higher floor the next day which we did, lovely room with a view. They only fault with this hotel is that you have to pay for wifi in your room but it is free in the lobby, but that was all we could fault,the rooms were spotless clean towels everyday and the staff were very friendly and helpful. A special thanks to Jeff the doorman he helped us on many occasions even highlighting the hotel map for us to show us how easy it was to get around NYC. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square and many other attractions. We can recommend the Three monkeys bar just;5
Stayed here for a few nights for a wedding and it was just a great experience! Minutes from times square, central park and the aubway so I couldn't ask for more!   Beds were ridiculously comfy and big   Definitely stay there!;5
Jalal was the most helpful bellboy I had ever met. Nothing was too much trouble, all done with a smile!   The Hotel was great, really comfortable beds. Excellent chamber maids, immaculate room.   Close to all sites!;5
Stayed for 3 nights room only. Rooms are clean, providing everything you need. Breakfast available but we ate in local cafes. The hotel offers complimentary tea & coffee but actually this is only available in the morning, which is a bit mean as other hotels provide it. Staff are great in reception, very helpful. Beauty of this hotel is that it's pretty central, near the underground and walking distance of many attractions.;4
"I do like trying new hotels in NYC.  This is one of the more ""quirky"" ones I've stayed, mainly in the decor but also in the ""vibe"".   The rooms are not big.  Bathrooms are smaller. If there wasn't a big mirror sitting on the floor (vs hanging up?) I would have been able to sit and work at the desk.    And - it was propped against the wall, not secured.  Thankfully it didn't fall over! See pictures.   It is in a good location - near my office on 56th and 6th and Times Square and that area for restaurants.  The shower was strong and hot. Towels were okay.  Bed comfortable.  I was able to sleep despite some noise from the outside.  I was facing a courtyard and the window was quite small.  The A/C made too much noise, so I left the window open and was fine (early June).   Bonus -";3
Stayed here for 6 days as our wedding anniversary. Location couldnt get any better. Straight onto times square. However the overall noise was great and slept with no noise. Jeff the doorman was very helpful and always so cheerful. Reception staff was also very helpful and very polite.  Our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed. Shower and bathroom  Was also lovely. Plenty of storage and space for two people. Found a lovely surprise in the room which was a bottle of wine for our anniversary. A nice touch. Nothing was too much trouble and always wanting to help us first time new Yorkers.. a huge shout out to xaiver the bar man. Was very nice and so friendly. Telling us the best places to eat and visit. Was such a kind man. He needs a raise!!! The hotel in general was lovely.;5
Just back from a great holiday in USA. We stayed at the Ameritania what a place to stay. Next to Time Square,Broadway, subway, hop on hop off, and lots more. The staff was very friendly and helpful. At the bar was JAVIER who made some off the best cocktail,s you will fined in New York.;4
First I must mention the porter Jeff he was fantastic. Very helpful and friendly..as for hotel it was clean but staff not that friendly. It's a lot smaller than I thought but very central to everywhere..also very expensive. A bottle of water was 3.50 dollars. Our room was very small, the TV had nothing but a fuzzy screen and clock didn't work on wall. Air con unit was in the room and was so loud I couldn't sleep. The view from window would have been great if you could see through the dirty Windows. On a plus note the bed was soft and comfy. I wouldn't stay here again. The TV was sorted out after we mentioned it . This hotel is ok but for a first time visit to USA I maybe expected everything to be on a grand scale. Maybe if you upgraded you would have a better room.;3
We stayed for 5 days, we had a queen size bedroom which we were expecting to be a bit bigger than it was, but that was OK considering we didn't spend much time in there.  Rooms were clean and so was the hotel.  Man on the check in/check out desk could have done with a smile on his face. Also got funny at the fact I was paying for my stay in cash, not sure why that was a problem but the manager came over and sorted that out.  When we arrived also we had a few bags, would have been nice if someone offered us a hand to bring them in or up to the room.   There was a lovely man called Jeff when we were checking out who took care of our bags and loaded them into the taxi for us and also found out where our taxi was when it was late turning up!;4
Just returned from an amazing trip to NYC. This hotel is fab. Lovely style and decor and it's very clean. The staff are all very friendly and can't do enough for you. Special mention for Jeff who always had a friendly hello and a smile when we returned from a days exploring. He helped us with our cases on our last day and nothing was too much trouble. He's a credit to the hotel.;5
I've stayed at the Ameritania hotel a handful of times now for work and it has always been fantastic! The location is hard to beat and the staff is always incredibly friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend to anyway who is looking for a place to stay in the area!;5
For the price, you can't go wrong. This is easily one of the best in the area. Everything was excellent, from the room and the cleanliness of the areas, to the attitude of the staff. The location is one of the best qualities.;5
I came to NYC for a vacation and stayed at the Ameritania Hotel for nine nights in augost and then came back for three nights in september. It was my third stay in this lovely hotel.  The staff in this hotel is superb! They are welcoming and professional, especially Gina and Yulia. the staff makes the guest feel comfortable and at home.Check-in / Check-out fast and efficient. At check-in they gave me a room upgrade and i got to stay in an amazing room. a perfect start for a fantastic vacation.  I love that the rooms have closet space and a modern shower. comfortable beds.  It is a very nice hotel in a great midtown location, very close to central park and the upper west side. lots of subway lines that make it very easy to get around the city. and also great for those who like to;5
Stayed 5 nights at the Americana room was comfortable clean  great location 5 mins from Times Square staff were all very pleasant doorman Jeff  Vlad on reception n Gina would definently stay there again;4
My partner and I have just returned from New York and we stayed in this hotel. You have to expect some noise being on probably the busiest Street in the world. However we were not disturbed by the noise from the street. This hotel was modern, clean and well presented. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would return in the future. it was a complete bargain to be honest.;5
Had a great stay at the Ameritania.  Front desk helped us by providing two Q rooms bc they had overbooked.  Worked to our advantage since we had four women and needed the two bathrooms! Bellmen were friendly and helpful with directions and car services.  Only issue we had was the power popped off when tv, lights and hair dryer were going but switched on within ten minutes.  Great location to all our ventures.  Would definitely stay there again. Shout out to Emily for helping us!;5
Everything was great. We were checked-in by Janet, who upgraded us to a bigger room (we were staying for 10 days with a 4 y.old). Also, thank you Jeff for the tips on where to eat. Housekeeping was also great, Walking distance to times square and Central Park.;5
We spent 2 nights at the Ameritranian NY, 54th & Broadway. With classie rooms & a shower to fit the family in, you could hardly want for a better location. Central Park, Times Square & a host of theatres & places to eat on the door step, it's a great place to stay.  I would definitely recommend it.;5
Just came home after staying a week here. Lovely hotel and the beds were so comfy! Just what you needed after walking around New York all day. Stayed in a family room, it was lovely and a good size.  Wifi was only available in the lobby, if you wanted it in your room you would need to pay. Also a lovely range of things in the minibar, but do not touch as they are so expensive! Only let down was the room service. It just seemed a bit sloppy, room was not hovered and cups were not replaced daily. However I would definitely recommend and stay here again.;4
Brilliant hotel for a visit to New York.The room was very spacious and clean. Great location with Times Square only a five minute walk away. If you needed anything frank the doorman was there to help out.;5
. Would highly recommend this hotel it is in a great location just off times square, the room was lovely with 2 large comfortable double beds and the staff were pleasant and helpful. Would definitely return .;5
Ok - warning the pictures they show do not represent all their rooms! We had to start with room 920 which was little more than a noisy cupboard! The noise off all the aircon units reverberated up through the middle section so even if you turned your own noisy unit off you heard everyone else's! You could also touch all walls from the bed!! After complaining we got a free upgrade to Queen on level 12, massive difference hence the mixed review. Larger room and bathroom, office desk and fridge, huge improvement!!! Even a quiet aircon unit and as it looked over the street no one else's aircon noise either. There is no free internet in the room which is a pain however the hotel is perfectly situated for Central Park and Times Square. There is discounted parking across the road and;3
Enjoyed an amazing trip to New York, staying at The Ameritania. Easy walking distance Times Square, Broadway theatres and Central Park. Plenty of good places to eat nearby. Used nearby subway at 50th Street to access lower Manhatten. Staff very friendly and helpful, especially doorman Jeff.;5
Complimentary champagne on arrival for our 25th Anniversary was very much appreciated. Lovely surprise. Perfect location for all attractions. Loved our stay,  Will certainly be returning soon. Highly recommended x;5
Went down the street to see if we could get a better value, but it didn't work out so well. Don't stay in a room below the 5th floor. These are dungeon rooms with nice views of the HVAC. $10/day for Internet. TV doesn't work properly. 50/50 shot if you order food will they show up.;2
I have been to this hotel for 2 years in a row now because the staff are so friendly and can not do enough for you!!! We had a problem the third party company who we went through booked us a single room instead of a twin rooms but the receptionists were so helpful and had us moved! The hotel is always kept to a high standard and make your visit so much better! Also from the third party company we booked with didn't arrange our transfer so they didn't pick us up from hotel but Mourad helped to arrange this! Great facilities and the location well you can't get no better!!;5
An amazing stay at this lovely hotel for my daughters wedding in Central Park.  The staff were excellent, particularly Emily Nicholls.  Nothing was too much trouble and all major attractions are fairly close by.  I will definitely return.;5
We selected this hotel for its close proximity to both Cemtral Park (Wedding Venue) and Times Square.  The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful and friendly, we were made to feel welcome from arrival to departure and the staff were happy to advise on local restaurants and attractions.  Particular mention to Emily Nicholls who was excellent in looking after my family.  This is a fantastic hotel and allows easy access to all the major New York attractions.  I would definitely return.  Slight noise at night but then again you are st the heart of the city that never sleeps so it is not really a complaint;5
Good facilities, modern and beautiful rooms, and good service of all staff. And an extraordinary location between Times Square and Central Park. One suggestion: The beds a too soft. In my opinion it would be harder improvement mattresses;4
