small rooms and upon looking over the room a huge cockroach flew out of the bathroom i didnt want to go downstairs empty handed so i attempted to find it by looking under the curtains and saw a previous guests toothbrush went back downstairs and was given another room needless to say i didnt sleep much that night and left very early the next morning theyre currently checking the temperature of all visitors to before entering this is known useless i wouldnt be surprised if some higherups cousin sold them those things i suppose they may turn away 1 or 2 people over the pandemic but a temperature check doesnt catch the people who are asymptomatic or are building up i guess its pandemic theater and thank you for wasting my time waiting in line every time i went back;2

the hotel itself is beautiful and in a great location however filled with staff that you are just a name and number to they have no interest in actually helping or making you feel welcome also room not ready at guaranteed check in time with no late check out or upgrade to make up for this essentially paying for a room from a certain time and then not being allowed in it rooms are extremely small for what you are paying yes it is new york but ive stayed at plenty other hotels that do value you having a comfortable stay with a bit more space in this crowded and busy city beds were nice but quite small but then again they have to be for the small little rooms nice lobby and great bar generally good environment but dont come here if you expect a smile and hello;2
we stayed at the empire in january 2017 we got an excellent rate about 1000 for four nights in a small junior suite we wanted proximity to the metropolitan opera and the empire is very close easy walking distance and much closer than any other i know of but as to amenities the hotel is woefully lacking the room number on our telephone did not match the number on the door for example if we wanted something from the front desk we had to go down and wait in line only once out of a dozen times did the front desk attendant answer a call from the room the two rooms were disappointingly dark we needed an additional floor lamp just to read the newspaper the bathroom sink was about 15 inches deep so water splatters easily the tub shower has a glass wall covering;2
hotel rate was high parking was high parking cost only good until 6pm park across the street universal hollywood closes at 6pm if you do not leave before 6pm hotel charges an additional 12 for 1 additional hour so they know you are going to probably not leave early because the cost of the park is really expensive also so they make even more money off a person i was disappointed and will not stay at this property again;2
good side good location friendly bellmen bad side the management are cheap you can tell by the hidden costs like the resort fee what is so resort about this place the free breakfast is cold coffee often out there is a chargeable room service breakfast you can order from a menu with no prices the staff are clearly underpaid we were told without tips and side hussels most of the staff could not afford to eat on check in i was given orders not to use any food delivery service they would reject it but i could use the overpriced service they get a kick back on and i was given a card 50 minimum delivery fee i also had initially about 8 disclaimers and waivers because they get alot of credit card disputes i was also warned not to miss check out time by even a;2
the location was great ill give it that right next to the subway in a safe neighborhood but the hotel itself was very disappointing we didnt mind that the room was shabby after all it was inexpensive by nyc standards but we did mind that 1 the beds were very uncomfortable and awfully small for queen size 2 wifi didnt work in the rooms you had to go down to the lobby and compete with all the other guests for plugs in order to use it 3 we had to ask 4 times before we succeeded in getting a dead lightbulb replaced 4 we had to ask repeatedly to get 3 washrags and handtowels for the three of us getting first just 2 then just 1 then none at all on successive days the front desk always sounded like theyd get right on it no problem but nothing;2
2 main problems i stayed there for 3 nights this early march firstly the day time receptionist lady is extremely unprofessional unfriendly and unapproachable secondly there are some pipes problems which is noisy enough to wake me up at 6am in the morning i stayed in room 210 then when i requested a room change the receptionist refused to change the room for me and stated that due to the hotel building is very old every room would have the same problems so clearly she already knew about the problem but despite there are other liveable rooms available she chose to give me that room it is until she was off and i spoke to the night time staff that they are able to change my room to room 1004 which turned out to be a perfectly fine room without any pipes problems;2
we had a very bad experience with the owner of the company our toilet flooded early one morning we called the front desk immediately the owner came barging into the room and began screaming that we flooded the toilet well i do not think that we want to spend time flooding a toilet at a hotel for kicks sarcasm however i wrote a letter to the executive offices but received no response or acknowledgement from our treatment i am only giving it two stars because the staff was absolutely amazing kudos for the staff that made the rest of our stay more bearable otherwise we would have truly switched hotels;2
the hotel is a few minutes walk from central park lincoln center subway access and more which is awesome starbucks and walgreens are right next door however i have never had worse service in my life and ive traveled a lot across many countries my family had 3 separate rooms and since they have no ice machines we all called more than 5 times and never received ice they told us before coming that there was an inroom fridge and coffee theres a keurig and pods but we had no cups and never any cream sugar or stir sticks 2 days in a row our room was not made up even after telling them after the first day 1 day my sisters room wasnt as well as my parents the gym was being renovated the entire time and they had passes to a gym but since i have little;2

the first room was full of smoke which came from a smokefilled hallway laiden with dirt stains and pieces of trash we immediately came downstairs and described the problem to someone at the front desk explaining that the smoke seemed to be coming intensely from one room she said âwe of course canât disturb our guestsââin other words we canât really help you i asked for the front desk manager but he wasnât available so i requested that he visit us at the restaurant a few feet away he never appeared when we returned to the front desk and finally did manage to speak with him he didnât apologize he moved us to another room on a different floor our experience was like that of a cheap vegas hotel;2

we booked this hotel as it seemed pretty central and large rooms firstly i would like to point out that this hotel has no bell boyconciergeporter call it what you like they were non existent which means your responsible for your luggage so if you are unable or unwilling to take your luggage to your room it will stay in reception the first room we were given was very spacious but very dated the bed was on a metal base and would squeak every twist and turn and the lights where difficult to turn on or off and would occasionally flicker when i explored this it led me to a hole in the wall behind my bed that the light fitting was plugged into not too safe with a metal bed base i thought i then looked at other safety issues to find that there was no sprinklers in the rooms;2

the room maintenance was poor the coffee supplies were never replaced the shower design wets or damps the bathroom floor the plumbing was defective the toilet got clogged twice and we never threw anything but toilet paper in it the furniture was poor there wasnt a proper closet or wardrobe when you are charged more than four hundred dollars a day you expect something at least regular the best of the hotel is its location the room was under average if furniture is considered besides amenities and supply of coffee and sugar were poor or inexistent the doormen are very friendly i think the best personnel in this hotel the internet connection is a rip off you cannot charge your clients ten dollars a day per device when most of hotels are offering free high quality;2

of all of the hotels in nyc i would stay somewhere else the room we were in was very small the ceiling in the hallway is maybe 7 tall but seemed lower and the hallway to our room was narrow with a lot of turns valet was quick the location is ok depending on what you are in the area for and where you need to go walking to times square for example is approximately a 20 minute walk the restaurant downstairs of the hotel is great and very busy at least when i was there;2
spent two nights here over thanksgiving we chose the hotel because it is about three blocks from the apartments where wed be spending most of our time with family we are native new yorkers and while other visitors may appreciate the relatively quiet residential upper west side location it helps to know your way around manhattan if you plan to stay in the neighborhood the room was small but relatively tidy the bed was fine the bathroom was clean those are the pluses the minuses were many the reception area was criminally understaffed especially for a hightraffic holiday weekend it took forever to check in the computer system was balky the vibe not very welcoming there were quite a few foreign guests with limited english and the few staff members were not;2

the only good thing is the front desk people and the subway nearby the hotel smells weed and cigarettes and the lobby and the elevators are dirty the room was clean but everything in it is too old the tv has a few chanals with a poor quality the bad was very uncomfortable the bathtub need to be repared it gets stuck all the time we must wating for 15 to 20 minutes after putting the water on to have a hot water for a shower and in the bathroom was too much cold the heating makes a terrible noise so you cannot sleep when it is on so i realy do not recommend this hotel;2

i booked this hotel without checking the reviews first so after reading all the negative reviews i was dreading the worst to be honest it wasnt as bad as i thought it would of been the best compliment i could give it was that it was clean we had a room on the 5th floor no views just looking out onto other rooms we never got any daylight whenever we were in the room the lamps had to be on the room was small but the bathroom was adequate and no mould as had been described in previous reviews my biggest problem was with the noise from the air conditioning units from outside the windows in the quiet of the night it seems very loud the pool was closed whilst i was there no notices or apologies from anywhere and the bar on the rooftop did not belong to the hotel good;2

i was coming back from a buisness trip in texas and decided to stay in new york for 2 nights for some traveling unfortunately either due to the hurricane or holiday season most of the hotels were either fully booked or very expensive this seemed like the only decent option based on tripadvisor reviews for 150 a night i am a young guy and ive been in the army spending about a month sleeping in a tent in the middle of the desert so i guessed nothing can be that bad right as i arrived in the hotel i was given room 338 the elevator was broken so it was either having the staff carrying my bad upstairs or taking it myself i knew the room was going to be small but never thought it would be that small my room was close to the bathroom and the shower so each time;2

chose mainly for location next to lincoln center where my daughter was graduating from nyu the only good thing about it was location we arrived at 11 am knowing that checkin was not until 3 pm but when making reservations they said they would accommodate an early checkin if they could we had asked as we needed to change before going to lincoln center at 2 pm and preferred not to change in a restroom they also said that they could not provide any other area for changing after lunch we came back and checked again at 1 pm they said nothing was available and that since they had upgraded us to a larger suite our room might take longer to clean i asked to be downgraded if it woulds be quicker but they said they could not accommodate our request finally at about;2

my husband and i went to new york for our honeymoon in april 05 for a week we chose this hotel as the photos in the brochure looked lovely and it was reasonably priced however we now wish wed paid a bit more and stayed somewhere else we arrived at the hotel and it was rather run down and tatty our first room no 109 was tiny we thought ok we wont be here much but when we ventured into the bathroom we found a large brown puddle in the middle of the floor which was formed from a dripping in the ceiling above round the light fitting needless to say my husband called reception straight away and explained the situation and we asked to be moved to another room which we did i know this is a pretty cheap hotel but i would not expect to be faced with this no matter;2
the hotel is convenient and comfortable nice lobby spacious modern rooms unfortunately something was wrong with housekeeping and i was not able to get a room until 830pm not so good when checkin is supposed to be at 400pm many other guests had the same issue as we waited in the lobby the staff were sympathetic but never explained why too bad because the hotel itself is very nice and a decent value for the price as a busy traveler this inconvenience makes me unwilling to try this hotel again;2

we stayed 5 nights at the empire hotel and on our first night our room was right next to the elevator which was quite noisy the room was also shaped in a triangle and it was not only very very small but because of the room shape we could barely open our suitcases the next morning we asked reception if we could move to another room mainly due to the elevator noise reception advised they did not have another room however when we pushed the matter they eventually found us another room to move to we were moved to another room which was also very small but at least in a square shape and not next door to the elevator the hotel is in a very good location however the reception staff are not very friendly and as described the rooms are exceptionally small we are normally not very;2

this hotel does have a few nice features great location nice lobby2nd floor lounge area and lovely loccitane bath products unfortunately the negatives outweighed the positives during my stay the very narrow hallways with dark wallpaper were offputting from the start i was not expecting a large room but was suprised to find such a small room with such minimal space surrounding the bed although the tv was nice i wouldve preferred a desk upon which i could do my work a leisure traveler might not have any problems with this but between the lamp tv and tray of items for purchase on the small desk i had no room to work on my small laptop the brick wall view only emphasized the small dark cramped feeling of the room in addition the bathroom was not well;2

i stayed in this hotel with my friend for 5 nights this accommodation has the perfect location lot of landmarks are a walk distance the problem is that thereâs absolutely no service first of all the night when we arrived saturday we had to wait almost 1 hour to be checked in because there was only one agent at the front desk checkin itself were not informative at all no explanation about services offered facilities restaurants nothing bellmen were not available neither room are small but clean and with a nice view thereâs no fridge bathroom very small at the checkout they charge you with additional fees for they stay and for keeping your luggage in the bellman room overall this is a good hotel but from a 4star hotel i expected a higher level of service;2

the lobby was beautiful exactly what i was envisioning my room however was the epitome of what youd think of for the set of a new netflix series on hotel murders it was obvious the room was previously a closet or small staff space of some sort and had been renovated to a guest room it was a total dump smallest ever college dorm minifridge sitting on the floor next to the bed a chronicles of narnia style wardrobe in the corner leaning forward as if it might fall over at any minute needless to say i dont foresee myself staying here again;2

this hotel has one great selling point the location but the service is atrocious i am not the kind of person who complains in a review but this was too much 1 i reserved a junior suite because i need a bath tub for two nights paid in full in advance city views on arrival the front desk said standard queen right they also said you have it all left to pay untrue i was exhausted after a long haul flight and did not really take in what the difference was unpacked and realized no tub usual tiny cramped new york hotel room with a view of a sheer wall of bricks wrong room i was too tired to pack everything again and change but when i pointed the error in the morning they said the rate was nonrefundable so i moved to the junior suite 2 what hotels in 2017;2

my boyfriend and i stayed here for two nights and were not really expecting much as its a days inn it certainly didnt deliver we went on a search for vending machines the first night and learned that there are only three in the entire 13floor building and all were on separate floors each floor had its own distinct odor none of which were pleasant and all of which were cigarette based we moved as quickly as possible whenever we had to come or go the first morning i got up and found that we had no hot water my boyfriend later saw that there were two master control knobs beside the toilet that controlled the hotcold mix but even after adjusting those it was next to impossible to control the temperature while showeringit would fluctuate every 30 seconds or so;2
i suppose you need to know your own limits saving money and an interesting location might make up for a sadly worn property saved from being truly terrible by an accommodating and goodnatured staff it is clean your bed will be comfortable but the heating may go the cable tv is likely to be out and if you are past your youth hostel days you may find the level of discomfort not worth the savings if your young and buoyant and have a reason to be on the upper west side by all means try your luck;2

we stayed five days in this hotel and even though the room was clean and it didnt matter to us that the room was quite small the motor of the airconditioning was so loud that we could hear it from the hallway and it could wake you in your sleep our only window looked out to another building in a way that the curtainthing wasnt even long enough for us not to be looking into the windows across but these things didnt really bother us the reason why we are writing this review is because when we left a cellphone in the room on the last day housekeeping took it although the hotel never admitted to this even though we phoned the same day we checked out they said they found nothing and we also left a bottle of rum in the room and they did not even mention that furthermore;2

disappointed luckily we stayed only for one night on our way to washington dc by train the location was good near penn station though but like often near stations you can expect smell of weed everywhere very crowded and fuzzy in the lobby since there was some kind of youth happening nearby the room was outdated to say the least and very small you could almost hit the toilet seat closing the door the bed was not very comfortable the window was small and the view was the opposite brick wall sorry but cannot recommend this hotel;2
we picked this property because it is so close to penn station and that is a nice advantage but it doesnt offset the fact that this is a very outdated property with teeny tiny rooms our room literally felt like a closet we could barely get around each other in the space around the bed we were only in town for one night and were so busy all day that we barely had time to be in the room except for sleeping so it turned out to be fine but if we were there for even one additional day we would not have been able to take it and even for one night wed never book here again wed rather have a short cab ride and stay in a nice place going forward;2

very intriguing place considering its very unique architecture design as well as its history loved the neighborhood meat packing district at the base of the high line close to good food cute neighborhoods to walk through fun intellectual and physical activities of various kinds felt like a safe neighborhood i recommend a captains room based on what i have heard from other guests dont stay here if you suffer from claustrophobia the living spaces are really small and cramped we stayed in one of the tiny bunk rooms waaaayyyyy too hot wo any way to control it only one tiny window opening to a courtyard whose design allowed almost zero air movement and ac could not keep up never able to bring the room below 79f shared bath was just fine;2
this is technically a hyatt property but is the worst hyatt ive ever stayed at for starters theres zero parking available they direct you to park in an airport parking structure next to the hotel but theres no special rate for hotel guests then i check into my room and it smells like cigarette smoke the rest of the room was fine but that doesnt really matter when your room reeks finally upon checking out and receiving my bill i was charged for some sort of unlimited liquor offer that i hadnt purchased overall it feels like they take advantage of people who want to stay near the airport and are used to the hyatt brandquality you will not receive any of it and are better off staying at a cheaper property;2
lets dispense with the obvious the empire hotel has a sensational location being just across the street from lincoln center if thats where you are spending your entertainment dollars and the rooms are nicely decorated as is the lobby and its surroundings so whats wrong a lot to begin with we arrived at checkin time to find that the king bed room we had reserved could be had only on the smoking floor a smoking floorimagine that and we took it because the alternatives were two double beds or wait i tried setting up my internet had trouble and had to run back and forth between the desk and the corded phone on the other side of the room to catch the instructions on the nightstand with the phone i found a small bottle of fiji water with a hotelattached label;2

we chose this hotel for location only as we were meeting family in the area it is a basic hotel which we were aware of but it was very drab and tired looking in the bedroom corridors lots of stains and old decor and not as clean as i would like the first bedroom was reeking of tobacco even though we requested non smoking our request for another room was dealt with promptly without any hassle this was adequate with a good shower and a comfy bed so we stayed noisy at night though with a bar opposite the hotel we did have to ask for towels as there were none the elevators also have a strange smell marijuana maybe not a hotel i would recommend with children the positives are helpful staff a nice lobby good eating places nearby also close to central park;2

i have stayed at the empire hotel at least 1215 times over the last 6 years and generally the experience has been pleasant and positive this trip however was awful in short a combination of issues with the reservation team prior to arrival the inroom dining staff upon arrival and the night manager on duty during the stay culminated in a poor stay overall longer version 1 prior to arrival the reservation team i had to call 3 times as they had lost the reservation john the gm did call me and take care of this and that was greatly appreciated 2 once we checked in in the evening i called to order room service at approx 950pm and was told they closed at 10pm and therefore we unwilling to provide inroom dining had i called after 10pm i could understand;2
we had a room facing into the inner courtyard and at around 6am there was a lot of noise coming from here men shouting banging and crashing could hear beer kegs being moved around this woke us up and i use ear plugs as we checked out we said this to the reception staff and they were very dismissive and said it was nothing to do with them we asked about the good nights sleep guarantee and she said as it wasnt their fault and it was the morning d therefore not the night the guarantee doesnt apply she was very defensive and borderline aggressive the one thing she said was you should have asked for a quiet room when you checked in we have some quiet rooms we are not the sort of people to complain and have never left a negative review of a hotel but we feel we have;2
i am shocked that this hotel could have so many favorable reviews on tripadvisor the hotel prides itself on its art deco architecture but that just means that your bathroom hasnt been renovated since the 1920s the rooms are extremely small ive been in larger rooms in europe case in point i had about 10 inches between the edge of the bed and the media console as i said before the bathroom is extremely small with chipping tiles and almost no counter space we had a ledge of about 4 deep to store toiletries yes the location is convenient but expect more noise as a result but this is nearly unavoidable in nyc and panhandlers in the lobby we also didnt appreciate hassle with having your hotel card looked at every time you enter since there are no card readers in;2

i treated my girlfriend for her 40th a trip to new york wanted to go somewhere iconic to nyc and had been told the new yorker is the place to go due to the location and history the stay was fun and we enjoyed it what i cannot believe is that the deposit they took wasnt held but actually took the payment and not returned i have emailed loads of times and tried calling nothing the payment of over 260 euros has been taken on the 15th november we stayed for 5 nights promised it would be returned within 10 business days yet no sign of it right before christmas too so thanks for that a nice trip tarnished by a lack of customer care i guess once you got the money it doesnt matter right;2

the rooms themselves were fine the hotel is fine its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area but the rooms are very small which i know isnt that wild of a thing in new york city but its not ideal as i was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it the bed took up half of the room which again i understand and its fine not ideal but fine my main issue and why im giving such a low rating is that when i booked my room well in advance in august i booked it for 2 people i wasnt sure if my friend could come with me so i didnt add her name to reservation that shouldnt have mattered but when i added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date;2

stayed her for an event in london with some friends upon arrival in the room we noticed an awful smell that was like something decomposing in the room causing us to get out spray to make it some what bearable the first night was bad we were accused of being loud ten mins before we were going to bed only for the accuser to be loud and the night receptionist to bang on every door down the hall as well not mention he was creepy which for female travellers is unsettling the second night wasnt any better as the room to the left of us 333 i believe were loud with banging on god knows what would have reported this but the receptionist didnt appear to understand us when we asked basic questions about amenities such as wifi by the way they charge â£1 per hour of usage;2
please take a look at my last review for this hotel we stayed here again in april 2017 again in a pleasant junior suite the good news at this stay is that wifi was included so my credit card wasnt hacked plus the chambermaids and restaurant staff were all very cordial however the same cannot be said for the hotel managers we had 3 concerns and the 3 managers we spoke to several times were unhelpful rushed us and were not listening did not keep their word or return calls and were obviously passing the buck to the next ones shift 1 in the 3 days that we were there our room keys failed and needed to be replaced 3 times no the keys were not near our cell phones on one of these days due to a power failure the machine that makes these keys wasnt functioning;2
the hotel itself was clean very nice looking in the lobby and the staff was friendly and helpful our biggest issue is that they had us stay in the smallest room of all time it was hard to walk around since it was so small you couldnt close the bathroom door without standing in the shower and then we found out it was about 13 the size of a normal room but they didnt charge any less for it i wont ever come back;2

i cant imagine how anyone would give this hotel 5 stars or even 4 this would be near the bottom of all the places weve stayed in nyc staff was extremely rude at checkin basically yelling at us because the door to the room they initially put us in was broken refusing to move us to another room etc they gave us some free vouchers for continental breakfast at the diner but we regretted using those sometimes free still isnt cheap enough especially in a city like new york where there is so much good food to be had the only real positive is the location very convenient if you are arriving or departing by train the art deco lobby is fine but the upper floors of the hotel look dirty and poorly maintained a 2star hotel masquerading as 4star you can do so;2

first off when we arrived at the hotel there were not any available rooms so we had to wait in the very small lobby when we got to our room it was not bad for the money we paid however they do not use fitted sheets when you wake up in the morning be prepared to find the mattress the only other problem we had with the room was the water if you want to make sure that you will have water take your shower at night or early in the morning anytime between 900 and 1100 in the morning you will not have any water our other problems were with the people who were running the front desk the bellhop was very nice and the security was nice but the front desk people are very rude they will take people in line out of order so it does not really matter if you were there first;2

i booked two nights for my family at the end of a two week holiday and thought that at more than â£200 per room per night it would be a fairly good standard sadly there were lots of things wrong for this to be judged as a quality hotel the initial view is good but the room was dirty in places some lights were missing light bulbs and there was no hair dryer until we called down to ask for one on the final morning i signed the bill at â£460 though initially i was quoted â£435 but room tax get added afterwards so oh well not the hotels fault however i got home to find they took â£580 from my account with no explanation they have your card on file and can charge whatever they want and despite emails there has been o response overall this hotel was average but considering the;2
this is the nastiest hotel i have ever stayed in it is in a wonderful location but thats all it has going for it the carpet is awful and the floor beneath it felt spongy i wouldnt put my bare foot on it the building was a converted apartment house and i shudder to think anyone ever lived in an apt this small the furniture was scratched and looked like it had been purchased at a yard sale or thrift store no comfortable chair to sit on and the deskmake up table had no light the bathroom was small but at least updated their free wifi was pathetic and not working during most of our 2day stay;2
upon arrival the desk clerk was very pleasant and told me she was giving us a room with a viewâ like it was a special favor the room certainly had a view of bright lights that could not be screened out because there were no curtains just two sets of grubby looking mini blinds there also was no heat it was frigid and windy yet the unit in the room was blowing out cold air neither of the two thermostats in the room made a difference at about 1000pm i went down to the desk as no one answered the phone i said the heat wasnât working and they said someone would be up to fix it i took the dog out for a walk and when we returned we remain in the lobby for a time with the rest of my party also staying at the hotel i went back up around midnight and the heat still wasnât;2

i stayed at this hotel because i had business meetings in the neighborhood which i must say is in a very ugly part of la i wont stay here again nor recommend it to anyone this is a hotel that is past its prime the rooms are ugly 80s decor and the furnishings are old and neglected there are scuffs and stains all over the walls i found an old tea bag in the corner under a big splatter mark obviously a previous occupant attempting to throw it in the garbage which went unnoticed by housekeeping the room had a dorm fridge which froze my salad with an old microwave stacked on top of it haphazardly there was also a space heater which we didnt need to use in our room there was a constant loud hum of machinery operating when i called to request a room change;2

my wife and i recently spent a week at the empire hotel and while the location is great and the feel of the interior is modern and hip the facility gave us nothing but problems the first night there the plumbing had some sort of back up nonrelated to our room and created our toilet to over flow with water and some sort of cleaning product that filled up the bathroom floor spilling out into our room the hotel decided to give us another room however it took an entire day to get it upon walking into the new room there was a strong smell of mildew in the air that was completely horrible to endure as i inspected the room i found out that the air conditioner had been leaking condensate water onto the carpet for quite some time and the entire floor along the wall next to the;2

my best friend and i went to ny to celebrate her 30th birthday we chose to stay at the empire hotel because we thought it looked really cute online it was an added bonus that after we booked the hotel we heard that the kardashians stayed there too we booked a standard room with 1 king sized bed because it was almost half the price as a room with 2 queen beds we arrived before checkin so we asked if it would be possible to check in early the woman at the front desk said we could check in early if we upgraded our room which we werent interested in doing at that time she said she would call us if our room was available early we left to walk around and eat lunch but after a few hours no one ever called we came back to the hotel to ask if our room was available;2

this hotel is in a nice location and has a pretty lobby the room was small but typical for new york city it has contemporary decor in the room which at first glance looked fine but our room had an extremely noisy inconsistent heater it had a broken keurig machine and no cups to use with it we stopped at the front desk and they said they would send cups up after waiting awhile i called down to the desk and they told me housekeeping didnât have any there was no hairdryer in the room our friends in another room had a hairdryer which did not work they called the front desk who was supposed to send one up it never came another couple in our party had to change rooms 3 times before they got one where the heater worked iâm sure the filter in our heater was filthy my;2
front door staff and bar staff are the only high quality elements to this hotel dont be fooled by the plush lobby the rooms are stuck in the 70s whilst the rooms are passable for the money you pay there seems to be a distinct lack of care shown to the rooms dusting general maintenance etc there is no free wifi which in this day and age is pretty poor the beds are extremely uncomfortable and the air con has no settings its either freezing or off the roof terrace is excellent as are the bar staff but dont think youll be getting any swimming done i had asked reception staff 3 times prior to arrival to sort and upgrade out for me and my girlfriend for our room given i was proposing sadly this never transpired the location of the hotel allows you to walk to most;2

we have visited this property four times in the past six months and have noticed the service level decline with each visit the club lounge is a joke we watched people arrive during breakfast hours to find food items had been depleted and not refreshed staff seemed oblivious even when manageres walked through they didnt seem to care turndown was requested but not completed we were sitting in the bar area when several employees returned from their break reeking of marijuana the best feature of the hotel is its proximity to lax which is practically right next door the modern redesign of the hotel is also very pleasing but they need to realize they are in a service industry;2
just returned from a week at the new yorker i cant fault the position of the hotel but it is certainly not 4 star advertised as re modernised definitely not we booked a metro room which was supposedly modernised old sink and bath fittings decoration looking shabby and a tv which was supposedly flat screen which came out of the ark the room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel only feet away they have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise when you book on arrival they then sting you for a 40 a night facility fee ontop of your original booking this is for the business centre gym and something else quite random and even if you dont want to use;2

i stayed at the empire hotel simply due to the location it is right across from the lincoln center and very close to columbus circle the best way to describe the hotel is poor room my room was on the 2nd floor with a view of a wall and equipment ie air conditioner etc almost no natural light the bathroom was very small and the shower was very difficult to turn on off and get the temperature right the worst partthere was a clanging noise off and on all of the time woke us up several times a night discussed with the front desk and they said they would look into it it is an obvious issue and the room shouldnt be used service only some towels were replaced one day there were no hand towels at all asked for additional towels but they never;2

as we were desperately looking for a low budget hotel in new york for september 2009 a new york friend told us about the jane it sounded too good to be true a fair price hotel in the west village recently opened and nice looking but small rooms we were able to book a âcabinâ for two persons for 2 weeks arriving at the hotel and seeing our home cabin for the next two weeks we had the attitude of the positive still okay it was a very small room with a view on a blind wall and that airco outside was making a lot of noise but hey we were in new york the first night we were completely wasted from the flight from amsterdam to new york and slept quite early we woke up in the middle of the night because of the noise coming out of the bar of the hotel downstairs music;2

when i decided to stay at the hilton near universal studios i thought i had hit a jackpot it was within walking distance to the park so after spending a long and tiring day i could quickly return to my hotel for some much needed rest what i didnt know is that their halloween horror nights which is a huge annual event every year was opening that night the issue here is that traffic is a nightmare going to and from the hotel with no special accommodations for guests who rent cars and are not attending the evening event streets surrounding the hotel are blocked for buses who are transporting the thousands of people parking in surrounding areas for a drive that should have taken 10 minutes took me over an hour when i brought my concerns to the front desk clerks;2

my partner and i booked 2 nights at this hotel â£58600 2 nights no porters to carry bags so i had to drag a rucksack and 2 cases through a reception full of unhelpful people after a 8 hr flight an transfer we booked a junior suite as it was a birthday treat we was checked in by romeo who assured us the view we would have from our 2nd floor room was amazing natural instinct to check the view the second you get in the room i wish i left the curtains closed the view was of 2 tower blocks of office opposite the hotel no views of central park as this hotel claims the size of the room was totally underrated im 6ft 4 i couldnt fit in the bath and the shower head did not adjust high enough i had to hold the shower attachment to have a shower the finishes are dated and;2
this place has the potential to be awesome great location cool decor and long history sadly it is let down by a number of things when we arrived we were put on level 4 and no sooner had we put our bags down we noticed a strong smell of cigarette smoke coming into our room followed by the smell of cooking this smell continued for some time so i spoke to a staff member who advised me that it was due to permanent residents that reside at the hotel these permanent residents are those that remain from when the jane was used as low cost housing so essentially youre sharing with residents of a boarding house luckily we were immediately offered a new room but had to wait till the following night to stay on a level without any smokers levels 3 and 4 have smokers;2
ok so its new york everything is expensive as is this hotel but firstly the check in desk should people really have to wait 30 mins plus just to get to the reception desk and then be told it was too early to check in so 75 bucks or else not prepared to wait another 30 mins later in the day i stump up looking forward to the room with the view of the hudson river or the empire state building that i paid for i get scaffold and the building next door so later on i go down an complain apparently it has been the bain of their life this year people being promised such rooms dont advertise them on you websit then so no room available that night but pack up everything in the morning and the cases will be in the room when you get back at 600 we get back at;2

we love this location and have stayed here dozens of times over the last 10 years but this hotel is getting really tired this trip our air conditioner didnât work and after being told multiple times someone woild come look at it they didnt instead they brought us a fan the room was close to 80 degrees all night and it took multiple calls the next day to get it looked at the place was booked so they couldnt move us to another room they finally sent a tech to fix it and while it did kick on we still couldnt get the room below 73 degrees to sleep the staff is friendly and has good intentions but we will not stay here again the pillows were lumpy and tired the window literally fell entirely off the hinges when we opened it this place could use a big dose of tlc;2
we stayed in this hotel two nights just before christmas we had booked junior suite with double beds since we traveled with a child the first room on the 4th floor we ended up changing the room was one long rectangle very dark with windows facing small inner courtyard while we had these windows even with the curtains open you couldnt tell if it was day or night there was not too much light coming through them due to the opposite brick wall the room was quite hot to sleep in and even with the ac running the temperature didnt change too much the real problem with this room was the constant humming noise that came from some sort of heating units positioned outside my husband checked the noise level with an iphone app and it was 55 decibel inside our room throughout;2
we stayed 9 nights in this hotel ill start with whats good about the hotel but do read to the end for the cons 1 the hotel lobby is grand and gives a great first impression 2 if you love history this hotel is full of historical moments 3 it is a 5 second walk from the restaurant to the entrance of the ace penn station subway 4 it is a 20min walk to time square chelsea empire state building 5 the rooms are sufficiently large we had two queen size beds and enough space for 8 pieces of luggage the air con is good the wifi is stable i did an afternoon of work in the hotel 6 the gym is decent with 4 treadmills dumbbells goes up to only 50lb so for those who train with heavier it might be a problem however there are the standard machines but no racks;2
we chose this hotel because we were flying out of lax the next day so we only stayed here for one night our first room was disgusting with stains all over the carpet couch and counters we called and they said the hotel was sold out for the night but somehow were still able to move us to a new room not really sure how that works the new room was better but the counters were still dirty with coffee stains and other marks it just seemed like they came in to switch the sheets hopefully and that was it for cleaning it seemed like the rooms were updated recently but get a lot of use and housekeeping isnt able to keep up we would definitely pick a new hotel if in the area again pros close to airport 247 shuttle starbucks coffee in room big tv cons very dirty;2
we visited new york and had 4 rooms in this hotel location is amazing the team not so good maybe 2 people knew what they were doingsaying they kept charging our cards without a reason and kept blaming the system the money came back to our account but only when we left new york i will not recommend or come back to this hotel i kept solving problems more than enjoying my stay;2
spent a week at this hotel great location but tired building and tired staff my card did not work to get in there was a lot of noise that travelled well into my space my room was not cleaned one of the days waited for 15 hrs to get a fresh towel after 3 phone calls and a visit to the lobby the following day another traveler walked into my room as he was assigned the room i was in i was just out of the shower and naked at the time so a tad inconvenient i needed to use the business office but my key did not work had to wait for 15 mins in line to get my key authorization to the business center when i went in the computers were antiquated and the printers did not work i left and came back later but they had no paper to print i reported it and after an hour i;2

was on the main floor of a 3 day stay room was tidy and mostly clean great cable tv with flat screen thought it was odd that the touch up paint didnt match the finishing paint was disgusted that there were cobwebs on the ceiling considering that was so easy to clean didnt appreciate the fluctuation between hot and cold while trying to have a shower there was zero climate control the walls are thin and its very loud when we put the sign on that we didnt want housekeeping they came in any way to clean which i think is disrespectful since we arent messy people to begin with will we stay here again not a chance thanks for reading;2

first the selfparking was confusing no signs outside to say parking for hyatt regency circled building 3x before some finally confirmed it was the right building to park in second why not use your room key for in and out parking privileges instead of going to valet to get a second ticket third no microwave in each room no matter what size of the room for a hotel of this magnitude not okay couldnt heat up leftovers or pop popcorn to watch a movie fourth compact fridge was a joke get a real compact fridge for the rooms the hotel brings in enough money to fix these issues;2
my expectations were not high after reading the reviews but still i was disappointed when i saw the room the room was really small even smaller than rooms in europe hotels looked sad and needed some maintenance moreover the bedclothes were stained however the hotel is close from 2 subway stations and from central park the floor was quiet and there was always hot water it was clean and looked bugs free so overall it was alright you just have to realize the hotel is like a private bedroom and bathroom hostel hotel in nyc are super expensive so morningside inn is still a reasonnably good option;2
standard room was small and nothing like the images on their website not unexpected booked the room on bookingcom for a better rate so it didnt totally suck i told them i might call back after checkout in the morning and extend my day but when i did the manager refused to honor what the morning staff had said because i did not get their name i told him that i was sure he knew who had worked that morning but he would not budge lights out around the bathroom mirror making hard to shave bath fan sounded like a jet plane clothing hanger falling off wall on one side air vents not fully secured room thermostat heater blew out cold are but the space heater worked;2

i have stayed here twice the first time was alright a large room relatively clean but the place was terribly noisy this time however we were in a shoebox that was far too small for two people and made intolerable by the warm weather â there was no fan and no air con obviously so we had to leave the window open all night therefore exposing ourselves to the gobshite neighbours ear plugs proved unsatisfactory the bed was so soft that every time i moved i woke my partner up and the bathroom was so small that you actually had to squeeze past the sink just to sit down on the toilet if youâre overweight you might actually seriously struggle iâm not joking by the way the place is very noisy too doors are slammed shut with little thought to residents the walls are rice;2
the hotel lobby is absolutely underwhelming a circus show with the feeling of a dilapidated theme park arduous checkin process this place is stuck in a freeze frame of 20 years ago but with wear and tear accelerated carpet is threadbare and im shocked at how the fabric on the headboards is greasy and worn out the fact this is a 4star hotel may be the biggest jokes on the internet many hotels in nyc get away with murder so to speak theres nothing about this hotel that is 4star its a solid 23 star it is also very loud in the hallway anyone walking by or talking in the hallway sounds like they are in the same room as you they charge to hold your bag where other hotels do this for free the internet is not good excellent location but thats about it;2

hotel seems nice but once in the room the true colors show rooms are dark even with every light on rooms are dirty maids only hopefully give new towels and hardly make the bed they dont vacuum the room at all dust bunnies all over the floor and under the bed walls are thin you hear everything and everyone and yes you will hear other people being intimate when a neighbor turns on their shower or flushes their toilet you think someone was in your bathroom another issue is the wifi has connection issues and was spotty at best the only convenience for this hotel is the 710 minute walk to universal studios but there really is not dedicated path to the main street expecially at night where there is hardly any lighting and people flying up and down the hotel driveway;2

i am going to start off by stating the good things about the hotel the hotelâs location is fantastic if you are staying in the city after an event at madison square garden this is steps away and is the place to stay the staff is very friendly the hotel is very clean now the bad the âfacilities feeâ is obscene and misleading to charge almost 40 a day for the use of a gym that most people are not going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong i expected more from a wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee in spite of paying the âfacilities feeâ there wasnât even a coffee maker in the room come on even when you stay at motel 6 there is a coffee maker in the room the room;2

the hotel is very old and quite interesting there are renovated rooms but we stayed in an older room the beds were super comfy the view was of the empire state building the bathroom was tiny as was the closet but at least there was an ironing board and iron one floor length mirror was helpful for getting ready to go out the diner downstairs was open 247 but the food was mediocre the bar and restaurant off of the lobby wasnt ever too busy with super cheap drinks in our opinion there was work being done right next door to our room so it was quite noisy for several hours but not too bothersome if you must wait for your friends in the hotel lobby it was always super busy without a spot to sit at all so we waiting outside as the weather was nice;2

kind of a unique location on the upper upper west side although not centrally located its proximate to great sections of the park and subway lines the staff was helpful with requests iron deli locations etc the halls were threadbare with crumbling plaster and chipped paint and the room was the darkest and most claustrophobic ive encountered in my 30 years of living in and now visiting manhattan it seemed more like a 150 hostel slot than a 350 economy room tub was repaired with some sort of epoxy that had raised and blackened into an organic looking form but the room was otherwise reasonably clean im sure a cp view room in the front would have proved to be a better experience than our airshaft portal but this was by far the worst 300 400 room we have had;2

this hostel has pros and cons the pros are booking in and early check in is very straight forward it was also the perfect location for where i needed to be in west london and 25min tube into the centre the price is also very reasonable the cons are it is not clean when they do clean it is between 78 in the morning when most people are trying to use the facilities it looked like under my bed and the fridge in my room hadnt been touched for weeks the water runs lookwarm in all the taps and shower areas not ideal for brushing your teeth or wanting a hot shower the female showers were then out of use for the last two nights of my stay with no clear signage to another one and lastly there is no hooks in the shower area in or outside the cubicles for you to hang;2

the best part about this hotel is the location close to central park columbus circle subway museums etc the lobby and the bar look great and you will be forced to spend time here because wifi is only free here and not in the rooms an thats the good news over the first room into which we were sent was a disgrace by anybodys standards firstly it was on a smoking floor secondly a minature yorkshire terrier would be too big for this room and finally the shower sprays water all over the bathroom and basically floods the place when i called to complain about these things among others i got the most frustrating responses from the front desk its not a smoking floor its a smoking optional floor what is that supposed to mean its a european style;2
the closeness to the theme park is great however when we went early jan 2017 the lobby was under renovation and the elevator wait time was comicalâ¦510min at times and when one finally showed it was crowded to the point you couldnt get on sometimes we went to breakfast our last day and came back around 930am and our key cards didnt work checkout is 11am we would have went down to get the key cards rescanned butyou knowthe elevators we waited 10min for someone to come let us in our parking key card for selfparking didnt work one daywhich wasnt too big of a deal but we had to stop by the front deskagain you have to pay for parking each day wifi was not free unless you signed up for their hilton reward program the tv signali;2
i really disliked this hotel the rooms are dark not for atmosphere just unpleasant the room is very small reminiscent of chickens in a cage where they cant stretch their legs the shower can only be turned on and regulated by standing directly under the water i asked for someone from room service to show me how his head got wet too the cleaning lady left no soap one day everything is extra there is a coffee maker in the room but you have to pay for using it the wifi for the room costs ten dollars a day you have to pay for the computer in the lobby to print a boarding pass the keys dont work so in 4 days i had to come back down and stand in line 3 times at reception because i was locked out of the room the staff from housekeeping to reception;2
we were not told the pool level was closed indefinitely the deluxe double room had no room to swing a cat enough wardrobe space to hang 7 items for four people only 2 internet devices per room even though we booked for 3 people drinks prices were disgusting9 for a average beer concierge woman had a lousy attitude air conditioning was rubbish the only good thing about this facade of a hotel was the location which was fabulous;2
we stayed for two days on the fourth floor in the midst of our stay we came across several things 1our floor slanted at a 10 degree angle which made my children scared 2a giant pile of dog turds on our windowsill 3cracking floors in the bathroom 4no room in the rooms whatsoever overall the best thing was the location mainly because it was close to subways and central park if you are a neat freak do not stay here;2
uh so if i had been actually planning on spending any time in this room i would have been extremely disappointed and likely requested a refund it was just me and i meanthe shower worked the door locked and the bed was alright but my room was extremely rundown and a little bit scary to be honest if a couple booked into this hotel and expected a romantic getaway or something theyd likely just be trying to getaway from this room entirely yikes the staff were nice and polite though its not their fault this place just needs a massive overhaul but locationwise it cant be beat so why would they fix it up yknow;2

i booked this hotel as it looked nice on the pictures seemed good value for money and looked like it was a good central location for visiting la however if i had seen that to park your car it cost 18 tax per night there is no way i would have booked to stay at this hotel the parking cost nearly as much as to stay at the hotel itself when i asked the receptionist if i could park on the street the answer was sometimes you can sometimes you cantwhat sort of answer is that we had never visited america before and had no idea about parking laws as a citizen himself i think he should have been a little more helpful i should have looked into the additional hotel charges before i booked but i never though it would cost so much to park there the hotel is clean;2

spent a long weekend here recently i was in town for a combination of work and pleasure my main and only complaint about this hotel is the level of noise from the rooftop club we stayed on the 9th floor and the music from the club was clearly audible in our room at night perhaps we were directly under the speakers the bass thumped loudly through the ceiling and walls all night on thursday night it ended shortly after 1am so not a major issue for us on friday night however the rooftop club like many nyc clubs is open until 4am we called the front desk twice to see if they could do anything about it they said theyd call the club manager but nothing happened not really surprised by that im certain the club brings in a ton of revenue and that;2

my wife and i stayed here for 4 days in november and whilst there was nothing particulary wrong with the hotel there was also nothing great about it upon arrival we were quickly checked in and sent on our way to our room the main hallways and communal areas were extremely hot and in poor repair once in our room considering it was a king superior it wasnt particulary large and had a view of the ac units out the back of the hotel trying to get the room to a comfortable temperature was a struggle and if you wanted anything like a coffee in your room that was extra the design of the shower wasnt great as it flooded the bathroom however the shouwer itself was the highlight of the room overall if it wasnt for the fact that we were both so exhausted from walking round;2
the ameritania hotel has a very central location on the corner of broadway and w 54th street so if you desire to be very close to times square this is a good choice this area of the city can be extremely crowded in the afternoon and at night due to the proximity of musical theaters and simply because its times square so if you prefer your hotel to be in a calmer area youre better off selecting a hotel in another area of manhattan for instance soho or greewich village the room was nice with a nice bathroom and good beds also they make good cocktails in the hotel lobby bar we even received a little thank you drink on the house one evening after we had enjoyed a few cocktails there what was not a good experience was thw wifi its free in the lobby but;2

pros universal studio theme park is just walking distance from the hotel room and toilet is big and considerably clean cons as iâm a hilton honors member was being prompted to check in and enable the digital key but the digital key function is out of order room is generally dark thereâs no ceiling lights thereâs only 2 side table lights and a standing light upon checkin 2 bottles of water is provided and thatâs it for my 3 nights stay bedroom slippers are not available inside the room have to call housekeeper to request and the wait is about 45 minutes there is no mirror within the room except the toilet so if you are travelling with a wife who needs to put on her makeup be prepared she will need to stay inside the toilet for the longest time;2

easy to find thanks to its roof top sign and check in was smooth was allocated room 1101 on the 11th floor and although very small looked good ac was on when i arrived and it was super loud after a bit of fiddling around with the controls i managed to turn it off but i could still hear ac noise i presumed it was coming from an neighboring room and would stop in due course but it wasnt and it never stopped turns out my room and all rooms on the courtyard side of the hotel are directly above the hotels main ac fans which run 247 see photos and at night the sound is broadly the same as being on an aircraft bring good quality earplugs if you want to sleep;2
this hotel is run down dirty and no better than a 2 star even by nyc standards upon checkin the hotel stated there is a 2999 plus tax 257 per day per room fee for wifi health club and phone calls i do not use any of these services and it was not disclosed via priceline and their fees this seems to be the new scam in nyc hotel circles i have used priceline for 15 years and have spent well over 50000 on their site in in this time after 75 minutes on the phone they were unable to resolve the issue i was willing to purchase more expensive rooms via express deals and provide priceline with the confirmation number and they were unable to help looks like i will never use priceline again;2
from outside this hotel on new yorks upper west side looks every bit the modern sleek place you might expect from the highly respectable and very clean neighbourhood however inside you are greeted with extremely tired decor and service which puts you more in mind of a soviet prison than of a new york hotel the building does not appear to have been designed as a hotel in fact it does not seem to have been designed at all the corridors are tight and claustrophobic with stained white walls which look like an okhrana execution chamber the elevator is old fashioned slow and noisy with a door you have to push then we come to the room i am pleased to say that the sheets had definitely been changed and cleaned which is good as they were the only part of the room;2

and just that i am no stranger to the cost of livingstaying in new york so i understood that for less than 200night this wasnt going to be the ritzcarlton however i did expect a bit more than this hotel delivered upon arrival there was a long line for check in with two employees moving roughly at the speed of molasses i had requested a fridge for my room not included in the room price but available for 25 and was assured that it would be sent up shortly the elevator was very small my suitcases had to be sent up in another elevator because the elevator was not big enough for 2 suitcases and 3 people and moved very slowly i had booked a queen room for my 3 year old son infant daughter and me it was tiny barely enough room to navigate between the bed;2

we stayed here as someone in our family is a fan of a certain series and you would think that the hotel might reflect the show but we were well and truly disappointed a list of things to be aware of 1 front desk staff was surly three interactions two very negative the saving grace was the concierge he was fantastic 2 expect slow elevators 3 the rooms show excessive wear and tear we had two on the same floor so we were able to compare and both showed the need for new paint poorly planned fixture placement which contributed to condition 4 excessive noise yes this is new york so you come to expect the sirens traffic etc but i measured the noise from the air conditioners and other equipment in our room to be between 45 50 dba and this was;2

the location next to the met is excellent but there are many negatives to the hotel this sounds minor but with no coffeemaker in the room one has to get dressed etc just to get the first cup of coffee at that price point wifi should be included but it is 13day with the lincoln center location was hoping this would be a high class experience with maybe operatic or classical music in the background but found instead a poor mix of music in the lobby and too loud the breakfast buffet which we skipped at 26 was the poorest we have seen in a major hotel and doesnt remotely approach some that have many hot entrees instead of just 3 and include items such as lox assortment of cheeses house made pastries etc apparently many people feel the same as the dining room was;2

we too had an issue with booking in we had booked a twin room but were told on arrival that there had been a mistake and they did not have one available they offered us a queen bedroom or the possibility of going to another unseen hotel at no point did the receptionist apologise for their mistake and gave the impression that she was rather annoyed with us about the whole thing after standing our ground for some time they eventually found a room for us on the 7th floor with a double bed and bunkbeds this room was quite big and was cleen but the carpet was wet on one side of the room the internet access in the basement is useful and quick but a bit expensive at 1 for 4 minutes the location is great easy for travel and brilliant if you want to spend time in;2
i stayed at this hotel and really wanted to like it as i am a hyatt globalist and love hyatt brand generally the hyatt hotels are exceptional and the people are extremely friendly and helpful this first concern i had when i entered the lobby iwas there were a lot of southwest airlines crew staying at the hotel i am always concerned when i see an airline known for being cheap staying at the same hotel i am staying i approached the check in desk at 315 and the lady checking me in abruptly said âthe room we have reserved for you isnât ready giving you another roomâ i had selected online check in and a 2 pm arrival with flight delays i arrived at 3 and the room still wasnât ready the desk clerk handed me my keys and offered no additional information i noticed;2

we arrived around 800 pm on may 26th i went to check in while my husband waited in the car apparently during this time a valet had asked him if we were valet parking and my husband wasnt sure what i was going to pay for so a manager came over and informed my husband that he believed self parking was full due to three wedding receptions being held at that time so to go ahead and pay for self parking then if the lot was full we could valet park for a cheaper price well inside i was checking in with the front desk supervisor she was very helpful and upgraded my room for free we booked a 2 bed room but when she found out it was only because the website wouldnt let us book a king room due to my son being 3 she moved us to a corner king room because it had more space;2

for the money which we only paid about 96 a night it was an ok option if i had paid anymore i would have been sorely disappointed the room was very small but we were only sleeping there we had a park view which was nice the bathroom was reasonable and clean we did not have a closet but had to live out of suitcases on the floor the renovation must have still been in progress as our room had paint chips and drips all over the carpet no cable tv no wireless internet and no continetal breakfast as advertised on a website but it is only 3 blocks from the subway wouldnt go back but it could have been worse;2

if a great location is what youre looking for this is a good place to consider as long as youre willing to risk sacrificing the basic services and amenities that other hotels offer as soon as i tried to check in i was rudely informed that since i was 18 and not 21 i would be unable to check in and that i should have known this because it was somewhere on their website this information was nowhere to be found on priceline which is where i booked my room not to mention the fact that most hotels dont have a minimum check in age anyway so who would think that a hotel in a major city would have such a restriction after calling his manager the guy then told me that it actually was okay for me to check in since i had already paid several hundred dollars for my room online;2

this hotel was recommended by a friend and the online photos looked great the location certainly is wonderful however the room is smaller than a closetnowhere to put anything seriously my husband and i came with two rather small suitcases and there was nowhere to put things the bathroom is so small there is no room to put any toiletries and i hate when hotels gouge their guest with extra fees for the internet double if you each have a computer free internet in the lobby but its so loud there that there is no place to sit peacefully if you have to work why not just add a few dollars to the room fee and include the damn internet we thought this would be a good alternative to the hilton but dont waste your money;2

my first stay in a hilton was an attempt to pamper my wife and myself as well as avoid having to park at universal studios hollywood my first stay was excellent i got a nice room with an extremely comfortable bed and amazing view for a great price and they gave me free breakfast that was my first stay at a hilton hotel since that time ive stayed at many luxury hotels trying to replicate that first luxury experience and very few have come close only a couple have exceeded it so i decided for halloween horror nights at universal in la in 2012 to try again in short i was charged 100 more for what felt like a motel 6 bed without the amenities even motel 6 offers such as a free breakfast if you can call a motel 6 danish a breakfast its still more than youll;2

we stayed here a few weeks ago and were really disappointed with the hotel its location is very close to central park but other than that there is not much around this area the whole west side seems to be undergoing major roadworks and most of the buildings are heavily cladded with scaffolding including the entrance to the hotel one morning i awoke and opened my blinds to 5 workmen peering through from the building opposite and we were on a higher floor the reception area is dark and dismal with no natural lighting and the decor in the corridors is bold dark and a bit overbearing we upgraded to a suite but even it was fairly basiceg we had a curtain over an inset for a wardrobe the room was also darkthe worst part however was the shower which the hotel;2

we stayed at the hilton while visiting universal city the hotel is right across the street but they do a poor job of accommodating the visitors who walk there you have to walk down the main hotel drive next to cars theres a partial sidewalk on one side but youd think a hotel that advertises its proximity to the park would actually build a safer path to get there it was also confusing just getting to the driveway the front desk folks told us to walk inside past the ballrooms and go out those doors but there were weddings going on both nights that i guess we crashed walking through no one said anything so i guess we didnt offend anyone congratulations and mazel to the bride and groom we made our reservations in february and confirmed them before arriving we;2

my friend and i stayed for 5 nights at this hotel we were disappointed because the room was very small and crowded it was said to have been recently renovated but the room was dark and shabby the furniture was of poor quality and the wardrobe was damaged the television was unwatchable because of poor reception there were no facilities to make tea or coffee and nowhere else to get a hot drink we did ask to be moved to another room which the hotel staff agreed to and the alternative was a bit brighter and the tv worked the floor however had an interesting gradient sloping up from one side to the other on the plus side the standard of cleanliness was good and we always had fresh towels the hotel also claims to offer park views but i think the number of rooms;2

dont be fooled by the trendy lowlit lobby which broadcasts coolness the empire is as its name suggests a representation of a bygone age the rooms are small and ventilation poor with archaic old ventilation systems and dirty controls we moved rooms but our first sucked in the aroma of a restaurant the bathrooms are small and you can barely move in them the suites are the best value and best rooms but cone at a price finally a word about the location stunning so you need to recognise you will need to compromise if you want to stay there it could be so much better but that would come with a price i fear a continued lack of investment will mean it descends in future years;2

stayed here for 4 nights with my sister in law for her first visit to nyc disappointed is an understatement we had been told the hotel had been upgraded but the hotel looked tired in most places our room was tiny and on the side of the street where construction drilling continued throughout the night ð staff didnât seem to care about this the beds were comfortable once we eventually got to sleep john on concierge was really helpful but the other staff i didnât find at all helpful the redeeming feature was the tick tock diner attached to the hotel who served great food and the staff were really attentive the hotel is centrally located within a short walking distance of times sq etc so a good spot in terms of location but the hotel is definitely in need of some;2

we stayed 2 nights at the hotel in mid july 2012 on checking in well after the check in times we were told to wait for an hour as the room was not ready and we were offered complimentary drinks as compensation as non drinkers we were then offered breakfast vouchers when we checked our delux king room we were horrified we had requested a quiet room away from the service area and lifts we were shown an run down broom closet on the 1st floor overlooking the entrance with lots of bts trying to get to the roof top night club the room had a curtain and a rail over the fridge as the cupboard the room was so small that we had to carefully move around the bed not to bump anything we immediately asked to see the manager who true to nyc form was rude and unhelpful sorry that is;2

i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of february 2008 i was travelling as part of a school group the first point i will make is that it is very common for school groups to stay here and naturally good behaviour is not a guarantee though id like to think my group was reasonably behaved if this is likely to bother you i strongly recommend looking for somewhere else to stay during your trip we had a couple of issues with our room firstly a pressure nozzle in the radiator would occasionally release leaving steam hissing out for a time quite frequently colourfully described by my roommate as sounding like two mice having a fryup the noise was initially irritating but eventually became white noise secondly the provided hair dryer broke after giving;2

were currently staying at the empire hotel until 91613 and ill say it has even disappointing i planned this trip to nyc for the last month and although the reviews of this hotel were just above average i decided to book here anyway due to the location and decor of the rooms and was excited and looking forward to our stay ughwhat a waste 1st we checked in on friday 913 around 4pm and was given a standard room with a pretty decent veiw over looking g lincoln center the room was very small as i suspected as tge reviews warned me about this but hey its ny but so no big deal breaker the too was very worn with shower caulking issues a hole in the wall near the closet and badly stained lamp shades but still not a total desk breaker as i was not given a receipt;2

strengths this hotel has been superficially renovated and looks upscale from the inside room looks nice and the bathroom is also very modern the service was good and many of the people in our party received champagne bottles for inconveniences they experienced location is ideal weaknesses the hotel is literally falling apart for example we were moved 2 times the first because our air conditioner was not working the second time because our window literally came off luckily it got stuck and did not fall out but if it would have someone could have been seriously injured the curtains also came down at some point our party experienced similar problems one person said that their drawers continued to open because their dresser was not levelthey called down;2

this hotel is very well located and fairly inexpensive by ny standards now the bad news and this seems to be a universal problem great foyer with plenty of uniformed staff but scruffy rooms too many staff whose sole purpose appears to be to hang around the foyer looking smart and not that interested in assisting customers after taxes it probably wasnt even that cheap why oh why dont hotels invest more in the rooms and less in flashy foyers;2
we didnt read the reviews about this hotel before we booked if we had this wouldnt have been the hotel of our choice i want to make my review as accurate as possible and after all this hotel was cheaper than many others you get what you pay for one of the previous reviews said the astor on the park was like an upmarket hostel and i think that sums it up we booked 2 rooms and specifically asked for rooms with a view of the park with one room to have twin beds the rooms we got looked across a small yard right in to the bedrooms on the other side the window blinds had to be closed all the time or people in the rooms opposite could see right in whose fault this mix up was is still up for discussion so maybe not the hotels fault one of the rooms wasnt too bad but;2
after reading all the mixed reviews of this place me and my sister were a little wary of staying here for the price its great a nice neighborhood and quick walk to the 72nd and broadways station when we first checked in we were told to go to the elevator at the end of the hallway after walking around we finally noticed what looked like a closet door with elevator buttons on the outside this was the elevator our room looked pretty decent and was exactly as it had been described by other travelers as a dorm room the shared bathroom was right next to our room however my sister noticed a pubic hair on the clean towel that was supplied in our room the bathtub was disgusting and i showered in my flip flops there was rust on the drain and all we got was a bar of;2
we have stayed here twice once when it first opened and this time the first time was not too bad cockroaches in the bathroom and a shower that flooded but we loved the style of the hotel and the location so we hoped that they had addressed the shower issue in the time between our stays they did not and it just got worse the shower fully floods and there is mold beneath the platform towels are replaced based on their laundry facilitys whim we were there for a week and only received full towel service twice and this required a call to housekeeping both times where we were informed that they simply do not get enough towels to service all of their rooms we came back to our room one time to find that they had put sanitary covers on our dirty glasses one still half filled;2

we have previously stayed at the empire several times and have been very happy therehowever we were in room338 crs last night nov 26 and were very disappointed in our stay the air conditioning did not adequately cool the room so it was hot and stuffy this made it very difficult to get any sleep this morning we had no hot water the desk clerk said a pipe had burst our overnight experience was pretty hard to accept we are hoping that the hotel will refund the fee for our stay because we would stay there again since our daughter lives 2 blocks away we wont however if our problems are not addressedwe tried to contact the manager by phone but just kept getting passed around and we were never connected to anyone in authority;2
i knew it would not be fancy or average and it was not but thats ok it was cheap and that was more important at the time the room was fine not dirty that i could see but old and basic this was my first time sharing a bathroom i think there were 8 other rooms but i dont think the floor was full so it was never a problem again the bathroom was old and not the cleanest but i expected that and it wasnt so bad as to freak me out the walls are thin i could hear the tv of the neighboring room quiet clearly i will say the staff were not outright rude but the made you feel as though you were inconveniencing them and they couldnt really be bothered to help you my only real complaint was the breakfast again i had very basiclow expectations there was free coffee;2

the only good thing about this hotel is the location the room as small and dated they arenât clean the hotel stinks of week as does the whole of nyc we was 3 adults sharing a room we had to upgrade to a suite just to be able to move this is where the issues started we read the review before about the hotel over charging guest and yes they over charged us by over 200 dollars i now have to get my bank to get my money back the staff really donât have a clue itâs ruined out holiday;2

old hotel updated we got a special rate for a party and even then it was overpriced noisy rooms small and dilapidated definitely have had better value for money nice staff and good location are the positives;2
the jane is quirky and bohemian just like many parts of the surrounding neighborhood and thats fun but its also pretty tired from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms and its cramped and dark we stayed in a captains cabin with double bed smaller than a queen size bed but not too small and a private bathroom there was one small window really small because a good chunk of it was given over to the air conditioning unit if you really want the bohemian feeling this may be the place for you given the expense and what you get for it well stay elsewhere;2
what can i say after really looking forward to my first visit to new york this hotel was a real disappointment my family had just stayed in a 4 star in washington dc the service was perfect the room facilities were excellent coffee machine etc and the room had plenty of space in contrast the new yorker had very poor service the desk couldnt get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him we were charged 20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin even though we had the rooms we booked in washington the new yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin the room was tiny with minimal facilities the only thing on offer was water at a price the lifts made so much;2
really really confused how it would be even plausible to have a review above 2 stars the location of the hotel and the staff are the only things that got this 2 stars i will never stay here again i stayed after reading reviews complaining about the same things thinking no way they have 45 stars and every room is like that but really no way that our room is the only room with these problems first the room we got was the âking deluxeâ the bed was the entire size of the room which ok not horrible if youâre not spending the entire time in the room the tv has a black bar through the middle every channel the bathroom no door to the shower you have to move the actual sprayer in the shower to get wet it doesnât spray you the bathroom door paint was peeling off;2
the only reason we stayed at this hotel was because of the location and availability the room and bathroom were the smallest ive ever seen especially in a us hotel not only does the hotel need updating but the carpet is so worn in the lobby and the bathroom needs painting and caulking the hotel did seem to be clean and the front desk and doorman were very friendly and accommodating i had read the reviews on trip advisor but didnt have much choice again because of availability in the city and soaring costs due to many events;2
the receptionist was courteous and friendly although we did not have the 2 rooms nearby she assured us that the rooms are beautiful indeed the rooms were spacious and one of the room has a balcony that oversee the courtyard i was impressed there is a huge gated carpark right beside the hotel but chargeable at 24 per day there was sauna but restricted to aged 15 and above there was laundry but much more expensive than elsewhere 350 to wash and 350 to dry the breakfast was just soso the chef at the omelette station was rude and refused the egg orders for my kids he insisted that i had to pay for breakfast for my kids as each room only cover breakfast for 2 adults but when we checked with the reception after our breakfast the receptionist told us that kids;2

we had a room on the second floor at the end of the hall we just needed a place to sleep we arrived at night and left in the morning the room itself was a tad rundown and basically outdated and there were various sloppy patches here and there on the walls there was a large tear in the carpet it was a small room with a tv that got a few channels we could only find one outlet on one of the walls there was no tv remote when we got to the room there was a single chair in the corner onto this chair we simply piled our bags since it was the only open floor space in the room the hotel is located way up at 106th street right on the park but the room was quiet enough the beds were comfy but one had a slight sag in the middle oddly the bathroom was updated and was;2

this hotel has several pluses none of which are related to rooms â¢ great location literally across from penn station â¢ historical exterior â¢ impressive lobby we got one of the old rooms which was in urgent need of refurbishment and in its current state can only be described as horrendous it was small noisy dark and dirty with a dã©cor straight from the 1970s the bathroom was equally bad and tired with old uneven tiles painted over by green paint and the final insult was their resort fee which is basically a 27 mandatory charge per day for internet access avoid this dump there are lots of better hotels in manhattan;2

the hotel itself has all the characteristics to make it an excellent find however the outside bar terrace was never open whilst we were there the inside area of hotel was lovely but wifi could not be obtained if you stay in a corner room the location of the hotel is not the safest and even the 2 min walk to underground was not a pleasant experience word of warning do not turn right up the road as this is not a safe neighbourhood even during the day we did not feel safe if staying in hollywood again i would choose a completely different areaneighbourhood having a security officer patrol your room one evening was not a comforting experience and i come from a hotel background;2

i hate to leave a bad review because the staff was so nice but its like the management is only doing the minimum if that beds are very cheap and horribly squeaky we booked a private twin but were given a 4 bed bunk room with very little space showers had no shelves or hooks which makes no sense for a shared shower space kitchen i wouldnt use it tv room common room is shut away and not very comfortable i wouldnt recommend for solo travelers who like meeting others on their trips we did like the location though and of course the staff was very friendly not sure who owns or manages this but they need to step up their game;2
the empire hotel is located 5 min walk from central park and about 1015 min walk from times square it has good transport links all around it these are the only positive things i have to say about this hotel between the lack of hot water slamming doors and rude staff i will not be staying here again we arrived on sunday night and after check in we headed straight out to explore we didnt get back until late the next morning we got up late to shower and there was no hot water when we called room service they advised us that the boiler was being fixed and it would be about an hour before we would have not water it was st patricks day and we were in nyc so we had a cold shower and went out to see the city we didnt get back to the hotel until around 2am again we;2

like most things in new york city the new yorker hotel is very tired and in desperate need of an overhaul many of the rooms are absolutely tiny with signs of wear and tear everywhere and heating and ac systems clearly decades old the impressive art deco roots of this hotel are simply not enough to hide the fact that this hotel just isnât very good at all;2

just returned from a week at the new yorker i cant fault the position of the hotel but it is certainly not 4 star advertised as re modernised definitely not we booked a metro room which was supposedly modernised old sink and bath fittings decoration looking shabby and a tv which was supposedly flat screen which came out of the ark the room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel only feet away they have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise when you book on arrival they then sting you for a 40 a night facility fee ontop of your original booking this is for the business centre gym and something else quite random and even if you dont want to use;2

as a bargain basement kind of hotel this place would be tolerable if they would just change a few things 1 give me a wastebasket in my room 2 put a roll of toilet paper in the shared bath so i dont have to drag one in every time i need to use the facilities 3 give me a hook and a rack in the bathroom where i can put my clothes and my towel 4 fix the shower faucets so they dont fall off when i turn them on 5 put something on the bottom of the tub so i dont slip immediately upon stepping into it 6 fix the world s worst caulking job in the showers these are all small things not expensive to fix but they make life easier and when theyre not there we notice i could complain about other things the hotels dinginess smelliness etc but i was prepared;2
very disappointed to they charge for wifi for every phone plus ask for extra coffee if we get out of the street most of the places wifi free and friendly for the price this hotel charge 330 pn too expensive;2
i made a same day reservation at this hotel called to make sure they had my reservation whoever i spoke to on the phone must have misunderstood because when i got to the hotel iâm told they cancelled my reservation and i wasnât given any notification or email not even three days later that it was cancelled the sole reason iâm rating two stars is for the receptionist briana who helped me she was an absolute gem and had a room cleaned for me last minute so i wouldnât be stranded the hotel room itself looked nothing like the photos online it looked like an old nyc apartment building that they stuck a bed in hung up a modern looking art canvas from tj maxx and called it a hotel the bathroom had mold in the grout the mirror was cracked the wall behind the toilet;2
stayed here after a couple of nights at the club quarters boston and at the hilton new york fashion district in comparison this hotel is over priced has tiny rooms with barely enough space to open a suitcase the majority of the tiny amount of space provided was occupied with mini bar items everything in the room including basic tea and coffee is an additional charge and really adding insult to injury the wifi comes at an extra fee as well at a time when trains starbucks and some public parks have free wifi this really isnt acceptable at all the hotel lobby looks nice enough but the rooms themselves are rather in need of repair and refurbishment definitely not a 4 star establishment generously a low 3 would not recommend;2
to give context to these comments we are seasoned travellers who have visited both developing countries and numerous cosmopolitan cities in north america and europe until the neighborhood improves i would recommend that people do not stay here unless they are on a very limited budget i had considerable unease with the feel of the area especially at night the hotel itself is being renovated and a cursory look would indicate fresh white bedding and a minimalist style closer examination would uncover a bathtub that fails to drain and a paint job in the bathroom rather than a renovation;2
if you need to stay here for the location then go ahead its a great spot just outside of the hustle and tourists of times square otherwise its just a tiny outdated room with unremarkable staff and unattentive customer service after our keys didnt work after checking in we were greeted by a tiny hot room hot because they didnt turn on the air conditioning and there is no thermostat in the room also the room was tiny and we actually paid extra and got talked into an upgraded room i hate to think of what the other room wouldve looked like the room and bathroom are so small we couldnt fit the crib they brought us without creating a fire hazard we were across from a storage room so there were a bunch of unsightly boxes right in front of our door for both;2

picked for its location really near central park museums and walking distance to time square etc also as featured in gossip girl the location is really good and staff are friendly and the roof terrace great but rooms are small even for new york it does feel run down but the real down side is the endless extras i have never been to a hotel which charges 3 for an inroom coffee never had to pay at any hotel before plus having to pay for wifi and then only for one device the whole room was full of extras with a price tag overall the hotel gives the impression it is looking for every opportunity to fleece guests and that takes the edge of any stay;2

the location of this hotel is amazing right in front of lincoln center and walking distance form midtown however this is pretty much where the good ends the hotel grounds in general and the rooms in particular are old run down and in some cases just filthy much of the furniture in the rooms is worn out see photos or broken some of the towels i had in the room had holes others had mold see photos the ac and heating system is very noisy the gym equipment is old and has signs of rust this was the first and last time i will step foot in this hotel if you need to stay in new york look for another place;2

we have just returned from staying in new york where we had a fabulous time but were very disappointed in our hotel the room was like a prison cell with no light only a tiny window and a very dim bulb there was no air in the room and the radiator was off all day but on all night we were unable to alter it so the room was freezing when we got in but we were cooking in the night there was one small wardrobe with only two coathangers and no drawer space we asked to move but were told all the rooms were the same talking to other guests this seemed true and those lucky enough to have a room overlooking the park said they were unable to sleep because of traffic noise we had to ask each day for towels as old ones were taken but not replaced and we ended up buying loo;2

not what you would expect from a hilton property is in major need of a remodel 2 elevators permanently out of service paints chipping in rooms tub is chipped needs new decor looks like its from the 1980s and the front desk looks like it came out of the 1970s the staff were just average nothing above beyond i honestly was not wowed here and the only thing that this hotel has going for it is the location next to universal studios and a short drive to everything else if youre paying 300night youre better off at a ramada or days inn because thats the same quality you will get with this hilton i would recommend the marriott down the street;2
my family just rented a hotel at this location at 400 per night for an executive suite we figured that was good being close to universal studios as we were on a family vacation and convenience was key we asked to check in early but it was not available which wasnt a problem we ventured over to universal my husband was feeling ill and went back to hotel to rest and check in and was asked to wait another hour to get into his room once he got our room it was not the executive suite but what was available not completely an issue as he would take what he could get at the time keep in mind check in staff was very rude not accomodating in any way we prepaid for breakfast for ease of our stay and to eat close to where we planned to hang out when we got to;2

i have stayed at the empire 4 times total in my nyc travels it is a dark somewhat dingy hotel always a wait at the front desk and rooms assigned to those who so not pay full price are tiny scarcely bigger than the bed this stay my shower was broken and therefore hard to adjust the spray heater made a terrible clunking sound so we had to turn it off to get some sleep only one elevator was working ive found these issues to be more and more typical there over the years too bad because the location is great with lincoln center and great restaurants fiorellos rosa mexicana nearby but because of the above id have to give it 1 star;2
i have done extensive traveling rarely have i paid 500 bucks a night for a hotel room except at farimount properties i know that nyc is not priced to most standards but 500 bucks should still carry with it an expectation of wellaboveaverage standards the only good thing about it was the location as soon as i walked in i got a bad vibe the decor was dark heavily draped and dingy the deluxe premium room was small had one chair and again the decor was brownblack there was a full shower with half of a shower door so water went everywhere there was a sink but it was 2 inches deep so water went everywhere there was no counter space and the whole thing annoyed methe street noise was typical but the hotel patrons were beyond noisy for 500 bucks a night i expected a;2

we booked this hotel due to the close proximity to universal studios the lobby is nice however the rooms are completely out dated i booked a month in advance and rooms generally cost about 200229 a night however i fell for the operator offering a larger room on the executive floor with your own private floor refreshments included robes breakfast etc etc for 50 bucks more a night being hilton honors we usually get it anyway but i wanted more square footage when we arrived the room was not ready we got our room 30 min late uh extra square footage well thats definitely not true we dont even have a couch the view is nice but we have a tiny desk and a single chair i truly dislike rooms without two night stands the beds are not two queens but two fulls we felt;2
decent looking hotel across the street from lincoln centeropera house we stayed there the night after the show and the convenience was great especially since it was raining overall cleanliness was good the bed was comfortable and the checkincheckout was quick and smooth however a lot of the details i look for in a nice expensive hotel were just not there i tried calling the front desk both before and during my stay and a lot of times the phone would just ring and ring and they wouldnt answer location is nice but traffic started up loud at 700 am water pressure at the bathroom sink was too high and the faucet was oriented poorly so it was awkward to use and i kept splashing myself with water one of the lamps had a broken knob they provided;2
lets start with the good no bedbugs as far as i could tell and i did check the bathroom was very clean as were the linens close to the subway and good restaurants nearby also close to a very pretty section of central park theres a lot to steel yourself for however our room was the smallest ive ever stayed in which is to be expected for the price and location little details are neglected like the lamps that collapsed upon touching but they still worked the maid shortsheeted the bed the remote control didnt work with the tv different brands peeling paint and corners of wallpaper front desk staff seemed indifferent didnt even try the wifi based on earlier reviews and we didnt get instructions on how to connect anyway honestly if i were doing it;2

fortunately we had read the negative reviews on this property so we were well prepared for it because of meetings in the lincoln centre area and the fact that we were in ny for one night only we were determined to tough it out room wasnt ready in spite of early check in request supposedly a double upgraded room when it was finally ready tiny poorly designed a deskbar with various over priced drinks and snacks not a glass to be found not even in the impossibly tiny bathroom reaching anyone on the phone whether room service or the front desk or the operator is a test of your patience as noone seems to be there when i finally reached someone and requested 2 glasses i was told it was hotel policy not to provide glasses as they are a safety hazard;2

unfortunately my opinion of abercorn has been smeared by the treatment of my partner and i on our fourth night of accommodation on our third evening of staying at this hostel our circumstances changed and required us to stay another night in london the receptionist was happy to take an extra â£50 off us for another lodging we went out for the next day and came back to abercorn went to our room and all of our possessions had been removed basically someone had come into our room rifled through our private belongings and haphazardly shoved them into our bags we went to reception and it took them three seconds to check the computer system and note that we did in fact pay to stay for another night we got little apology and were told that âit wasnât their faultâ and that âit;2

i one time read a post from a hotel in costa rica i was considering it stated that in costa rica 4 star hotels are different and can be considerably more rustic than 4 star hotels in other part of the world i am now a few days removed from my stay at the wyndham new yorker and am still pondering if the wyndham new yorker considers itself on the same spectrum as costa rican hotels let me begin by stating that this hotel charges a 22 fee upon check in in addition to what you pay to spend the night for honestly no reason they state it is for wifi and gym etc but frankly charging for wifi is very 2008 and not conducive to what modern hotels should provide its guest the most appalling thing about this 22 hotel fee is that upon check out if you would like to walk around;2
lobby is lovely thats the biggest positive states its a 4 star actually would rate as a 23 star dated surroundings room very small and bathroom even smaller paper peeling off walls paint work dirty there was a power outage whilst we were there very few emergency lights worked the management resorted to putting glow sticks in stairwells for a health safety conscious country the hotel didnt appear to have an emergency plan pool is more of a plunge pool full of children bar dont serve coffee only alcoholic drinks would not stay here again;2
i chose this hotel because it was close to lax and they had a shuttle lesson learned hyatt regency the room wasnât ready i check in at around 11pm the room was dirty food and stains and the toiletries were half empty or used no one answered the phone after trying to call down four times i couldnât get out of here fast enough the bed sucks too;2
i really liked this appartment even though it cost us â£900 thats over â£200 a night for a week should have been like the hilton for that money which is a shock when after all its just a room with a toilet anyway it is a nice place to stay one block from the subway and in an lovely area the only real problem was cockroaches in the kichen which frightened the life out of my girlfreind and i couldnt catch them so that didnt go down to well the service was basic what do you expect from an appartment to be honest if you want more for your money book a hotel i would not return or recommend this appartment;2
stayed here for 5 nights in feb i am at a loss to why my review is so far adrift from others on here that find the place great firstly the lobby is fine but thatâs it once you get in the lift and enter the corridors oh my so depressing and needs some tlc i canât remember the number of the first room but it was awful really awful after travelling for over 20hrs i just wanted to go to sleep but off i went to reception to ask for a different room so was very happy to be told we were getting a newly refurbished one well it was better nice basin lol and tv not bothered when in new york about tv the workmanship in these rooms is awful therefore everything looks tatty i definitely would not recommend this hotel location was good but very very noisy wish i took some earplugs;2
the room is so small itâs barely maneuvable the curtain pull broke the drawer wouldnât stay shut the outlets were finicky the sink wouldnât drain and thereâs no shower doorthat was the first night the next morning no regular coffee pod i called and they did fix some things they told me to put more towels down for the shower thatâs just how it is the next day a roach that shower is the worst and the beds werenât even comfortable it was a 1000 for 3 nights and that was a conference rate what horrible do not stay here;2
careful to do everything according to their rules and dont think theyll do anything to remedy the situation they wont booked 12 rooms for a week when we didnt check in on time they sold the rooms out from under us;2

the rooms themselves were fine the hotel is fine its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area but the rooms are very small which i know isnt that wild of a thing in new york city but its not ideal as i was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it the bed took up half of the room which again i understand and its fine not ideal but fine my main issue and why im giving such a low rating is that when i booked my room well in advance in august i booked it for 2 people i wasnt sure if my friend could come with me so i didnt add her name to reservation that shouldnt have mattered but when i added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date;2

we have used this hotel on a number of occasions before and always found it good however having just spent two nights there i doubt that we will ever return the hotel is in the midprice range for nyc but its great advantage is its position which is very near central park next door to the lincoln centre and close to major shops and columbus circle this time the standard of service had declined very significantly and to get anything took such an effort for example four phone calls and a four hour wait to get bed linen for the sofa bed broken air con which was repaired but only after two phone calls delays in check in which meant we could only get access to our room after waiting for over an hour beyond the stated stated checkin time the standard of maintenance in;2

we stayed for two nights in july 08 if you are staying in winter then this hotel is probably okay but not summer when we first arrived we were given keys to our room only to go up and find the room was full of rubbish then we were shown two rooms and told we could have whichever one we wanted but one didnt have a key and we would have to get staff to let us in every time so we took the third option and the room was small and clean no complaints there but the airconditioning is fan only it was so hot that i nearly passed out and were from a hot part of the world so i should be used to it each night before going to bed and again when waking up we would have to stand in the hall and fan as much air into the room as possible the windows did not open so;2

theres a lot to like about the jane hotel its charming the lobby is lovely the location while a bit far from the subway is close to the village and its just about the cheapest private room youll find in manhattan but after a couple visits i think im through for one thing the place is showing signs of wear for example i could feel the mattress springs on the narrow cot sized bed the carpets are looking a little dirty i noticed that the hallways looked in need of a vacuum mainly though im tired of waking up and finding a strange man in a bathrobe brushing his teeth in the coed bathrooms im finished with the coffin sized rooms especially the ones with bunk beds that make you feel even more claustrophobic i dont think i could take another sweltering night;2

i stayed here on a year 12 school trip and when we arrived at the hotel it took up to 2 hours for us all to be assigned rooms although we were lucky in that we got a room straight away only to walk into it and smell the strongest most stale cigarette smell despite it supposedly being a nonsmoking room fortunately after complaining the staff were very polite and helpful and did in fact move us to another room although much better we found the lamp hairdryer and toilet didnt work properly the toilets actually became blocked in several peoples rooms including ours all in all i would say that for what you pay and the location the hotel isnt bad but i certainly wouldnt stay there again;2
stayed here for work last week and could not wait to leave while the hotel lobby is nice and buzzing the bar was probably the best part of the hotel the rooms leave a great deal to be desired this hotel is in great deal of refurbishment walls were scuffed and showed signs of dirt while i was given an upgrade to a very nicely sized room upon arrival there was more surface area in need of attention bathrooms are tiny and lacking light and surface storage space closets do not have doors and like the bathrooms the storage access is probably high for people of smaller stature doors should be given dampeners as they close quite loudly location is ideal for lincoln center but something a subway stop away at these rates would have been better worth it for me;2

unfortunately the negative elements of my stay at the empire outweighed the positive for that reason i wonât be returning and wouldnât recommend this hotel the location is great just off broadway and close to central park and the lincoln centre the hotel staff were very courteous and the checkin experience fairly efficient the rooftop bar is a really cool place to hang out good food and drinks great views not cheap but as you would expect for manhattan that is where the positives end the rooms are small old and tired in fairness the bed was comfortable enough however the aircon so noisy i had to switch it off to sleep and the free broadband dropped out so frequently it was impossible to work i am so pleased i had booked a superior king room because anything;2

all that is good about this hotel is that it is very convenient to most places underground times square empire state building etc the only down side as other reviews have pointed out are the size of most of the rooms our original room on arrival was so small you didnt even have a side table and i had to crawl over my hubby to get into bed the shower had been skewed out and was totally defunct and had been that way for a long time we asked if it could be fixed on the 1st day 1st evening 2nd day 2nd evening getting the picture in the end on returning at 1030pm one evening we went again to one of the 2 desks no one tells you if it is the right one just keep telling you they will deal with it and one of the managers where there and moved us straight away;2

my friend booked this hotel for a 3 night stay in new york i agree with the comments regarding location the location of the hotel was excellent for what we wanted to do its really near columbus circle and central park and times square is about a 20 minute walk it cost us 51 in a taxi from the airport and the journey took about 30 minutes we tended to walk to most places that we wanted to visit during our stay when we arrived we were told that they did not have the twin room that we had booked available for us they did offer us an upgraded room but with a double bed i complained vigorously to member of staff who checked us in who later turned out to be the manager he kept repeating an apology and said that they would have a twin room ready for us the following day;2
really not sure the hotel is worth the money the final bill was close to 350 per night for a super tiny queen size bedroom overlooking an alley way with almost no natural light coming in at all time my daughter said the bathroom was like the one on the airplane super tiny and tight the bathroom really needed some tlc it was a bit rundown the bed was comfortable and the sheet was good the reception area was nice and the doorman was polite the reception lady was nonchalant and uninterested she did give us 2 bottles of waterwill definitely stay at other hotels in the area when we come back in february btw management please fix the lights on the giant sign above the building its embarrassing to see the letter o and e are broken great location;2

stayed at this hotel december 8th till the 12th convenient location for subway and walking distance to central park convenience store on the corner was handy and star bucks subway in close proximity asked and paid for newly renovated room but was far from it room outdated and small not enough towels supplied for 3 people so had to ask which was supplied checkin check out was done easy staff friendly and helpful rooms lacked ventilation so in summer would have to have aircon on to circulate room would be a problem if aircon didnt work generally ok but nothing fantastic i had hoped for more for my dollar but maybe that is just new york would stay hera again if nothing else available;2

the location is good not far from times square however we queued to check in and were then greeted by a very abrupt receptionist they were busy but still no need for such a lack of welcome we went to our room much of the hotel has been refurbished apparently not our room it was shabby and very small the bathroom tiny we stored toiletries on the floor on day 2 of a 3 night stay our tv broke down the coffee machine didnt work and our room key was blocked we were eventually moved to a different room which was apparently an executive room it was much better had been refurbished but not much bigger we have stayed in new york previously and dont expect large rooms but we wouldnt stay there again;2
the lobby is nice and the people are friendly however our room was in great need of renovation the carpet was faded with holes and we had a 90s tv that would just shut off at random times and maintenance looked at it and then walked away didnt fix it the room next door sounded like a construction zone the walls are paper thin the 7th floor we didnt stay on this floor reeked of marijuana and the elevators are very old and slow;2
2nd time to nyc this time was for our honeymoon we did get an upgrade which was a nice offer room we got had an ok view facing lincoln centre room was a bit beat up considering the cost per night shower had no water pressure and they dont offer any complimentary amenities like bottles of water in room nope that would be 750 steep roof top was ok pool was the size of a bathtub the simple thing that bothered us the most was not being able to get your own ice which would be fine if we didnt have to wait over an hour twice to get ice to the room we ended up going down to the bar with paper cups to top it they dont even leave glasses in the room for you to have a drinkjust paper cups for the price i would not recommend it nice area though;2
i was there june 2014 and had a lot of troubles i had a problem with the booking and the staff except one was ridiculously unhelpful in several situations the room was tidy but there was a strong smell of polish there was mold in the shower and in my room at the windows the mattress was saggy the room was very loud at least until midnight i give 2 instead of 1 points because there are a few pros the area hammersmith is quite okay eg not dangerous at night there were no real bad things like theft etc i could get a room 1 week before arrival;2

we are two girls in our twenties and stayed in this hotel from the 23rd27th january 2008 we would not consider this a good location for girls travelling on their own as you need to get the sub or a taxi into town due to the distance and would not walk around the neighbourhood at night the room was an average size but when lying in our beds they were on a slope very interesting we also were awoken with a darfader like sound coming from the heating system followed by a loud banging sound but gave out no heat so we were freezing overall the room was clean and we would have to agree with other reviews the bathroom was the best feature but on our last night when entering the bathroom we were greeted with something neither of us owned in the toilet we had to call;2

new york is new york and you should not get your expectations too high for hotelsunless you wish to spend big dollars i have stayed at many days inns over the years and have generally found them to be serviceable hotels that return the quality for the price this experience did not meet that expectation the property is milking money out of rooms of yesteryear and in need of some true renovation to be specific the door to the room was barely lockable requiring a slam to get it to latch the linens for the bed were torn and should have been replaced bath linens were of a quality that i would have expected at a minimal cost hotel the tv was ancient the real issue for the room was the plumbing for some reason it had a extra set of valves and was not in any;2

i have be staying at the abercorn house over the last six years at least 47 times a year as i travel frequently to london for conferences this will be my last visit conditions of the place are as described in many reviews basic and minimal however over the last few visits staff seem to become more and more rude with absolutely no effort given to making you feel welcomed i dont expect a red carpet at this price point but i also dont expect to be treated like a nuisance for asking for information when i choose your establishment to spend my money at this price point there are many other options in london and i will taking my business elsewhere moving forward;2

our first low impression of the place was confirmed when we checked into our room to find the bed sheets had not been changed from the previous occupants there was dirt and hair and stains on both beds we requested that they change the sheets immediately and they seemed confounded that we had a problem with it the towels were threadbare and stained and they didnât provide a top sheet the bathtub plug didnât work so my hope of having a nice soak after a full day and night traipsing the streets were dashed on our second day some money went missing from our room after room service and the housekeeping staff denied taking it we had a hell of a time getting the staff to not pass the buck or blame us for not using the safe when we finally were able to get hold of the manager;2

my partner and i stayed at the new yorker for three nights in late june the location of the hotel is very convenient for penn station and midtown and easy access to the rest of manhattan as a result the hotel building is an art deco wonder and the hotel exterior and lobby are very evocative of that era we had a great view of midtown from our room on the 27th floor however the room itself was in poor condition on entering the room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and as we pulled back the curtains there was a lot of dust the room decor and bathroom fittings were very dated and the air conditioning was noisy as other reviewers have said there was often a long wait for the elevators my main gripe with this hotel is the excessive resort fees 29 per night plus;2
i have done my homework prior to the stay and so there were no surprises shared a bunk bed room with another buddy for 2 nights and that was enough room was as a big as a car park lot so go figure how 2 grown man elbow ourselves as we tried to change clothes etc luckily both of us travelled light so luggage storage wasnt an issue but then again treat it as a place just to sleep so should be ok toilets were clean but then again sharing a common toilet may not appeal to many the elevator broke down during my stay and climbing stairs werent fun room is musty and dark thankfully its winter i wonder how people deal with summerall the best if you are on the cheap cheers;2
i went here to have some drinks with friends one evening in the downstairs bar the atmosphere was quite nice and the bar quite empty afterwards we decided to go upstairs to meet some more friends in the rooftop bar while the rooftop bar area was very nice i thought that the staff was very rude the gentleman at the entrance of the bar was giving everyone quite a hard time getting in in a nonpolite way after telling him that our friends were there we had to have 4 of them come to the door and get us i totally understand access control issues but there is never a reason to be rude or obnoxious about it unless there is an issue that warrants it eg rude guests this soured my experience and i would not recommend it;2

after reading that short term renting is a thing of the past i find myself with conflicting feelings i stayed there many years ago the summer after 911 the place was a dive but all i did was sleep and store my stuff i did several loads of washing in the basement and talked with several residents about the building and living in ny it was great being so close to lincoln center and central park and the subway was great but i guess it will never happen again real mixed feelings;2

the hotel is very close to grand street subway station which makes it ideal to get away quickly from the area although the hotel seems clean the smell of herbal cigarettes wafting through the hotel was off putting the room was extremely small and very cold and the electric wall heater was very noisy all in all it was cheap and somewhere to sleep but i found the staff very unhelpful as i had emailed the hotel prior to the visit requesting is some extra touches could be added as it was the hubbys 40th but no reply was received and on arriving none of the staff who were on reception had a basic grasp of the english language to understand my request;2

we were extremely disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist on arrival at the new yorker and sadly the experience didnt improve much after that our credit card was not so much requested as demanded and when i queried the amount that would be held by the hotel was simply told it was hotel policy in case i incurred extras while staying and anyway your company will be paying for it as it was this was a personal holiday not charged to any company and apart from the internet charge of 10 there was nothing else to pay a 49 charge was excessive especially as it took more than a week to refund it once we got to the room there were no facilities for making a drink simply the option to ask housekeeping to provide something but no explanation about whether that;2
words cannot express how disappointed i was with the jane itâs clear that the jane trades on its quirky vibe however this is to the detriment of the guests that stay in the hotel on check in there was a private party gift bagging stand making it difficult to actually make your way through drunk partygoers taking selfies to actually get to the check in desk the overpriced rooms are cramped hot and smell like they need a good airing if you have a room facing the main road itâs also quite noisy the one good thing about the jane is the bathroom really nice and well laid out my main annoyance was that we couldnât get onto the roof for drinks every night was closed for a private party and also when we tried to get into the lobby bar again there was a private party in;2
we were staying on business and needed a room with 2 beds for 3 people reservations was very helpful and told us a few rooms had 2 queen beds but most had two doubles later in requesting a room from the front desk we found out the double bed rooms had a much better view so we requested that upon arrival we were checked into one which was dirty we said we would wait for it to be cleaned but were put in another room on the 11th floor this had 2 doubles but faced the interior space an awful view not wanting to make a 3rd trip to the desk we kept the room the room ended up being really loud right next to the elevator i now believe it is probably the last room they sell as it really is almost unbearable also the elevators did not work very well;2

if you are trying to find a comfortable upscale place to spend an enjoyable tripe do not stay here we stayed in a captains room and according to the fire escape map on the door we were placed in the absolute smallest room on the floor about 50 smaller than all of the other rooms it didnt look anything like the pics on the online profile maybe because we booked through a third party site they gave us the worst room there was literally nowhere i could put my suitcase that wasnt in the way of a door and we had neither a veranda nor a view of the hudson at least one of which was promised in the room description i guess it didnt really matter because the windows were so dirty that we could barely see out it was in the 90s during our trip and the air;2
while the employees were good to deal with the overall experince was not a good one upon arrival of my room it seemed as if i was placed in the smallest room that was soaking up all the noise in the area not to mention the rooms around me the bathroom was very small no space to spin around in there after sitting in the room for about 20 minutes with all the noise i went to the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction the manager on duty was able to change the room to one that seemed to be recently upgraded although you could see that it was just a minor face lift to the room i had before the money paid for the room wasnt worth it at all not even half the amount would have been worth it;2

i stayed here because i was travelling on a budget and everything in new york is ridiculously expensive so i put up with this for the 6 nights of my stay the staff were extremely friendly and helpful as new yorkers are in general the decor was tired a previous guest had pulled a bed fitting out leaving nails exposed which i manage to push back the toilet cistern kept flushing until i learn a trick of lifting the lid and turning it off i suppose i could have gone and complained to the staff about that one but did not there is breakfast of muffins and coffee down in the basement everything basic;2

average stay at the hollywood hotel location wasnât the best you have to rent a car they have parking in the back but what they donât tell you is itâs 30 a day breakfast was free and good omelette station fresh waffles fruit bagels cereal toast ect the hotel is old and you can tell the room wasnât nice it was small and old had an awkward pillar in the middle of the room that was in the way the bathroom needs an update no counter space for make up room the ceiling in the shower is cracking and crumbling the beds are hard didnât have a good sleep with parking we ended up paying 200 a night pretty pricy the staff wasnât helpful at all asked for a plate to microwave left over pizza and they said they didnât have any they left a dirty old ice bag in the room;2
room 233 was tiny delapidated with unpleasant odour and smelly bathroom there were no other rooms available reception was always busy or noone was there we were there for our 55th wedding anniversary and a 78th birthday so were very very disappointed room 233 bore no resemblance whatsoever to the photographs nor to other rooms we have stayed in at premier inns i have written a letter to the manager and also sent an email to the manager but so far no reply the hotel is so well situated which is why we chose it but the stay was completely spoilt by this horrid little room;2
for a recent short trip to one of very favorite cities my friend and i chose the quality hotel on broadway because wed stayed there for 5 nights last year and had enjoyed the ease with which wed reserved online with option to cancel the spacious room and adequate bathroom the decent degree of cleanliness the relative quietness and most of all the convenient location just a few feet from the 96 st subway station in a neighborhood we like unfortunately the minusses outweighed the plusses during our recent twonight staysome of the same plusses were still there the room was quiet except for the slamming doors that so many hotels seem to have and the clueless guests who let them slam the bathroom looked as if it had been renovated recently even though the;2

i had one night at the new yorker when i unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in new york city at 343 for the night it was not cheap by any means but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time mid october 2019 the hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 pm compared to the standard 3 pm and indeed when i checked in i was told my room was not ready so i decided to store my bag until i could check in later i was pretty shocked to learn that i had to pay a 5 fee to store my bag for a few hours ive never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that service once i got to my room i found that it was incredibly small and cramped there was barely room for the bed the room had no view either except of the building opposite;2
weve stayed at about a dozen hotels all over manhattan and never really had a bad experience until we came here the checkin was long tedious and unpleasant the woman that checked us in was just plain rude and seemed to absolutely hate her job the first room they put us in was an absolute horrible neightmare the decor was run down the room was so small you couldnt even turn around in it you had to back onto the toilet because the bathroom was so small nowhere to put a suitcase or a bag or a cosmetics case but the worst thing was the horrendous noise from the airconditioning units outside our window not that our aircon even worked it was so hot we were sweating all night and hardly had any sleep between the loud noise and heat the noise was like a big truck;2

stayed at the two person bunkbed room in sepoct 15 having stayed in numerous cheaper rooms in nyc before including both bunkbed and shared bathroom options i must say that these rooms were just too small for my liking approximately 45 square meters no private sink and with no possibility to put suitcases beneath the bed for the 6 nights we stayed the room was cleaned only once not a huge problem perhaps but at least having the thrashcan emptied more often would have been ok it was quite humid a few days in nyc this time and that definitely did not add to the attractiveness of a tiny room on the positive side location very friendly employees price and no problems with the the shared bathrooms usually no lines;2

it could have been worse we were lucky when we stayed at the days inn in new york city unlike several other reviewers on this site we did not encounter bed bugs in our room but that is the only good thing i can say about this hotel the room was tiny with paint peeling from the walls the plumbing worked most of the time but the heat worked only sporatically this was in january i had made a reservation through the days inn web site and i was offered what i considered to be a reasonable price i do realize that one must expect a certain amount of shoddiness in a cheap hotel in new york however when we checked out they refused to honor the price i had been given when i made the reservation so now i have to dispute the higher charge with my creditcard company;2

the empire is in a great location right next to central park the lincoln centre and 10 minutes walk from times square but that must be offset by the fact that the rooms are very tired and the whole hotel is in real need of a facelift we stayed for three nights in late august having arrived from boston and then going on to a cruise to bermuda we chose the empire as our both our girls loved the âgossip girlâ connection and the rooftop terrace and pool were an attraction the entrance lobby and stairs are fine and the staff are great but it all goes down hill when you get to the rooms we had two interconnecting rooms and couldnât believe what a shabby state they were in apart from being quite small both bathrooms had tiles hanging off doors didnât open aircon units;2

great location right across lincoln center unfortunately my room was very tired meaning in desperate need of renovation and updating not enough lighting the desk light didnt work at all no convenient outlets for electronics you have to climb under the desk or night table to find an outlet to connect your phone adds to the overall tired impression the bathroom shows the sign of lots of flooding from the shower the sink drain is extremely slow and there is no room for storing toiletries the kleenex box is so high that i could barely reach it the bed was clean and firm and i liked the overhead shower the hotel lobby displays the same tiredness as the room;2
just recently booked a room for myself my wife at the new yorker the lobby looks great since our last stay price for 2 day stay was ok and very close to penn station the room on the 24th floor was small and i mean small about 140 sq ft carpet is worn fixture in bathroom was broken walls are paper thin you can hear everything in the room next to you from talking to flushing the toilet to taking a shower clothes closet is too small dont open the dresser draw and then try to walk around cant do it no room tried 3x to call the front desk and no one picked up the phone just kept ringing tv stations are limited and some that you do get to watch the color is red i could go on on but the best i can do is a poor rating website pictures are far different then the;2
the best of this hotel is just the location if you want to go to universal studios otherwise nothing this was a disappointing hilton rude not good service and definitively not service and solutions oriented for this price better other hotels in la in my case i would even better consider the sheraton just beside this is not good for families nor for business wants to be good for all and is for nothing i rate two stars due to the location for universal studios otherwise would give just one internet not free breakfast very expensive fridge in room very noisy;2

took a world tour in april may 2011 during the trip we stayed at maybe 12 hotels the empire hotel was the most expensive in the whole trip we stayed at 4star hotels and some 3star the empire hotel was also the worst from the point of view of the following cramped standard room fixtures and fittings not working or in poor repair queues at front desk concierge service poor the only real saving graces were the bell staff who were friendly and helpful and the lady on the front desk vanna who worked tirelessly against the odds the other saving grace was the location which was very central and convenient i complained was upgraded and then it was better but still poor value for money and not a great experience my experience is that there are a lot;2

my stay at the new yorker has been the worst stay at any hotel i have ever experienced when you get to the hotel the lobby is very busy and very nice the buzz gives you a real feel of the city the hotel is on a central location with easy transport connections this is where the beauty of the hotel ends firstly i was told the rate of the room was 159 plus tax my total bill came too 260 when i tried to pay cash i was told the hotel does not accept cash even though you are given that option when making a reservation i was given a room on the 21st floor when you come out of the elevator you are met with an old musky smell and a very dirty brown carpet nothing like the decor that you are presented with when you first enter the hotel on getting to the room we were met;2
on a positive note this hotel is in a great location and just steps away from the subway also although it is shabby our room was clean but there are a lot of negatives on two of our three nights there they left us with only one washcloth and one hand towel for two people the windows have no sound insulation so we could here all the street noises it is the noisiest hotel room i have ever been in there is no central ac instead we had a window unit that was very loud and not terribly efficient the hotel charges to use the computer in their business center the television had few channels available none of which was the weather channel or national news in all this days inn needs a major renovation it truly is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed;2

the main disappointment at the hotel was the fact that the pool deck was closed this was the main reason we booked this particular hotel and we were really looking forward to it it was a major disappointment that we only found out once arriving at the hotel after hearing this news we headed to the hotel room only to find the room was very small totally dark facing a wall and with a noisy air vent we immediately headed back down to reception and to be fair we were able to upgrade the room after expressing our disappointment and really appreciated that at the hotel the lobby area and bar was very dark so didnt want to spend much time in there wifi was only free in lobby and not in room i think the price of the hotel is made up for by the location its just one;2

i liked the fact that it was cheap because it was a last minute trip but we called 3 times for wash clothes and ended up with hand towels the noise from other people checking in was so loud it woke me up out of my sleep i called because when i got back to my room it smelled like cigarette smoke and the front desk said oh i dont know anything about that the heat wasnt that good but the window didnt lock either so it was very cold at times and as i was leaving out one of the front desk clerks just starred opposed to saying having a good day or hello or whatever i tried to look at the brighter side but it was hard;2
having read some of the reviews on here we were not expecting a great deal and balanced against the fact that it wasnt by nycs standards expensive we thought what the heck however we were still disappointed doesnt look too bad from the outside but the interior certainly requires a lick of paint and some air freshener here and there the first room we were put in was tiny and oppressive the windows faced into a courtyard and so very little light shone into the room exacerbated by the lack of windowlene applied to the glass but the worst thing was the air handling unit on the adjacent roof that rattled and hummed virtually all the time getting to sleep was impossible we asked to change rooms but were given some spurious excuse that this wouldnt be possible;2

itâs only my first night here and iâm already disappointed firstly the charge of 31 per day just to use their facilities to have coffeetea facility in your room there is an extra charge on top of that the room is very outdated the bathroom is old and rusty beds are not comfortable at all the only upside is the location and the view of the empire state building the hotel desperately needs renovating will definitely not be choosing this hotel next time i visit nyc;2
we stayed at the empire hotel on the last night of a three week trip i had only booked it as it features in a tv show my daughter watches and she was desperate to stay there we arrived and the reception is impressive we checked in no problem and were impressed with the size of our room two double beds two large windows and a seating area on opening the curtains we discovered the view was basically straight into other peoples rooms it was 10pm but we had travelled from la so we hadnt eaten since lunchtime the hotel guide stated food is available in the lobby bar until 2am and the restaurant until 1130pm when we went to get food we were told food wasnt available at all that night as the restaurant had closed due to lack of customers we were advised by reception to;2
we had a suite so the room size was good and location is ok but based on the following issues i would not recommend this hotel heater the first night one of our heaters was broken so they came to fix it however the other heater made such a horribly loud noise that it kept us up all night which with a 2 year old was a nightmare we asked for it to be fixed and they said that is just the way the old steam heaters work so we ended up sleeping without heat the next 2 nights it was better to be freezing that not sleep due to the horrid noise check in room was not ready until 30 min after check out time would not have been a huge deal but in combination with everything else it was just one more negative bathroom felt dingy and there was a rusty;2

the hotel lobby is absolutely underwhelming a circus show with the feeling of a dilapidated theme park arduous checkin process this place is stuck in a freeze frame of 20 years ago but with wear and tear accelerated carpet is threadbare and im shocked at how the fabric on the headboards is greasy and worn out the fact this is a 4star hotel may be the biggest jokes on the internet many hotels in nyc get away with murder so to speak theres nothing about this hotel that is 4star its a solid 23 star it is also very loud in the hallway anyone walking by or talking in the hallway sounds like they are in the same room as you they charge to hold your bag where other hotels do this for free the internet is not good excellent location but thats about it;2
this is not a cheap hotel and after driving quite awhile to get there we discovered that there is no restaurant although the website had terrific reviews for their chef you can order delivery from a local pizza joint we were stuck walking to the wendys up the block and bringing back a burger the common areas are beautifully appointed but the room had peeling wallpaper and paint there were dead bugs on the less than clean floors and the furniture was not functional nightstand lighting was only controlled from the light switch by the door and apparently the lights are on a timer as they continually turned off after an hour or so the air conditioner is noisy and we were unable to turn it off after spending 200 for the night we expected more;2

we stayed here recently for a friends wedding also at the hotel and were very disappointed with the hotel and service the location is good but thats more or less it the rooms are tiny you have to pay extra for a window which has an external view and everything is very tired with paint peeling off the doors we arrived after a long trip and the hotel had no hot water not ideal there is a club at the top of the hotel which means it is very busy and noisy if you are on the higher floors the staff are unhelpful and the bar staff especially on the rooftop are particularly rude we expected so much more from this hotel given the price location and city it is in we would never stay here again and would recommend people against it considering my friend had her;2
we stayed at the new yorker for 5 days in december our room was tiny the size of a walkin closet the first night we woke up at 630 am to two employees bickering loudly next door the second day we returned to the hotel at around 1130 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes as if someone has smoked in our room on our last day as i was brushing my teeth the water from the sink came out brown this is the most disgusting experience iâve ever had at a hotel i am very surprised this happened at a 4star hotel putting all of this aside the room smelled bad in general the bathroom was dirty and the tv didnât work properly safe to say i will never stay at this hotel again;2
when we got to the hotel it was not as nice as it looks on the website our room was not in great shape aside from being small a bit shabby lacking the advertised amenities it also had lots of little bugs in the shower my husband thought they might be fleas but we donât know when we checked in it was already quite late but my husband did not want to bring any bugs home with us so we he went down to the desk to ask about a new room but they did not have a another available room with 2 queens after some talking they did graciously give us 2 rooms with 1 bed each so we split up with our kids the two new rooms did not have bugs â hooray but they were a bit shabby the room my husband and daughter had clearly had had updates but it still did not have a great paint;2

by far location is this hotels best quality but unfortunately its not enough to overcome some of its bad qualities and horrible customer service i stayed there with my family for 1 night during their 5 days stay at the empire heres just some of their fatal flaws the shower has no door well it has half a door so when you take a shower expect water to be all over the bathroom which thank god does have a door i expect a hotel room in manhattan to be small but hotels usually compensate that with comfortable beds i found the bed at the empire to be too hard and the pillows to be way too flat the room is bombarded with stuff for you to purchase all kinds of snacks liquor coffee tea water chargers and other crap you dont need its too obvious how;2

the entrance is amazing and reception is clean bright an area of calm first impressions were great we were happy to be staying in an iconic new york landmark unfortunately the room was disapointing it was average size and the beds were comfortable the cleanliness however is not up to standard in a hotel of this alledged calibre the head of housekeeping needs to inspect the room more thoroughlythe bath needs an upgrade the attached photo shows the base of the bath with ground in dirt that cant be removed the back of the bathroom door also needs a thorough clean as did other areas where dust collects the decor in the room is tired another small inconvenience was that the tv is not wall mounted and this takes up surface space not having a fridge or teacoffee;2

when i visited the new yorker by wyndham i was expecting a very nice hotel i was sorely disappointed the room was small and cramped with the decor that havent been updated for decades the room service was delivery from the resturant downstairs and the food was garbage the parking was 60 day valet 40day self parking i understand that nyc is expensive but do you really have to rip people all the way off in broad daylight the employees were very helpful except for the doorman on the day before of my arrival he was mia and had to hunt him down to get my car parked next time ill look a little harder for a better place to stay;2
this was my second stay at astor on the park i like the hotel it is inexpensive the location is terrific and the staff is courteous and accommodating the condition of the hotel however is another matter it truly appears to be down on its heels we had a room on the top floor and it seemed to have been furnished with all the odds and ends in the hotel the room was really ugly the balcony door did not close properly and it turned out not to be connected at all because one strong wind blew it completed off the frame there was mold in the bath tub and mattresses and bedrooms littered the stairwells while i would stay again do hope they have a chance to invest a little money in the place;2
we stayed in a 1 bedroom and it did not at all look like the pictures of the website they had scratches on the walls the second television did not work and the room was depressing the location is great but the service was not when i asked for a box for cable for the television that had nothing they said only one of the televisions were for cable and the other was for dvds they never sent the dvd box after i requested it also a fire alarm went off at 2am when i called the front desk to ask about it they just hung up the phone when i tried to call back they wouldnt pick up i never asked for anything extreme just at least the minimum of what a person would expect when they arrive to stay at a place that is paid for ie cleanliness working televisions basic;2
on paper this is a wonderful hotel looks great photos and physically reasonable price great location and large rooms the problem lies with horrific service due to major understaffing and unpleasant tiny bath and impractical shower the problem starts with a busy checking in area which means one always seems to have a 20 minute wait to check in or out and with other problems whenever you dont need anything magically there is no queue we changed rooms as the shower has no door so water splashes in the bathroom not ideal and when we moved to a room with a bath the bath was so small with no ledge and enclosed by a wall it was incredibly uncomfortable and impractical being in manhattan and not a modern building noise was a problem beds were very comfortable;2
i am a wyndham rewards member and paid 5000 for an early checkin she told me that she would give me an upgrade but instead the room was tiny i asked for another room and they gave me a slightly better room but not up to my expectations i am very disappointed because the last time i visited my room was great;2
while it is difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in nyc the empire hotel was a bad value for the money we had a deluxe king room which was a scant 10 by 15 feet approximately the renovation of this old hotel attempted to be trendy and was tacky wallpaper unpeeling shower designed for a double glass door but had only one side of the door tiny sink with no surround bulky armoire no closet paper coffee cups that were not replaced after use a mediumsized bottle of water cost 8 dollarsthere are other hotels in the same price range that are much better valuesthe sofitel for example booking the best value hotels requires much advance planning;2

my previous review stated this is one of the best places to stay in nyc but upon my second stay i now understand that there is a significant difference between the rooms that have been renovated and the rooms that have not been renovated my most recent stay was in a room that had not been renovated and i was very disappointed in how dilapidated the room was after talking it up to the rest of my traveling party who were rightly skeptical at my reservation unless you can ensure a renovated room this hotel is not even close to being worth the money i must also warn you the elevator is scarier to ride in than most and if the front desk employees engage in a conversation you can be assured they will not assist you until their discussion is complete no matter how hard you;2

first our flight in arrived roughly around 11 pm so we were instructed to call the front desk and inform them that we were going to be arriving past midnight to ensure that our reservation was not canceled that in its self was a pain in the butt we called several times and no one answered so we were forced to leave a voicemail hoping that they would actually get it we got to the hotel and got our room when we walked in we almost left because the room is roughly 11x11 and right next to the elevator we could barley walk in the room and there was no room for the luggage the bathroom was tiny as well the bathroom was probably 3 feet deep and 7 feet long luckily for us the room was clean so we decided to tough it out for a couple of days but if they give you a 20 room;2

i expect more from hyatt than say motel 6 the check in lines were very long and one clerk went out of her way to ignore me when she saw me approaching her to ask a question she literally ran away from me then as i stood in line with about 1215 other people that same clerk allowed two people that were not in line to cut in front and she checked them inout right in front of all of us it was pathetic the room service and parking were ridiculously overpriced;2
hotel is a great location however staff at reception pretty unhelpful and not interested if complaints rooms are very small and basic no facilities to make a drink no fridge decor tired biggest complaint was on running a bath filthy brown scummy water which did not clear reported to reception they were not interested toiletries ok but no shower gel hotel dies have some beautiful art deco features;2
we had heard the top of the empire hotel had a great view and that is correct so if you want to see it take the elevator up but dont stay for drinks i was expecting a really nice atmosphere since this entire building was totally remodeled if you like badly dressed staff 16 drinks riding in an elevator that looks like the worst freight elevator youve ever seen decor that already looks run down then youll be happy;2
apart from its location this hotel was dissappointing the lifts were very problematic thoughout my 10 days stay and it was impactful every day and a constance source of irritation bascially on a regular basis only 1or 2 of 6 lifts lift was working on serveral occasions i had to use the service lift waiting your turn in linegrrrh the room was pleasant enough but the reception area was also a problem given one had to regularly que for long than normally expectered periods to be served the conceige service was below average dispensing incorrect information regarding restaurant opening days all in all i would avoid this hotel if you have a choice particuarly as they are going to renovate it they will run out the old lifts which are unreliable lift rescues;2

we stayed at the new yorker for 5 days in december our room was tiny the size of a walkin closet the first night we woke up at 630 am to two employees bickering loudly next door the second day we returned to the hotel at around 1130 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes as if someone has smoked in our room on our last day as i was brushing my teeth the water from the sink came out brown this is the most disgusting experience iâve ever had at a hotel i am very surprised this happened at a 4star hotel putting all of this aside the room smelled bad in general the bathroom was dirty and the tv didnât work properly safe to say i will never stay at this hotel again;2

i have to say that while the hotel is in a fabulous location close to central park the metropolitan and guggenheim and the neat places in the upper west side and harlem with lots of cafes and especially a great bagel place called tal bagel and the subway connections were great we found the hotel a little rundown and definately our room let in all the considerable noise outside in fact because the air conditioner was put in the window and then tape was used to try and seal the space which had disappeared in one section so the cold night air was blowing in although the hotel staff did at least put more tape on the next day we could hear conversations on the street below as if the window was open add to that the fact that there were construction things on the;2

our first impression was awesome but upon entering the room it smelled very musty and damp a luxury hotel at 340 a night plus 45 a night parking fee should not smell like a mossy rainforest we took that in strides but getting into bed that night we found the beds hard and the pillows like wafers we have stayed in hotels at 100 per night that were 20 times better we woke up to absolutely no hot water which made getting ready to hit the park very unenjoyable again a luxury hotel we ended up not being able to shower that morning and water was still not hot in the afternoon either we complained to the front desk and got a voucher for a free breakfast this sounded great at first but we get to breakfast to find we only got muffins and fruit;2

would not recommend apart from the nice location on the upper west side i cannot think of any positives about this hotel as you will read in the other comments old outdated not overly clean lifts are ridiculously slow and dingy tv didnt work at all and staff in general were not friendly a staff member who delivered a mini fridge to the room so i could store my insulin was positively rude as we didnt hear him knocking on the door straight away just to note i requested said fridge prior to check in again while checking in yet still had to phone and request again after checking in just an example of the hotels efficiency for the price you can find better would suggest you only stay here if you really cant find anything else;2
the location is lovely and convenient and the doorman bellman upon check in was helpful and polite and thats really all i can say positive about this place the front desk clerks were mildly competent if slow and a bit clueless but the concierge was rude and unhelpful which is really the opposite of what i imagine to be his job description so the weirdness no top sheet none ive never had this in north america and i do really like one so i asked for it to be done but when we got back that evening nothing so i called housekeeping and the guy came up with a duvet cover for me close enough i guess now the problem 4 elevators 2 of which were never in service when i was trying to use them and 1 of which was frequently down and the noise of the;2

i stayed 7 nights in this hotel two weeks ago its in a nice neighbourhood and about 10 mins by subway to the center of manhattan the staff is nice although they act very slow if you have some requests for example i asked for an extra blanket because it was terribly cold and i had to wait one day till they gave it to me furthermore do not ask for wake up calls i asked for it because i had to get up early to get the bus to dc but they didnt call i found out that there was even nobody at the reception at 7am though they promised to call but in general its a cheap place the bathrooms and toilets are clean the rooms not really and youre in nyc;2
location is superb just out of the hustle and bustle but still very much in the heart of nyc if youâre visiting as a tourist central park is a 5 min walk away and times square a 10 min walk away hotel itself is very run down and old poor lighting in the rooms and the whole establishment old wallpaper and carpet the lifts are extremely slow and make you feel slightly uneasy shower pressure is good but the bathrooms are tiny and i mean small honestly barely fits one person air conditioning is a box in the room that makes so much noise but staff are friendly are very friendly on fridays and saturdays this hotel turns into a mating ground for young people the empire rooftop bar is a popular place and gets completely rammed and lots of people end up booking rooms;2

a few friends and myself were looking for something on a budget to try and get to ny during december this hotel is very basic and in some ways really lets itself down the first room my cousin and myself were given was through a fire exit door and it was an absolute tip i only looked in and walked straight back out and went down to reception and advised that it was filthy and i would not stay i had read that you could upgrade your room and we had tried to do that via the internet before we arrived but the hotel didnt respond we were eventually given a family room with 2 double beds which was nice for the two of us i have to say that the room was clean and there was a maid service everyday it is a very tired hotel and a couple of the desk staff are not very nice;2

i read a lot of the reviews and they are all accurate but from different viewpoints the key is your expectations the hotel is clean but for the first couple of days i had bugs not bed bugs my guess is that if the building has bugs the cleanest room will have bugs too the room i stayed in was drab but clean meaning that the floor and counters were all wiped down that said the paint was peeling and the walls clearly had not been painted in years and the carpet was very old on the other hand i paid 6070 a night which is two hundered dollars less than many hotels in the area the location is great it took me a couple of nights to get comfortable but i never once saw anything on the bed and the sheets were changed daily recommendations if you just;2

if you want to be close to the park across from lincoln center a three minute walk to columbus circle then in terms of location this place cant be beat unfortunately it can be beat in most other ways or at least a key way for me while the staff is friendly and the lobby inviting the elevators hallways and rooms are tired and in need of some serious refreshing the room was fairly large for nyc but everything from carpets to bed covers to the bathroom needs to be repaired replaced or refreshed there are far more comfortable options nearby its an incredible spot but far from spotless;2

ok so this place is iconic and boasts some undeniably lovely original ny art deco touches in and around the lobby the location for penn and the garden is great and if you get or request the right room on a high floor youâll get a manhatten or new jersey view to die for but it ends there for me firstly itâs vast by my calculation over 1000 rooms which results in long lines for the elevators of which there are 12 and reception at peak times donât doubt theyâre in a constant state of maintenance but this high footfall also means the floors themselves and certain aspects of the rooms are shabby it could do with a refurb in fact on my most recent visit my key card kept failing resulting in 5 minute round trips back down to reception praying there wouldnât be a;2
there were larger issues for this hotel such as poor responses from guest services slow responses for room service requests and poor handling of complaints there were smaller issues like poorly designed rooms improperly installed tvs inefficient elevators etc overall this hotel is one that looks like a five star from afar but once you are in it you can see that it is just a facade the heart of this hotel is two stars;2
from the location point of view yes it is great however for a hilton our experience was poor first of all if they give you a room on the second floor go back and ask for a change of room straigh away there is come sort of heavy machinery or a massive laundry area working 247 and you wont be able to sleep when we got there they changed our room so not very happy about it no free bottle of water in the room get your own or be ready to pay for them the service when you go to the restaurant for breakfast is poor and they believe that is ok to treat people with disrespect so we had to make a point there the walk to universal is only 7 minutes on a hill so be prepare for it thete is also a shuttle availbal from the hotel from 8am the parking is expensive and when;2

i stayed here in 2007 and 2008 and came back again this past week what a disappointment first off there were no glasses in the room there were 2 flat pillow on each of the double beds and the room was so hot we had to have engineering come up about the airconditioner and he told us it was because our room was big big there was less than 2 feet from foot of bed to wall and the bathroom was minute engineering had to finally bring us a fan that we left on for our 3 day stay we called for ice and each time it took over 30 minutes no matter if we called for it at 10 am 5 pm or 10 pm oddly we ran into friends who were staying at the hotel and they too said they would never come back;2
i stayed at this hotel because it is where my review course was held the hotel is nice the bed was comfortable it is close to universal studios and city walk but everything else was not so nice problem list the bathroom was dirty peoples hair was everywhere i had no warm water for showers for both days of my stay even though they said they fixed it only one of six elevators worked got to climb stairs to the 11th floor got my steps in our last night i called to let them know there seemed to be a leak in our hallway floor the carpet was soaked i found this out by almost slipping as i stepped onto the tile floor from the wet carpet i fell asleep before anyone showed up however no one ever did show up that morning i had to walk through;2

at first my sister and i were happy we booked a room here we were hesitant at first because of all the bad reviews but we thought it wouldnt bother us too much since wed be out a lot long story short we got there just to be let down they said there was a leak and our room wasnt available anymore we freaked out just two girls in ny for the first time and without a roomyou could imagine our anger anyway the manager after 2 hours told us he booked us another room in another hostel on the lower eastside when we got to the other hostel there was a mix up and we had to wait another 12 hours before they finally straightened everything out and gave us a room the only good thing that came out of booking this hostel was getting booked at the other hostel for less;2
the room was teeny i mean so small that we couldnât have a suitcase open and walk by it at the same time there was no closet and only two small hooks for clothes which held 4 hangers when i complained the front desk sent up an enormous clothing rack which was too large to fit in the room the bathroom was passable but just barely the toilet ran constantly unless you adjusted the handle there was no plug in the drain in the sink so you were screwed if you dropped something in the sink the safe was located on the floor which was really awkward to access all in all the hotel needs a makeover the lobby was lovely and the staff was polite so thatâs saying something in new york additionally the location canât be beat luckily we only stayed for 3 nights any longer;2
so there is a bed and a shower but thats about it the clerks are as friendly as the usually are in london not the room seems clean but i found a qtip that was not ours and the floors were dirty the blinding does not cover the entire window so by 600h it was bright the fridge smelled of chees even though we never had chees in it and if someone in the hallway or the next room talked you understood every word and as a topping our room was directly over the smokers area do whenever people smoked we had to close our window i would advice you to ask for a room that isnt into the back jard on the plus side weve seen worse in london and the hostel is located close to the hammersmith station;2

difficult to recommend this hotel to be honest check in process is about the least efficient ive seen anywhere ever i experienced a line 2025 people long with no particular urgency on the part of staff rooms are tiny but functional noise is a problem not from the city outside but from the hallway expect to hear every conversation that takes place outside your door the location is near penn station but not much else frankly so while the price may be right youll likely be happier elsewhere;2

booked a room for 2 adults and 3 children no effort made to accommodate 3rd child and given a blanket and pillow to make our own bed if they cannot accommodate a larger family they should not have accepted the booking rooms and windows very poorly insulated so heard road noise and people talking in corridor as though they were in our room iâll put up with a lot but when you pay over 400 per night i do expect to be able to get a good bightâs sleep;2

for the most part this is a beautiful hotel but it could use a lot of upgrades beginning with the elevators the elevators were off and on the whole time we were there it was a whole process just to get out of the hotel for such an iconic hotel the service and over all experience was a let down they have a morning brunch on sunday that is 15 per person for a muffin and yogurt cupnot really ideal if you are on a budget but at the same time not terrible the staff was rather rude and not helpful at all the location is great its about a 5 min walk to central park and 15 minute walk to times square i would not stay here again;2

what made this hotel appealing was the history behind the building built in 1907 with great architectural detailing accommodated the titanic survivors in 1912 etc i knew that the hotel rooms were small and i was interested in the design of each room using a train cabin as inspiration i feel however that the execution of this concept was poor the rooms were musty had bad temperature control and didnt appear to be the cleanest perhaps they were using colorspatterns typical to what was used and popular in 1907 but i think they could have made these fabrics a bit brighter to add liveliness to the rooms this historical building also has small windows so the designer should have kept this in mind when selecting the fabrics colors and lighting techniques the;2

we have spent four nights here before we arrived we have read the reviews and they were all pretty positive and we can certainly see the appeal the location the atmosphere as long as you do not need any space besides the place for sleeping it is satisfactory but heres the thing as long as you have two luggages which to be honest fair amount of tourists have it is virtually impossible to live in the room that is not an overstatement with two luggages on the ground there isnt space for any movement for any manipulation for nothing so when we went out we delayed ourselves just because one of us had to do the business with the luggage and the other had to be on the bunk and then switch the corridors are fairly clean but there is a cigarette smell the bathrooms;2

we stayed at astor for five nights upon entering the room we noticed one of the windows had been sealed with tape we soon realised this was due to the cool breeze which was able to seep in though into the room the heating was a major problem especially for a winter stay and extremely temperamental for at least two nights there was no heating at all making the room unbearably cold the shower seemed to only have two temperatures scalding hot or ice cold some of the staff were very helpful though one member was extremely rude and acted as if everything was an inconvenience the highlight of the stay would have been the stray cats which we were lucky enough to have a clear view of from of window;2

the great thing about the new yorker is the location right in midtown you can easily reach most of manhattans must see spots as well as being conveniently placed for shopping the hotel also has the fantastic tick tock 24 hour diner which is great for breakfast unfortunately thats where the good stuff ends the second we stepped out of the lift and saw the dull brown depressing corridors we nearly turned back our room was tiny a corner room with two queen beds there was literally no space to move around the room let alone store a suitcase the decor was old and tired the tv didnt work at all and the bathroom looked like something from an old movie under no circumstances would i ever return to this hotel again there are so many choices in manhattan do;2
ill start with the positives first the location is brilliant right opposite the lincoln centre and easy to get to everywhere else the staff are helpful and there is a great bar area in the lobby the bed in our junior suite was also exceptionally comfortable and then the negatives first and foremost and the reason why this hotel will never get another cent of my money is the lack of free internet its free in the lobby but you then have to pay for it in the rooms in this day and age this is totally unacceptable in the 1950s you were charged extra to have a hot bath times have changed and you would not dream of charging people extra for hot baths in a hotel of this type in new york today and the world of communication has also changed internet access like hot;2

whilst the room was ok clean enough and with mini fridge and cupboard this was not a nice place to stay due to nightly noise obviously you expect some amount of noise in such a large place but doors here do not shut quietly and due to the tiled floors and lack of insulation the whole floor seems to reverberate each time a door slams shut and that was a frequent occurrence earplugs dull the noise slightly but our lack of sleep here was maddening put something on the doors also the shared bathroom facilities are quite nice but the showers are bizarre with a push button that lasts only 18 seconds barely long enough to soap up and no shelf for clothes wifi also expensive for a place this size i wont be back;2

so on arrival the hotel looks quite grand dont be fooled the hotel rooms are on floors 1940 floors 118 is student accommodation the hotel is very run down and tired very old fashioned and constantly smells of weed the rooms are not very nice very old and feel dirty the bathrooms are quite disgusting and you cant open any windows there is no tea or coffee facilitiesno drinking water and no fridge the hotel has an italian restaurant which is lovely and an american diner which is fairly average the location of this hotel was the main issue for us 34th street has got a massive drug and homeless problem everywhere you turn every street corner or shop doorway there is someone rolling a joint injecting drugs into themselves or being sick i have never experienced;2
there were pros and cons to this hotel the pros were its proximity to universal studios its a 5 min walk so even though theres a shuttle bus provided after the first day we found it was just as quick to walk the rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy and theres a small starbucks in the hotel the cons were that the check in staff didnt give a very warm welcome and i felt like we received worse service because we were obviously tourists and not business customers it also took a long time to check in and it was a long walk from the car park to the desk and rooms the hotel is mostly carpented in public areas and it was really difficult to wheel our luggage across the thick carpet parking costs 25 dollars per night which soon adds up the room was clean enough;2
for my wifes birthday i decided to take her on the vip tour at universal studios and the hilton seemed like the appropriate place to stay for our 4 day sojourn this is the first time i have stayed at a hilton in a while so here is an unabashed review of the facility the hotel is nice and pleasant with all the amenities one would expect from such a place transportation to universal studios is excellent with a bus arriving every 15 minutes but now let us go into the room and see what awaits us the room is large and spacious welllit and accommodating likewise the bathroom is very large with all the traditional items one would require now down to details the bed has a comforter on it which is way too warm fortunately i found a solo blanket in the closet and;2

we stayed 4 nights at empire hotel at end july initial expectations were good when we arrived in the lobby its nicely decorated and has has a lux feel however the rooms dont live up to this ours was on the 1st floor so barely slept through the noise outside theres no double glazing the decor was tatty and felt old there is nowhere to put bags so with 4 people and luggage it was chaos we chose this hotel because of the pool however if rain is forecast it closeswe didnt get to use it once access to the pool is a grotty stair then an underwhelming rooftop area pool looked dirty but since we didnt go in i cant confirm we paid 250 a night for this not worth it pay more elsewhere or same for better room;2

it is a very average hotel with extremely bad customer service first my husband needed to print out a document and was told that they could not provide such a service then some packages were sent to him during his stay and although we contacted the hotel in advance to ask if there would be any fee and was told that none at the moment of getting them he was charged 2 dollars per box when asked why we were told there would be no charge the answer was that probably it had been a trainee who said that by mistake but they do not care and we must pay it turned out that one of the packages was going to arrive late at the day of leaving the hotel we offered to pay for resending this item to another us address but got a refusal in a rude form generally speaking when;2

the only good thing to be said about this hotel is its location if you are looking for a hotel in the upper west side then the location is perfect very close to the subway relatively quiet just great beyond that this hotel has nothing going for it i paid a total of 333 a night including all the taxes for a dingy shabby very miserable hotel awful room terrible service and attitude of front desk staff things promised on the booking confirmation did not exist and there was a couldnt care less attitude of all staff i encountered i would never go back there at that price you can do much better;2

completely average think motel rather than hotel this is budget accommodation rooms very basic very tiny but clean central heating poor we had to request an additional portable heater no catering just vending machines in basement this is an old building that has received a recent facelift minor irritations with poor quality finish not as good as picures would suggest in our opinion just a bit too far out of town at 106th st some rooms have park views but nothing special happening at this end of the park if you are an experienced visitor and just need somewhere to sleep this would be fine for first time visitors to the big apple pay the extra and get closer to the city we would not use this hotel again;2

my dad sister and i are all moving to new york and are staying here for 5 days until we get our place to live this hotel is nice and modern and beautifully decorated but their service is the worst i have ever witnessed in my life and i travel a lot so ive been to a lot of hotels this hotel has terrible service and charges expensive and unnecessary fees for little tiny things such as cleaning and having a trained animal terrible service not worth the decor not to mention that paying for a bigger room such as a junior suite is not worth it seeing as its not much bigger or worth the money;2
i am extremely unsatisfied as to how things were conducted at this hotel as far as parking i was not made aware of the 60 a day parking fee before i arrived then after checkout when reviewing my credit card bill i noticed i was charged twice for parking when i called to question the double charge on my bill i was informed that since i had my car parked at 1030 am on the day of my arrival but did not pick my car up til 1130 the following morning even though check out time is noon that i was charged for an addition day of parking 60 for one addition hour especially when i was not made aware of these charges til after the fact i think this is an absolute load of crap and am very displeased with the whole situation;2
we stayed here because of the location right aacross the street from lincoln center the room was so tiny you couldnt open the bathroom door and see the toilet the bathroom and room was very dated despite their comment of being recently remodeled lobby has a boutique feel other than the room being very small for 449night the only postive was the location a big negative was the rooftop bar we couldnt get to go because it was reented out for a private event and then at 930 pm when others were allowed to go up hotel guests had to join the same line as nonhotel guests which i think is absurd needless to say the one grat part of the hotel we couldnt enjoy;2
the hotel itself is nice and the employees are very helpfull though there are a lot of noises commimg from the streets since the windows are very thin the pool is also much smaller than on the picture on the webside;2

upon arrival they gave us a room that the bed wasnt big enough for my daughter and i to sleep in and the sheets were dirty and ripped tv did not work they came up to give us new sheets and expected me to change my own sheets which should have been clean to begin with they changed our room and there were no light bulbs and the room was filthy they straightened it up but i still felt that the room couldnt get clean the carpets were stained and sticky the staff for the most part did try to work with what they had i have stayed in 2 star properties but was glad to leave this one behind;2
i can see now why there are mixed review s originally i stayed on the executive level i had paid for a regular that was pleasant the tv and wifi wasnt working but at least everything seemed cleaned and comfortable and what i would expect of a 3 star hotel but then they moved my room which is basically any room below the 12th floor my bed is a double when they say its a queen the wallpaper is molded and coming off my bed sheets barely fit and are ripped the carpet smells like smoke even though apparently this is non smoking and the air conditioning takes up the whole window which makes this room seem even smaller plus the wifi and tv are still not working thank goodness im out of here tomorrow it cannot come soon enough the thing is if the concierge;2
my husband booked a weekend getaway for a concert at msg so he chose the new yorker based on location we arrived at 6pm on a friday night and waited at the desk for 45 min to check in only to be told that the room type he booked was not availableat 6pm ok so they gave us another room with two double beds as we had no time to wait around for the original room the room was clean but beware those double beds are tiny im 55 and my feet were at the end of the bed we were determined not to let it ruin our evening but come on for what you pay for a hotel in nyc there were other options which we will choose next time;2

just returned from a 4 night stay the hotel lobby was art deco impressive but our room left a lot to be desired we had a twin double bed on the 22nd floor the room was tiny only just big enough for one double and not at all like the rooms pictured on their website badly in need of renovation there was also some outside work going on as there were ropes outside our window but we were out all day so it didnt bother us should really have complained asked to be moved but im not one to cause a fuss it was easy to get around from there one block from penn station and 10 minute walk to times square;2

we stayed in a captains cabin so i cant complain about the space it was maybe a little overpriced for the amount of room we got but somewhat in line with a regular hotel but the noise was worse than ive ever experienced in any hotel there seemed to be a window open all night but we couldnt find where there is a nightclub downstairs and the loud conversations drunken screaming and horn honking were all clearly discerable until the place closed down at 400 it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a loud party i give a poor rating rather than terrible because the day staff was very helpful and friendly after dark the nightclub staff apparently takes over and they are very very unfriendly even trying to block us from entering the building if you;2

this hotel is to be avoided like the plague if you are the least bit fussy the rooms are tired with furniture that is damaged or at best well worn the state of cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired and general hotel facilities and services are almost nonexistent the staff tried their best in the circumstances and the hotel is fairly well situated overlooking the top end of central park although a high standard of hotel accom is not crucial in a city like ny the lack of it it certainly spoilt our holiday the actual experience of the hotel in no way matched the visual impression given on its website we accept that tariffs are reasonable but this is no excuse for the the standard of accom and serices offered should have really complained more whilst there but there did;2

this will only be a short review about the hotel first of all i would like to say the hotel is clean and tidy and i found the staff to be helpful and friendly there is not much at the hotel except for a small room downstairs where u can get a drink from the vending machine and use the internet access the rooms in the hotel are small and very basic the heating does make a lot of noise so if your a very light sleeper this will affect you you can also hear the tube going up and down so this also can be a pain if your a heavy sleeper like myself you should be fine there is not a lot of space to hang and put your clothes so we kinda lived out of our suitcase for the five days we were there the lift also has a mind of its own and you will be lucky if you can fit 4 people in;2

good location is the only reason to stay there the room was small and poorly light the bathroom was very small there was basically no furniture except for the bed and and a small desk there was a straight back chair with stains on it there was nowhere to put your clothes so you basically lived out of your suitcase the wifi did not work this place was a real piece of work i would never stay there again;2
not a bad location for a hotel however these days i am not sure it is pardonable not to have wifi thrown into the package that definitely takes away two stars in my opinion i guess you can add the price of wifi to the bill as a strategy but asking guests to pay for wifi usage in the rooms is kind of outdated stayed here for two days good thing about the location is the convenience store nearby and a starbucks at the street corner too;2

my cousin a friend and i booked to stay for 8 nights at this hotel and got what we thought was a bargain when we 1st arrived wed thought we had done okay as it seemed like a smart pleasant little hotel the room seemed fine apart from the room opposite which absolutley reeked of stale smoke and sweat we think the room belonged to someone who worked there as the lock on the door was an old key lock the shower leaked when we used it but apart from that for the 1st couple of days we thought things were okay we was made aware we cpuldnt call out from our room as we had pre paid our room bill and they didnt want us running up a huge bill and not paying for it which we thought was fare enough but then when we tried to call into the hotel phone it kept getting diverted to;2
the location is fab however on departure they claimed we were due to be charged an additional fee that wasnât included in our confirmation despite our confirmation stating all fees and taxes were included no explanation of this fee or communication from them since our stay when iâve queried it and followed up so beware leaving your card and insist on a receipt which the receptionist did not give me;2
the only good about this hotel is the location when you view the pictures of the rooms hotel it looks great but in person its a major disappointment the room is very small and tight as well as the bathroom you barley have any room to do your business the tv is small the prices are high the hotel charges an additional 27 nightly because of their self proclaimed great wifi and other bs amenities this place nickels dimes their customers you get charged a 2 dollar fee just to leave your luggage for a few hours after check out if you have money to blow this is the place to stay;2
after departing from a nasty air bnb we had booked and sadly paid for we had to look for a budget hotel and chose days inn very pleasant reception staff on arrival and during our stay nice looking foyer sadly the room wasnt nice or pleasant however in need of an overhaul especially the bathroom which was a bit evil and for some reason had no cold water just warm and hot no fridge in the room just a space where one once lived hotel is close to subway and not too noisy apart from the ac units or ice machine if you are unfortunate enough to score that felt it was a bit overpriced for what you get a spruce up with some paint or even clean grout would help a lot;2

the only thing good about our stay at the empire was how nice and clean the room and hotel was in general unfortunately that is the only thing that was pleasant about our stay when we checked in we were supposed to be given a waiver explaining that we would be charged an extra hundred dollars per night for insurance purposes and after check out the money would be given back we were given that waiver on day two of our stay after we asked why our account was charged an extra two hundred dollars the hotel charged my card three times before they told me that my card was declining i showed them my bank statement showing the charge for the hotel as a pending charge and they basically called me a liar how could i post a fake charge to my account to further prove that they did;2
this is a dealbreaker for me the bathroom has a sliding door which doesnt close all the way its not a mechanical issue it was designed this way ive seen this at other hotels mainly in florida bathroom doors that either arent there or dont allow for sufficient privacy if you are the kind of person who likes to defecate within view of your significant other then i dont want to know you you need psychiatric help ill put this as clearly as possible all hotels need bathroom doors which close completely blocking out all sight and sound this one doesnt meet that requirement furthermore i know this should be obvious but this hotel is right next to the airport i dont know if some people consider that a plus but heres what it means you have a horrible;2

i went in this hotel for the second time last month always on a business trip the first time i was there my collegue and i we were quite satisfied about it even if it has not a good quality for price rate and we decided to come back but we had a very bad experience last time the room was smaller compared to the previous time and quite dirty ive even found a used napkins on the floor of our room but the worst thing was the fact that the boiler of the hotel broke up and all the guests had to stay without hot water for two days and at the reception they were assuring that the inconvenience would have been solved fast well 25 days without hot water in winter time is not a short time and the only thing the hotel has done was giving the guests the free entrance to a close;2
on the surface it looks like a nice place but our stay was less than satisfactory i stubbed my toe on the metal bed frame the very first night housekeeping didnt replace cups and or washcloths during our 5 day stay when asked to bring up ice which was not available on our floor it took way too long the worst part was that you could hear everything out on the street at night especially the garbage trucks at 2 am that lasted for over an hour i think they need to improve their windows as i have stayed in nyc before and never heard this much noise on top of all that we payed an average of 300 per night i have stayed in less expensive places in nyc that were much better;2

i booked this hotel as one of the few which catered for single travellers in new york with the added bonus of it being in the west village location was great few minutes to subway and lots of evening options close by it is however on the side of the main road running alongside the hudson this made for lots of traffic noise constantly better windows would easily rectify this problem i was relieved that the noise from the barclub was not an issue for me and i had read lots of reviews that it could be very loud the room was fine as expected it was tiny but enough for what i needed wifi was available in the room and although a bit slow it was fine for what i needed the bathroom also was fine clean and with really good showers my main bugbear was the fact that;2

traveling solo i did not mind the smallish room which i thought was nicely appointed the bathroom was fine hot water plentiful and nice rainfall shower maid service was excellent i did not use the internet or room service nor did i eat the pricey snacks and coffee in the room despite the positives the big problem that overwhelmed all else was the very noisy fan in the air conditioning unit which literally sounded like a working lawnmower motor i tried two rooms and was finally told by staff that the air conditioning units were noisy in all the rooms i had to turn the air conditioning unit off to sleep fortunately the weather was cool so while the room was warm and stuffy at night it was survivable otherwise i would have immediately changed hotels despite the;2

we had to change our room 3 times due to mold that was clearly visible on the bathroom doorframes there were fruitflies in 1 of the rooms our 3rd room had no mold but a yellow stain on the duvet gross housekeeping told us that mold is a known problem in the hotel surprised that we werent offered some sort of a credit for all our inconvenience was there for a job interview for my daughter rather than being early having time to relax we spent the day waiting for them to prepare another room only to find it was also dirty took about 2 hours until we finally got into a room on the bright side the doorman was amazing and so was the concierge location was great if youre looking to be away from the hustle bustle of times square quick walk to central park;2
just back from new york and spent 4 nights at this hotel as it was our first time visiting we wanted something quite central which it was its a 30 min walk to central park and not far from times square and macys so the points definitely go for location the not so positive aspects of the hotel is the rooms walking into the hotel reception you get a positive feeling as its nice but upstairs its very disappointing we were on the 21st floor with a view of the empire state building which was good the room itself was tiny and had a tiny bathroom you could not display anything the wardrobe was small and there was hardly any room to move about in and it was really dated and looked like it needed a good clean i would say it was probably a 2 or pushing it a 3 star at most;2

we booked our reservation after checking out the website of the hotel looked appealing thats our first mistake checked into our room about 300pm and promptly realized that there was no air conditioning working and the temp was in the 80s outside called the front desk and i was notified that someone would take care of it immediately at about 9pm a ac tech came to out room and told us that he couldnt fix it and gave us 2 fans we were told we would have another room in the am the next day after continuously calling the front desk they moved us to a larger room at around 4pm we were not happy as you may have expected they offered us breakfast coupons well in the end they offered us a 100 credit for a room that cost about 400 a night plus tax thats;2
we stayed at this hotel for 7 nights the lobby area is lovely the rooms are ok however the air condition is ridiculously noisy making it unusable when you are actually in the room the lack of a door or screen on the shower means the bathroom floor is soaked every time you use it we were very disappointed that the room we were given looked out onto other rooms so close you may as well be sharing and were above a dingy yard staying for 7 nights you would expect better than this the rooftop was closed for private functions on most nights they let us up there one night even though it was a private function as it was late and charged 34 for a double gin after telling my daughter it would be 16 rooftop pool is extremely small we had to pay 150 deposit on arrival and;2

of cause it is understandable that hotels in capitals or cultural centers of the world are tremendously expensive and thus when we look for accommodation we try to fit price location and quality in some reasonable margin this is exactly what i did sometime back when i first time traveled to usa i picked new yorker first for its location which is convenient but for active travellers who can walk through ny city center in 6 hours as i did the location wasnât that drastically important after all the price i remember was average buy when i arrived they took quite big deposit and almost the same amount at the cost of my 7 days stay this didnât help me in budgeting my stay for next week thanks god i did have some funds additionally to not starve there to death it was;2

this hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary the decor in the room was dull and beige my room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal not much light was let in from the window while the bedding was new and updated the furniture seemed old and dated the worst aspect of the room was the plumbing and heating controls the dual hot and cold water controls in the shower were unstable and hard to control it resulted in the temperature vacillating from scalding hot to freezing cold the tub surround also had been updated with new tile but the tub was old and worn in appearance it took an extra ten minutes to take a shower to maintain the water at a comfortable temperature the room was drafty and it felt like turning the heat;2

when booking a hotel in new york unless you are prepared to spend big bucks more than 600 a night you have to make some compromises for the price of a 5 hotel in most other cities in americaeurope you get at best a 3 hotel ill start with the good points the beds are comfortable its very well located for the upper west side now the bad points we had decided to splash out and book a junior suite number one point no closet there was a hole in the wall covered by a curtain within which was also the safe and the minibar this meant that jackets could not hang straight down there were also only two small drawers to keep all your clothes in also we had no daylight the room overlooked an interior space you had to crane your neck to see the sky the air;2

we wanted a queen bed which i reserved online then my son joined us and i called the hotel to arrange for a room that could accommodate a rollaway bed apparently the rooms are so small that a special room had to be selected that could accommodate the rollaway bed when we arrived there was no special room reserved for us the staff at the front desk kept asking what was the name of the person you spoke with as if that could make the room appear in the end we got a room with two double beds and virtually no window and various explosive sounds from other rooms including a constant ventilation noise with the 62 required daily fee added for free overseas phone calls free internet use of the fitness center and taxes i wouldnt stay here again i had loved it;2

it may be unfair to write a true review as i ended up not staying here i did have a reservation i did show up and check in i did go up to my room at that point i pretty much headed back to the desk and checked out first the place smelled moldy and the communal bathrooms which are very communal smelled like they hadnt been cleaned in days the room was so small that next to the bed there was not actually room for both me and my suitcase to fit in the room with any space left for movement the lighting system is bizarre the wifi was nonexistent five minutes was enough to have me leave the only saving grace was the friendliness and understanding of the desk clerk who checked me out without charge though with the comment this happens all the time dont worry;2

i stayed 2 nights in this hotel because my graduation was across the street at the lincoln center first kudos to the staff the doormen and front desk staff are super nice and quick to help my only complaint is the actual facilities having paid just under 1k for 2 nights i feel my room was too dirty and deteriorated my bathroom door looked like it had exploded and someone spackled it back together however my biggest complaint is about the many white crusty stains throughout the room especially above both beds the pics are one of each of the two beds if you use a black light im sure the room would light up like a christmas tree gross please if youre going to have fabric headboards andor texturized wallpaper implement appropriate cleaning routines;2

we booked it because of the price hotels were very high priced at the start of the 2019 holiday season and we found the windsor on a booking website that in itself was an issue since i was booking for 4 people two adults two teens the booking website allowed four of us but the windsor insisted we had booked a room for three people i had confirmation for four many emails between the windsor and us and between the booking company and us and we were forced to upgrade for 35 per night to a larger room to accommodate the four of us i should have cancelled then but rooms were outrageous the week we were planning to be there so i agreed to the the extra 35 a night and hoped for the best we were on the top floor 7 aka the penthouse which i dont think had been rented;2
the price is right for the location of this hotel but you should be aware that it has many problems and you have to endure many annoyances during the stay we experienced a constantly running toilet very uneven floor surface divots covered with carpet interminably slow and tiny elevators and spotty room service we actually came in late one day to find that the room hadnt been cleaned at all despite these problems we found the management to be sympathetic and fairthe manager actually took a little off of our bill;2

to begin the location is pretty good because of the proximity to the empire state building and penn station lots of subways go by this place however staying next to the busiest corner of the city makes it impossible to open the window at any time because of the noise and the lights if youre looking for some quiet time when back home at night you might like to find a place above the 59th st or south soho west village tribeca brooklyn im generally not very sensitive to noise of any kind yet i havent experienced something that much overwhelming so far you have to know that 34th st where the hotel sits is one of the busiest street in the whole city day and night moreover i dont think it would be appropriate to call it cleaning but hey thats what its;2

we stayed at this hotel late julyearly august 2005 it is conveniently located near the freeway and is not a bad place however it does have some problems and we shall not use this hotel again the entire hotel looks slightly run down and heavily used some furniture is marred in the rooms i was surprised at the lackadaisical attitude of the hotel staff to say they are not very ambitious is an understatement the room next to ours had some very distracting loud children who kept banging and laughing when i went to the understaffed front desk to complain rather than offering an apology and a room change i was asked if i had called security i demanded a room change and got one although we did not receive any offer to help us move our first room had a small;2

this hotel knows that you will only visit once and therefore seeks every opportunity to extract additional cash beware the facility fee charge slipped under your door sometime during the middle of the nightquestioning this unexpected charge you will be blandly told that it is all made quite clear in the paperwork dont expect them to mention it at check in though then there are the queuesqueues to check in queues to check out store your bags for a fee of course queues to collect your bags speak to the polite but oh so indifferent staff queues are the new yorker way however room facilities fine but worth the hassle not sure;2

i stayed with my partner for a 3 day break at the astor on the park we arrived late at night so we have a quick check in although the receptionist didnt seem very happy to see usas this seemed to disturb his rest the room was very small and basic but clean there was only one small window overlooking the inside court of the hotel there were some facilities an alarm clock and tv with very bad reception in a wardrobe the bathroom was also very small and basic but clean it wasnt easy trying to work out how to use the shower and the receptionist didnt explain very well after calling her there was also one hairdryer which didnt work due to the lack of facilities there wasnt much to judge the service on other than our interaction with the reception staff which;2
on first glance from the outside going into the lobby the empire hotel gives the appearance of a modern day hotel which cannot be anything further from the truth our stay began with one catalogue of errors after another fawlty towers springs to mind on arrival we were met with the the most miserable unhelpful rude young lady it was clear from her tone that she was not happy to answer any questions so once i asked one question that was me done the elevator from the lobby had a very odd smell once we reached our floor i felt as though i was in the movieâ the shiningâ i had been transported back to the seventies the corridor boasted the most out dated wallpaper iâve ever seen in a hotel when we got to the room we were exhausted and it was late so you can;2
the service both reception and cleaners do not speak good english and are rude rooms are so noisy doors make a lot of noise when closing and there is a lot of people in the corridors as well as people walking no soundproof at all there was also noise from outside because there is a building site under construction in the same street there is nothing to hang your clothes while having a shower wifi is not free they charge you if you want to use wifi the hostel is 2min walking from hammersmith tube bus station there is a minimarket with food in the reception with really good prizes;2

negatives hotel is advertised as a 4star more like a 23 star room size not too bad though shower room very small and flooded a lot the view hotel air conditioning units and piping which are very noisy and hotel walls what happened to the lincoln centrecentral park views room service mini bar very overpriced food and drinks expensive pool is tiny and not like the pictures i paid extra for breakfast by the pool seved 811 turned up at 10 one day and 9 another and hardly any food left and what was left there was pretty bad and obviously not edible lifts of the 4 there was always 2 broken and were very slow roof top bar i was turned away as it was too busy with outsiders even though i was staying in the hotel decor is very dated and tatty and in need of a;2
this hotel does have a good location pleasant enough staff and nice decor the trade off is apparently made in room size micro and basic amenities which are missing or for which one must pay extra call me crazy but i do expect to be able to get coffee even bad coffee somewhere in a hotel either the crappy brewityourself or in the lobby nope towels and oddly bathmats were in short supply considering the shower is wide open to the bathroom and puts water all over the floor the pool is hip but waaaay smaller than pictures make it seem unheated as well but it was in the 90s so we didnt care;2
travelling is one thing i love doing and nyc was indeed a dream come true for me looking for accommodation was really tough especially in summer and good thing i was able to get a night at days inn after cancelling my reservation at the jane hotel which i find really too old dirty and unsafe location very strategic literally near the train station when you plan to visit the statue of liberty walking distance to central park and just a short bus away to the time square checkin wasnt rough esp when you are greeted by a friendly staff with my notsogood and friendly experiences in other hotels in america i would say this front desk staff named jasmine was one of the bestsfriendly and professional kudos girl keep it up this industry needs you room well;2
issues at checkin leaking bathroom sink faucet malfunctioning light switches corridor doors slamming all night long and a grumpy bar staff member the only good thing about the property is the club lounge breakfast and the only great thing about the property is the continuous 24 hour shuttle service;2
the positives for so much sharing of restrooms and showers itâs clean the rooms are tiny but also clean josephine at the front desk is so lovely and helpful she was one of the few friendly people there the negatives noah who is a manager and also works in the cafe is incredibly rude and unfriendly he gives off a really bad attitude i would recommend staying away from him unless you want to be treated like shât personally i will never stay in a hotel like this again basically a glorified hostel i cannot stand sharing showers with random men i would go in to use the shower and thereâs an old man in a robe very awkward and uncomfortable granted itâs cheap for the location but again i will never make this mistake ever again to save a few bucks;2
this was one of the very first luxury hotels i stayed in back in 1989 when it was the registry then it was a read destination hotel where you would bump into stars in reception my first visit there i saw bob mitchum and karl malden yes it was that long ago whilst the hotel does retain some glamour its now horribly mainstream with little other than its great location to recommend it food looks good but is mainly all you can eat buffet style this is great in vegas but la hotel is crowded getting a lift to your room can often take 10 15 mins there is a general feeling of slight decay its frankly not that clean and cost cutting is very much in evidence the phone in our room didnt work and the bed is as hard as rock worse is the fact that in our room at least;2
stayed here when my husband and i decided to go to universal studios horrible mistake but thats another review we arrived around 3pm on a saturday they must have gotten a larger number of travelers than normal because the whole staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off there were maybe five people in front of me but it still took a good 40 minutes for us to get checked in normally if they had said sorry we are running behind or something to that effect i would have let it go but no instead the manager starts pulling people from the hilton diamond line and starts throwing them in front of me when i finally reach the front of the line again not so much as an apology or even an explanation as to why he is placing people in line ahead of me until i;2
pros awesome location quiet and very clean the housekeepers do an excellent job cons extremely shabby rooms with old uncomfortable full size beds with cheap bedding and 90s tvs showers are terrible and there is no space in the bathroom to get ready rooms are small with old stained carpets and extremely dated furniture the hotel posts photos of a few renovated rooms to trick you into booking and does not offer refunds when you discover the true state of the rooms wifi does not work in the rooms in the stairwell they end with 09;2
the hotel location is great but checkin and concierge are very inefficient guests can cut queues nothing works as expected blinds not working very noisy room most hotel staff are great but some are unfriendly one of the worst hotels if not the worst that i have ever stayed anywhere in the us;2
from the minute my fiancã© and i walked into the hotel the obvious lack of customer service was apparent when we were checking in the person behind the counter never even looked up at us introduced himself or welcomed us to the hotel he was very curt with us and seemed like we were inconveniencing him by making him do his job after checking in my fiancã© and i dropped our bags off in what was an extremely small yet nicely decorated room and went down to the lobby bar to get a drink my fiancã© had to do work and since wifi costs 12day in the rooms we were going to try and use it in the lobby my fiancã© tried to access the wifi several times without success he asked multiple people at the desk for assistance they just told him that he had to stand by the checkin;2
so on arrival we were moved rooms into a twin which as a couple we didnt want but they had no alternative we were then told we would have to move the next day so couldnt unpack having done that we were then told to stay in our room fairly shambolic but then it may have been a one off they were as polite as they could be given the circumstances issues slowest lifts on earth literally and ive never been in a hotel in my life without its own restaurant as such the breakfast tokens for the rooftop continental is beyond laughable they have bread rolls and stale croissants rapped in clingfilm for me this is pretty budget given their 350 price tag for a night you can pay for that in dubai europe and hong kong and let me tell you the quality is in a;2

booked 10 nights in this hotel through my travel agent and it was not cheap staff were great room adequate however rooms were booked out to huge groups of college kids which meant no sleep for the last 5 nights felt like i was staying at a backpackers or on school camp terrible one star for staff and one for location;2
the elevators are horrible and probably have not been checked in 5 years the lobby is very sketchy and the hallways are disgusting the rooms were pretty clean but overall it did not feel like a safe environment the front desk never had enough help as there was always 1 person there also when we walked into the lobby one night 2 collegeaged boys were telling the front desk they had opened their door to their room and found an old man asleep in their bed the police were called and dealt with it but it was still very frightening overall not safe unclean and extremely outdated honestly pay the extra cost and stay at the hampton inn or holiday inn;2

we were allocated this hotel as a part of our group package and it appeared to be a good deal as the daily fee they charge to use the fitness centre and have free telephone and wifi was waivered the location is superb right where you want to be to explore wonderful nyc close to subway manhatten empire state building etc first impressions are good also as the foyer bar and reception are all artdeco clean tidy and the staff are very engaging polite and helpful the tick tock 24 hour diner attached to the hotel serves great food and the eggs benedict is out of this world 1010 thus far our booking stated we was in a standard queen room and when we arrived reception informed us that we had been allocated a room without a view and he would upgrade us to a room with a view;2
1st impression after settling into room was the noise level of the traffic below our 5th floor corner suite windows are not triple glazed and could hear every taxi beeping their horn and every bus screeching their wheels into the very wee hours although the bed was very comfortable it did not make up for the noise level the lighting in the room is very poor too low lighted to even read a book chairs in the room were cheap and were creaking apart lamps in room were also cheap and missing switches to manually turn them on bathroom lighting was minimal and off centered from the mirrow couldnt put on makeup in there and had to use hand mirror by the window to see what i was doing as well there was very little space for ones own toiletries for a sutie there;2
the location was perfect for our conference at the new york society for ethical culture it has a lovely lobby the front desk staff was good and the concierge was fantastic im not sure how its rated 4 star my room was like a sauna and the roof top bar and outside noise were unbearable when i called the front desk at 400am to let them know my air unit was on cool and off yet it was still blowing out hot air i was told you know your windows open its usually hot on your floor the second evening was better as i learned to adjust the air by my window openings however the windows being open made the road noise intolerable luckily they provided ear plugs for no charge there was a charge for everything else even the keurig coffee 300 the rooms;2

we booked two nights in a budget room with a double bed it was very hot and there was no ac but no complaints here since it was advertised that budget rooms do not have ac the ceiling fan was whobbling and hitting the ceiling making a noise that i could hear from the next door shared bathroom the location is pretty good you are 3 blocks away from the 110th street subway station which is serviced by the red line that can get you downtown but be advised that it is not an express line and it stops in every single station there is so if you need to get to times square for example you will have 9 stops along the way the most frustrating thing was that the total due on arrival as per the booking information was not in fact the final total due oh yes there were taxes;2

my sister and i traveled to nyc to take in the holiday sights we had four fun packed days planned on our arrival we checked into the days hotel on broadway and 94th another family we knew we also staying in this hotel our room was on a floor that had not been refurbished the other family was on a redone floor our room had no frig or microwave broken tv telephone that did not work you had to email the front desk and only one towel we were only in the hotel to sleep and were quite comfortable as long as the air conditioner was on high it was 20â° outside i would not recommend this hotel for your nyc stay;2

myself and my partner had booked our holiday to nyc through a travel agents so we didnât have much choice as far as hotels went we arrived at the new yorker and immediately were told we had to pay a 250 fee as âinsuranceâ which was the first red flag i was aware that there are city taxes etc but when booking i had asked my travel agent to find out was there any other fees and they had told me there were not going to be after reluctantly paying the 250 we then went up to our room which was probably one of the smallest hotels rooms iâve ever been in i was expecting small but not this small and especially for the price and our view was facing another wall we were also told that our price included breakfast which turned out to only be a pastry and coffee each morning iâm;2
the empire hotel looks great on paper the lounge and reception are still decked out identically to their starring role days in gossip girl but even here the edges are looking a bit frayed and shabby the room was fine and clean enough although there were some stains here and there and bathroom not pristine no complimentary tea or coffee you have to pay per cup for this the rooftop pool was decidedly grubby and closed early when we were there the lift to this floor was also broken we got a bargain price for our room on a website and so did not feel short changed if youre paying full price then i would expect youll be disappointed in its favour the hotel is handy for central park and the kennedy centre;2

arrived for the weekend 2 adults and 2 kids found the hotel in a very accessible location a block from the 96 st subway station the room was ok but in a second glance you can notice a need of a renovation or at list a cote of paint over the doors the shower was not appealing with scratches and marks on the tubs flour and on a cold night like ours was you had to wait forever for hot water while i was waiting to speak to the front desk i heard other complaints of heating that doesnt work misplaced parcels and other calls oh and there was a party on ph level we did not hear it in the room but the common areas were very loud;2

i stayed here in september 2011 having read good reviews on here i have to say i was disappointed the rooms are tiny with a small bed not good for tall people and whilst the bathrooms are clean with decent facilities they are shared between quite a few people this hotel does however have some redeeming features such as the efficiency and helpfulness of the staff the cleanlyness of the place and the history associated with it however for the money you pay you can do a lot better elsewhere on a side issue and not directly related to the hotel whilst the west villagechelsea is great to visit i would not advise staying there for too long as the poncyness of the whole place will get to you for something a bit more genuine and relaxed try the lower east side;2

the lone bright spot was the friendliness of the staff working in the bar and at the front door everything else about this hotel screamed past its prime like a middle aged former high school quarterback still banking his popularity on his play in the big game against the rival team i get it your hotel had a recurring role on cws gossip girl but it is time to let that go and spruce up the place the facility itself is old and crumbling literally in the case of the front desk which is likely why the lights in the hallway and bedrooms provide very little illumination the aesthetic of the hotel is dated the king sized bed i ordered actually turned out to be a full size the room was musty smelling and the inroom ac unit made a wheezing sound the view out;2
we stayed here for 10 nights not your average hotel stay there were 2 of us iâve stayed here before but not for 10 nights for nostalgic reasons and the history of this hotel is why we stayed here we asked for additional towels which were provided but then were taken away from us days later while we were out for the day at 6am each morning the smell of food woke us up not sure where it was coming from since there is no room service at this hotel we had a nice view on the 35th floor but for 2 people the room was small when asked if we could move to another room with more space i was told ânoâ we moved furniture into the closet to make more space the water temperature in the shower ran too hot or too cold it fluctuates on its own the sheets were not changed once the 10;2

stayed at midtown west hotel for only one night was in town for business and stayed at another hotel and needed something simpler for an extra night to sightsee liked the location of mwh but it is very bare bones with the smallest bathroom i have seen in a long time with the sink almost impossible to negotiate the service was fine and the desk clerk helpful and it was clean one thing that struck me was the lack of a reading lamp which gave the room more of a flophouse feel than necessary price was reasonable for nyc and it was a last minute booking but still hope to do better for 170 with taxes fee next time iâll search a little deeper;2

having paid what we would consider good money for a hotel room we were very disappointed in the quality of this place the decor was tired and a bit scruffy it smelt funny and our room could only be described as pokey no tv or wireless internet was available in our room either the staff were variable some were extremely friendly and helpful and others ranged from indifferent to downright surly and incompetent and lets not talk about the lift given a choice i would rather have used the stairs to get to our 8th floor room it would have been quicker two good points it was reasonably clean and had an excellent location the subway was just outside the door and the bus stop for the hop on hop off bus not more than 50 metres away;2

honestly the stay was a complete disappointment charge 600 dollars for a basic room with rust in the shower with used products in the shower not only did i pay 600 for a basic hotel i also had to pay 35 per day for basic parking if iâm paying this amount for a room the minimum would be that you guys covered parking maybe iâm just used to vegas hotels but this was not up to par or up to standards for the price also the water pressure in my room was a joke the sink had better water pressure than the shower the water pressure in the shower was a joke also spent 70 plus tip on breakfast the breakfast was a basic waffle runnywet eggs and bacon nothing in the buffay was worth 70 not to mention the utensils and drink cups or dirty which i had asked my service to;2
rather than air our the particulars i will report that the hotel is perfectly situated across from universal studios and thus very convenient the hotel is under going renovations in the lobbyrestaurant area so it is very noisy and there is no main restaurant everyone is crammed into the bar area for breakfast elevators are extremely slow and they warn of this in a letter on the desk in your room we were there to see a concert at the hollywood bowl plan extra time to get there from the hotel as the bellman has no clue on how to call cabs front desk and security staff need to be trained on how to check in and return lost property bar staff was wonderful;2
this is my 4th visit to new york but first time in this hotel in a good location just a few things put me off to a point i wonât be returning we were being checked in by mohammed who asked us to leave him a review then said heâd waived all the fees of an early check and room with a view we didnât ask for either he must have asked us to leave him a review about 78 times we then got into our room with the phone ringing its mohammed reminding us to leave him a review no joke itâs not want you want or need after a 12hr travel day the rooms are quite small but considering youâre only sleeping in them itâs not a big deal however they do need a deep clean the curtainsnets were covered in thick dust and fluff the lifts are very slow so make sure you donât need to rush;2
before leaving for the us visiting and staying the first time in nyc my partner and i decided to select this hotel because of the reviews we saw in this site and the its central location i have consulted twice with my travel agent here outside the us before making the reservation i told him that for certain reasons my partner and i are unable to share a bed although we would like to stay in the same room the solution was offered also in the hotel homepage site in the form of two beds in a single room after checking this site and consulting with my travel agent he rechecked through his reservation center and reassured us that he asked for a twin bed room ie two separate beds and this is what we will get our voucher indicated this when we got to the hotel after 10pm;2

i loved the bowery and also the maritime and i was excited to stay here i stayed in a captains room it was a profound disappointment there were quite a few things i didnt like the window to the room are prison sized the mattress is uncomfortable the power off thing makes it very uncomfortable in the room on a hot day the housekeeping staff gave me 2 shampoos but no shower gel when i asked for that to be fixed i was brought up 2 conditioners okay the tv signal seemed really off not that i spend much time watching tv in ny but it was kind of annoying the bar downstairs was closed for a private party apparently this happens often also there arent always cabs outside as the hotel is pretty out of the way;2
