It was not the first time that we have stayed in this hotel, as it is well located for shopping and sightseeing. On this occasion the room was cold and despite good glazing was somewhat draughty. Even when the air conditioning controls were set at maximum you needed to be wearing thick clothes to be comfortable. Two requests to reception to resolve the heating problem got nowhere.;2

The location is convenient to Universal Studios and to the red line on the Metro for access to central LA. The room was comfortable and quiet. Housekeeping is definitely sub-par at this hotel however. There was hair on the floor of the bathroom. The plastic vent above the bathroom sink has obviously not been cleaned for a long time, as there was layered dust on it. The biggest problem was that our room was completely skipped for servicing and we came back from a long and hot day to find a room with still unmade beds and dirty towels. We had even made a point of letting housekeeping know when we left the room earlier that day so that they could make use of our absence and access the room. By time we got back in the evening, it was too late for them to offer anything but an;2

We booked our room online but they charged us extra 29$ per night. Our room was small and noisy. It was my first and last staying in that hotel . The location was good . Their price is not reasonable and I am not satisfied at all.;2
Pros: Relatively short drive to Universal Studios / Kodak Theatre from hotel.  Cheaper rate than most hotels near the area ($72/nite). A short 5 minute walk to the metro station.  Cons: Shady area during the night.  Police said there are transients and prostitutes that stand in front of the hotel starting at 11pm.  Do not walk around by yourself in the evening.    Hotel staff were not knowledgeable about surrounding area and terrible at giving directions.  Do not rely on staff giving advice.  Staff were not polite or pleasant when checking in.  They overcharged me and expected me to pay the higher rate even though I was quoted less.  I found only one staff member at the front desk helpful.  The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable but our toilet kept clogging. At least there;2

Got here yesterday...  Although we were told at the agency that we will get a nice room for our honeymoon, we got a less then a standard room, with a view to the service road. We asked for change and they told us that they will check it up... But no answer...  No safety deposit box in the room.  The water pressure at the bath was very law, it was fixed at midnight, after we already took a shower after a long day.  WiFi is over priced, 8$ per day. So far, so bad...;2

"The hotel is very close to where my daughter goes to school, so we thought we would check it out.  I haven't been to any other shared bathroom facilities in NYC, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  The rooms were clean and there were fresh towels, soap and a roll of TP each on the beds when we checked in.  There were 2 bathrooms on our floor and they always seemed to be busy.  The bathrooms were modrately clean.  The hallways, doors and walls were dirty.    If you don't mind sharing a bath and want to save about $100; it's a good alternative.  It is in a very nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  I don't think I would stay there again, because I found sharing the bathrooms with strangers a little bit hard to take.  The Hotel Beacon on 75th is a much better alternative,";2

If you want a good night sleep, this is the last option for you. As it's in the middle of Lincoln center with so many road across - it's impossible to sleep. And oh by the way, the AC units are so old and dangerous, it keeps making striking and squeaking noise if you turn it on. You can also hear everything your neighbors are saying as there is no sound proof. And lastly, I know it's New York but man...the rooms are so small.;2

This hotel is inexpensive and in a good location for those traveling to New York City. This is the best that can be said about this hotel.   If you plan in advance you can find four star hotels for around the same price and they will be well worth it for a few days stay. There are no creature comforts here, no modern amenities. Couple this with weak wireless signals throughout the hotel and you are offline and instep with the dated appearance of the dÃ©cor (which is noticeably falling apart). If it's too much to improve the dÃ©cor of the hotel, at least provide the staff with decent suits. Some of the staff is unpleasant, but it could be a result of larger administrative issues here.  Not a bad place by any means, but not so much of a value as to disregard the amenities and;2

"The location of this hotel is great, close to many of the main attractions in Manhattan. First impressions when you enter the lobby are ""Wow"" as the decor is very retro but tastefully done. This is the only wow factor though! The hotel itself is quite old - you can see this from the poor standard of the bathrooms. The tiles look like they've been on the walls since the hotel was built. Grime has built up around the bath & taps and the room just smelt fusty.  Bed was comfy but bedroom was small, dark & pokey. Decor of bedroom questionable as work work has clearly been damaged and dinted over the years and had just been painted over. Very poor finish. Carpets looked dark & dirty and bedding smelt a bit fusty like it hadn't been aired enough.  What annoyed me most was lack of";2

Thought this would be a great hotel based on the reviews. Location is great, and not much else. The hallways had a wierd smell on our floor and were old and dated. Room had updated bathrooms, but not much else. housekeeping was adequate on most days. five nights and $1200 later, Im not satisfied.;2

The rooftop patio shown in every website is inaccessible for families because they are pushing their nightclub, why we couldn't sit up there for the day is ridiculous.  The bathroom was small and moldy.  I get the small, but what is up with the shower, water gets every where, thus the mold.  The elevator was the slowest I have ever seen and they have another set (oh, it's just for the rooftop nightclubbers) again, couldn't you allow your guests use of it during the day?;2

We spent two nights (Friday and Saturday) in a double room with a private bathroom. Pros: Great location, close to the tube station and nice quiet neighbourhood. Reasonably clean room and bathroom. Cons: We stayed on the bottom floor which was extremely noisy all night. Every ten minutes we could hear people loudly moving around in the corridor outside. Our room was close to the elevator, which pings every time the door opens. The first night we didn't sleep at all. The staff were quite rude and unfriendly. The shower didnÂ´t work properly and just had a weak dripping of water. The room was very small, basic and cold feeling. The communal areas were not appealing to spend time in.  Although the price is reasonable for London, if you want to get a good sleep then do not stay here.;2

I've stayed at Empire during business travel on a few occasions. The service is inconsistent. The heating/cooling system is one thing that is consistently bad. This trip, there were two staff members who were really great (Patrick and Michael). I wasn't impressed with the others.;2
"This hotel is advertised as a 4 star establishment; it is not. No wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby. No working desk in the room. No coffee/ tea facilities in the room. Cleaning is very shabby, some days it seems as though they just made the bed and did nothing else in terms of cleaning. Rooms are very small, I'm talking very small. Aircon is noisy even when it is off.   On the positive; front desk staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is location is perfect; close to Central Park, time square and the MoMa.";2

"We arrived at this hotel to a frosty reception. We had caught an early flight and arrived at the hotel at 10.40am. I was unwell with a bad head cold. We were told that check in wasn't until 4pm and that if we wanted to check in early we would have to pay a fee. Due to a series of early flights we had arrived early at previous hotels throughout the USA and this was never a problem. I needed to rest so we paid the extra and were told we were ""lucky"" there was something available, which came across very rudely. There was no suggestion that they could hold our bags, organise activities for us, or that we could just relax in the lobby or nearby cafe.  The room we were given was just above the lobby. The furnishings were old, as was the bathroom. There was no minibar and the room was";2

"It may be unfair to write a true review as I ended up not staying here. I did have a reservation, I did show up and check in, I did go up to my room. At that point I pretty much headed back to the desk and checked out. First, the place smelled moldy, and the communal bathrooms (which are very communal) smelled like they hadn't been cleaned in days. The room was so small that next to the bed there was not actually room for both me and my suitcase to fit in the room with any space left for movement. The lighting system is bizarre, the wi-fi was non-existent. Five minutes was enough to have me leave. The only saving grace was the friendliness and understanding of the desk clerk, who checked me out without charge, though with the comment, ""this happens all the time, don't worry";2
The Jane Hotel is well located and cheapish for what it is. The rooms are small but can also be very noisy if located near the street. There is also a nightclub under the hotel which pumps until the wee hours, I found it hard to fall asleep until well after 1:00 am. Not what you want when you are trying to recharge for another days sightseeing in NYC.  I was staying on the 3rd floor and there were some strange odours coming from somewhere. Not sure if it was smoke or the carpets or what. There were also a few noisy inconsiderate people who like to slam doors, talk etc at all hours of the night.    The ventilation / heating can also make the rooms very warm. One day I was there the outside temp was near 90 so to cool down I had to use the window mount Aircon which sounds like an;2
Like most things in New York City, The New Yorker Hotel is very tired and in desperate need of an overhaul. Many of the rooms are absolutely tiny with signs of wear and tear everywhere and heating and a/c systems clearly decades old. The impressive art deco roots of this hotel are simply not enough to hide the fact that this hotel just isnât very good at all.;2

It was my last night in LA, I just wanted to chill and eat good in a cool hotel but I just ended up paying 223 dollars for mediocre service and food.

"Wife and I stayed here yesterday night, a layover trip on our way elsewhere.  The Good: The staff in every facet were wonderful; friendly, professional, willing to joke around with talkative guests. If I told them a need, they were delightfully responsive. The amenities are acceptable.  The Bad: Located right by the highway, and overlooking it, the traffic noise was clearly audible from the 19th floor, enough to keep me from sleeping well. The walls are also, apparently, fairly thin. While I don't begrudge adults their nocturnal engagements, I'm not terribly interested in listening in.  The Ugly: The bathroom shower. Whatever their intentions, this particular aspect of a deluxe room is sadly (and very profoundly) lacking the option of taking a normal shower. Caveat: this was a";2
"The Premier Inn at County Hall has really gone downhill since we last stayed here. Surprisingly, the last time we were here the hotel also said they were âunder refurbishment â. The breakfast, as always, was varied, fresh and good value. It is the hotel itself that is in poor shape. The room amenities are virtually non-existent, the towels are threadbare, the furniture is old and in poor shape. The location is superb, and probably why most people stay here. The wifi bears special mention... Without doubt it is the most pathetic excuse for included wifi i have tried to use... It is extremely difficult to contact the hotel. I tried 13 times to call the hotel from Canada without success; they simply did not answer. I finally was able to communicate through the Messenger app. A";2

"Let me start by saying I hate to write this review. I don't like to complain. And I do speak to management before doing something like this to give them an opportunity to correct an issue. I did that and I wasn't confident they care (details below). Plus, there wasn't just one issue but a host of them that made me write this. I write plenty of other glowing reviews, so I don't write this lightly.   In short the hotel looks nice but once you get to the front desk the staff is rude.  With that said, I decided to book this hotel despite some reviews. I thought if the worst people can complain about is ""slow wifi"" I'll be okay. I had two friends stay here before and they said it wasn't a problem, and that they liked the hotel, so I figured I might as well. Boy was I wrong!  Let's";2
3 of us to a room. One double bed one single bed in a corner. Barely any space for our luggage.  Went and spoke to management to get another room they tried charging em 750$ per night that's MORE than what I paid for my flight and hotel together so whatever guess I have to slum it.  Bathroom was ridiculously small oh and we all got flea/bug bites.  Breakfast was included which was very small area and they ran out of food a lot it was buffet and some people couldn't have 1 or two sausages they had to have 6 or 8. They should have had someone serving so they didn't run out of food every day. We were here for 3 days I love New York and I'm here often. Usually staying in Brooklyn area with family.

Location was great: No. 5 bus a couple of minutes walk away.  72nd street subway 5 mins walk.  Diners & restaurants close by.  Easy to get to all the top locations.  Quiet residential area.  Seemed to be a very safe neighbourhood.  Room was basic.  Clean linen every day.  Carpet was dirty.  Bathroom & shower very close to my room and were seldom in use when I wanted them.  Shower was old, but clean.  But toilet didn't get cleaned for the 3 nights I was there - this was not acceptable at all.  I didn't spend any time in the room apart from sleeping, so it is just as well!!   So if you plan to be out all day & don't want to spend much money (by NY standards) and are willing to cross your fingers to hope the toilet has been cleaned, this is the place for you!;2
Dark and dreary.. lobby was being renovated.. WiFi is additional for rooms.. this is more like a motel. In fact I would recommend one over this.. staff were friendly for New York standards however as for something and 2 days later was told it was on its way.. checked out a week later and still no sign or mention of the I phone docking station that was to be in the room. This hotel has the potential of being great but not quite getting there on all frontsðdisappointing to say the least.;2
Overall we were disappointed. The worst thing in the hotel is the fact that the entire hotel lobby was not heated although the temperature outside was in the mid 40s. We were freezing and as a consequence nobody wanted to stay in the lobby. Room service was average to poor (in many occasions we had to call to get the right number of towels). The small bottle of mineral water in the room is sold for the ridiculous price of $7.5 !! The only positive note is the location, one block away from Central Park.;2
Bed bugs..very gross........expired body wash (the expiration date on the package was 2 years ago!)  super dirty rooms...I can see trash hidden behind the bed.... it's located at a great spot that is close to subways and food  but I will never want to come back again because of those cleanliness issue.;2

Stayed at this hotel for our summer vacation. Location is good (Just in front of Central Park and 3 blocks from subway station) but rooms are tiny and the second night we found a huge roach in the room. If you're traveling on a budget I guess it's ok, but otherwise stay some place else!;2
"I booked via an online agency. When I checked in, I was told that in addition to the advertised room rate, I would be required to pay an additional non-optional $29 per night ""facility fee"", to cover usage of the in-room telephone, the business center and the fitness center, even though I did not wish to make use of these facilities. When I subsequently checked the booking details, I did notice the fee buried in the fine print, but it was not prominently displayed when I booked. I would advise other travellers to check carefully before booking whether the hotel is going to levy this fee. As a result of this experience, I won't be returning to this hotel.";2
It met the minimum only because the bed was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep. Other than that, it was a real disappointment. The internet didn't work. There were only two small elevators that left many people waiting for long periods. Promised amenities (such as a morning newspaper) never appeared . . . the little things just kept piling up! I got the impression that ownership is milking this facility for as much as they can get before they dump it.;2
We love this hotel but the price and what I get for $428 is not worth it. We had the park and fly 7 nights and for that price no way.  It was $289 in 7/2017.  This is not a value.  Staying at the Sherton next time.;2
The hotel itself was decent. It was well kept and very clean. The 1bdrm rooms are small, but clean. We did have a complimentary coffee pot, microwave and fridge in the room, but the coffee pot didn't work. Not crazy about the staff. Phoned for a wake-up call and never received it.  On our second night our key wouldn't work, had to get new room keys issued. Asked front desk for the best directions to a TV show taping. It was a good thing I mapped it out on mapquest before hand, or we wouldve went way out of our way. We were given the incorrect directions. If you are doing any sight seeing outside of hollywood, best to map your own directions just to be safe.  Also, ask for a room away from the busy street, or you will hear sirens all night as well as traffic/people talking. Not;2
We arrived early and stored our bags which was helpful, unfortunately the check in experience wasn't good at check in in time.

The room was nice, the beds were comfy. We chose this hotel for the buffet at cafÃ© Sierra only to have our reservation cancelled 3 days before because the cafÃ© has shut.

"I have stayed near here before and the location is fantastic so when I saw this hotel online at  such a good price I went for it....man be careful!  The initial room was poor so they changed me to another that was marginally better, all seemd pretty clean (not great though) but the decor is fast approaching end of life, no smoking rooms are optional but in fact all seem pretty smokey, overall not impressed. Was told that they were undergoing a refurb but none of those rooms were available.  No cable TV - in fact NO TV at all and the fitness suite only has 1 running machine and this has been broken for ""some time now"" according to front desk, disappointing. The business suite is a joke - you need credit card just to access the internet and no printing is available - WHAT!  On the";2

I thought for awhile before writing this review because I am not the type of person 'who likes to complain for the sake of complaining' but rather a person who uses this site for what it is intended to 'advise' other travelers. If I had booked through a discounted website then indeed I would not be as apt to write but I paid full price for a very disappointing stay.  I canceled a  reservation at a different hotel and booked the Empire when my son and wife said they could could join me on my stay. Friends had taken us to dinner at Ed's on our last visit and I fell in love with the beautiful lobby and thought the kids would love it. Looking over the reviews I knew the hotel had small rooms so booked the the Deluxe Room King for myself and the Junior Suite King for my son. I was;2
If a great location is what you're looking for, this is a good place to consider as long as you're willing to risk sacrificing the basic services and amenities that other hotels offer. As soon as I tried to check in, I was rudely informed that since I was 18 and not 21 I would be unable to check in, and that I should have known this because it was somewhere on their website. This information was nowhere to be found on Priceline, which is where I booked my room, not to mention the fact that most hotels don't have a minimum check in age anyway, so who would think that a hotel in a major city would have such a restriction? After calling his manager, the guy then told me that it actually was okay for me to check in since I had already paid several hundred dollars for my room online,;2
Hollywood hotel is ok for the price.  Only good thing was the breakfast.  Ice machine on floor 2 was not working entire 5 night stay.  Some outlets donât work in room so hard for four people to charge phones at night.  Lighting horrible.  Only light was lamp in between two beds.  Satellite did not work good.  Beds were hard.  Would not recommend unless you are on a tight budget.;2
Overall Fair but POOR Handicapped accommodations especially at the 3 front steps. The lobby and bar areas were eclectic and pleasant, Staff were EXCELLENT and very accommodating. The room really was way too small for more than one person;2
Despite the lovely rooftop bar, the rooms at this hotel are very dilapidated. I would not recommend sleeping here, especially considering the high price. Our bathroom flooded twice and we were told it would be fixed after the first night, but it was not. The rest of the room was rather dirty and dingy.;2
If you want to wait, wait, and wait then this hotel is for you! Wait for the luggage cart, the bell service and then wait to get a cold breakfast and wait for even the managers to hear your complaints and then wait to get your deposit back months after promised....I'm never staying at this location again! They failed to deliver on every level.;2

The hotel is a few minutes walk from Central Park, Lincoln Center, subway access, and more, which is awesome.  Starbucks and Walgreens are right next door.  However, I have never had worse service in my life, and I've traveled a lot across many countries.  My family had 3 separate rooms, and since they have no ice machines, we all called more than 5 times and never received ice.  They told us before coming that there was an in-room fridge and coffee.  There's a Keurig and pods, but we had no cups and never any cream, sugar, or stir sticks.  2 days in a row our room was not made up, even after telling them after the first day.  1 day my sister's room wasn't as well as my parents'!  The gym was being renovated the entire time, and they had passes to a gym, but since I have little;2
The studio apartment is ok for one or two nights if you are looking for cheap accomodation and you dont mind putting up with a low level of hygiene.  The room we stayed in wasnt exactly clean and the bed linens were creased as if someone had slept in them the night before (they smelled clean though).  The bathroom had pubic hair on the floor and in general didnt give an impression of cleanliness.  The fridge in the kitchenette had mould and looked like it hadnt been cleaned in months.   In general the only bad point for this hotel was the cleanliness of the room. The price was right, location good and in general ok for a short stay in NYC.  It would be absolutely perfect if they could improve their hygiene standards.;2
Stayed here late September for 2 nights. Our room had very noisy aircon that could only be stopped by unplugging the power plug.   The bathroom had loose sink and plumbing that had been broken in the 80s by the look of it. I had to unblock the sink by using a water bottle as a pump and the filth that came out of it was disgusting.   There is definitely a trick to using the shower.   Woke up on the last morning with a bedbug crawling on the sheet.  When I squashed it blood came out of it all over the sheet. I checked my wife's skin and my own and fortunately no bite marks.   This hotel was recommended to us by Trailfinders so if they offer it to you then avoid it.  It is centrally located near central park and that's all I can say that makes it beneficial.   Staff are helpful;2

If you stay here, you will learn that they do not value you as a customer.  There are absolutely no perks for you.  The pricing is atrocious compared to other hotels.

I was so happy to be back in the Carolina's after such a horrible experience.  I would not recommend this stay to anyone.;2

This is the 3rd time I have stayed st the Ameritania. The overall quality of everything has greatly declined. Breakfast isnât offered. Instead we were referred to an outrageously overpriced ($140 for 3 people!). Our room wasnât cleaned one night of our stay. We ran out of toilet paper and waited 30 minutes for housekeeping to bring some. The snacks offered in the lobby were uncovered and lacked serving utensils. The front desk staff was unpleasant and seemed put out when asked for assistance.;2

For a recent short trip to one of very favorite cities, my friend and I chose the Quality Hotel on Broadway, because we'd stayed there for 5 nights last year and had enjoyed the ease with which we'd reserved online (with option to cancel), the spacious room and adequate bathroom, the decent degree of cleanliness, the relative quietness, and, most of all, the convenient location (just a few feet from the 96 St. subway station) in a neighborhood we like. Unfortunately, the minusses outweighed the plusses during our recent two-night stay.Some of the same plusses were still there: the room was quiet, except for the slamming doors that so many hotels seem to have (and the clueless guests who let them slam), the bathroom looked as if it had been renovated recently (even though the;2
My husband and I went to New York for our Honeymoon in April 05 for a week. We chose this hotel as the photos in the brochure looked lovely and it was reasonably priced. However, we now wish we'd paid a bit more and stayed somewhere else!! We arrived at the hotel and it was rather run down and tatty. Our first room (no 109) was tiny. We thought, 'ok we won't be here much' but when we ventured into the bathroom we found a large brown puddle in the middle of the floor which was formed from a dripping in the ceiling above (round the light fitting!) Needless to say, my husband called reception straight away and explained the situation and we asked to be moved to another room, which we did. I know this is a pretty cheap hotel, but I would not expect to be faced with this no matter;2

My title embodies what is wrong with the illuminated sign(missing a P) and indeed the Hotel - they donât care. 1. We were checked into someone elseâs room-a first for me at any hotel and very embarrassing . 2. The bathroom is essentially a cupboard. 3.Inadequate noise insulation means day and night New York traffic noise including sirens and horns. 4.Forget breakfast in the hotel - not sure whether a franchise or not but in any event the staff havenât a clue. 5. A 20% tip is compulsory in the downstairs bar despite the service- overheard last night from the barmanâ I have no idea what a Singapore Sling is- Iâll look it up in my phoneâ 6. No adequate response to any of the multiple complaints on this website from the management. 7. The only positives -We found the restaurant-Edâs;2
After a long flight and subway journey to the hotel, the first thing we wanted to do was take a shower. The first room we was put in, we couldn't fit our suitcase on the floor, which meant we couldn't open the bathroom door. When we went to take a shower there was no hot water, the water ran for 10-15mins and it was super cold and water sprayed everywhere around the toilet, as the shower curtain to bugger all!   We went to complain, but the staff said that we had to be patient and wait for the water to run hot. Our other friends in 2 other rooms didn't have this issue, in fact their rooms were a little better than ours. So we asked to change as 20 mins waiting for the water to run hot was ridiculous.   We got a new room and was content with it, as we was in NYC baby and should;2

Had to stay here a few times while apt. being renovated.   It is convenient and less expensive than others, but still my last choice in the area, because of the condition of some of the rooms.  (Bathrooms are good, though.)  However, the staff are very helpful:  I asked for a refrigerator and they brought one right away.   One room had no hot water, but someone came and eventually got the valve to open.    It's hit or miss.   My last room was fine, but had no dresser.   Only worth it if you can get a great price through a bucket website.;2
"I have stayed at the Days Hotel six times now. Count 'em, SIX times. You can scroll down for my initial review, which I posted after my first two times. Since then, every experience has taken a nosedive and I can no longer positively recommend this hotel.  It is STILL a ""value"" for NYC. I won't get into what a ripoff NYC hotels are, and how awful they all are and how much they overcharge. It's terrible, and as much as I like NYC, it is not worth what hotels overcharge. Given that Days Hotel averages about $150 a night, it's considered a ""bargain."" But it's still a craphole. Yup, a craphole.  Since I've been staying there, the wear and tear on the motel is just getting worse. A lot of it has to do with the fact that, because it costs less than most hotels in Manhattan, you get a";2

The WooGo Central Park would be a place to stay if you want to get a taste of being a resident of New York.  Pretend it is your own apartment and bring your own towels and wash cloths, make your own beds, wash your dishes, take out the trash, and be willing to dispose of the previous occupants dropped trash and forgotten underwear.  The first night the front desk staff directed me to the 'managers' office where I inquired of two surley young men if I might obtain a wash cloth.  They informed me they did not provide anything but one towel per customer.  We were there 5 days.  No one cleaned our room, brought fresh towels or emptied the trash.  As we were checking out other customers were at the desk asking for toilet paper, towels and trash bags.  It has a good location - go up;2
Unfortunately my opinion of Abercorn has been smeared by the treatment of my partner and I on our fourth night of accommodation. On our third evening of staying at this Hostel, our circumstances changed and required us to stay another night in London. The receptionist was happy to take an extra Â£50 off us for another lodging. We went out for the next day and came back to Abercorn, went to our room and all of our possessions had been removed. Basically, someone had come into our room rifled through our private belongings and haphazardly shoved them into our bags. We went to reception and it took them three seconds to check the computer system and note that we did, in fact, pay to stay for another night. We got little apology and were told that âit wasnât their faultâ and that âit;2

We understood and went to our room to find it completely trashed! Mind you we didnât arrive until 11 PM! Why was this room untouched? We were given another room but felt uneasy about the cleanliness of the facilities because of what we had just experienced. (Photos posted are of the first room we were given upon opening the door) The new room was cramped and small as was the bathroom and there were stains on the curtains. We have stayed in small facilities before but they were at least renovated and cleaned. We like to check out the hotels in NYC so when people ask for recommendations;2

But here's my list anyways ... new beds (these were rock hard), new pillows (rock hard again), new carpet (they were dark coloured to hide the dirt), softer towels (they were very rough), more towels (2 just isn't enough), more bathroom stuff (soap, shampoo, etc.  there just wasn't enough, however they did provide tooth brushes and toothpaste - why??? who doesn't bring their own).  The room was small,, but that's ok.  We've had small rooms before, like in Paris (even smaller) but ... we paid less in Paris, less in Toronto, less in Boston for alot;2
Check-in took a very long time as there were only two receptionists. Anytime I had to speak to staff at the reception desk there was a long line and a long wait. It was impossible to sit in the lobby or the bar, which is adjacent to the lobby, because it was very cold. I had to cal housekeeping to clean a heavily dusty telephone and lamp.  The bathroom door paint was peeling and sections of the molding was missing. This is the first time I ever was charged for in-room coffee, $3.00 per cup. It is gratis in every hotel I've ever stayed at.  A small bottle of water was $8.50 and a snickers bar was $6.00!! The bed was comfortable, although the room was small side. Staff was friendly. The hotel is in a good location.  For $350.00 per night, I expect something better.;2
"Stayed 6 nights on 3rd floor. Room was tiny, bed was too small for two people, thin blanket. Furniture outdated, carpet looked like it was there since they build the building ages ago. There was wallpapers peeling off here and there. The old water heater was hissing loudly when ON so we had to sleep with earplugs or freeze all night, asked for nice room when checking in, was told ""we're fully booked"" and also that the nicer rooms are more expensive. Corridors smelled bad, like there was kitchen in each room cooking who knows what.... Not even once we were told good morning when going through lobby in morning, unfriendly staff.  To be fair I have to mention that the bathroom was fine, clean, with good shower pressure and the hotel is in great location with subway right around the";2

The hotel is up near 128th Street, quite a few stops up from say 51st where it all happens!  That said ,it's an easy journey on the subway and the view from our window was a snowy park - beautiful!  Our room was painted in lime green  (so you didn't need a hangover in the morning - that's for sure!) and tiny for the two double beds they put in there (for the three of us - two adults and grown up son) which left no room even for a chest of drawers!  Nothing in the bathroom next to the sink to put your stuff on but - hey - it was relatively cheap for a hotel within easy reach of downtown Manhattan.  There was internet connection but that was definitely not cheap.  Worst thing was that for two of the four days we stayed, the lift stopped working.  We were on the 8th floor and the;2

"I walked to this hostel, my suitcase dragging behind me, with a sense of dread and a significant lack of enthusiasm after reading the reviews online. ""It can't be as bad as they say"" I thought to myself as I entered the complex and I was correct, it wasn't THAT bad but it could have been so much better.  First things first, you wouldn't stay at this hostel if you were travelling to London and were only in town for a few days looking to meet other travelers because there is a 0% chance of that happening here. I have seen more atmosphere at a funeral. I was only here because I needed a place to sleep for two nights.  So the staff are awful but seeing as I only wished to confront them twice (once to check in and once to check out) I didn't really mind. They certainly didn't seem to";2
I have stayed here once before back in 2007, nothing has been updated since and the hotel shows sign of tear. But my main issues are the hideous prices Hilton charges for what 2013 are basic stuff. Wifi, i say no more. Shame on you Hilton! IÂ´ve been a Diamond VIP for many years but due to job change iÂ´m now without Hilton status and it is obvious that staying at a Hilton hotel sucks when you are without Hhonours status. Also the breakfast is brutally overcharged. The only reason for staying here are the location next to Universal Studios.    If Hilton offered complimentary wifi and had reasonable prices on the breakfast i would have rated the hotel higher. Interestingly the buffÃ©t on sunday seems price worthy especially if one compare it to the breakfast.;2
My husband booked this trip for my birthday and it has been amazing, the hotel is in an ideal position for sightseeing and the barman Javier was a really nice helpful man very friendly and knowledgable, also very good at creating a drink to suit your taste. Now for the hotel review, we were booked into a King size deluxe room, this is not what we were given the room was so small we banged our feet on the bottom of the bed every time we tried to walk around it. 200 sq ft of space - no way, the clock on the wall was broken, no hands on the dial!!! No docking station no easy chairs to sit in and a view of other bedrooms opposite through dirty windows.  As you can see from photos no room at all to move around freely or store luggage, feel as though we have been ripped off.  When my;2

I was not going to do a public review but the hotel sent me this link so I will.  The hotel is in the perfect location if you want to go to the opera, symphony, or the ballet.  Its also a great location if you are going to a Broadway show.   Thats where the positive comments end.Many 3rd party websites give discounted deals and I booked this hotel (3 rooms) via Amoma and Dealon - the Dealon interaction was ok but the Amoma reservation was not.  The hotel admitted the error was on thier side - I got the correct confirmation for dates in my email, but when I called the hotel to confirm they had the dates off (they had us coming in Monday and leaving Thursday vs Arriving Thursday) - this caused me tremendous stress and time to ensure the reservation was fixed as my family was;2
I booked this hotel months ago. Check in on the website says 3pm.  We arrived at 3:15pm. There are two guys working and a lady (Janet) who I believe is the manager, but acted like she was too busy to talk or help anyone (the guy that was helping me kept calling her name for help, and she was too busy talking with another guest.  He kept telling me my hotel room was prepaid, so I'm not sure WHAT we were waiting for. Finally, he tells me my room is not ready yet, but they have a room with 2 double beds and the room is ready if we want it now. My husband tried to get an upgrade to king for free, and they did not have any. I started getting irritated because check in is at 3 and it's past 3. Why is my room not ready? When he could sense my irritation, all of a sudden, our room is;2
There's a lot to like about The Jane Hotel: it's charming, the lobby is lovely, the location (while a bit far from the subway) is close to The Village, and it's just about the cheapest private room you'll find in Manhattan. But after a couple visits, I think I'm through. For one thing the place is showing signs of wear. For example: I could feel the mattress springs on the narrow cot sized bed. The carpets are looking a little dirty. I noticed that the hallways looked in need of a vacuum. Mainly though, I'm tired of waking up and finding a strange man in a bathrobe brushing his teeth in the co-ed bathrooms. I'm finished with the coffin sized rooms (especially the ones with bunk beds that make you feel even more claustrophobic.) I don't think I could take another sweltering night;2
Rooms are too small and no counter space in bathroom for personal products. Products were either placed on the ground, or on the toilet seat. I will not stay here again, nor will I recommend this to any one.;2
Clean and comfortable and upgraded to a larger room gave us high hopes for this inner city hotel. But it was the small touches that were lacking. Bathroom door hanging off and not mended despite reminders, shower panel at wrong end of bath so the water went all over the floor but more infuriatingly everything had to be paid for at hugely inflated prices. Even a coffee was $3.50 while a bottle of wine was $78. No free wifi in the rooms only in lobby. Good thing we enjoyed the city itself!;2

Location is great if you are staying for Universal Studios. However, food and customer services were horrible. No coffee and soup was cold.

We came back for dinner and the soup was cold. Eat somewhere else!;2
I booked two nights at the Universal City Hilton in a standard king bed room but I was upgraded to a corner room with a great view of the park. Indeed, the room itself was pretty nice and spacious.   The room was pretty cold though, and the heating system did not appear to work very well.   Even from the top floor of the hotel, you could still hear the traffic noise from the nearby super busy highway (across the area of the park and CityWalk).  The TV was placed in a weird angle from the bed, and the quality of the picture was pretty average.   The hotel's standard check in time is 4 PM, which is already an hour later than most hotels in the city. I checked in via the app, but my room was not ready until 6.15 PM in the evening! When I finally was able to get to my room, the;2

I booked my holiday direct with the Wyndham quest reservation team. Accepted I had to pay single occupancy and service charge. On arrival I was informed I had to pay $268 at the end of my stay. I pointed out already paid. Receptionist was rude and stated I hadn't. Later in my stay , I tried to discuss this issue again. Insistent I had booked through a booking agency and not guest reservations and stated I had to pay.Still wouldn't have it even with email from Wyndham quest reservation.  This made my holiday at the new yorker hotel extremely expensive.  The service charge was for wifi, use of the gym . My room was small, clean .

We stayed two nights in this hotel, and if our stay had been longer, I would have seriously considered moving to another place.    Check-in was really unimpressive.  We asked about parking at the Pantages Theatre, just a few miles away, and the two clerks just looked at each other.  OK, so they're not theatre people.... The first sign that they had our reservations wrong was on the breakfast ticket â dated only for one night.  We took it back to the desk clerk after breakfast the next morning.  No problem, she simply penned the correction on the ticket.  When we got back to our room at 10:30 that night, neither one of our cards worked.  Back downstairs, we were issued two new cards â no apology offered.  A small buffet breakfast was served.  Both mornings the hot food offered;2
After reading some positive reviews in reponse to some poor ones, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. First off, the warm welcome. The two guys on the front desk made Jack Dee seem like 'The Laughing Policeman'.  The room was large, the bed was small, and the air con didn't work. To be fair they fixed it straight away, it had been turned off at the mains. And it was very efficient. On trying to shave, discovered the plug in the sink didn't work, likewise, when my wife decided to have a bath. The toilet kept refilling endlessly, which was quite noisy. And none of the doors seemed to shut properly. Also there were no curtains, just some inadequate blinds, so we were awake at about 5:30 every morning, except when we blocked the light out with towels and cushions, and then we;2

The hotel was a disappointment. They booked us in a room with no space. Even the doorman said it is the worst room in the hotel. Then we had to pay more for a slightly better room. At least there was room for our luggage. Kenny the bar man was a real light in that dark tunnel. He immediately came over and helped us and made good suggestions!;2
The hotel itself is beautiful and in a great location, however filled with staff that you are just a name and number to - they have no interest in actually helping or making you feel welcome. Also, room not ready at guaranteed check in time, with no late check out or upgrade to make up for this. Essentially, paying for a room from a certain time and then not being allowed in it. Rooms are extremely small for what you are paying - Yes it is New York, but I've stayed at plenty other hotels that do value you having a comfortable stay with a bit more space in this crowded and busy city. Beds were nice but quite small, but then again they have to be for the small little rooms. Nice lobby and great bar, generally good environment, but don't come here if you expect a smile and hello;2

I am a Hilton Diamond customer. We have 2 rooms. One Executive Room and one Standard Room. Both were a disappointment.    First let me say that I have been staying here for years and have always enjoyed it. I recommend it to friends and family as it's in an unbeatable location and has fast internet. However lately every trip has been slightly more sloppy than the last and now it seems they have really lost their way.  We had some issues with our rooms. Twice I went to reception to ask to speak with a manager (and this is the first time I have ever complained at any Hilton anywhere in the world - and I stay over 60 nights a year, every year, for years). Both times I was asked to wait in the lobby for 5 minutes while they got someone. Twice I waited for 15-20 minutes before;2
Quirky and Charming combined with cramped, broken and noisy. The Jane is, admitedly, not your average hotel. It is affordable but the room we chose was a double w bath and the heat worked....we reached 90 degrees before we figured out how to manually adjust the baseboard heat ( on our knees, behind the sheet metal cladding). Plumbing traps had to be out of code as well as we could smell sewage gas in the bath until we closed and covered the drains.  The rooms were clean and very small but that didn't hinder our sleep or enjoyment of the surrounding area. The second night of our stay the Hotel had a DJ in their lounge and we could hear and feel every noise till 3 AM. A call to the night manager was fruitless. Quirky, yes. Charming, no.;2

It's great to be right at the airport...but there's several airport hotels, including a Sheraton next door that I've visited and liked better.   My Cons:  Air conditioning struggled to keep up in my room.   Room smelled like new carpet emissions or chemical cleaning agents. Could be alleviated if they permitted windows to be opened or at least cracked. This is a major pet peeve of mine when you can't get any form of fresh air into the rooms.   Check-in staff seem a little off at times, that process could have been quicker and more efficient.   My Pros (or at least not Cons)  Location if you don't want to deal with LA traffic.  Bathroom was normal/average.   Bed was comfortable.  Room cleanliness was average.   Hotel bar/restaurant had excellent food and service.;2

Stayed for one week at the New Yorker Hotel. Good things were location and Tick Tock Diner. Not so good was the first room we stayed in, which was right next to a supply cupboard and  very noisy at night as well as some noise from outside. Also, the decor in this room was very dated with paint peeling off the bottom of the bathroom door and the door looking rotten in some places. Also. there was a really, and I mean really, cold draft coming through the seals around the edge of the double glazed windows.  We asked to be moved the following day and were moved to a room 6 storeys higher,  same size room, but again very draughty around the double glazing so much so that we had to request a spare Quilt to try and block the draft from the window, as well as an additional quilt for;2
I have never reviewed a hotel before but felt strongly about our stay here, We are a family of 5 who were visiting New York for 7 nights, I wanted to book a hotel that had a pool so that the children could relax after a day's sightseeing-what a mistake choosing the Empire! The 'pool' consists of a tiny plunge pool that you can't swim in ,just dip in and out,3 people in it would be too many! I think it's very misleading to say they have a pool deck,if not false advertising. What they have is a very trendy,very expensive,cocktail bar on the roof where children are not welcome. The rooms are tiny,bathrooms even tinier...trying to think of some positives,location is great,beds comfy,wouldn't stay here again.;2
Guess they were renovating...parts of the room fine, others not so good.  Carpet was more like padding, mold around tub area.  Hall ways and elevators need sprucing up but location near the subway was great.  Better to stay nearer midtown if you're doing the tourist things.  Staff was helpful, esp. the bellmen.;2
We were a little concerned upon arrival as the hotel didn't look great from the outside but were placated when we got to the room. The room had been recently renovated and was clean and had nice neutral decor. The bathroom was dated but clean, however the shower was not great.  The breakfast was very basic and the cereal was stale, but was enough to sustain until lunch and it was nice that it was inclusive. The location was ok, not as close to universal studios as I expected but was an easy 10min drive down the 101. The ad I saw for the hotel said there was a free shuttle to universal but when I asked about this I was told that there was a tour that would pick us up at 8.45 and drop off at 7.25pm which is not what I would call a shuttle.

"It could have been worse.  We were lucky when we stayed at the Days Inn in New York City: unlike several other reviewers on this site, we did not encounter bed bugs in our room.  But that is the only good thing I can say about this hotel.  The room was tiny, with paint peeling from the walls; the plumbing worked most of the time, but the heat worked only sporatically (this was in January!). I had made a reservation through the Days Inn web site, and I was offered what I considered to be a reasonable price.  I do realize that one must expect a certain amount of shoddiness in a cheap hotel in New York.  However, when we checked out, they refused to honor the price I had been given when I made the reservation.  So now I have to dispute the higher charge with my credit-card company.";2

I chose the Hollywood Hotel after reading all the good reviews on here. But after arriving and seeing the hotel and my room I was shocked. The pictures look great online but in person itâs a little run down (you also canât tell that the balconies are shared) My wife usually lets me do all the planning for vacations and Iâm normally on top of it. But we both agreed after this trip that my streak was over. Overall the room was dirty with stains on the bed and even the lamp shade. There was mold and rust in the bathrooms. It was a toss up on if we had hot water in the morning. It was annoying at first, but it actually became comical towards the end of the trip. My sole purpose for writing this review is to give a little warning to the other husbands out there that think theyâre;2

"We are a family of six people that stayed at the Wyndham in April for 4 nights. We booked our room 7 months in advance through Booking.com. Through our booking process we got the info that the hotel was to be paid upon arrival. I notified the hotel that we would arrive appr. 8pm. When we arrived we got a really rude employee who, at first, didÂ´nt seem to find our booking and then claimed that the card had been declined. I told her that the booking confirmation had said ""pay upon arrival"" and that there should not be any problems with the card but she kept interfering when I was speaking in a very rude manner saying that whenever one books through the internet, one should always call before arrival to check if the card is ok.

Lobby was dirty as was the elevator, Oh well, anyone can have a bad day. Not. The room was very well worn. Side tables were peeling paint as was the desk, no blackout curtains just Venetian blinds, one of whose slats was held together with a band-aid! The bottom of the bathroom door was rotting, the curtain rod was sagging and the bath towel was full of holes. The desk sent up a new slat for the blinds and we got a new towel. The manager said she couldnât do anything for us as we had booked âthru an agency, but she said she would get back to us. I waited and waited and thus this belated review.Days Inn/Wyndham should be ashamed to have their name on this property and should pull the franchise. The staff at the desk were great, but they donât have anything to work with.;2

The hotel is nicely located at the upper west side  Lobby is nice and reception person was nice too.   BUT: the room. See for your self and make up your mind.   Lots of stuff that needed replacement long ago.   The curtains dont go all the way down. Only one free electricity socket and basically not what I'd expect from a hotel in 2018 at nyc.;2
The room was little and worn And very dark!! Right out to a backyard with junk!! Overall both room and toilet/bathroom neede at BIG makeover. Only free wifi in the lobby. NOT and i mean NOT value for money.;2
The rooms themselves were fine. The hotel is FINE. Its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area. But the rooms are VERY small. Which I know isn't that wild of a thing in New York City but its not ideal as I was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it. The bed took up half of the room. Which again I understand and its fine. Not Ideal but fine. My main issue and why I'm giving such a low rating is that when I booked my room well in advance in August I booked it for 2 people. I wasn't sure if my friend could come with me so I didn't add her name to reservation. That SHOULDN'T have mattered. But when I added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date;2
Picked for its location really near Central Park, Museums and walking distance to Time Square etc.  Also as featured in Gossip Girl. The location is really good and staff are friendly and the roof terrace great.  But rooms are small, even for New York, it does feel run down but the real down side is the endless extras  - I have never been to a Hotel which charges $3 for an in-room coffee (never had to pay at any hotel before) plus having to pay for Wi-Fi and then only for one device!!! The whole room was full of extras with a price tag.   Overall the hotel gives the impression it is looking for every opportunity to fleece guests and that takes the edge of any stay;2

Not at all what I expect from Wyndham Hotels. Very small room and even smaller bathroom. Upon entering our room I noticed that the smoke alarm was wrapped in plastic. I notified the front desk who sent two security guards who took pictures and said they would send someone to remove it. I removed it myself several hours later before going to sleep. Apparently my smoke free room wasn't for the previous guests.  I was never notified that I would be sharing this hotel with over 100 dogs. It seems the dog show was in town that weekend. I should have been told this when I booked the room and I would have booked somewhere else. Dogs in the lobby dogs in the elevators is not what I expected when paying that kind of money!;2

Even on the 20th floor, I could hear every shout on the street, every horn, every siren, all the construction, every door slam in the hallway, every conversation in the neighboring rooms. The shower went from hot to scalding to cold over and over in the space of a 15 minute shower. No refrigerators in the room, toilet was so short it was hard to get up.;2
We arrived at the Empire at around 5:00pm (check-in time was 3:00pm).   Upon arrival we were told that it would only be a 15-20 minute wait.   After 1 hour, we asked the desk to check on our room.  The desk clerk apologized and said it would only be another 5-10 minutes.  Fourty-five minutes later it still was not ready.  At around 7:00pm, tired of waiting in the lounge, we went to dinner.  Finally when we returned at 8:00, our room was ready.   So we wasted 3 hours at the hotel when we could have been out seeing the city.  (we only booked one night).        To make matters worse, there was a loud party going on in the next room until 4:30 in the morning.  We called the front desk twice and each time it was quiet for about 10 minutes...then it would start up again.   So ......no;2

The location is awesome! Straight beside the times square but not to close to be in the big noise. BUT: No wifi included? How can that be today? Thatâs no service at all and actually unacceptable. Every âhillbilly-Motelâ offers free wifi. And by the way, the rooms are very small and you can hardly turn around. Also there is water, where they charge you for and not even a fridge or something. I can recommend it for the location and the good room service but the rest ðð»;2
"This hotel needs an update and needs to add some amenities.  Our room was small, with nowhere to even charge a cell phone except on the floor or hanging over the toilet; they could at least invest in a charging cube placed in a convenient spot.  The bathroom  -- old fixtures, no room to store anything.  No coffee or tea maker in the room; and no coffee or tea available in the lobby -- except in the morning when the Tick Tock Diner located in the building staffs a counter in the hotel lobby -- and it's not complimentary.  Housekeeping was very good, but the lobby staff were less than helpful.  The lobby is attractive, the meeting room that our group used was okay but minimal, the hallways were shabby and depressing.  My overall rating would be -- if it were an available rating --";2
Tiny cramped room. Not soundproof at all so could hear guests talking and making noises in the middle of the night. Temperature control is really bad -it was either too cold or woke up sweating. I would definitely choose another hotel instead next time.;2
"The Empire Hotel  looks great on paper. The lounge and reception are still decked out identically to their starring role days in 'Gossip Girl'. But, even here the edges are looking a bit frayed and shabby. The room was fine and clean enough although there were some stains here and there and bathroom not pristine. No complimentary tea or coffee; you have to pay per cup for this. The rooftop pool was decidedly grubby and closed early when we were there. The lift to this floor was also broken. We got a bargain price for our room on a website and so did not feel short changed. If you're paying full price then I would expect you'll be disappointed. In its favour, the hotel is handy for Central Park and the Kennedy Centre.";2

And after taking 45 minutes to drive from the Hertz car rental to the hotel (maybe a mile) and pulling into the back I'm told by Valet that they won't accept the car in the back by the shuttle drop off and self-park.  Also, the front desk will tell you to go to Valet to purchase self-park with in & out pries.  And to find out the same garage as self-park is where valet parks.

We booked this hotel for its proximity to Lincoln Center, and it did have that in its favor, but that was the only thing.  The heating unit in our first room was so noisy that we could hardly hear ourselves.  We went to the front desk and had to persuade the person there to give us another room.  In that one, the heating unit made a clanking noise that kept up awake at night.  We also asked the front desk person where to buy a bottle of wine and were sent on a wild goose chase down Columbus Ave.;2

I went here to have some drinks with friends one evening in the downstairs bar.  The atmosphere was quite nice, and the bar quite empty.  Afterwards, we decided to go upstairs to meet some more friends in the rooftop bar.  While the rooftop bar area was very nice, I thought that the staff was very rude.  The gentleman at the entrance of the bar was giving everyone quite a hard time getting in, in a non-polite way.  After telling him that our friends were there, we had to have 4 of them come to the door and get us.  I totally understand access control issues, but there is never a reason to be rude or obnoxious about it, unless there is an issue that warrants it (e.g. rude guests).    This soured my experience and I would not recommend it.;2

OK, so they gave us another room with two double beds as we had no time to wait around for the original room.  The room was clean, but beware, those ""double"" beds are tiny!

First impression was awful, a dingy 'reception' with what appeared to be the local Mafia in charge. The room (a triple) was very small but acceptable although it took a can of air freshener to dispell the musty smell. The room was cleaned and fresh towels every day and the bathroom would not be out of place in a Holiday Inn. The heating was erratic and very noisy from about 5 am when it wheezed back into life. Overall it represented value for money as we did not pay much. This hotel should really be designated a backpackers hostel.;2
This was horrible. The room smelled dirty, was dirty, and sooo small.  The whole place smelled like cigarettes. The whole room barely fit the bed and a TV, and there was no room to move!

I stayed here for 5 nights. Friendly staff and decent location, but I'm afraid that's where the positives end. In a party of 24, we had booked to all be on the same floor. However, when we arrived we found that we were spread out all over the hotel. The rooms were very noisy, from outside and other rooms (walls seemed to be very thin), the lifts took forever to reach their assigned floors, and the door to our room had clearly been jimmied open numerous times as there were deep dents in the side of the door and the frame on the side where the handle is. It was also apparent that outsiders could come in off the street, as there was numerous female 'visitors' on their way down from the higher floors almost every time we went in the lift.;2

"As much as I wanted to like ""The Jane"" I can't. Although the history behind it is interesting and although the double rooms come with en-suite, it is just not enough. When we first went to our room, a huge pile of bin liners full with garbage awaited us as we made our way from the lift to the room. The smell indicated that although it is a non smoking hotel and has smoke detectors, smoking indoors is still a habit with some of the guests. The room itself was what we expected it to be in size and decoration, but... The amount of dust everywhere was amazing. The glasses above the minibar had such a thick layer of dust, that i doubt anyone has ever used them since they were put there. The smell in the room was an odd mixture and not very pleasant, but better than the one in the";2
Terrific Lincoln Center location, rooftop pool that is a major attraction in the evening.  Hot spot clientele and gorgeous lobby.  BUT, a/c did not work, toilet handle repeatedly did not work, elevators were sporadic (one night only one was working causing huge backup).  A/C issue caused two nights of sleep in steamy conditions with window open (suggestion of front desk) allowing all the noise of Broadway traffic and club patrons to come in with the heat.  Did move rooms for final night.  Finally, upon departure, it took 60 minutes for valet to deliver car which caused a delay in travel.;2
Had two rooms for two nights for a large party of women. Many of the guests had flown in across country for this bridal party weekend. We arrived to check in at 6:30 PM and one room was not ready (despite being 6:30 at night). It took almost two hours to get into a room (which was upgraded), as none of the rooms were ready by housekeeping. During this time period myself and another guest had to constantly go down to the manager to get updates on our room, as no one was keeping us informed via telephone or otherwise. We also had an extremely difficult time getting room service to deliver ice or other items which we required. I had numerous disappointed women with me, all of whom would never stay here again. After receiving our rooms, the manager informed us he would make sure our;2
Expectations were low for this place knowing the deal with older nyc hotels, we just wanted a clean, comfortable enough place to stay for one night. The front desk staff was friendly and lobby had free wifi. When we walked to our room on the 2nd floor, the stench of fish cooking was overwhelming. It was clear some staff or long-term guests were cooking on the second floor and airing their kitchen fan in the hall ways...I'm not exaggerating..it wreaked. The room was larger than expected, plenty of room for 3 people. There was a cockroach in the sink which isn't shocking for NYC but after the fishy smell and seeing some vom on the carpet...not the most pleasant welcome gift.

The hotel is average, but the heater does not work in the room is a hotel a bit old so you see, you need to take public transport or car if you want to go to visit the attractions of Los Angeles are not near any.

Stayed in many 4* hotels and this is by far the worst, and the first time I have left a less than positive review. I will start by saying the location is great, right next to Penn station.  Reception staff were nice, however only dealt with them upon check in and check out.  Beds were comfortable and the room was generally clean.  Small, cramped and outdated rooms. Tiny bathroom. For the price and also the photos online - not worth it.  The walls were also so thin we could hear everything next door.   Waiting for the lifts took forever despite there being so many of them and there was always a queue. I hated the thought of returning to the hotel to use them.  Also, one night every single lift was filled with the smell of fish, and everyone was gagging. Still no idea what it was.;2
This is the third time I stayed at this hotel.  The first time, I had a miserable time as the a/c kept breaking down and making loud noises (didn't get any sleep).  I wasn't refunded as I booked outside the hotel.  The second time, it was a comfortable room but one that I did not choose upon reserving (hotel was full plus I arrived late).  This time around, nothing changed.    The room I stayed in was located on the 14th floor in the corner facing Universal Studios/City Walk.  It was clean, comfortable, modern, and looked comfortable.  I was actually happy upon walking in and thought - finally a room that is comfortable.  I was wrong!  I came back exhausted after a trip to Universal and also a local trade show.

While the check-in and breakfast lounge staff were friendly and helpful, this place is really part itâs heyday. I stayed there for a last minute business trip because it was the cheapest chain hotel in NY even remotely near my meetings, but Iâd gladly fork over an extra $200 next time to stay somewhere without cracked tiles in bathroom, chipped painting and just gross infrastructure. Bedding and all was fine but slept kinda skeeved out.;2
Don't be fooled by the facade and photos online. This was my second time staying at the Empire and I was incredibly disappointed with the service and room I received. My room looked out to another guest room that was probably 10 ft away. The AC did not work and was incredibly loud. The shower did not function properly and had no shower door thus soaking the bathroom floor. The front desk staff were incompetent and I have never waited that long to check in to any hotel. On a positive note, the doormen were very courteous and helpful. Also, the breakfast buffet at the rooftop was very good value.;2
Just stayed in New York for 5days at days inn....location not bad mcg too subway which is easy too use...get 7day pass which u can use on any line at any time on 32dollars well worth it!....

My husband, two kids and I stayed here when visiting family in central park west. It was close to both our family and the subway and had many good neighborhood places to eat nearby and seemed reasonably priced...but it was Very Dirty. The halls smelled of mold/smoke and when I took off my shoes and socks in our room I could feel dirt/crumbs on the carpet. Please have housekeeping use a vacuum between each guest, at least! One elevator was always out of commission, and not always the same one. There were only 5 channels on the TV, which is a problem when you want to relax with your kids after a day pounding the pavement. And though the sheets were clean enough there were stains on the bedspreads. The room was hot, in January, and we had to keep the loud AC going all night. I;2

The only thing good about this hotel is the location.  It is near and within walking distance to many sites in town. This I the second time in two years I have stayed at this hotel.  From the exterior and lobby the hotel has a great old fashion look.  The room are very small. I estimate that they are about 1/3 the size of most hotel rooms I have stayed at.  The TV was not working correctly and several channels were fuzzy or unwatchable.  Ice was also hard to find. Ice was only on even numbered floors.  I could not detect any room service, but there are several cheap eat places near the hotel.;2
Went there on summer camp. The rooms are quite small. It is ok-ish for cleaning. The owners are not really nice. I was insulted by some of the people staying for the night. Very noisy place. The location is not bad.;2
We expected better quality at the Hollywood Hotel, judging by the photos.  Instead, it was fairly mediocre across the board.  On the positive, the breakfast was pretty good, with a chef making waffles, pancakes, omelettes etc. The pool area was small, a bit out of the way, but âokâ for our needs. The room was quiet and clean, but the housekeeping was appalling.  Early one morning, we were badgered by the cleaning lady to get out of our room because she was waiting to clean it.  We were on our way out for the day anyway, so wasnât too disturbed by it.  But then the second day we came back to the room late at night to find it hadnât been cleaned or made up at all.  Our sonâs bed had no sheets on it and dirty towels were still piled up in the bathroom.  To try and get someone to;2

It is a very nice hotel with spatious and clean rooms. The breakfast also is very good and you have all you need in your room. Really I would have give the maximum rating to it. The only problem was that I booked my room online on their internet site and when I arrived there (at 11pm with two kids) there was not a reservation with my name. So I invited the guy at the reception to have a look on internet on their site to verify that the reservation was there. But he refused to listen to me and he said that there was no reservation and he had a free room that could give to me for 350$ per one night. He was extremely unpolite and he told me that it was not him to have a problem but me, so if I wanted the room I had to pay 350$. I went away and... next day my credit card was charged;2

We stayed at the Astor for 6 nights at the beginning of April 2012.  We expected the rooms to be small since it is New York so that wasn't a problem.  We got room 207, a room facing the park which sounded great.  However, the windows were filthy and one of them had toilet paper dangling from it. This was never addressed during our stay.  Facing the park you must also beware that you directly above the subway track which adds to the noise that you get from the street.  The room was clean but the towels had small rips in them, the bathroom ceiling had water stains and the pipes were leaking water into our bathroom from the room above!  All that said, this is one of the cheapest deals if you want to stay in Manhattan, around 900 for six nights.;2
The first room was full of smoke, which came from a smoke-filled hallway laiden with dirt, stains, and pieces of trash. We immediately came downstairs and described the problem to someone at the front desk, explaining that the smoke seemed to be coming intensely from one room. She said, âwe of course canât disturb our guestsââin other words, we canât really help you. I asked for the front desk manager but he wasnât available, so I requested that he visit us at the restaurant a few feet away. He never appeared. When we returned to the front desk and finally did manage to speak with him, he didnât apologize. He moved us to another room on a different floor. Our experience was like that of a cheap Vegas hotel.;2

"I can't imagine how anyone would give this hotel 5 stars, or even 4.  This would be near the bottom of all the places we've stayed in NYC.  Staff was extremely rude at check-in, basically yelling at us because the door to the room they initially put us in was broken (refusing to move us to another room, etc.).  They gave us some free vouchers for continental breakfast at the diner, but we regretted using those; sometimes free still isn't cheap enough, especially in a city like New York where there is so much good food to be had. The only real positive is the location, very convenient if you are arriving or departing by train.  The 'Art Deco' lobby is fine but the upper floors of the hotel look dirty and poorly maintained.

This hotel is old and very tired. There is a lot of deferred maintenance, and the rooms are not particularly clean or comfortable. My bed was old and squeaky. The claim to fame is that Nikola Tesla died there. I will give them this, I stayed on the 40th floor and the view was great and the elevators fast. Convenient to have 24x7 dining on-site. If remodeled this property could command a much higher price and much better reviews. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. If you like Art Deco, you might enjoy this time capsule.;2

You can't deny the charm of the building, but rooms are so run down small and antiquated it really should be maximum a 2 or 3 star property. Staff is great but they can't help the state of the building. At almost $375 it's absolute horrible value for money even for NYC.;2
I stayed at the Jane for one night in one of the larger rooms. Great room, great view, except for the fact, I left with BED BUG BITES all over my back and stomach. I called the hotel and spoke to the GM. He told me they had had this problem 4 months ago but it had been resolved, NOT! He said he would get back to me ASAP. He did not! I sent two VM and two emails and still not response. I would advise you NOT to stay there. I now have to have my home fumigated and tons of dry cleaning etc. very costly stay for one night in NYC!;2
We stayed in a Captain's cabin, so I can't complain about the space.   It was maybe a little overpriced for the amount of room we got but somewhat in line with a regular hotel.  But the noise was worse than I've ever experienced in any hotel.  There seemed to be a window open all night but we couldn't find where.  There is a nightclub downstairs and the loud conversations, drunken screaming and horn honking were all clearly discerable until the place closed down at 4:00.  It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a loud party.    I give a poor rating, rather than terrible, because the day staff was very helpful and friendly.  After dark the nightclub staff apparently takes over and they are very, very unfriendly, even trying to block us from entering the building.    If you;2

This hotel should not be rated as a 4*. We have stayed here twice before and it was 4* then but has declined over the years. Too small bathroom (smaller that those on a cruise ship) with no safety rail and mal-functioning bath faucets, toiletries are not replenished, no pen and a dinky pad for writing, no bathrobe, no slippers, $7.50 for a bottle of water, $3.50 for in room coffee.

Disappointed. Luckily we stayed only for one night on our way to Washington DC by train. The location was good near Penn Station though. But like often near stations you can expect smell of weed everywhere.  Very crowded and fuzzy in the lobby since there was some kind of youth happening nearby. The room was outdated to say the least, and very small. You could almost hit the toilet seat closing the door. The bed was not very comfortable. The window was small and the view was the opposite brick wall. Sorry, but cannot recommend this hotel.;2
The location of the hotel is fantastic! The room, not so much. We stayed in a superior king room. The wallpaper was peeling throughout the entire room. The ridiculously small bathroom left it nearly impossible to get ready. The bed skirt was filthy. Complimentary Wifi was stated in the room description however, that's only in the lobby. Charging for Keurig coffee in the room is absurd. Heater clicked & churned loudly throughout the night waking us each time. There's a fitted sheet on the bed & a duvet. When we asked for a flat sheet, our request could not be met. Overall, if we had paid more than $150 for the room, we would have felt ripped off.;2
This is a reasonable budget option but don't expect too much.  Our room was very basic, slightly shabby and fairly small, but both it and the bathroom seemed clean and not uncomfortable.  We certainly didn't have any problems with dirt/vermin etc like some other reviewers (although we didn't go into the kitchen so I can't comment on that).  It's definitely not a luxury option, but if you're just looking for a good value place to sleep in between seeing the sights of New York, it hits the spot.    The one problem we had was on our first night (of three) with noisy neighbours playing loud music -- it seemed like there were quite a few students there.  In fact, the whole place is slightly like a halls of residence. . .;2
"We live a hour from Hollywood, but were coming to see a playand wanted a decent hotel nearby to spend the night. Hotel is tired and drab. Our room was worn. Bed and room musty (with not really clean odor). Bathroom  had rust coming through glued-on mirror. Room was a $128, but turned into $162 at checkout with two sets of room taxes, a 13.10 parking fee (was quoted as $12), and a ""marketing assesement fee"" (we pay for their advertising). They couldn't put a couple bottles of water in room, so you had to go to machine in hallway (broken). Found a grundgy little store off lobby that sold them. Breakfast was included, but more a glorifed Continenental. You'd think a major chain would want to make a better image of itself.";2
Writing this review while staying here in hopes they will fix these issues.  The hotel AC did not work.  The first room on the second floor had a bad smell and the AC didn't work.  The front desk moved my room to the 8th floor and 857's AC did not work either.  This room was dirty with stains on the carpet and not up to Hilton Standards.  I reported the stains and hopefully they will clean those this afternoon.  The hotel staff was polite and professional.;2
really bad service at the restaurants and room service. Severely understaffed. This should not be a Hyatt property. Not worth the money they charge. We were very disanointed and will never pick this hotel again.;2
The hotel was very nice and on arrival we were upgraded as we had booked three rooms and they wanted to make sure we were all together which was great. We handed over a credit card to pay for any extras we might incur during our stay, again this was fine. Upon waking on our last morning we found a bill for $130 per room labelled âfacilities feeâ. This was for WiFi, gym and business services. The only one we used was WiFi but this came up as free when we logged on. Apparently we should have been made aware of this fee when we booked as everyone pays it. We werenât and it isnât mentioned on our reservation paperwork. On checking the credit card bill when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us on checking in without telling us at the time. Â£321 for WiFi. Not good.;2

Please do not stay at this hotel my husband got bit in the room. The hotel will not take responsibility. The hotel is in a bad area with no nearby bars or restaurants. The hotel is not near Universal Studios it is a 20 minute Metro ride away.  The breakfast was poor as well and the bar does not open very often.;2
We booked this hotel for its location. However, they pretty much stuck us in a closet. Our room is so small that we only got an office chair and not another chair. The shower drips. No counter space in the bathroom nor anywhere else. The furniture is old and the handles are loose. Couldnât sleep very week as the walls are thin and I could hear everything happening outside. I even thought people were trying to open our room door. Iâm literally still here and I hate it. Iâm having to sit at the end of the bed to even charge my phone and write this review as they donât have outlets close to the bed.

On first glance, from the outside going into the lobby, The Empire Hotel gives the appearance of a modern day hotel, which cannot be anything further from the truth. Our stay began with one catalogue of errors after another, Fawlty Towers springs to mind.   On arrival we were met with the the most miserable, unhelpful, rude young lady.  It was clear from her tone that she was not happy to answer any questions, so once I asked one question, that was me done!  The elevator from the lobby had a very odd smell, once we reached our floor, I felt as though I was in the movieâ The Shiningâ! I had been transported back to the seventies, the corridor boasted the most out dated wallpaper Iâve ever seen in a hotel. When we got to the room we were exhausted and it was late, so you can;2
Location is great for the hotel other than this you are paying too much comparing to service provided they got busy next day so they did not clean our room till I called and asked to pick up the garbage.Roof top has open buffet for $25 dollars and when you check out the food is very poor quantity I will not go back Ask manger to check the size of the bed for me and her answer was she does not know what kind of bed is in my room never follow up with me on my concern.;2

We were disappointed in the empire hotel. Our shower did not work properly. We had to use the hand held part of the shower since the overhead did not work. The breakfast at eds chowder house was insufficient. The display of the food was not filled & looked like leftovers.;2
Stayed here for one night. A large group of people came upstairs at 3 am and were so loud, security was called and they began banging on the door several times until they opened up. Noise still continued, yelling, screaming, loud music. Felt like I was staying in a cheap motel for what I got. Room was clean but I couldn't sleep. I had to call security again because it didn't stop. I would expect more from a hotel like this.;2

"The rooms  are OK at this hotel, but we had some plaster falling from the ceiling over the bed.   The location is fine, but parking is costly at $12 per night.  The ""free Full American breakfast"" is pretty ghastly, unless you like lots of maple syrup with watered down orange juice.  Finally, the staff are not friendly, rarely smile, and argued with us over a $1 phone call which was not ours (we use cell phones, especially in LA).   Overall, this hotel in not worth the money.";2
The hotel itself is not bad and the rooms are spacious but I had problem with the heating in my last night, the room was cold, so I diseased. I come to talk about with front desk, the guy who check me out was very nice and polite, but when the manager come â¦ she very cold, no smile, no greeting, nothing! She talk in rude manner.  No apologies or anything. Looks like she didnât care about the guest.;2
Charged to much.. More than the going pricee. Room was too tiny kept hitting my leg trying to get around the bed. Couldn't get off the toilet too low. Finally moved me to a handicapped room. First room was too small.  You charged $824 for three nights.;2
If youâre looking for a really low budget stay and you donât mind being woken up by other guests in the middle of the night multiple times, or after âcleaningâ your room, finding all of your belongings left previously on the bed thrown into a corner on the ground, or sleeping in stained bedsheets, or having to use a towel with weird yellow stains on it, than this is your place to go! The walls are paper thin, the doors donât seal well and the beds are rolling on wheels during the night when you turn around in your bed. The bathroom and the common kitchen were okay. The staff gave 0 fck that you might sleep longer than 6am and shouting around to each-other in the corridors as well as doing the loudest possible type of cleaning: vacuuming.;2

"So I've had the very same issue twice with this hotel. Their own website clearly states early check in at 12:00pm, late check out at 2:00pm if you purchase the ""club room"".  It does not say subject to availability anywhere. I arrive to check in for 12:00, room not ready. Same discussion with staff as I had a few months ago regarding the early check in with the room I booked. They stated they were unaware of such details, until I showed them these details...on their own website. Even if you call reservations to book the ""club room"" they advertise early check in. Previously I was compensated for this issue, so no big deal....mix ups happen. But now the second time regarding the very same issue.

We  chose this hotel for its pool, sun lounge deck, gym and central Location. When we arrived the pool was closed (out of season despite 30 degrees C and blazing sunshine), the sun lounge deck had been closed since January for refurbishment (no visible refurbishment activity) and the gym was also closed for refurbishment. The pool did open Friday - Sunday but when we went up the water, in what turned out to be a pool around 2 bath sizes, was dirty/cloudy. Our room ($300 per night)  was tiny, with an even smaller bathroom, which I assume they call the restrooms so they don't even have to supply a bath ?? The shower only had half a door (seemingly intentional) so the bathroom floor flooded every time we used the shower. Our room had been recently (badly) redecorated and I am;2
I have delayed my review as I had a follow up email from the company that own The Jane asking for my comments - so emailed my comments and was waiting for their response.  Been over a month and nothing, so here it is:  I was really looking forward to this hotel and I am gutted to review that I was hugely disappointed.  I went with an open mind and appreciated that the rooms would be small but they are so tiny....two people with normal size suitcases can hardly fit in and it takes a lot of awkward manoeuvring!  The communal showers were nice and we didn't really have to queue much.  What really lets it down is the lack of communal area, as the rooms are so claustrophobic you just want to escape them and go sit somewhere. On their website it mentions and shows photos of a ballroom;2
Darth Vader creates a new hotel death start here: Poor hot water on first two floors, one working elevator. A great roof top you can never get into since its always closed for private events.

Let me detail all the reasons I can't recommend this hotel.  1)  They charge per device per day for internet. This will end up costing you a fortune! 2)  The TV is useless. No channels of regular tv came in, they were pixilated.  3)  The first room we got had a faulty air conditioner which kept us up most of the night.  They did switch us rooms.  4)  The shower is so poorly designed that the floor was covered in water after my son took a shower.   The sad truth is that if they just focused on fixing issues it would really be a decent hotel.;2
On our very first visit to New York, we arrived in the dead of winter (snow and temperatures in the teens).  After 25 minutes at check-in, we ventured to our room.  After getting off the elevator, we were extremely surprised by the small hallways that led to the room.  The walls were very thin.  Once in the bitter cold room, my husband tried to figure out what the problem was with the heat.  Being from Texas, we were not use to seeing radiators in hotel rooms.  The front desk came to assist and check out the radiator problem and provided us with a portable heater.  Draped in our coats, gloves and other winter attire, we waited for the room to be heated. Eventually everything was working but after a long plane trip from Texas, we just weren't up to entering a room which wasn't;2

Stayed in the morningside for two nights. The room was not as shown in the pictures. The shared restroom stinked and was dirty most of the time. There was hair and used toilet paper everywhere. The shower didnt work properly as it had no cold water sometimes, even if you selected it and it was impossible to take a shower. Inside the room, the TV had only one channel functioning and no other channels were available. Even after complaining to the front desk nothing was done about it. The towels were very old and not good for guest use anymore. The door lock needs replacement as one had to struggle to remove the key from the lock after unlocking the door.;2

Second to last on this list said:  ""No Smoking:  It is against the law to smoke in these premises.""  Normally that would be perfectly fine for me since I don't smoke; however the desk personnel was standing at the entrance to the check-in area chatting with another gentleman and smoking.  The whole bottom floor reeked of cigarettes.  If you're going to forbid guest from smoking at least have the decency to not do so yourself!

We were not told the pool level was closed indefinitely, the 'deluxe' double room had no room to swing a cat. Enough wardrobe space to hang 7 items for four people. Only 2 internet devices per room, even though we booked for 3 people. Drinks prices were disgusting......$9 for a average beer. Concierge woman had a lousy attitude, air conditioning was rubbish. The only good thing about this facade of a hotel was the location which was fabulous.;2
When we got to the hotel, it was not as nice as it looks on the website. Our room was not in great shape. Aside from being small, a bit shabby, lacking the advertised amenities, it also had lots of little bugs in the shower. My husband thought they might be fleas but we donât know. When we checked in, it was already quite late, but my husband did not want to bring any bugs home with us. So we he went down to the desk to ask about a new room, but they did not have a another available room with 2 queens. After some talking, they did graciously give us 2 rooms with 1 bed each so we split up with our kids.  The two new rooms did not have bugs â hooray! But they were a bit shabby. The room my husband and daughter had clearly had had updates, but it still did not have a great paint;2
We booked the empire as it looked great in the pictures, the pool looked inviting and the reviews were mostly good. The location was excellent, very close to Central Park and Times Squarw. Unfortunately the first room we were allocated had an AC that sounded like a freight train and wet carpet surrounding it. It was also extremely dark as it was an internal room with a view of walls. I was unable to contact reception by phone as it was constantly busy. At reception we were not immediately offered another room and it took another visit to reception after waiting half an hour for an engineer that didn't arrive to be offered the opportunity to move.

"We stayed at this hotel late July/early August, 2005   It is conveniently located near the freeway, and is not a bad place   However, it does have some problems, and we shall not use this hotel again  The entire hotel looks slightly run down and heavily used   Some furniture is marred in the rooms   I was surprised at the lackadaisical attitude of the hotel staff   To say they are not very ambitious is an understatement   The room next to ours had some very distracting, loud children who kept banging and laughing   When I went to the understaffed front desk to complain, rather than offering an apology and a room change, I was asked if I had ""called security""   I demanded a room change and got one, although we did not receive any offer to help us move  Our first room had a small";2

"Positives: - saw NO roaches/other critters and seemed generally cleanish - quiet - large bathroom compared to other hotels  - bed was reasonably comfortable  - location  Dislikes: - severe allergy attack within 5 minutes of every time I entered my room. I went through a pack of Benadryl during my stay. Not sure if it was the dust or some not-visible mold...but as soon as I would leave the room it was fine. - towels reminded me of my nightmares from high school gym class...

Well apparently this is where gossip girl was filmed that said it sure wasn't filmed anywhere other than lobby! So I wasn't expecting much room size wise and it delivered although my knees almost hitting the bathroom door when I closed it to go the the toilet was abit much I'm only 5.10   The wallpaper was hanging off the walls in places in the room, the bathroom other than being small was perfect.... For a diy project with stained woodwork round the door the shower trim was broken, brown slime round shower seals etc oh and a toilet seat that had what looked like marks from someone using an iron on it!

"We stayed at the Empire in January 2017. We got an excellent rate, about $1000 for four nights in a (small) junior suite. We wanted proximity to the Metropolitan Opera, and the Empire is very close, easy walking distance and much closer than any other I know of. But as to amenities the hotel is woefully lacking. The room number on our telephone did not match the number on the door, for example. If we wanted something from the front desk, we had to go down and wait in line; only once, out of a dozen times, did the front desk attendant answer a call from the room. The two rooms were disappointingly dark; we needed an additional floor lamp just to read the newspaper. The bathroom sink was about 1.5 inches deep, so water splatters easily. The tub shower has a glass wall covering";2
This nicely-located hotel looks very stylish and seemed like it would be a good spot for us to crash after being in NYC for a baby shower one weekend.  However, our room on the 10th floor (which is 2 floors below the rooftop nightclub) was vibrating from the bass beat of the club until 4am.  I got no sleep.  Upon calling the front desk to see if we could get a room change the night manager Erik told me they were sold out but he would call the club to ask them to turn down the volume and send up a pair of earplugs.  Really?  of course the club did not adjust the volume at all, and the earplugs never arrived.  Also, our bathroom was laughably small.  It literally fit a walk-in shower, commode, and tiny sink that was facing a wall - you could not stand in front of the sink as there;2

Staying here with my my mum as it was the cheapest option for Wimbledon. We booked a twin room with a fridge. Shared bathroom. We were really happy when we first arrived. Room was clean & bright. Until the door slamming starts! Itâs honestly horrendous. Woke me up constantly in middle of night. Thereâs no signs telling people to be aware of this. We were careful to let doors close quietly but then whatâs the point when nobody else gives a toss? You can also hear every word people say in corridor & it echos.  Itâs a shame as itâs the only real negative about the place as it is a 5 min walk from Hammersmith underground, clean, friendly & cheap. Unfortunately though - unless you wear ear plugs, you wonât get a good sleep. Itâs 7.03 just now. Iâve been up since 0530. Wish I could;2

Decided to stay at the Hilton as we visited Universal Studios since it was conveniently located within walking distance of the park. Arrived at 4pm, Check in was easy, as I had already prepaid for my stay on the Universal Studios website (hotel/ticket pkg) was advised they would be holding an additional $180 incase any damages to the room occurred during our stay and an additional $35 per night for parking. Those were surprise charges, my fault for not reading the small print on the website. Got to the door of our room and housekeeping stopped us and said she needed to check our room one more time because there was a problem in the bathroom and she wanted to check to make sure it was okay. She said it would only take her a few minutes. Caught off guard because we were told our;2

As a proud born & bred New Yorker,[which obviously most of you are not] was excited to return back ,After booking room months in advance and explaining how important and special this homecoming trip was for my wife and kids, we were assured to have a room with a view. What you gave us was a back corner looking at a wall. Shame on you. My only relief in this is karma....what goes around will surely come back around, and hopefully two-fold. Simply no care, pride, or love in what you do...just a job going through the motions.  There is nothing you can say to take away the disappointment. [1]-brown water[rust] from bathroom sink.

This is a nice hotel with a good location. Its not very expensive and the breakfast is good. Rooms are nice, and the beds are comfertable. They cleaned our room every day and gave us new towels every day.   Most of the staff vere really nice and helpful.   But there is something that really irritated me. Under my stay they charged my visa with 560 dollars out of the blue, and when i confronted the staff he told me in a rude way to call my bank, because he didnt know what had happend.  My bank told me this was normal, and i would get the money back within a week or so.. so i calmed down. When i checked out, the lady in the reseption told me that my deposit would be back in my account in a couple of hours.. This is now 2 days ago and i havent seen the 560 dollars OR the deposit! I;2
The Newyorker has removed all coffee makers and refrigerators from the rooms and if you want one they charge you $25-$30 per day per item.  Very frustrating!!!!  Note the room was nice as were the staff but I expect a coffee maker in the room.;2
I say probably as we didnt get past the lobby, and headed for the door. The staff were prefectly friendly, but the lobby had a dirty rug, dilapidated, old bits of furniture lying around, uncleared cans lying, and you needed a card for the rest room, which had signs of the door being kicked in. There were signs of despair and hopelessness. However it was bargain basement, and so I suppose if you are desperate..;2
The location was excellent, but the place smelled of smoke and was not very clean. The carpet had stains, no microwave, and they charge $25/day for a small refrigerator. However, the staff was helpful and kind.;2
"Stayed here 3 days, 2 nights on business so the hotel selection was not my own.  Pros: -great location and on its own section of W64th so very easy to load in and out of car services  -there was a leak at the pool which affected some guest rooms and the hotel staff made accommodations for those displaced at neighboring hotels and paid for their taxi -modern decor, decent sized rooms and comfy beds -provided high-end complimentary shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc and even had a complimentary toothbrush kit -view from the rooftop at sunset was exceptional   Cons: -AC in the room wasn't working, clearly the coils were dirty and they were frozen and so it was 1. Leaking onto the carpet and 2. Really warm in the room (85F outside). I informed the front desk and they said ""they'd";2
I stayed at the Quality Hotel on 94th Street and Broadway for a week in mid-february 2005 for 4 nights. The position of the hotel was excellent, close to the subway, convenience store and Central Park with some great places to eat nearby (I recommend the Key West Diner for breakfast). The towels and bed linen etc were changed daily and the lobby was also attractive and welcoming. HOWEVER, visiting the hotel as part of a group of 20, I had access to many rooms. To our astonishment when one room unlocked their door after we arrived there was a man asleep in the room. One room discovered several cockroaches, one girl's clothes were thrown away by the maid, the plug in my sink was stuck making it completely un-usuable and the radiator leaked onto the carpet. (With which the;2
Very average hotel. Very small rooms. Didn't have a closet, just 2 hooks and 4 hangers. I asked for a quiet room but there was a very loud roaring noise all day and night.  Super long line to check in and check out. They nickel and dime you for everything: you have to pay to have packages delivered there. The room was so small, so I asked to have the mini fridge removed and they wouldn't do it unless I paid a charge. Really? The room service staff was nice and Yuri, the concierge, was super friendly.;2
The location is good - not far from Times Square.  However we queued to check in and were then 'greeted' by a very abrupt receptionist. They were busy but still no need for such a 'lack of welcome' We went to our room - much of the hotel has been refurbished apparently - not our room, it was shabby and very small. The bathroom tiny - we stored toiletries on the floor!  On day 2 of a 3 night stay our Tv broke down , the coffee machine didn't work and our room key was blocked. We were eventually moved to a different room, which was apparently an executive room it was much better had been refurbished but not much bigger!  We have stayed in New York previously and don't expect large rooms but...  We wouldn't stay there again.;2

Room was small, but thatâs New York for ya. Hotel staff was rude, the staff on the roof was lazy and inattentive.

We stayed five days in this hotel and even though the room was clean and it didn't matter to us that the room was quite small, the motor of the air-conditioning was so loud that we could hear it from the hallway and it could wake you in your sleep. Our only window looked out to another building in a way that the curtain-thing wasn't even long enough for us not to be looking into the windows across. But these things didn't really bother us. The reason why we are writing this review is, because when we left a cellphone in the room on the last day, housekeeping took it. Although the hotel never admitted to this even though we phoned the same day we checked out. They said they found nothing and we also left a bottle of rum in the room and they did not even mention that. Furthermore;2
"I travel a lot and go into the city multiple times a year. This was my first and last time I stay at the Empire. My friend and I stayed for one night. The lobby was very nice. The elevators were efficient. The hotel was overall clean. The rooms are small but that is what most expect in NYC. I chose this hotel because it was only 3 blocks away from The View where we had tickets the next morning. We stayed in room 931. We had 2 full size beds. I am sure that made the room feel tighter than if we only had a single bed. The beds were satisfactory but certainly didn't make you say ""ahh"". Besides the room being so small, the bathroom was the bigger disappointment. The drain in the sink filled and had a slow drain every time you used it. It was small and shallow so the slow drain made";2
Hotel rate was high.  Parking was high. Parking cost only good until 6pm.  Park across the street, Universal Hollywood closes at 6pm.   If you do not leave before 6pm, hotel charges an additional $12 for 1 additional hour.  So they know you are going to probably not leave early because the cost of the park is really expensive, also, so they make even more money off a person.  I was disappointed and will not stay at this property again.;2

(over $1000) I called the customer service number and the man said that the amount would be refunded ""in the next few days"", no apologies, nothing.  I waited a week and nothing happened so I emailed them.  A week later I got an email saying that there may have been a 'technical error' and the amount would be refunded, but if it wasnt refunded, to send the email to my credit card company, all very odd!

Me and a friend stayed here for 5 nights just before new years. The price was ok, but the room we had was absolutely tiny. It was difficult for 2 people to move around in. (We stayed in one of their bunk bed rooms) Because the room was so small it got hot really quickly, and there was no way to adjust the heater other than totally turning off all the power in the room. On the other hand, the shared bathrooms were always clean, although I had one shower where there was no hot water.  If the price was a lot cheaper I would say its worth it, but we've been able to find cheaper places to stay that are nicer and bigger.;2
I expected more for the price.   No doors on either shower and we had a Deluxe King and a Suite.  Pool was closed for maintenance indefinitely however, we were not advised of this before check in and the rooftop pool was one of the reasons we chose Empire.;2

The room had major issues which were immediately taken care of when identified but they should never had occurred. The location was convenient and the staff was excellent. It is New York and rooms are generally small but this room was too small for two people. It would have been a great single room.;2
Small very dated and tired hotel! Reception area is poor and it goes down hill from there on. The lift is extremely tiny and the stairwell dirty and narrow. The rooms are tiny with grubby furniture, torn and dirty chair and wardrobe plus no handle on the drawers. The room was cleaned daily but the towels whilst clean were torn!  Staff not visible in the evening which made me feel unsafe! No wifi, no coffee facilities and temperamental hot water.;2
When I got to the room there were stains on the sheets some of the sheets were torn it look like a blood and or catch up on the bedskirt. There was also a piece of exposed metal in the floor in my room which we didnât see until my son tripped over it and split his toe open the staff handled the situation extremely poorly. Parking at this hotel is a nightmare;2
We have stayed here twice. Once when it first opened and this time. The first time was not too bad, cockroaches in the bathroom and a shower that flooded, but we loved the style of the hotel and the location, so we hoped that they had addressed the shower issue in the time between our stays, They did not and it just got worse. The shower fully floods and there is mold beneath the platform. Towels are replaced based on their laundry facility's whim. We were there for a week and only received full towel service twice and this required a call to housekeeping both times, where we were informed that they simply do not get enough towels to service all of their rooms. We came back to our room one time to find that they had put sanitary covers on our dirty glasses, one still half filled;2
It felt like we were bothering the front desk staff when we checked in or stopped to ask any questions.  The room we had has character but thatâs all I can say positive about this hotel. Wallpaper was old and coming off the walls.   Bathroom is very old.  The tub is stained and worn down to the core in certain areas.   The tub facets were on the verge of coming off if you pulled too hard.  Broken floor tiles.  Ice machine removed on one floor and broke on the other.  We like ice when we stay in hotels.    No continental breakfast.  This is definitely not the standard we are used to for the Days Inn chain.  Very close to subway line.;2
Requested suite with 2 double beds & sofa bed,did not get. Room wasnât even ready at 430 when check In was 4pm. Smoke alarms went off in middle of night & we were in lobby til 430 in the morning. No explanation as to what happened. Never stay there again;2
I requested a refrigerator 3 times from the front desk on both days of my stay and it never came.;2
My room had a musty/moldy smell to it when I had the A/C on and a high pitched intermittent whistle near the windows. I was given a different room without any question but the A/C had the same smell when I turned it on. I immediately turned it off. I was given a floor fan to run instead. Good thing it wasn't hot.;2

We were allocated this Hotel as a part of our group package and it appeared to be a good deal as the daily fee they charge to use the fitness centre and have free telephone and wi-fi was waivered. The location is superb right where you want to be to explore wonderful NYC, close to subway, manhatten, empire state building etc. First impressions are good also, as the foyer, bar and reception are all art-deco clean tidy and the staff are very engaging, polite and helpful. The tick tock 24 hour diner attached to the Hotel serves great food and the eggs benedict is out of this world. 10/10 thus far. Our booking stated we was in a standard queen room and when we arrived reception informed us that we had been allocated a room without a view and he would upgrade us to a room with a view;2

When we come back we got the room in a high floor, it was very hard to find the room  on the floor it's very confused also the room was so small..I asked if I could change, front desk said they were full.

The hotel is a good location. Laundry drop off across The street was good.    The room was very, very small. Woulda have been great for an individual, not a family.  They did provide us, with a complimentary roll away, which we sandwiched between the double bed and the wall.   They mentioned at check in about making sure we were comfortable with the room.   I figured that's basically what all the rooms were.   Needs updated badly, few tv channels, always had to ask for enough towels (only showed up once), bed was marginal and every morning was spent counting the bugs!;2
The first room was noisy and dirty. Then we changed the room and this room was much better. Clean, friendly. The breakfast is always the same. The stuff is unfriendly. The parking fee is $21.00 for one day. This is toooo much! In other hotels is parking free! This is too much.;2
I've had the pleasure to be in Los Angeles, for a five week stint, on business.  For three of those weeks, my coworker and I booked rooms at this hotel.  They have excellent promotional prices and it was close to work.  On the exterior, the hotel appears quite nice.  They are doing heavy renovations (converting the hotel to The Hollywood Hotel), at this time, so if you're not in the mood for construction noise, stay away- and they work until 7:00pm at night.  The interior is quite old fashioned and looks quite tired.  The rooms themself are a collection of a bunch of old hotel furniture thrown together.  The first week, I stayed in a dingy, smelly room, but figured I'd deal with it, while my coworker's room looked a couple of notches better than mine.  The next couple of weeks,;2
"I've been here two days.  The elevators have been ""under repair"" the entire time I've been here, with no sign of any repair personnel whatsoever.

There are a whole bunch of unhappy guests here right now.";2

The only thing this hotel has going for it is its proximity to Lincoln Center and its fashionable lobby. Aside from that, the rooms are cramped, the staff is amateurish and the management is incompetent.   We stayed at the hotel on Saturday 11/10 and checked out on Sunday 11/11. On neither day were the elevators working. Three times I had to traverse 11 flights of stairs. How do you run a hotel in NYC without a working elevator? The man who claimed to be the manager was rude and disinterested in hearing complaints from guests as they checked out. I don't know if anyone else was compensated, but we weren't.  Clearly security is also an issue at this hotel, as there is some sort of ghetto gangsta club on the roof which leads to a lot of drunk people lurking the halls at night.  I;2
We paid a premium price here. The room was small and smelled like smoke. Some amenities you would expect, like a proper ice bucket, clean walls--were non-existant. All of this would be OK if it was cheap, but it was super expensive. Worse of all when you went into the bathroom at night there would be like 6-8 cockroaches scurrying about, with cockroach shells under the mirror. Yucko man.;2
Great location, but way out of date, both the decor and the internet policy and service.  Trying to charge $12.95 for each device?  Really??? And having to input your personal data and credit card info to get it?  Come on?  Too bad, because I would stay here again if they could get into the 21st century.;2
Old hotel updated We got a special rate for a party and even then it was overpriced Noisy rooms small and dilapidated Definitely have had better value for money Nice staff and good location are the positives;2
The hotel is very close to Grand Street subway station which makes it ideal to get away quickly from the area. Although the hotel seems clean the smell of 'herbal' cigarettes wafting through the hotel was off putting. The room was extremely small and very cold, and the electric wall heater was very noisy. All in all it was cheap and somewhere to sleep but I found the staff very unhelpful as I had emailed the hotel prior to the visit requesting is some extra touches could be added as it was the hubbys 40th but no reply was received and on arriving none of the staff who were on reception had a basic grasp of the English language to understand my request.;2
"Ok - l'll start by saying I have traveled for work and for pleasure, and stayed in hotels all around the world, from 5 star to utterly disgusting.  This was more like the latter, but a slight step above.   It is on par with an Eastern European BUDGET hotel.  If you are traveling internationally and are pinching pennies - then STAY HERE.  It is really cheap, only a 4-minute walk to the subway, and generally clean and safe.  If you are sightseeing in NYC, you shouldn't be spending time in your hotel room anyway.  Once you get on the subway, you're in Times Square in 12 minutes.  I call it ""European"" as the shower door only came half-way, and there were no face cloths provided - indicative of European hotels rather than US hotels.  They provided shampoo, soap and hand lotion, but";2

After you've paid online the hotel adds a resort fee surchage - $29 a night extra.  You may see it in the fine print but this is an unethical and sneaky way to soak the customer.  I hope there is a class action on this business.  Definitely a very bsd deal for a place that is tattered and is most definitely NOT A RESORT.;2
Hotel is located across street from Universal.  Free Shuttle is offered to park starting at 9am.  Front desk friendly and helpful but...rooms were old and outdated.  Furniture was old and scratched all over, carpet was dirty from excessive use, rooms smelled of smoke and it was a bit disgusting.  Hotel is not worthy of a level 6..maybe a 3.  Parking was $20.  Parked here for our stay and walked over to the park.  Hotel was very busy from Jewish wedding.  Several members of party were rude and impatient in garage.

My partner and I stayed at the New Yorker for three nights in late June. The location of the hotel is very convenient for Penn Station and Midtown, and easy access to the rest of Manhattan as a result. The hotel building is an art deco wonder, and the hotel exterior and lobby are very evocative of that era. We had a great view of midtown from our room on the 27th floor. However, the room itself was in poor condition. On entering, the room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and as we pulled back the curtains there was a lot of dust. The room decor and bathroom fittings were very dated and the air conditioning was noisy.  As other reviewers have said, there was often a long wait for the elevators.  My main gripe with this hotel is the excessive 'resort' fees. $29 per night (plus;2

Stayed here luckily only for one night as that was enough,  found reception staff rude when we checked in, rooms are small and dated, I had emailed them previously to ask for one of the rooms to be a twin as it was for adult brother and sister?

I stayed here for 3 nights and got the deal off of priceline for basically $150/night.  I was told this is very good value for a hotel in new york, especially last minute.  I would have to say, the hotel location was excellent.  Close to a couple of nice restaurants in the upper west area, nice neighbourhoods, and relatively quiet compared to times square.  Also very close to central park which was nice for walks.   However, other than an average bed and bathroom, don't expect much.  Carpets are old and run down.  Lighting is fair to poor.  The air is a bit on the musty side.  The ad states that internet is included, but access is limited to the entrance in the hotel... you definitely will not have access from your room... Furniture is very old.  Entrance and elevators look;2
2 Main Problems!! I stayed there for 3 nights this early March.  Firstly, the day time receptionist lady is extremely unprofessional, unfriendly and unapproachable.  Secondly, there are some pipes problems which is noisy enough to wake me up at 6am in the morning. I stayed in Room 210, then when I requested a room change, the receptionist REFUSED to change the room for me and stated that due to the hotel building is very old, every room would have the same problems. So, clearly she already knew about the problem but despite there are other live-able rooms available, she chose to give me that room. It is until she was off and I spoke to the night time staff that they are able to change my room, to Room 1004, which turned out to be a perfectly fine room without any pipes problems.;2

I had done some research and I thought the Ramada Inn near Hollywood looked good.  Upon arrival the front desk asked me if I needed a shuttle back to LAX airport.  I said yes and was asked for a 10 dollar deposit.  I questioned why and was told the hotel gives the shuttle 10 dollars when we leave.  This shuttle is 15 dollars a person and the hotel never gave the shuttle any money.  I was travelling with my mother so I had to pay 40 dollars for a ride.  We were placed in a room in the front of the hotel.  This is off of Vermont which is a very busy road and not much insulation and can hear people talking, traffic and sirens all through the night.  On the second day I requested to be moved to the back of the hotel and was told that the entire hotel was booked and we would have to;2

I am a 50 year old lady travelling Europe and London being expensive we decided to stay in the 'outer' suburbs but somewhere hear enough to transport it wouldn't be an issue and this hostel covers that aspect perfectly. We could hop on a train within a three minute walk brilliant. Now the rooms - we stayed on level two and the stairs are not a drama. The hostel itself always looked clean to me - we stayed three nights/four days. The room we had comprised of two single beds, one wardrobe, a bar fridge and a bathroom everything you could possibly need - BUT the beds were crap - really uncomfortable to the point I could feel the springs digging into me, when we opened the wardrobe the left hand door almost fell off so we didn't use it, bathroom was fine but a shower prior to 7am is;2
So the positives: Location - right next to subway and in Upper West Side. The room itself was clean, and relatively quiet for NYC. Wifi worked pretty well. The room was decently sized.  The negatives, and there's a lot of them: - The hotel is old, tired, and run down. There was a hole in our bathroom door, and burn marks in the lamp. - The TV barely worked - the screen was all fuzzy. And of course no HDMI, so I couldn't even use my own chromecast. - A smoke alarm battery was chirping all night in the hallway, and nobody from hotel management or housekeeping cared enough to replace the battery. - No towels in room at check-in. - Fitness center was a misnomer - it is 1 treadmill and 1 bike. That's it. - The unit next to us reeked of smoking and marijuana. - No security - The room;2

I STAYED IN  3 HOTELS FOR THIS LA TRIP with my family but unfortunately Hilton hotel @ universal city failed my expectations as this is hotel I paid most during my 1 week stay in LA. The washroom shower was dated, leaking with water, lamp stand was not working and carpet was old,when we arrived at the front desk it was the most unwelcoming guest experience I've ever experience in my life since I started travelling. With the price of the hotel, I would probably not recommend, we only choose this hotel because of the location that's why I didn't mind of paying a little bit more, but think of the BRAND of HILTON , hire better employees pls. for you to carry on your BRAND.;2

We stayed for 1 night and were very disppointed to have selected it. The rooms are okay with bare minimal accessories. The bathroom was okay but lacked in hygeine. The furnishings of the room were average with curtains worn out. itis difficult to reach th ehotel as probably at that time some construction was going on and all approach roads leading to the hotel were closed. The taxi driver dropped us a few metres away from the hotel and it was a nightmare for us to reach the hotel as the streets were dark and some young boys shouting and yelling on the streets. Very unsafe. Not a good place to stay if one wants to feel NYC.;2
This is technically a Hyatt property, but is the worst Hyatt I've ever stayed at. For starters, there's zero parking available. They direct you to park in an airport parking structure next to the hotel, but there's no special rate for hotel guests. Then I check into my room, and it smells like cigarette smoke. The rest of the room was fine, but that doesn't really matter when your room reeks. Finally, upon checking out and receiving my bill, I was charged for some sort of unlimited liquor offer that I hadn't purchased. Overall, it feels like they take advantage of people who want to stay near the airport and are used to the Hyatt brand/quality. You will not receive any of it, and are better off staying at a cheaper property.;2

It's long past its prime and in dire need of a makeover or just looking like it's run by someone who gives a wotsit. Tired decor, failing services (two out of four lifts and the wifi were broken on my one night's stay) and indifferent staff made it all a bit trying. An American couple in the lobby when I was checking out we're expressing their irritation at the lack of basics and demanding to be refunded. Being British I just put up with it and committed to posting a passive-aggressive review on Facebook afterwards (I'm a man of my word).

Poorly maintained hotel that needs some money spent on it and to be managed better. I guess the first clue should be in the huge neon sign on the top of the building outside which is only half working. That sort of sums up this hotel. Only half right. Broken towel rail, broken window blinds, no light on the desk making it impossible to work there.;2
We had the misfortune to stay here for 3 nights over July 4 weekend. The room was a size of a closet, the mattress was rickety and gave us a back-ache. The sink would not drain, the furnishings & plumbing was a throwback to the fifties. No coffee-maker, no bottled-water, plastic cups, watered-down toiletries. The prices were outrageous and behavior of the staff was condescending, unfriendly and often in-correct information was passed out. No idea who rated this hotel so highly - we had a choice of several surrounding places but we relied on previous ratings. Wyndham needs to spend money to upgrade the physical facilities and hire better staff.;2
Let's start with the good. No bedbugs as far as I could tell, and I did check. The bathroom was very clean, as were the linens. Close to the subway, and good restaurants nearby. Also close to a very pretty section of Central Park.  There's a lot to steel yourself for, however. Our room was the smallest I've ever stayed in, which is to be expected for the price and location. Little details are neglected, like the lamps that collapsed upon touching (but they still worked). The maid short-sheeted the bed. The remote control didn't work with the TV (different brands). Peeling paint and corners of wallpaper.  Front desk staff seemed indifferent.  Didn't even try the wi-fi based on earlier reviews, and we didn't get instructions on how to connect anyway.  Honestly, if I were doing it;2

Had 2 rooms for our 2 day stay. AC/Heater did not work for one of the rooms for more than a day. Had to call more than a couple of times to have someone come over to fix it. Issue was fixed but no one followed up in person. Couple of texts sent to check in, I guess there is something in hospitality called personal touch!?   Called at 11:30PM to check how long the bar is open, was informed that it is open till 1AM and last order at 12:45. Reached the lounge/bar with my wife at 12:05AM and were sent back. The reason provided was there were not enough guests at the lounge! Laughable! How can there be guests when you send them back! Ridiculous service that!;2
"We stayed here as it was an 18th birthday treat for my daughter as she's a big Gossip Girl TV show fan. It was her first trip to New York and we'd flown from the UK so were looking forward to our first night's sleep.  The room we were given was an absolute disgrace. The toilet handle was hanging off, there was no instructions on how to do anything in the room such as cooling or heating and the ""style"" of the hotel is clearly dark and dingy because there were just 2 side lights for the entire room which meant your could hardly see a thing.  To be honest, the lights were the least of our problems. We didn't sleep a wink the first night as our room had EVERY noise polution problem you could possibly have. It had huge generators right outside the windows that were as noisy as being";2
We were looking for a place to stay that was close to Central Park and not crowded. When we first arrived, the doorman/porter did not help us with our bags. Even the taxi driver said to us they never help the guests. Then when we walked to the front desk, he started flirting with me and I found it to be very disrespectful. That's exactly what he was doing outside with two women.   Elevator: Needs a bigger one. New one. We had to make 2 trips to get our luggage to our rooms. Not help from the porter.  Stairs: Small. Dirty.  Rooms: Small. A/C works poorly. One night it was hot and I couldn't sleep. That said, it was clean.   At first you think the hotel is clean, but when you go upstairs to the rooms you see that it needs some cleaning. Also, one of the front ladies was rude to;2
"First, the positive. Convenient location and a friendly and accommodating  housekeeping staff that promptly responded to a couple of routine requests. Otherwise, not so good. The Queen bed sloped sharply on both sides towards the middle; the bathroom was in major need of retileing and the lines at lobby checkout and check-in were longer than the line outside ""Hello, Dolly."" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). Overall, not a good value.";2
I found the Astor to be a very small, small hotel, eruo style furniture, carpet can do for an upgrade unless you keep your shoes on the entire time before getting into bed.   Nice front desk staff, very helpful. Subsequently they had no hot water. If I pay two-hundred a night or two-thousand a night or even two dollars a night.. I expect to have hot water.. No explanation from the Astor. They are working on it.. ok while they work on the boiler ..  than  the Astor needs to work on this bill... The front desk has no access to the computers to make bill adjustments, etc.. Not a place for children, , Expect to  pay for internet access if you bring your laptop.. The location was ok if you view the hotel from outside ..Overall. I will never advise or recommend such an horrific place;2
Positives to take from this hotel is that it is so close to Universal. The hotel staff were great. I did complain in the morning before checking out and the staff dealt with it with minimal fuss.  We were checked in for one night. Didn't use any facilities other then the room. The AC was really loud so needed to have that off. The fridge was also loud. 7.30am builders started on our floor or above us. If we had been told we could have chosen to move. Insects in the bathroom. As I have said staff were great and dealt with all appropriately and I greatly appreciate that, but this is a platform designed to review and it was all in all a disappointing visit to a Hilton.;2

Stained toilets, paint peeling from the ceiling in the shower noise from the street, hard beds, poorly maintained bathrooms, run down exterior. Room AC unit was older than i am and worked only fairly.;2
The website, building and lobby gave deceptive appearances because when we arrived in our room, the room had an outdated look.  I do not mean outdated meaning the 1920's, I mean outdated as an Econo Lodge or some off-highway motel.  My children thought they were in for a treat as they were when we visitied TRYP last year but, we were treated to a non-remodeled room with bare walls, old cupboards, cheap countertops, old tiles in the bathroom which had paint marks from poorly painted walls.  I lost 30,000 points on this horrible experience.  Will NEVER visit the New Yorker again!;2
The room I was given smelled horrible, like mold and was old, and has not been updated. There was a huge rust spot in the bathroom tub which was disgusting This room should never have been rented. I complained and was moved to a lovely and updated room on the 11th floor for the second and final night.I will never stay at this hotel again and will not recommend it.;2

Much like I was, you're probably on a budget, looking at reviews on here thinking it doesn't sound THAT bad. In honestly, it's not THAT bad. It probably won't kill you. Particularly if you're planning on being out all the time and just crashing out in your room.   But make no mistake, this is a hostel not a hotel, despite what their website claims. If you expect to spent any time at all in the room, spend a little bit more and get a proper hotel. The general state of repair was absolutely awful, the bed sheets were stained, the facilities were seriously limited and the wifi was mostly unusable.  One huge plus: I absolutely loved the surrounding areas. The bars and cafes near the hotel were a great antidote to Times Square! Would highly recommend the area, if not this 'hotel'.;2
First room had a bad water from window. The window already had tape around window seam from previously noticing a leak.  If you find a leak, hire the right people and fix the window properly. Putting tape on window seams is a joke. The location was great, staff was excellent Pamela (front desk), Manny, and Samantha (Hotel concierge);2
I stayed at the the hotel overall the stay was good wa surpised there was drink making factiles in the room or bottle water. On arrival I was informed that I needed to leave $300 (Â£230) deposit which I was not made aware of before hand however I was not in position to argue the toss and was informed it was a refundable deposit. I thought this would be return on departure I checked out two weeks ago and still no sign of the deposit being return. It concerns me that they have not returned it. I was a solo traveler who left the room as I found it.;2
Pros - Location: It is a block from 96th street subway stop, so basically the express 2 and 3 train, and local 1 train stop there, quick hop to basically anywhere. Also, it is upper west side, so it is basically a residential neighborhood, no tourist traffic, no loud noises at night. There are CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Subway, restaurants within a block, extremely convenient.  Cons - From the fire escape route map on the door, it seems like I am in the smallest room on the floor, I don't know why, I didn't book thru a third party, I didn't bid my own price on priceline, I booked it direct from the wyndhamrewards.com, but that's ok I can accept that, what I can't accept is since this is a Days Hotel vs the normal Days Inn, I thought the quality would be better than Days Inn;2

I'm not fussy when I book a budget hotel in NYC. The hotel was clean and the clerk who checked us in was polite. However, the mattress was hanging through and uncomfortable. The shades were broken, the heater blasted loudly, and only my husband got to take a hot shower. My daughter and I got the lukewarm water. This is definitely not a place I recommend.;2

The room was tiny - just big enough for a bed. The wardrobe was sub-standard, old, rickety, black veneer cardboard. The television I did not use was antique. The view was of an access way, and very far from picturesque. But, the sheets were clean, the lavatory was clean and the shower was fine. It's over-priced, but well-located for running in Central Park and for access to the museum mile and so forth.;2
great location shabby rooms hotel great location rooms extremely dated use modern decoration, communal areas nice pools good, drinks piano bar expensive got drink lobby cheaper reason,  ;2
My husband and twin toddlers arrived early for our stay and were nicely greeted and informed that our room was not ready but we could keep our bags with the bellhop until available. After coming back to the hotel, I was handed 5 bags with no offer to help to my room or use of a cart. The hotel was under construction so navigating through the area was tight with a double stroller and multiple bags. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. To then come to find out that there is currently no room service offered because it is also under construction was very discouraging! We have two kids and choose our hotels based on convenience. We stayed here last year and had a much better experience! We sadly wont be back or recommend to anyone in the future.;2

I came to this Hotel 3 years ago.  And I didn't like.  Can't say I like it more.  Design is nice, staff is friendly, location is great.  But... The hotel is noisy as possible.  Street view, you will suffer Broadway traffic.  Court view, you will feel the vibrations of all HVAC units in your bed and still hear the traffic.   Breakfast is nice but stupidly expensive.  8$ for Evian when you can by at DR (15m) for 2$.  I honesty don't want to say it's a bad place but I would suggest finding something else.  (You may want to avoid the Columbus 6 because it's globally the same thing.)  Sorry guys, but I take an hotel to sleep.  In 3 nights I hardly slept more than 10h total. Not good for business.;2
The room wasnât soundproof so I could hear other noises from outside. My hotel was supposed to be free since my family used his points to redeem but it got messed up. I ended up paying the full price even the check in staff told me differently. I donât think Iâd want to come back to this location. Not satisfied!;2
My wife and I stayed here for 4 days in November, and whilst there was nothing particulary wrong with the hotel there was also nothing great about it. Upon arrival we were quickly checked in and sent on our way to our room. The main hallways and communal areas were extremely hot and in poor repair. Once in our room, considering it was a king superior it wasn't particulary large, and had a view of the AC units out the back of the hotel. Trying to get the room to a comfortable temperature was a struggle, and if you wanted anything like a coffee in your room that was extra. The design of the shower wasn't great as it flooded the bathroom, however the shouwer itself was the highlight of the room.  Overall if it wasn't for the fact that we were both so exhausted from walking round;2
This is an old classic NYC hotel. Small rooms. Tiny bathrooms. Old and tired furnishings. The staff tries hard but they are stuck with an old property. It is in a very good location across from Lincoln Center and two blocks from Central Park. Lots of good eating within easy walking distance. Too bad the hotel hasn't been refurbed in a while. The room/bathroom size can't be fixed even it the hotel is refurbished.;2

I stayed in this hotel with my friend for 5 nights. This accommodation has the perfect location, lot of landmarks are a walk distance. The problem is that thereâs absolutely no service! First of all, the night when we arrived (Saturday) we had to wait almost 1 hour to be checked in because there was only one agent at the front desk. Check-in itself were not informative at all. No explanation about services offered, facilities, restaurants, nothing. Bellmen were not available neither. Room are small but clean and with a nice view. Thereâs no fridge. Bathroom very small. At the check-out they charge you with additional fees for they stay and for keeping your luggage in the bellman room. Overall this is a good hotel but from a 4-star hotel I expected a higher level of service,;2

Pretty underwhelmed by this place. Room was clean, but a little shabby or cracked floor tiles and mould in grout. Staff weren't overly friendly. Pipes make clanking noises really loud in the night. The elevator is tiny and super slow, and there's only 1 for 11 floors and 90+ rooms. And trying to charge for WiFi in this day and age is just irritating. Location not the best either, bit too far north of all the action. TV channel range also really bad, and you can hear your neighbours.;2

Where do I begin. This hotel trades on it fabulous location and it's proximity to glitzs and glam and up town living.  This worn-out, dark depressing place is better suited for rental by the hour not by the day.  Bellman look very, very unprofessional but nice, front desk needs customer service training.  They try to squeeze any penny they can get out of you, from $15.00 per devise for internet service to $7.50 for a small bottle of water to $1.50 per cup for in room coffee machine.  This is not a four star location at all...  PS. Beware, the tiger in room chair pose a real threat.;2
We stayed in a Captain's Room, the most expensive room type at the Jane.  Really wish we hadn't.  The location is fantasic but the room was small, hot (fan and aircon were ineffective and noisy), and outdated.  The Captain's rooms are all also on the West side, overlooking the Hudson (through tiny windows), and also a main highway (the noise of which is impossible to ignore, even on the fourth floor).  Facilities are basic, there is no kettle in the room so you can't make tea or coffee.  Worst of all of the service.  The staff on the front desk are very unfriendly, the policy seems to be that you have to wait until 3pm to check in, regardless of whether your room might be ready earlier.  We stayed 5 nights and twice had to deal with returning to our room and finding that our key;2

I do not recommend staying at this hotel as our credit card details were stolen and over $1100 was illegally spent before our card was cancelled.I know it was stolen at this hotel as it was the only place we used the credit card on our trip.When I emailed management to let them know my issue, they refused to acknowledge that it may have happened at their hotel. (how else did it happen if the card was used nowhere else?) Also, after checking other traveller reviews, I see we are not the only people to have had this happen, there is a similar review in March 2015. Traveller beware!!;2

This was my third time at the Empire as it is very convenient to work, but I was very disappointed to the point of risking the hotel from my list. Staff (especially housekeeping) is really impolite and not helpful - I had a problem with the a/c in my room and was just told after minutes waiting they would not check it and could not move me to another room. My room was extremely hot the 2 nights of my stay and there was nothing I could do. I like the hotel's dÃ©cor but it is starting to show its age, especially in the rooms - some polishing is definitely needed. Room is really small (even for NY) and you cannot be in front of the sink in the bathroom at all. I booked a superior room to try to avoid that but it seems there is no big difference between standard and superior (I was;2

Well before anything else, at around 7pm staff members barged into the room without invitation shouting that they were âlooking for someoneâ - we were asleep due to jet lag, there was no warning or anything they literally just flung the door open! Baffling and wholly unprofessional. Overall the hotel room wasâ¦Just pretty gross. The room clearly hadnât seen a vacuum cleaner in a good few weeks, the bathroom wasnât very clean, there was hairs of the previous occupants up the wall in the shower, the toilet flush and door handle were hanging off.  At check in they took the deposit (expected) and then another $175 which I wasnât told about, when I queried it at check out the guy behind the counter didnât have a clue what it was, went and asked someone then when he came back he;2

This hotel is a real study in contrasts. I was really thrown by the neighborhood.Wow! It's the kind to drive through with your windows up and doors locked. The room that we had was a queen double. The drapes and bedspreads were shabby altho the room was clean. I hope the other rooms are nicer.The bathroom was a bit on the small side and had a newer countertop ,,but really lacked counterspace.Our second floor balcony overlooked the parking lot,however, our room was quiet.The staff was efficient altho not overly friendly.The lower level where breakfast is served made me think I was in a different hotel. Recently redone with a ton of marble,new furnishings etc. There were nice choices for the breakfast buffet.;2
Staff and housekeeping overwhelmed, disorganized, small room, cold, small pool.  Didn't have room ready, housekeeping in room at 930pm one night.  Had to tell front desk what was taken out of mini bar open checkout?!  Keep track of that stuff yourself!;2
"The hotel has a great location, however upon our check-in I was under the impression I'd have a king size bed once we were checked in we received a queen size needless to say my husband is 6'7 and we needed the space. Once I asked for a room with a King size bed the employee told me "" this is all we have."" Now the problem I had with that is that upon staying a night and heading in I decided to ask for another face towel at the front after listening to another gentlemen being checked in I found that he was asked ""which floor he'd like to stay on, and which view he'd like"" wow none of those amenities were offered to me. As we asked for another face towel we were advised they'd have to bring the face towel up to our room which was a hustle for a tip. I've never stayed a hotel where";2
We stayed here for 2 weeks while we got married in the city. We booked a junior suite which was spacious with a couch and arm chairs however we were expecting a room with a separate living area ... This turned out to be a different room type that cost extra.   The bed was comfortable however the pillows were too soft for me and ended up giving me a sore neck. When we asked for different pillows, we were told that they could only give us more of the same type and didn't have anything firmer.   The other strange thing was that they is no glassware in the room. We were only provided paper cups. Not very glamorous when we wanted a glass of champagne. In addition, our cups weren't replenished every day so we quickly ran out of them!   The elevators were VERY slow. I think a couple;2

We booked this hotel for its location. However, they pretty much stuck us in a closet. Our room is so small that we only got an office chair and not another chair. The shower drips. No counter space in the bathroom nor anywhere else. The furniture is old and the handles are loose. Couldnât sleep very week as the walls are thin and I could hear everything happening outside. I even thought people were trying to open our room door. Iâm literally still here and I hate it. Iâm having to sit at the end of the bed to even charge my phone and write this review as they donât have outlets close to the bed. Paid the $33+ dollars for Resort/Facilities fee per night for absolutely nothing. Donât even have a coffee maker in our room, let alone a fridge. Just read that if you want one itâs $50;2

Location is this hotel's major outstanding feature.  The rest is quite ordinary. Why all the clothing fixtures are too high to reach comfortably is a puzzel. Also they seem to make it difficult to submit a poor review since they insist on 200 characters.;2
I stayed for one night in mid April. I used credit card points, that were the equivalent of a $370 rate. I expected a small room. I did not expect a badly peeling bathroom door, a bathroom sink that was barely draining, a very loud room heater, and a mostly dismissive front desk staff.;2
I was coming back from a buisness trip in Texas and decided to stay in New York for 2 nights for some traveling.  Unfortunately either due to the hurricane or holiday season most of the hotels were either fully booked or very expensive. This seemed like the only decent option (based on tripadvisor reviews) for 150$ a night.   I am a young guy and I've been in the army spending about a month sleeping in a tent in the middle of the desert so I guessed nothing can be that bad right?  As I arrived in the hotel I was given room 338. The elevator was broken, so it was either having the staff carrying my bad upstairs or taking it myself. I knew the room was going to be small, but never thought it would be *that* small. My room was close to the bathroom and the shower, so each time;2

"To give context to these comments; we are seasoned travellers who have visited both developing countries and numerous cosmopolitan cities in North America and Europe.  Until the neighborhood improves I would recommend that people do not stay here, unless they are on a very limited budget. I had considerable unease with the feel of the area, especially at night.  The hotel itself is being renovated and a cursory look would indicate fresh white bedding and a minimalist style. Closer examination would uncover a bathtub that fails to drain and a 'paint job ' in the bathroom rather than a renovation.";2
Iâll start with the positives - good location right next to City Walk and fab view from the room. Pool staff are also lovely.  Thatâs where the positive feedback ends! I am staying at the hotel in Executive room   at the moment and itâs extremely busy. Day 1 - shower blocked.  Fine, as fixed fairly quickly. Day 2 - child stood on glass in room - called for room to be hoovered. No apology but was cleaned.  Housekeeping only left two towels for 4 people and no bath mat. Called to get moreâ¦..Not received till next evening despite chasing.  Went to front desk to get assistance - no help and no apology. Day 3 - breakfast â¦. Service awful - no engagement at all and to top it off cereal bowl unwashed and orange juice had someone elseâs lipstick on the glass. Nice touch in Covid times!;2

The hotel has very small rooms. Very noisy as rooms face 8th Avenue and are directly across the street from Penn Station. Very clean with friendly staff. Unfortunately, they charge $5.00 for each bag to store prior to check in and check out.  The lobby is great and the hotelâs architecture is Art Deco as it opened in 1930. Good place to visit.... would not stay here again, did not feel safe at night and security did not ask to see each guests room key prior to getting in the elevator!;2
Told we were upgraded to a King Suite, only to realize that my 17 year old son now has to sleep on a pull-out couch. When he tried to open it after a very long day, it was tied shut!!We has to get housekeeping to come up and cut it open as it was new and the mattress was still covered in plastic(which my son slept on as he was exhausted). The room had an iron/ironing board but not one table in the room to iron anything on(we ironed on a foot stool). Very disappointed in the entire set up of the room!! We only spent 6 hours in the room, and then I saw an extra charge on my credit card for 19.00..when I called they said we had made ourselves coffee!! Are you kidding!! we didn't touch one thing, not to mention it was national free coffee day!! When I called to complain to the;2
"Do not stay in a ""41"" room.  They are tiny and dark, as the curtains can not be opened due to being an interior room.  These rooms should only be used for storage, and not of humans.

"Just stayed at this hotel for a weekend while visiting Universal Studios.  Very convenient location.  You can walk to the studios in 5 mins, very easy walk.  Rooms are nice, beds comfortable. The weekend we stayed, they had a wedding party and were fully booked.  This resulted in total meltdown for the kitchen.  We ordered dinner in the restaurant which arrived an hour later.  It was cold and the side was missing.  I mentioned it and they said they had run out sorry!  The next morning we tried the buffet breakfast and the eggs and bacon were ""stone cold"".  I complained and the waiters were very good and had the kitchen make my kids some more eggs.

Stayed here for 2 nights and that was too long.  They didn't accept our Travelex card for payment, whereas every other hotel had been happy to accept it. We have two children so we wanted to drop our luggage off and then head off to Universal Studios.  We didn't get back to our room until about 9pm.  When our son tried to go for a shower we found we couldn't adjust the temperature as the handle was broken.  We called reception expecting that someone would come fairly quickly, but we had to phone again over half an hour later by which time we'd had to shower our kids with cold water as they just couldn't stay awake any longer. Also the shower was so small,we could barely turn around, it didn't seem clean and the shower nozzle was so low we couldn't wash our hair.  The next;2

We are a family of four from Trivandrum,India but flew from Dubai to the US for holidays. We had the misfortune of staying in this shack for a night. Was the only negative part of an otherwise fun time in Manhattan. The whole place was shady, staff were rude illegals! There was a tiny 2 feet wide corridor to the room. No brerakfast. No wifi. They even charged extra $24 for facilities which we did not ask for. That was compulsory and that was the rules. Was never written before booking. Thankfully I won that dispute with a little help from my Bank.  People stay away from this hotel - you dont need to waste your time there or spend time to write a bad review in TA.;2

Your rooms are extremely small for your high rates...everything is over-priced, charging for Wi-Fi is insulting, given what you charge, and one of the elevators was not functioning when I left, which made me late for my shuttle ride;2
The hotel is in a good location. very close to the penn and bus station. Walk a few blocks up, and you will be on times sq. The employees do a great job. The only problem I had was the building, and my room. The AC blows out out moldy or a musty smell. It was not only my room. I noticed it was in the fitness room and the lobby. I was told, try to change the room, but that wouldn't have changed anything, if it was through out the building. The fact is... its a very old building. With a very old duct system that needs changing. Thank god I didn't use the AC, because maybe I would have arrived home sick. I will not be returning, regardless of the location........;2
2 recent nights spent at the Empire have been very disappointing. Here are the bad bits: - Rooms are shabby and in desperate need of updating (Ignore the promotional photo, think Super8 meets The Shining) - The deadlock was broken and the security chain was hanging off the screws. This lead to two completely sleepless nights, due to every sound in the corridor feeling like a threat. A complaint to the management resulted in absolutely no action whatsoever, which is unforgivable for a woman traveling alone.  - A leaking shower meant that the bathroom turned into a swimming pool (and with no housekeeping for 2 days or bathroom ventilation - well draw your own conclusions in the NY summer)  It wasn't all bad: The location is great and the bed was comfortable. Obviously the location;2
Trip Advisor reviews are pretty glowing--and curiously commend the same staff members by name. After my husband and I recently visited, we now know these reviews are far from objective. We booked a few months back because the location was good for what we were doing in LA. However, the room itself is far different than what is shown in the website photos. It was shabby--scuffed and dented walls, rusted bathroom fixtures, broken tiles, thin and frayed towels, a burned out light bulb in the bedside lamp, and dust in all corners. When we requested an ironing board, a broken one that would not stand was delivered to our room. Although we had confirmed in advance that the complimentary breakfast in the cafe was available, it was not so--the restaurant was no longer operating (and;2
Hilton Universal Hotel was at a nice location, if one wanted to stay close to the Universal Studios and the City Walk.  There were free shuttles that ran every 10-15minutes from the hotel to the Universal city walk and back.  But to go anywhere else in LA, one had to rent a car.  The hotel itself was not bad.  The lobby was nice and well maintained, some bellmen were very polite, but not all were.  The room was well laid out and looked nice but could have used a bigger TV.  Bathroom was clean and everything worked.  I found some questionable stains on the carpet.  I felt itchy in bed and found a couple of bug bites on my legs the next morning... that was gross.  Next three nights were no different... I think they may have bed bug problems.  The biggest problem with the hotel was;2

Our stay was pleasant, however two of the days were without hot water. The desk staff in the mornings were very understanding. The afternoon and evening crew acted as if they didn't know anything was wrong.  Communication between the hotel and the health club around the corner (where we were suppose to be able to shower) was none existent, and I ended up paying for my shower time. Reimbursed by the hotel, but still a hassle. The location was great, but I'd probably stay somewhere else next trip.;2
Stayed here for one night to meet friends for an evening in New York. The hotel is set up for volume and is obviously extremely convenient for Madison Square Garden, so gets a wide variety of clientele from tourists to show-goers to business conference people. Rooms could use some updating but the views from upper floors can be good. Unfortunately the night we were there the people in the next door room were having a major party, with at least half a dozen people clearly getting drunk, screaming and laughing, banging things around, TV volume turned up high, slamming doors. The walls are very thin so we could hear everything.  xThey did not stop until 3.30am and then we could hear them retching and coughing in the morning at 8am. Worst night's sleep I have had for a long time.;2

"First of all, the vaunted Rooftop Bar, with its magnificent view of nothing, should have been kept for the enjoyment of guests, like a building roof should be available to its residents. I didn't anticipate sharing space with a nightclub, complete with bouncers and velvet ropes.  The elevators in this hotel should be ripped up and replaced. There were only 2 of 4 cars working; Each holds about 8 people; and people jam into them like they are subway cars. Maybe some of those elevators to the roof should be give over to the hotel.  Since I was not properly dressed for the rooftop, I hoped the lobby bar would be nice - until they did last call at midnight. Hell, are we in New York City or Podunk?

Hotel:  Note: i have not visited NY before but am a frequent traveler, so will review, based on experiences had around the world.  The hotel is very worn. Everything in it could need a renovation. The water temperature of the shower kept changing and more often than not there was a distinct smell of fried food in the room. Beds are to the soft side. The doors close very loudly and you can hear your neighbors speak clearly in your own room. It is in the very low end, when compared to other three star hotels i have stayed in.

This is an amazing historic property. We ended up in the Tesla room, where Nikola Tesla lived and died. I was so honored to be randomly assigned this room. Everything was wonderful expect the water temperature. The shower went from pleasant to scalding and then to freezing. We stayed there for three days and I was honestly too scarred to wash my hair for fear of a severe burn. I mentioned it to the front desk and I was told that the building is very old with very old plumbing and it was common to have inconsistencies in temperature.;2
We've stayed at about a dozen hotels all over Manhattan and never really had a bad experience until we came here.  The check-in was long, tedious and unpleasant. The woman that checked us in was just plain rude and seemed to absolutely hate her job.  The first room they put us in was an absolute horrible neightmare. The decor was run down, the room was so small, you couldn't even turn around in it,  you had to back onto the toilet because the bathroom was so small. Nowhere to put a suitcase or a bag or a cosmetics case. But the worst thing was the horrendous noise from the airconditioning units outside our window. NOT that our aircon even worked!! it was SO hot! We were sweating all night and hardly had any sleep, between the loud noise and heat. The noise was like a big truck;2
Rooms are very dated. Not a big issue if rooms were clean which mine was not. There were very large wet stains on the floor like they were never cleaned and left to dry. Strands of hair left in the bathroom gross. The room view and location was great. Staff very slow and confused. Poor service and no sense of urgency. Did not feel the stay was worth the points or price. I would have rather stayed elsewhere. We stayed only one night just for our universal visit which served its purpose but I wouldnât come back. I was hoping this would be my go to since I have a season pass but I guess not.;2
bit strange- does atmosphere really wanted stay look say unusual wonderful, read mixed reviews prepared enthusiastic desk reception, wait 15 minutes earlier issues addressed, assigned odd rooms building ask bellman directions- none offered, walked did n't offer help bags, yes 224 rooms strange narrow stairwell dark dingy barely courtyard view, room not bad just nice, clean use upgrades not sure large people use bathroom- area small narrow, stay ok- nola charm location, better places, quiet courtyard fountain thinking raining night, ca n't good conscience recommend,  ;2
Last fall we went to New York for 4 day vacations and were excited to stay at Empire Hotel. Our room was awful! I don't think it supposed to be a room, more like mop closet. Soooo tiny!!! After complaining for a while, they moved us to a better room next day. Would not stay there again;2

Me and my friend stayed at the hotel from the 23 of April to the 2 of may! Upon arrival I was informed that they would withdraw 300$ as a deposit and it would be returned upon checkout.  First of all the bathroom was super small and old, 2 persons couldnât fit in thereâ¦ The night before checkout our âbillâ was stuffed under our doorâ¦ odd way to do it. When we checked out I asked the receptionist when me deposit would be released. He said that the hotel would release as soon as we left the hotel and that it was up to my bank when I would receive it again. However almost a month later I have not received my deposit and they have withdrawn further 40$ without notice.. I have tried several email, Facebook and phone numbers however I have not received answers! Super frustrating and I;2
"Is this hotel in floreclosure or do the owners really have no idea as to how a hotel needs to keep from falling into ruin?  Two star hotels should not look like third world countries. I opened the door to my room, and the first thing I saw was a carpet so grungy that I did not want to walk on it. Then I peaked in the bathroom and saw brown around the toilet. At that point- stay or not?  We ""won"" the room on Priceline but there is a bottom threshold and this sure is no two star hotel. I don't think it even should have one star. The next thing I do it pull up the bedding to look for bedbug evidence. I found none, but what I did see was that the bottom sheet was more than a foot short of the bottom of the bed. Aw gee. Where did they get the deal on too short sheets? Then I looked";2

I stayed here in 2007 and 2008 and came back again this past week.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  First off, there were no glasses in the room, there were 2 flat pillow on each of the double beds and the room was so hot! We had to have engineering come up about the airconditioner and he told us it was because our room was big!  BIG?  there was less than 2 feet from foot of bed to wall and the bathroom was minute!  Engineering had to finally bring us a fan that we left on for our 3 day stay.   We called for ice and each time it took over 30 minutes, no matter if we called for it at 10 am, 5 pm or 10 pm.  Oddly we ran into friends who were staying at the hotel and they too said they would never come back!;2
The lobby and elevators smelled foul and the room wasnât much better. The room was not clean. Windows were hard to see out of they were so dirty. The bathroom smelled so bad I bought air fresheners. Dust everywhere. Pool closes at 8:30pm. The location is convenient next to the airport, but be ready to hear planes taking off all the time.;2
Had to move rooms during my stay even though several reps prior had said I wouldnât have to do so. Being told I could only stay in the room if I was a âbasketball player or football playerâ was pretty disrespectful. I guess I should have worked harder on my jump shot, so possibly a âmeâ issue.;2
Little things were broken, fridge cabinet and sliding door. Room was plain and small, I expected more. Additional fees were added at the end. No complimentary breakfast,  no free Internet.  Bellhop was rushing us.;2
My best childhood girlfriends and I planned a get together for one night in NYC-we booked two connecting rooms, or so we were told by the person at the hotel who made the reservation for us.  This was confirmed by a phone call later before our trip.    When we checked in, we were told that the rooms were not connecting.  We were very upset about this and they obviously did not care at all that we had been misled when making the reservation.  We were then told that we would get rooms across the hall from each other.  That also turned out to be not true. The rooms were not close at all.   One room was ready at 3:00 but the other room was not.  We were told it would be 5-10 minutes until it was ready, but that was not true either .  We were told we could have a late check out for;2
I had to change rooms because of the poor air quality. The second room had same issue but, not as bad as the first room. The air system has a bad mildew smell!! I had to sleep with my head under the covers. Also, they need to provide a microwave either on the floors, or near the front desk so guest can warm up their food! They wanted to charge me $20 for a microwave, to warm up food that I purchased from their restaurant! This hotel is way too pricey to be inhaling mold spores!!!! Change out your ventilation system!!!!;2
For over $320 a night the rooms should be cleaner. Mold in the shower. No real glasses only paper. Opened a small bottle of wine from the mini bar which had turned vinegary. At least they took that charge off the bill;2
Reserved a 2 Queen Suite. Turns out, it's actually a Standard 2 Queen room, with adjoining door access to a conference room. I walked into the conference room, returned to the 2 Queen room and the door closed behind me. Now I was locked out of the conference room. Called the Front Desk, was told someone would come up to fix the situation. No one came. No other room was offered. Complete lack of customer service. Do NOT waste your money or your points, on a Suite at the Hyatt Regency LAX.;2

The ""standard room"" was clean but was very small and had old, outdated interior and fixtures, and was in a creepy back hallway,, not  all what I expected based on the website pictures. The mattress was quite uncomfortable. The security here was good. There is no coffee maker in the room. I called three times to have one sent to my room and it never made it. I finally went to the front desk and the check in staff had one sent up. If location is important, it will work. Overall, not worth the amount I paid for the hotel.";2

"I booked the hotel through Hotel.com and pre-paid for the room, in the description, it stated free wifi. But when I checked in, I was told there will be ""facility charge"" for using the internet, phone, business center and fitness center. When I raised the question about the charges, the front desk woman responded with arrogance and rudeness. I declined the service and didn't use any of the facilities nor the wifi but was still charged for it at check out time. I heard the same complaint from other customer while I was checking in. Apparently, this hotel has mis-led other customers with the false promotion practice too. I have stayed in other Wyndham hotels before and hadn't been charged for this fee. If the hotel charge this fee then they should not advertise free WiFi. I will";2
Room 550 in downtown LA room was nastyâ¦.

Specially with a broke bathroom door.;2
First of all i tried to communicate with the hotel prior to my visit and no one even bothered to respond me with an answer! :( When i arrived to the hotel and asked for early check in - i did not even receive an option to pay extra just to get into my room they just said no rooms are avilable. When i finally received my room after requests of a high floor i received the lowest one, the windows does not close even after calling service guy, Safe did not work, there was no refrigerator in the room - even that in booking there is. The worst thing is that my room had a view to all Air conditioning of the hotel which made a lot of noise and i has to sleep with  ear plugs in a 4 star Hotel. There are 3 star hotels more modern and equipped from yours.;2
This hotel was clean, staff was nice enough and as other reviewers noted breakfast is really a plus.  But... please do not be fooled , this hotel is in the middle of no where.  Yes there is a subway nearby, but I personally did not feel comfortable walking the neighborhood.  There is nothng wrong with the hotel itself, it is like a standard Ramada or marriott.  If you dont have a car not sure i would stay here.;2
"We spent 4 nights in the hotel, in a standard room. This is New York, so â¬200 per night for a really small room is to be expected (no view). Imagine our surprise when coming back after the first night the room was not made. When calling housekeeoping we were informed ""we do not do cleaning-if you want a.) new towels b.) new amenities c.) the trash to be taken out "" we would have to call them every single time and let them know if we want some or all of this. After inquiring at the reception we were told that usually there would be room cleaning, but tehre was some kind of problem. Therefore only as to what the recptionist referred to as the ""light cleaning"". And when I enquired about the closed roof top (for the whole time of our stay!) I was just told ""well, do you know the";2
Upon check in, we noticed that the pull-out sofa bed had not been made. No biggie. We asked for it to be made around noon, and then hit the town. Still not made when we returned at 5:00. Again, no biggie. We asked again for it to be made before leaving for dinner around 7:00. We returned with 2 exhausted kids around 10:30 and it was still not made. We called downstairs and were promised immediate action. 11:00 - nothing. 11:30 - nothing. Finally around midnight, a gentleman arrived to make the bed. Brutal lack of attention/communication between the front desk and housekeeping.I've stayed at The Empire 5-10 times. I've recommended it to friends/colleagues another 10-20 times. I'll stay somewhere else next time I'm in town.;2

Upon arrival the hotel looks great from the outside, but initial appearances can be deceiving, as you get to the rooms they are tiny, old, outdated, and juts not up to 4-star standards, featuring cheap furniture and fittings, uncomfortable matress, dirty old carpets, and an old bathroom without a door lock! The quality of the room could have been overlooked if we payed the price that was initially given (I payed in advance) aside from the actual hotel price you have to pay for a $29 + tax hotel facility fee per night for services you might not even need and that were represented as included when booking! Very dishonest to force you to pay for something you don't need without any prior advice! We are very unhappy and disappointed, you would be better off paying a cheaper price;2

"As a bargain basement kind of hotel, this place would be tolerable if they would just change a few things: 1) give me a wastebasket in my room; 2) put a roll of toilet paper in the shared bath so I don't have to drag one in every time I need to use the facilities; 3) give me a hook and a rack in the bathroom where I can put my clothes and my towel; 4) fix the shower faucets so they don't fall off when I turn them on; 5) put something on the bottom of the tub so I don't slip immediately upon stepping into it; 6) fix the world' s worst caulking job in the showers.

The neighborhood is pretty good and quiter at night compared to being in downtown Manhattan, but the lobby is very small and the elevator can accomodate 2 -4 people unless you have luggage then it will only fit 2 people.   So you wait or use the somewhat treacherous stairs.  Our room had that old smoke smell - but the air conditioner kept it comfortable, which is easy to do because the room is so small.  The bathrooms were clean. The beds comfortable.  They did supply nice linens.  Request 2 beds and you may get a larger room.  They have vending machines somewhere - possibly in the basement.  But you have to go elsewhere for any kind of food.  They do have do have a doorman posted it seemed at all times and we felt safe inside the hotel.   Central Park is right across the;2
High charge for early check in, we arrived in LA at 9AM local time and early check in wasnt until 1pm local time or there is a high early check in fee. The room was filthy, no carpet in rooms, but room wasnt swept or mopped, restroom was dirty and the room was dusty. NO signs of COVID safety protocol. NO HOT TUB in hotel, and valet was very expensive for Valet IN n OUT per day fee. At the rates they charge for all these things you would expect Hyatt to deliver on at least a 4 star level, but this place is really in the 1 to 2 star range if that. I've stayed at other Hyatt Regency before and the service and rates were much more in line with the level of satisfaction. Needs much improvement.;2
Two words sum up The Wyndham.. Noisy and Basic. The room was small and dated but clean, Iâm sure it had not been modernised for some time. If you want to enjoy NYC you are going to need a decent nights sleep and you wonât be getting that in room 2179. The windows may as well not be there as they are not keeping any sound out at all, even on the 21st floor all you hear during the night is sirens, garbage trucks emptying dumpsters, construction work and whatever else is going on in NYC, at times if thought my bed was in the street.  There was a little museum in the basement which was interesting and showed the hotel in it heyday. A good location but I wonât be going back.  The Wyndham charges âFacility feesâ (as do many others in NYC), these are nothing less than a scam, $31.75;2

Sometimes you have to give places the benefit of the doubt and that is exactly what I did with the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport location. I am a very loyal Hyatt customer and have been for quite sometime. You don't just achieve the highest level of membership with them after staying just a few nights. Obviously there has to be plenty of money spent. I booked this reservation with an open mind and didn't let the previous negative reviews and ratings stop me for giving them a shot. Doing your homework on a place prior to visiting never hurts right?  Upon arriving I was amazed with the new remodeling that had been done!

Worst check in experience ever. Upon arrival, we were notified there were two reservations under my name and we should pay for the second room for the first night due to lack of cancellation. I explained I had called to ask for Government Employee rates but never made a reservation but she kept on arguing and requested the reservation desk name as if this would resolve the issue. Then we find out that our reserved room was an accessible (Handicapped) room. No one in my family is handicapped so she kept arguing again and notified us that we should pay more because accessible rooms are cheaper. Finally the manager who was standing a few feet away came by and told us that He would lose his job if He cancelled the reservation and gave us the regular room but he would do it any way;2

"My Family just rented a hotel at this location at $400 per night for an ""executive suite"".  We figured that was good being close to Universal Studios as we were on a family vacation and convenience was key.  We asked to check in early but it was not available which wasn't a problem. We ventured over to Universal.  My husband was feeling ill and went back to hotel to rest and check in and was asked to wait another hour to get into his room.  Once he got our room it was not the executive suite but ""what was available"".  - not completely an issue as he would take what he could get at the time.  Keep in mind check in staff was very rude, not accomodating in any way.  We ""pre-paid"" for breakfast for ease of our stay and to eat close to where we planned to hang out.  When we got to";2
My friend and i checked in on the afternoon of Feb 29th for a 6 day stay. I had already prepared myself for the worst after reading the reviews on here but I was pleased to be presented with a clean bedroom (though small) and spacious bathroom.  I stayed at the hotel for the first 2 nights before staying at On The Ave with my boyf (who lives in NY) for a further 3 nights. Because the deal we got so was so cheap  including flights (Â£400), Astor On The Park was used more as a place to dump my luggage than a place for me to actually stay for the duration of the week as my boyf booked the other hotel as a romantic surprise.  Anyway..I digress. The view from the bedroom window was dire, it was of a brick wall and other rooms opposite ours in a different building. Made no difference,;2
"Firstly, the whole lobby smelled like cannabis and the whole level for my room smelled like a fast food joint. Upon stepping out of the elevator on my level, I noticed there were chicken bones left on the ground, which was disgusting especially during Covid times. My shower head did not work properly; it was not fixed on the wall properly and thus kept shifting during my shower. There was barely any hot water during my shower as well. There was no staff around to assist with the luggages, but perhaps it's because of Covid. Upon check out, the front desk staff insisted that I had to pay US$50 for the night, despite my telling her that the night was completely redeemed using the Hyatt points. It was only after we contacted the Singapore team that the issue was rectified and they";2
Whilst the room was ok, clean enough and with mini fridge and cupboard, this was not a nice place to stay due to nightly noise. Obviously you expect some amount of noise in such a large place but doors here do not shut quietly and due to the tiled floors and lack of insulation the whole floor seems to reverberate each time a door slams shut, and that was a frequent occurrence. Earplugs dull the noise slightly but our lack of sleep here was maddening. Put something on the doors! Also, the shared bathroom facilities are quite nice but the showers are bizarre with a push button that lasts only 18 seconds- barely long enough to soap up and no shelf for clothes. Wifi also expensive for a place this size. I won't be back.;2

"Great location but really dated small rooms. I've never seen a bathroom sink that small even on cruise ships.  The furniture was scratched.. The shower had only a half door and water sprayed all over the bathroom.  The closet had a curtain, no door.   The first 5 channels of the tv were fuzzy.  Yes, I asked about it.  Was told I am sorry that is a problem. It was also in my friends room on another floor so I know it's a problem thank you.  I found the front desk to be rather rude.   They didn't really show any desire to assist.  Noisy rooms...  The wireless internet was soooo slow.     The ""TRENDY"" club was not trendy.. Sorry  The lobby was cool. That is about all I can say.   I will never stay here again.";2
I am a member of Hilton Honors and have never experienced such a dirty room at a Hilton anywhere and when complaining we did not even get an apology from housekeeping and cleanliness did not improve. we found e.g. children socks from the previous occupant which were left drying on a lamp (disgusting).  location is great when you only want to go to Universal Studios (shuttle bus). for visiting other parts of LA the location is not ideal, even though it is close to the Underground. there is a connector bus to the Hop on hop off bus, but the last connection already leaves at 6 p.m. the pool looks nice, but does not seem to be very clean either, there are no showers by the pool and the water smells funny.   lunch and dinner was ok. great was also the coffee shop - only place where;2
The Ameritania hotel has a very central location, on the corner of Broadway and W 54th street. So, if you desire to be very close to Times Square, this is a good choice. This area of the city can be extremely crowded in the afternoon and at night, due to the proximity of musical theaters - and simply because: It's Times Square. So, if you prefer your hotel to be in a calmer area, you're better off selecting a hotel in another area of Manhattan. For instance SoHo or Greewich Village.   The room was nice, with a nice bathroom and good beds.   Also they make good cocktails in the hotel lobby bar. We even received a little thank you drink on the house, one evening after we had enjoyed a few cocktails there.   What was not a good experience, was thw wifi. It's free in the lobby, but;2
Just checked in at the Empire Hotel. Staff at front desk not very friendly. Got our room and was very disappointed. Itâs a room that needs love and attention. Went down to reception and informed them, but left with an impression that I just waisted their time. We are here for three days and hopefully things can only get better. By the way doorman very friendly.;2
Forget it if you are a business woman expecting minimal respect. I made a reservation in my name, with my credit card, and listed my husband, with a different last name as a guest in the room. My name was canceled from the reservation, and reservations communicated with him, only, under my email address no less.;2
Lobby is lovely that's the biggest positive. States its a 4 star actually would rate as a 2/3 star. Dated surroundings. Room very small and bathroom even smaller. Paper peeling off walls, paint work dirty. There was a power outage whilst we were there very few emergency lights worked the management resorted to putting glow sticks in stairwells. For a Health & Safety conscious country the hotel didnt appear to have an emergency plan. Pool is more of a plunge pool full of children. Bar don't serve coffee only alcoholic drinks. Would not stay here again.;2

I donât typically post reviews, especially bad ones, but this hotel deserves an honest assessment. Poor customer service (we requested a fan three times but never got one) and inadequate air conditioning resulted in a disappointing stay. Only reason this hotel gets a 2nd star is the location.;2
The room had terrible noisy air conditioning which smelt as well. We reported this and when we enquired an hour later we were told that we were on the list. No one came and we unplugged the fans when we were in the room.  Brilliant location next to the Lincoln Centre and very near Central Park.  Unless it's cheap stay somewhere else nice and spend the money on cabs;2
"We have previously stayed at the Empire  several times and have been very happy there.However, we were in   Room338 CRS#362634435 last night ( Nov. 26)  and were very disappointed in our stay. The air conditioning  did not adequately  cool the room so it was hot and stuffy; this made it very difficult to get any sleep. This morning we had no hot water; the desk clerk said a pipe had burst. Our overnight experience was pretty hard to accept; we are hoping that the hotel will refund the fee for our stay because we would stay there again since our daughter lives 2 blocks away; we won't, however, if our problems are not addressed.We tried to contact the manager by phone but just kept getting  passed around and we were never connected to anyone in authority.";2

I'm not giving 1 star but I should. It was my first trip to NY and this hotel was terrible. It was on Holydays so price were very high everywhere, but this place was cheaper than the other (100/night). The only reason I give this hotel 2 stars, is the Absolute Bagels. BEST BAGEL EVER !!! They put like an inche of cream cheese. SO DELICIOUS !! But the hotel room was microscopic, walls are like paper and the personnal are not very helpful. Pay a little bit more and you'ill get a better place than this.;2
Stayed in November 2003 ... was about all I could find for less than $300 a night that weekend! This hotel is fairly convenient ... being so close to Broadway ... about an $8.00 quick cab ride to the main theatre locations. Room was small and elevators way too small and slow.  Fortunately we were only on the fourth floor so made use of the well-worn marble stairs. But when we slipped off our shoes for the evening, we realized the entire carpet was soaking wet! Called the front desk ... they said it was the last non-smoking room available. So we had to put on shoes for every trip from the bed to the bathroom. The same desk clerk was on duty when we checked out ... she took 10% off our bill for the inconvenience. Learned my lesson ... if I'm going to NYC, I need to make a;2

The hotel was fine.  Food selection could be better.  What really bothered me was pre-paying for room on Hyatt web-site.  I was surprised that they charged my card $.76.  The claim the wrong amount was collected off their web site.  I told them it is insulting to do this with no reason until I contacted  them.  Just be careful if you prepay at this hotel they may nickel and dime you like me.;2
On Priceline this hotel was advertised as a four-star hotel.  I would rated this hotel between a two or three star.  Although I received a great price it was run down and did not meet my standards.  I personally would not stay here again.;2
If you fancy a dark environment then this is the place for you! The lobby is so dark you feel blind coming in from the street - it doesn't get ANY better throughout the hotel!  My room was decorated in dark brown colours with hardly any light coming in and the lamps were few!  The location is great though!;2
This was horrible! I had a family of 4 and we asked over and over for housekeeping to provide us with the right amount of towels and they didnât! Had a non-smoking room but it smelled like somebody did. Our bed sheets had stains on them. The bottom of the couch was not swept. A person named Nick was delightful. Absolutely horrible experience and I donât know if weâll stay here again.;2
We booked two nights in a budget room with a double bed. It was very hot and there was no AC but no complaints here, since it was advertised that budget rooms do not have AC. The ceiling fan was whobbling and hitting the ceiling making a noise that I could hear from the next door shared bathroom.   The location is pretty good. You are 3 blocks away from the 110th street subway station which is serviced by the red line that can get you downtown, but be advised that it is not an express line and it stops in every single station there is, so if you need to get to Times Square, for example, you will have 9 stops along the way.  The most frustrating thing was that the total due on arrival as per the booking information was not in fact the final total due. Oh yes, there were taxes!;2
Not friendly staff. Not good housekeeping service. The best thing is the location. Noisy and id you ask for something we received no answer. Did not replace toilet paper or shower cap and never came to help with bags;2
The hotel was situated right on 34th and 8th street brilliant location , easy access to all the shops and underground transport , we were so excited when we arrived the outside looked amazing so did the reception,  look can be deceiving tho it was a total let down  ,15 mins waiting for a lift as only 2 lifts working out of 6 which are always full , once you get off the lift your opinion will change , the hotel is out dated , we booked a queen room with extra breakfast , the room was small and cold , no rads in the room only a heater on the ceiling , lithe heater would dry your throat out so ud have to put on the cold to cool down the room as there are no windows working ,the bath had brown stains on it and the outside had black mould on the edges other then that the room was;2
Personally would not stay there again. Did not feel 100% safe.  We may be too choosey however stayed there four nights (1 - 5 Dec) and found 3 cockroaches, one escaped capture... Room, well OK except alot of things were broken or kind of fixed. Corners of room had not seen a cleaner for several months. No hot water one morning. TV reception was poor.  Most things worked Ok however the room was very tired. I know NY is not cheap, however could have found a cheaper /  better hotel in London. Bellman was helpful and had a good sense of humour. Mexican food next door I would recommend. Subway very close on 96th. Good good places to eat breakfast close by. Overall just OK, but I would not stay there again.;2
"This comment relates to the breakfast staff.  If you don't care about the breakfast service, you can ignore.  It has a nice breakfast, if you obey the rules.  If your wife is sick and you want to take her a piece of toast or orange juice, hopefully this won't happen to you.  About four employees screaming at me in both English and Spanish about if I take a piece of toast and a glass to the room they will be fired, so if I don't stop, they will call the police.  All of this in front of about 50-100 guests.  Not exactly my definition of a ""service"" industry.  So I left the juice and toast, and said that they'd better throw it out anyway and not serve it to the remainig people.  When I shared this with my wife, she was quite upset.  But if you just want a clean place to crash it's";2
This is a bit of a saga but I'll give you the good points first: Near a subway (thank goodness) and opposite Central Park which was lovely. FIRST NIGHT: suffered room 314. VERY noisy and ineffective heating and the room was freezing.  There was a 2inch gap under the door with an icy draft blowing in.  Room cramped but beds comfy.   NEXT MORNING: Ready to do battle over the room and demand a refund if necessary but they moved us very easily to 'the best room'.  Nice view of the park.  Huge very uncomfortable kingsize bed and a pair of very shabby bunk beds.  We wanted a twin room and got this! Room very cramped for 2 single people. OVERALL: staff were mostly pleasant(ish) but sloppy.  No coffee making facilities in the room and no decent cafe's nearby for a hot drink or snack.;2
Only for this hotel is in a great location it has nothing going for it!!! It had the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in!!!! I was so disappointed. When you walk in to the hotel the lobby is beautiful however that is not carried up to the rooms. To make things worse when we were checking out we were handed a bill despite our trip being paid in full in advance. The receptionist argued with me about it for 15 mins even though I gave him the booking voucher that I had received from our travel agent. I then spent 10 mins waiting to speak to a manager only to be told that they didn't have time to speak to me and that they'd 'clear' the bill. I was so cross! We stayed in 9 hotels during our trip and I never encountered rudeness like it, it really put a dampener on our trip.;2

Had a terrible stay. Clogged sink drains, poor sink tap design leading to water splashing all around the bathroom, extremely small bathrooms, and worst of all, water leaking out of the bath area on to the bathroom floor!! Had to use bath towels to absorb the water. Had to switch through 3 different rooms in a 3-night stay. Given the 4 star rating this hotel has, i think it deserves a 0 star review, given even 2 or 3 star hotels fare better in comparison. Would suggest going for other much better hotels in the area available at a similar price point;2
This hotel is to be avoided like the plague if you are the least bit fussy. The rooms are tired with furniture that is damaged or at best well worn. The state of cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired and general hotel facilities and services are almost non-existent. The staff tried their best in the circumstances and the hotel is fairly well situated overlooking the top end of Central Park. Although a high  standard of hotel accom is not crucial in a City like NY the lack of it it certainly spoilt our holiday. The actual experience of the hotel in no way matched the visual impression given on it`s website. We accept that tariffs are reasonable but this is no excuse for the the standard of accom and serices offered. Should have really complained more whilst there but there did;2

I have done my homework prior to the stay and so there were no surprises. Shared a bunk bed room with another buddy for 2 nights and that was enough. Room was as a big as a car park lot. So go figure how 2 grown man elbow ourselves as we tried to change clothes etc. Luckily both of us travelled light so luggage storage wasn't an issue. But then again, treat it as a place just to sleep, so should be ok. Toilets were clean, but then again, sharing a common toilet may not appeal to many. The elevator broke down during my stay and climbing stairs weren't fun. Room is musty and dark. Thankfully it's winter - I wonder how people deal with summer....ALL THE BEST IF YOU ARE ON THE CHEAP! Cheers!;2
I booked this hotel because of its location in midtown close to Penn Station.  But it was a big disappointment.  The room had no closet or wardrobe or luggage holder, just a couple of hooks and a table -- where I put my suitcase.  Their website doesn't mention it but they don't have an elevator, so you better be very fit to schlep your luggage and yourself up and down the floors.  Those of us who are old and/or have knee issues are advised to give this place a miss.;2

The price is right for the location of this hotel, but you should be aware that it has many problems and you have to endure many annoyances during the stay. We experienced a constantly running toilet, very uneven floor surface (divots covered with carpet), interminably slow and tiny elevators and spotty room service. (We actually came in late one day to find that the room hadn't been cleaned at all.) Despite these problems, we found the management to be sympathetic and fair---the manager actually took a little off of our bill.;2
small rooms and upon looking over the room a huge cockroach flew out of the bathroom. I didn't want to go downstairs empty handed so I attempted to find it by looking under the curtains and saw a previous guests toothbrush. Went back downstairs and was given another room. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night and left very early the next morning. They're currently checking the temperature of all visitors to before entering. This is known useless, I wouldn't be surprised if some higher-ups cousin sold them those things. I suppose they may turn away 1 or 2 people over the pandemic, but a temperature check doesn't catch the people who are asymptomatic or are building up. I guess it's pandemic theater and thank you for wasting my time waiting in line EVERY TIME I went back;2
Check in and check out are less then awesome at this property. Iâve been staying her for work as the price is decent, rooms are clean and in all honesty Iâm only in the room to sleep. There is a small trattoria off the lobby, food is good and happy hour prices are great. What I will say is that the check in and out kind of sucks. Iâve stayed at this property a few times and itâs the same thing. Only 1-2 people on the desk and a line up to the door. Today a lady felt much more important then everyone and cut the line. When I said something to the employee that the woman should have been sent to the back of the line shoe told me she works for an airline and gets priority... my comment was thatâs not right, we are all human and all of our time is important. I too am in tourism and;2
We booked this hotel for 3 nights for our family holiday.  Positives-close to Central Park, Manhattan Diner, Laundromat and coffee shops.  Negatives - very far from Manhattan and other major attractions.  I said not for faint hearted because I am not claustrophobic but the hallways made me feel nauseous. They are like narrow alleyways where I found it challenging to find our room for two days.  The rooms were super small and the beds were very small as well. Shockingly, one of them was just one foot away from toilet door.  We booked the room for 4 guests but we never had 4 towels and housekeeping and front desk did not answer the intercom.  I had to call the reservation number from my mobile who transferred me to front desk and we got our towel. Next day it was the same story;2
"I had one night at the New Yorker when I unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in New York City. At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).  The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"".   Once I got to my room, I found that it was incredibly small and cramped. There was barely room for the bed. The room had no view either, except of the building opposite";2

Overall, the staff was very courteous. Everyone we met up to the morning we checked out was so friendly. We had no hot water Mother's Day morning and when I called to report it to the front desk they said they would call me right back. I never received a call back and I also didn't get a shower that morning. Steer clear of the breakfast buffet. My husband's sausage was raw inside, all the pastries were dry and cold, definitely not fresh, waffles and pancakes were cold, and bacon was hard as a rock. This was suppose to be $23.99 per person. We complained and the manager only charged us the kids price of $9.99 per person. I guess it was something but the food was so awful I would have preferred not to pay for the stomach ache I received later. I just had some grapefruit and;2

They tried to close us out a day early for no reason - Which took time out of our  day to clear up and make confusing costs on my card because they charged it before it was time and had to reverse/redo charges. Room did not have bathrobes or water  like it was advertised. No ice machine available to guests. No room service which we were looking forward to. Rooms overall were not as nice as the picture. You can hear EVERY door slam in the hallway at all hours of the night. The waiter at the lobby bar asked me to put my feet down (off an ottoman) while having a cocktail one night.    That being said, I did like the location, it was very easy to get most places. The bell hop and entry way greeters were very nice. The blonde female at the front desk was very helpful (in clearing up;2
We have just retuned from a New York break, 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. This is advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not, Iâve stayed at better 2-star hotels. Itâs really tired and shabby with tape covering the frayed edges of carpet in the communal areas.  If you are staying on 21st floor and above you may wait up to 20 minutes for an elevator as they are not always working. The windows in the rooms do not fit the frame so the wind howls like a gale through the windows, making the rooms extremely cold. We had to keep the curtains closed the whole time to stop the freezing draft.  The receptionists are not very helpful, when we arrived, we explained that we had paid for bed and breakfast and were advised by the receptionist that breakfast was;2
"This place is like an overpriced YMCA or youth hostel. Dingy, no maid service, no window a/c in our room and the windows didn't lock. We had to jam a piece of the wall ""art"" into the window to feel somewhat safe. Beds and pillows were hard as a rock. Stained sheets and towels. Disgusting room, I didn't even shower there. Location is very far from downtown, about 30 minutes on the subway. I would not recommend this place at all, not even for the price.";2

We stayed 4 nights at the end of June 2014.  First impressions of the lobby decor were positive and the greeting at reception was warm and helpful.  The location is great and you will enjoy the roof top bar when the weather is nice.  However, other aspects of the Hotel let it down (in order of importance to us): - Air conditioning in room very loud.  Other guests said the same.  We chose to have air con off at night.  Room very hot, still noisy from other air con units.  We did not sleep well on any night.  - Furniture chipped and lacking attention.  You know it when you see it - furniture that looked good maybe 5 or 6 years ago but now looking shabby.  Vinyl covering peeling off the desk in our room.  If we can see it why can't Hotel management?  - Lifts / elevators.  You will;2

This is a deal-breaker for me: The bathroom has a sliding door which doesn't close all the way. It's not a mechanical issue. It was designed this way. I've seen this at other hotels, mainly in Florida: bathroom doors that either aren't there or don't allow for sufficient privacy. If you are the kind of person who likes to defecate within view of your significant other... then I don't want to know you. You need psychiatric help. I'll put this as clearly as possible:  All hotels need bathroom doors which close completely, blocking out all sight and sound. This one doesn't meet that requirement.   Furthermore... I know this should be obvious, but this hotel is right next to the airport.  I don't know if some people consider that a plus but here's what it means:  You have a horrible;2

The rooms smelled, the carpets had huge stains on them, the TV's in the rooms are about 20 years old. Hilton needs to step it up and catch up with the times. No microwave or fridge in the rooms.  The only plus is walking distance to the park.;2
This hotel is trying hard but not succeeding in overcoming old facilities and dated rooms.  The lobby and bar area is nice however.  I would only recommend if rates are quite low. There are probably better values to be had.;2
I visited this hotel 2 years ago and was so impressed. We went over from the uk and after the long flight the guy at reception gave us early check in and breakfast vouchers. We have just come back from our second trip to the same hotel and what a difference. The lady at reception was very rude and wasnât welcoming at all. We also had to pay $29 per night facility charge which we had no idea about and never paid it first time there. We were very tired due to our early flight and couldnât check in early .. then we had to pay to put our luggage in with the concierge. They have also taken out the tea/coffee facility in the rooms. When I get home to the uk and check my account they have taken two lots of money coming to over Â£200! I have no clue what this is for and Iâm very;2
Having read the reviews I wasn't expecting anything too great.  It was pretty much as expected.  The room was very small and cramped.  We had a double room instead of a twin room, which was not ideal.    We were on the 10th floor and should have had a good view but the window was so filthy that we could only just make out a vague outline of the building opposite.....  There was also thick dust above the bathroom door.  The sheets were clean but the shower had a mouldy ceiling and the bedroom carpet didn't fit.  Also the radiator hissed all night.  Luckily we spent very little time in the room and what we did spend there we were so exhausted we just crashed out.  Someone had left an old pie on the pipes ourside the lift on the tenth floor and it was there for the whole duration;2
Before leaving for the US, visiting and staying the first time in NYC, my partner and I decided to select this hotel because of the reviews we saw in this site and the its central location. I have consulted twice with my travel agent here, outside the US, before making the reservation. I told him that for certain reasons my partner and I are unable to share a bed although we would like to stay in the same room. The solution was offered also in the hotel homepage site in the form of two beds in a single room. After checking this site and consulting with my travel agent, he rechecked through his reservation center and reassured us that he asked for a twin bed room (i.e. two separate beds) and this is what we will get. Our voucher indicated this. When we got to the hotel after 10pm;2

Stayed over Christmas and was deeply disappointed.  My room's carpet was stained, hasn't seen a steam clean in years and had cigarette burns. The rooms are dated and need desperate Upgrade. The furniture was battered, re-stained and old. The couch was stained. Of 4 cities I booked over the holidays this was the worst.  I ordered room service extensively - the pizza was good but the Pacific Ceviche was disgusting. The fillet mignon was dry and horrible. Did the chef take off over Christmas? No other Hilton ever gave such bad food.  2 days we had problems with hot water. The 2nd day they apologized and said it will be back on in an hour. Refurb the hotel! I was never offered to be moved, a coffee or any courtesy besides an apology. Step it up guys. Your service is mediocre.   The;2

"THE ""BEST"" is the situation, in the middle of Manhantan and very near of metro stations, supermarkets, fashion street, banks... and the staff, friendly and accesible.  THE WORST: too much things. Begs in the bedroom, windows that seem thereÂ´s no window (so, very cold and very noisy inside) and no courtains, so you wake up very early in the morning. Old bathrooms (with broken tiles near the basin), old corridors, stairs and elevators (in fact one of them didnÂ´t work the day of my arrival, so i had to change my room).  THE PRICE: about 412$ for 5 days the first week of Dec. Cheap for NY, but if you can find something better donÂ´t hesitate.  CLUE: find out and book with anticipation, this will be the best to find a good hotel.";2

The hotel is centrally located, with underground stations close by. Plenty of eating places within walking distance. Room quality is not great. We opted for a double room. The bed was comfortable but the room was not very clean. The carpet was stained, bathroom not mopped and cleaned thoroughly everyday. I had dropped a few hairs on the bathroom floor and they stayed there for 4 days.  Hotel quality can be improved. Staff is friendly and approachable.;2
The hotel room was an okay size, location was good, staff generally friendly and helpful and the water pressure was good, otherwise the room wasnât great.  The room had thick cobwebs in the corners, hairs in the bath, rust around the plug hole, peeling wallpaper, holes in the bed linen and our bed was so lumpy with a mattress that was trashed on one side. The water temperature in the shower fluctuated from icy to scalding throughout the duration of a shower without any adjustment on my part and there was no bath mat and the shower was permanently angled so that the floor was dangerously soaked and slippy. We asked for extra towels just so we could put one down after the first evening! The windows were so thin that you could hear the noise of the city at all hours and we all woke;2

The location of the Empire Hotel is great. Right beside the Lincoln Center. But it is a small and old hotel. It looks like it has been refurbished but the essential is still in need of some improvements. The elevators are terrible and so is the breakfast restaurant.

I expected a nicer place, although we had a nice and calm stay.;2
Aside from the A/C breaking down numerous times, no hot water for parts of two days, and the elevators not working on occasion we loved the hotel.  The Empire Hotel is a typical NY boutique hotel.  The rooms are on the small side, but better than some, but the atmosphere is very nice.;2

The only good about this hotel is the location. When you view the pictures of the rooms & hotel it looks great but in person it's a major disappointment. The room is very small and tight as well as the bathroom you barley have any room to do your business the tv is small the prices are high. The hotel charges an additional 27 nightly because of their self proclaimed great wifi and other b.s amenities.

We arrived at the hotel to check in around 4:30am.  The hotel receptionist was very courteous.   However initially I was told my room wasn't ready but would be completed in 5 minutes.  I should've known it was too good to be true.  An hour and a half later I was given a different room.  When I went up to the room, the AC did not work correctly.  It was blowing warm air on one of the hottest days of the year and the room temperature was so uncomfortable.   I went down to the same receptionist to complain and was told she would send up an engineer to check and fix the AC.  The engineer came, played with the knobs and had the nerve to tell me it was working.  If I didn't have some class, I would've told him to leave.   My face drenched in sweat was my own imagination.

I treated my girlfriend for her 40th a trip to New York, wanted to go somewhere iconic to NYC and had been told the New Yorker is the place to go due to the location and history.   The stay was fun and we enjoyed it, what I cannot believe is that the deposit they took wasn't held but actually took the payment and not returned. I have emailed loads of times and tried calling, nothing. The payment of over 260 EUROS has been taken on the 15th November we stayed for 5 nights, promised it would be returned within 10 business days yet no sign of it, right before Christmas too so thanks for that.

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time at this hotel, rooms were small and the view was bad, but the decor and the hospitality made up for it. Trouble started after check out. Every day for the past 3 days they've been charging my card $100+ and they are failing miserably with helping resolve the issue. They claimied we used multiple bottles from the mini bar even though we never touched it.. And continued to charge the card after they resolved a booking issue with bookit.com. We are very disappointed, we liked this hotel and planned to come back, however after that incident we absolutely will not.;2

We have just returned from staying in New York where we had a fabulous time but were very disappointed in our hotel.  The room was like a prison cell with no light only a tiny window and a very dim bulb.  There was no air in the room and the radiator was off all day but on all night.  We were unable to alter it so the room was freezing when we got in but we were cooking in the night.  There was one small wardrobe with only two coathangers and no drawer space.  We asked to move but were told all the rooms were the same,  Talking to other guests this seemed true and those 'lucky' enough to have a room overlooking the park said they were unable to sleep because of traffic noise.  We had to ask each day for towels as old ones were taken but not replaced and we ended up buying loo;2
Placed in this hotel by my Company. Art Deco description just means dated and tired!  Tiny rooms, small bathrooms, poor shower pressure and packed Lobby with long queues at reception. Area is central to Macys and Penn station yet pretty grubby with plenty of homeless around. High police presence which says something about the area!  Rooms here seem fairly cheap and this is for a reason, not recommended.;2
"We wanted a queen bed which I reserved online. Then, my son joined us and I called the hotel to arrange for a room that could accommodate a roll-away bed. Apparently, the rooms are so small that a special room had to be selected that could accommodate the roll-away bed. When we arrived, there was no special room reserved for us. The staff at the front desk kept asking ""what was the name of the person you spoke with?"" as if that could make the room appear. In the end, we got a room with two double beds and virtually no window and various explosive sounds from other rooms, including a constant ventilation noise. With the $62 required, daily fee added for ""free overseas phone calls, free internet, use of the fitness center, and taxes, I wouldn't stay here again. I had loved it";2
I could not believe it was 1) a Hilton 2) $300 per night. giving it 2 stars simply for walking distance to Universal studios and pool.   Our experience in bullet points:  * got charged $25 plus tax for early check in. Empty hotel, and I am a HH member. Ok, fine.   * Room strongly smelled of cigarette smoke. Old carpets, outdated room. Could not believe it was a $300 per night room, honestly. Had to call the reception and move the whole family to a different room rather than spend this time relaxing on our vacation.   * Went down to the pool and pool bar after our first day, pool bar was closed. It was 6.50 pm (their schedule says closed at 7 pm). Fortunately, the nice guy locking up the doors made our drinks for us anyway, thank you for that!  * We were looking for a convenience;2

My first time ever writing a review on Trip Advisor.  This is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at in NYC.  It is quite outdated.  I got a good deal for my 3 night stay however through Travel Zoo at $189/night.  The outdated A/C was very loud.  You can hear it turn on and off during the day and night.  You could not adjust the temperature, just max, min, or off.  The walls were paper thin.  I could hear all my neighbors down the hall close or open their doors.  You could hear people walking down the hallway and talking.  The humidity level in the hallways and the room was out of control, which makes the summer stay even more unbearable.  The bathroom was puny.  The edge of the door to the bathroom almost reached the toilet.  You could not sit there and close the door.  This is;2

The location of the hotel is great. The quality of the room is okay. The bathrooms are EXTREMELY small. The closets are VERY DARK, there is no lighting. The floodlights in the hallway and by the elevators are loose and some wires are exposed. Housekeeping does not help you when you need supplies. I had called for some extra shampoo and conditioner, they never came. Not very family friendly. There were rowdy guests who are inconsiderate of other guests.;2

On two visits I requested early checkin but was told the room was not ready, in one case until 6pm. If I had  known I couldnât get into my room before 4-6pm I would have cancelled and gone to another hotel.   Late departure seems to have priority over early checkin, so I will not return to this hotel.;2
Such a shame, we started our 14 night stay in what turned out to be the worst hotel of our stay. The room and bathroom were very tired and in desperate need of refurbishment. The air conditioning was exceptionally noisy and ineffective ! We didnât sleep well, we also asked at Reception to move room, they offered to send an engineer but it remained broken for our 3 night stay.  Location is good and subway is close by, staff are friendly enough but donât go out their way to help.  The roof terrace (once youâve climbed the ugly stairway to reach it) is nice. The pool area is a disappointment ! Tiny, covered over and poorly staffed. We spent less than an hour here with our 9yr old before it was shut because of rain ! It is a covered pool so this seemed a little excessive, the guy;2
We arrived on Christmas day and were given rooms on the fourth floor, overlooking the Lincoln Centre.  It was so noisy we had to leave the tv on to try and drown the sound of cars outside.  Our heating unit sounded like a washing machine on spin with nails in it (this was reported twice, but not mended).  Bathroom was tiny and tired.  On the plus side, the doorman and the concierge services were very good.  I would not rate this as a four star hotel.;2
Negatives - Hotel is advertised as a 4star. More like a 2/3 star. Room size not too bad though shower room very small and flooded a lot. The view - hotel air conditioning units and piping - which are VERY noisy and hotel walls. What happened to the Lincoln Centre/Central Park views. Room service & mini bar VERY overpriced. Food and drinks expensive. Pool is tiny and not like the pictures. I paid extra for breakfast by the pool (seved 8-11). Turned up at 10 one day and 9 another and hardly any food left and what was left there was pretty bad and obviously not edible. Lifts of the 4 there was always 2 broken and were very slow. Roof top bar - I was turned away as it was too busy with outsiders even though I was staying in the hotel. Decor is very dated and tatty and in need of a;2
Myself and my partner had booked our holiday to NYC through a travel agents so we didnât have much choice as far as hotels went. We arrived at the New Yorker and immediately were told we had to pay a $250 fee as âinsuranceâ which was the first red flag, I was aware that there are city taxes etc but when booking I had asked my travel agent to find out was there any other fees and they had told me there were not going to be. After reluctantly paying the $250 we then went up to our room which was probably one of the smallest hotels rooms Iâve ever been in ( I was expecting small but not this small and especially for the price) and our view was facing another wall! We were also told that our price included breakfast which turned out to only be a pastry and coffee each morning. Iâm;2
The heating unit was totally uncontrollable.  Had to unplug the unit completely to get the room down to a tolerable temperature.  Guest closet was so poorly designed that you could not hang any long garments.  There was no hot water in the shower for well over 20 minutes. And the glass panel in shower stall itself, which was European style, was not installed on the correct side of the stall.  So, water during the shower went all over the small bathroom floor.;2
We stayed 4 nights at Empire Hotel at end July. Initial expectations were good when we arrived in the lobby, it's nicely decorated and has has a lux feel. However, the rooms don't live up to this. Ours was on the 1st floor so barely slept through the noise outside. There's no double glazing. The decor was tatty and felt old. There is nowhere to put bags so with 4 people and luggage it was chaos. We chose this hotel because of the pool, however if rain is forecast it closes.....we didn't get to use it once! Access to the pool is a grotty stair, then an underwhelming rooftop area. Pool looked dirty but since we didn't go in I can't confirm. We paid $250 a night for this. Not worth it, pay more elsewhere or same for better room.;2
"For the money, which we only paid about $96 a night, it was an OK option. If I had paid anymore I would have been sorely disappointed. The room was very small, but we were only sleeping there. We had a park view which was nice. The bathroom was reasonable and clean. We did not have a closet, but had to live out of suitcases on the floor. The ""renovation"" must have still been in progress, as our room had paint chips and drips all over the carpet. No Cable TV, NO Wireless Internet and NO Continetal Breakfast as advertised on a website... BUT it is only 3 blocks from the subway! Wouldn't go back, but it could have been worse!";2
1) Make sure to get room types and pricing in writing. 2) If you are having an event at the hotel, get every single detail in writing including type of alcohol, food, and drinks. 3) If you are having an event, make sure the discounted rooms are not more expensive then Expedia or other websites.  4) Managers and staff are not willing to work with you and admit to mistakes. Horrible customer service.;2

And while it certainly is not the worst hotel experience, for the price of the room, I was definitely expecting more. For a hotel that certainly must bring in a lot of money, I was hoping for better. It feels it hasn't been updating in decades. There is a musty smell; the icebox in the room had made the carpet wet from leaking; the shower tile looked dirty because it needs updating; the bed was terribly uncomfortable; on the rooftop deck (which has beautiful views), there were loose tiles.

The first time when we arrived at the hotel, my wife asked for water they told us it is $2 per bottle. we requested only two, they refuse to return the other bottles. the man called himself a night manager was so rude to us and unprofessional. we felt unsafe living there.

The only good thing about this hotel was the people who work in the room service are so polite and kind.;2

The main problem was the room was not what we had expected (as we have stayed there before) and there was no mention that we could get a handicap room. The second major problem are the elevators. They are WAY too small and the additional or secondary elevators have been out of service for 2 years. This should be a priority for repairs. Lastly, internet service, while free, is the worst I have ever encountered in a hotel. I used my own hot spot internet from my smart phone to get service. The issues were with the hotel, not the staff. They were all very professional, trying to deal with some things that may not be totally in their control. Housekeeping was very accommodative and friendly.;2
We stayed in an unremodeled room.  It said it was non-smoking but the hallway stank of smoke.  The bathroom was barely clean, the hot water was impossible to regulate.  No cable.  Requested to be on the same floor as my mother and sister - called and requested several times, all parties requested at check-in and yet we were still on 3 floors.  As a family of 5, we told them we would come in very late and please hold two rooms next to each other.  They didn't.  We were on either side of the elevator shaft.  Fortunately, when you go to NYC, you don't spend a lot of time in your hotel room.  Apparently, we could have gotten some sort of breakfast deal at a local cafÃ©, but we were not ever told about it.  I heard them tell another guest when we were checking out.;2
We paid way too much for this shoddy Hilton. There was a ton of construction happening when we were there, the staff was rude and treated us like second class citizens for booking via Hotels.com instead of their website (we paid the same amount for the room!), and the rooms were just fine, nothing special.  Certainly not worth the pricetag!  The only good thing about it was the proximity to Universal Studios. But sadly, it was probably the worst Hilton I've ever stayed in!;2

This hostel has pro's and cons. The pro's are booking in and early check in is very straight forward. It was also the perfect location for where I needed to be in west London and 25min tube into the centre. The price is also very reasonable.  The cons are it is not clean. When they do 'clean' it is between 7-8 in the morning when most people are trying to use the facilities. It looked like under my bed and the fridge in my room hadn't been touched for weeks. The water runs lookwarm in all the taps and shower area's - not ideal for brushing your teeth or wanting a hot shower. The female showers were then out of use for the last two nights of my stay with no clear signage to another one. And lastly there is no hooks in the shower area in or outside the cubicles for you to hang;2

We chose this hostel due to the good ratings it had on this website, but we really don't understand why it has these good reviews. The employees are unfriendly, they constantly look like they don't want to be there. They never say a word to you and always have a mean look on their face. When I asked them about the wifi they didn't say a word, they just pointed at the sign in the lobby, whilst making a deep dark grumble noise. The wifi isn't free btw, which I think it should in a hostel filled with young people. All hostels I have been before (about 7 in this year) did have free wifi.  Besides this, there are plenty of kitchens, which is very nice, however you need to bring your own pots and pans and spatulas etc if you actually want to cook anything. This is very weird to me and;2

Too many conventioners, too crowded, elevators too slow, hallways too dark, our suite on the 8th floor was too noisy and the bath was inconvenient to the bedroom.

The bedroom TV had to be repaired as we were preparing  to go to bed.  The living room TV did work, however.  In general we were not at all satisfied with our stay.  We will not return.;2

We have just arrived back form staying at the Astor on the Park, the hotel itself from the outside lopoks great, the staff are friendly and helpful.

We moved rooms again the following morning to an adequate room on the 10th floor, the view was great, the room was clean, the bathroom was nice.

"We stayed at this hotel while visiting NYC for a weekend family event. The hotel is in a good location near Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle.   The lobby is dark but comfortable. Our toilet did not flush, even after it was ""fixed"". The shower was awkward to turn on. The room curtains were stained. And, we were informed by someone at the front desk that if we wanted two regular coffee pods (rather than the standard supply of one regular and one decaf) we would need to pay an extra charge. Really?!?! Upon checking out we were given $50 reduction to our room charge due to a non functioning toilet. Will not be returning anytime soon.";2
I was traveling on business, but had my family with me.  I normally stay at another hotel in the Columbus Circle area, but it wasn't available so I was actually looking forward to trying a different hotel.  Location seemed great opposite Lincoln Center, but  it was so noisy with all the traffic of both Columbus, Broadway and 63rd Street- they really need some better windows.  At first i thought it was a nice looking room, but then started to notice all the issues.  The smoke detector was gone from the ceiling with just the wires dangling.  The shower drain was clogged so I was afraid it would overflow if my shower lasted any longer (it took a full 25 minutes for it to drain after I got out).  The controls on the shower are missing pieces, and the temperature was hard to control.;2

The reason for the poor review only has to be due to what I can only describe as a dangerous event. On our first evening at 0130hrs we were spoken to a strong smell of cannabis so much we were sick. The corridor outside our room was dense smoke like there was a fire! I went to reception who did not seem phased and move us to another floor! No attempt was made to locate the offender all be it there was no doubt it was coming from the room next to ours! The rest of the stay 6 days was uneventful until we checked out! We made sure there was not any transaction on our credit card which you are required to leave at booking in, we were told there was not however when return to the Uk we discovered Â£1078 had been taken from both parties credit cards!

We booked this hotel due to the close proximity to Universal Studios. The lobby is nice. However, the rooms are completely out dated. I booked a month in advance and rooms generally cost about 200-229 a night. However, I fell for the operator offering a larger room on the Executive floor with your own private floor, refreshments included, robes, breakfast etc etc for 50 bucks more a night. Being Hilton Honors we usually get it anyway but I wanted more square footage. When we arrived the room was not ready. We got our room 30 min late. Uh extra square footage well that's definitely not true. We don't even have a couch! The view is nice but we have a tiny desk and a single chair. I truly dislike rooms without  two night stands. The beds are not two queens but two fulls. We felt;2

Booked through Expedia  and was given a crappy room. Check in reported that t we did not have a request for a view but not an option through Expedia. Checked in on time and on the 33 floor. Room was probably 12 x 12, and was in ok condition. Bathroom very outdated. No view of anything and looking at a brick wall. Asked to move and put in same room several floors down, Newly renovated but same shoebox. Staff very nice and suggested that we speak to them in the morning and they would try to accommodate us with a better view and larger room. Good location. Bed very uncomfortable with a dent in the middle. No king size beds at this hotel. I would NOT return to this hotel.;2
My dad, sister, and I are all moving to New York and are staying here for 5 days until we get our place to live. This hotel is nice and modern and beautifully decorated. But their service is the worst I have ever witnessed in my life and I travel a lot so I've been to a lot of hotels. This hotel has terrible service and charges expensive and unnecessary fees for little tiny things such as cleaning and having a trained animal. Terrible service, not worth the decor. Not to mention that paying for a bigger room such as a Junior Suite, is not worth it seeing as its not much bigger or worth the money.;2

"Visited Universal studios and Warner Brothers studios with my teenager.  Stayed three nights here after four nights at the Disneyland Hotel.  Disappointing step way, way down. This hotel desperately needs a makeover and new everything - carpeting, paint, furniture, bed covers... Had the best possible room on a top floor (not a suite) and the windows were filthy - on the inside!  Could not see out when we checked in for the filth on the inside of the windows.  The bedspreads looked -well ""long on the tooth"" is the polite way to describe them.  The staff was energetic but everyone and I mean everyone looking for a tip and I was glad I did not hire the ""driver"" they recommended for a tour in town since the big bus tours were just as good and 1/4 the price - clearly you need to";2
"As a Silver HHonors member, booking a Hilton hotel was the 'no brainier' booking for our eight hotel south to north California 'Griswold' family vacation...or so I thought.   What was best about this hotel? Proximity to Universal Studios. Yes, this hotel is so mediocre that the only reason I give it two stars is the location to something else.   Why mediocre?   Rooms are dated - we paid for Exec floor; NOT worth it at all - restaurants are close to school dining experience - and when something goes wrong, be prepared to justify to staff why you're complaining. Thought the customer was always right?  Kevin made a big effort to sort things out when our room wasn't cleaned after a day at Universal; strange thing is we thought a clean room was...expected?

I have stayed at a few hotels in this area, for the same rates.  This was dingy and needed attention.  Furniture had a lot of nicks, wallpaper seams opening up, shower had cracks in tile and did not drain well.  Water was above ankles showering.  AC loud, and do not look out the window- it was very dirty.  Mattress was old, like a spare in a home -Not comfortable.  Location is fine, near places to eat and the subway- I liked that.;2
The room was quieter than I expected. The room, bed and even the pillows were small. Bathroom wasnât functional and very small- no counter space, pedestal sink =water goes everywhere when washing your face, no towel rack and no vent/window that opens. The room is worn and outdated. Hotel desperately needs to renovated. Lobby and elevators crowded all the time. It smells old and musty. Do not stay here.

"I had one night at the New Yorker when I unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in New York City. At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).  The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"".   Once I got to my room, I found that it was incredibly small and cramped. There was barely room for the bed. The room had no view either, except of the building opposite";2

We chose this hotel because of the price and location (location is about the only good thing about it) but regretted our decision the moment we walked up to the reception counter. The man that checked us in was rude and seemed bothered that we interrupted whatever the hell he might have been doing. Once we got up to our room we couldnât believe how tiny it was (room is advertised for 4 people). I think my laundry room back at home is the same size. The view from the window also left much to be desired for.  The place quickly went from bad to worse. The beds considered double beds were barely big enough for myself and my 13 year old. I had to sleep like I was laying in a coffin. The room had an old beat up mini fridge that was not even plugged in and was locked! We didnât bother;2

So on arrival the hotel looks quite grand. Don't be fooled. The hotel rooms are on floors 19-40. Floors 1-18 is student accommodation. The hotel is very run down and tired. Very old fashioned and constantly smells of weed.  The rooms are not very nice, very old and feel dirty. The bathrooms are quite disgusting and you can't open any windows. There is no tea or coffee facilities,no drinking water and no fridge.  The hotel has an Italian restaurant which is lovely and an American diner which is fairly average.  The location of this hotel was the main issue for us. 34th Street has got a massive drug and homeless problem. Everywhere you turn, every street corner or shop doorway there is someone rolling a joint, injecting drugs into themselves or being sick. I have never experienced;2
"There are about a dozen cement steps up into the ornate, lovely front entrance to The Jane.  There was a doorman / bellman standing on the sidewalk talking to a young man on a bike as I approached with my suitcase.  He watched as I lugged the suitcase up the stairs, struggled with the heavy wooden door and tripped into the hotel.  There's a reason for the training that ""service personnel"" are offered at ""traditional"" hotels!  This hotel is definitely for the edgy, adventurous, bored-with-the-usual and possibly younger traveler.  It is ""funky"" which translates to dark, battered and small.  I stayed in a rather expensive ""captain's room"" - which had its own bath (as opposed to shared bath facilities in smaller rooms).  The room lacked air conditioning - ugh! - so the opened";2
When I visited the New Yorker by Wyndham I was expecting a very nice hotel, I was sorely disappointed. The room was small and cramped with the decor that haven't been updated for decades. The room service was delivery from the Resturant downstairs and the food was garbage. The parking was $60/ day valet & $40/day self parking... I understand that NYC is expensive but do you really have to rip people all the way off in broad daylight??  The employees were very helpful except for the doorman on the day before of my arrival, he was MIA and had to hunt him down to get my car parked. Next time I'll look a little harder for a better place to stay.;2
The surrounding area is very daunting and intimidating. The hotel was very outdated. They do not have the normal facilities experienced in a 4* hotel, such as tea and coffee making facilities in your room and they have hidden charges to be aware of? Ask before you book?;2
Finding a reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan is an impossible task at the best of times.  I stayed one night at this hotel recently.  I was appalled at the condition of the reception area.  The floors and carpets (where there were any) were dirty and worn.  The floor of the elevator was also depressingly dirty.  The corridors are a maze.  The room was spartan but (thankfully) clean and the bath was adequate but with an ugly brown stain near the bath tub drain.  The air conditioner was so noisy that I had to turn it off and endured a night in a too warm room.  I find it hard to believe that the owners and management cannot find it in their budget to correct these flaws.  On a positive note the location, near transportation and multiple restaurant options, is fine.  The desk;2
I have stayed at the empire 4 times total in my nyc travels. It is a dark, somewhat dingy hotel. Always a wait at the front desk, and rooms assigned to those who so not pay full price are tiny, scarcely bigger than the bed. This stay, my shower was broken and therefore hard to adjust the spray. Heater made a terrible clunking sound, so we had to turn it off to get some sleep. Only one elevator was working. I've found these issues to be more and more typical there over the years. Too bad, because the location is great, with Lincoln Center and great restaurants (Fiorellos, Rosa Mexicana) nearby. But because of the above, I'd have to give it 1 star.;2
"I booked a 3-night stay at Hilton LA/Universal City's location since it was fairly close to the area I wanted to be in.  When I read their website and made the booking, there was no mention of the ""vast"" road construction project that's going on here!  It was difficult enough to wind around all the street equipment, temporary cement barricades, etc, but the last straw was that on my first night there, returning at 8:30pm the street had closed for more ""night-time"" construction!  The hotel failed to mention this to me upon checkin, gave no notice anywhere in the lobby about it, etc.  I had to take a different route in the dark, and I had no idea where to go, my GPS didn't even know how to direct me.  I was upset and talked to the Front Desk Supervisor, but instead of apologizing,";2
After reading some of the reviews, we were a bit anxious about staying at this hotel but had no choice as we were unable to find any other accomodations.  Expecting the worse, we were pleasantly surprised at this hotel.  It is close to great restaurants, coffee shops, fast food joints, museums and one block from the subway. The lobby was clean, the staff polite and business-like and, if you are friendly, they return the friendliness.  Our room was modest and clean, with fresh linen, towels, tiny bars of soap (environmentally sound?), functioning mini-fridge and a good lock on the door.  It ain't the Westin, but then you are paying less than $110. so you have to get real. At no time did we feel unsafe or anxious, the neighbourhood was safe for walking at night (locals walk their;2

This hotel may have been great at one point in time but now it's severely in need of renovations. The photos advertised for this hotel are not accurate based on our room's presentation.   Pros: What saved this hotel from a one star rating was how nice the staff were. We were checked in quickly and they held our bags until 10pm.   Cons: To be frank, our room was horrible. When we arrived the bed sheets were wrinkled and untidy. The bathroom was very old and our towels had hair in them. The TV was also old....I'm talking the huge block shaped TVs before flat screens were invented. Only 5-10 channels tops. Even though the heat was on, the room remained cold and there was barely a comforter on the bed. The window as so dirty it had a white hazy frosted look, so no city view. In;2

Good points:  The hotel was very clean.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.    Not so good points:  The rooms were quite small (literally a mere inches between the two beds, between the beds and wall, between the beds and desk - you could sit on the foot of the bed and use the desk).  There were NO beverage glasses in the room.  When we called for glasses, it took close to an hour to get them.  There were NO face clothes in the bathroom.  When we asked, we were told face clothes were by request??????  The heater was an old fashioned radiator style, which is fine, BUT when it activated, it was SO loud that we were woken up (every 20-30 minutes).  The mattresses were terribly uncomfortable.  The beds were made with a fitted sheet and a comforter ... NO top sheet.  Felt;2

The temperature through out the entire hotel was very warm, and elicited poor odors from the carpets and bedding. The staff behind the check in desk was slow and did not do the best job at accommodating the number of guests who needed assistance. The hotel was a bit dingy, and very dark, in need of a remodel and some open windows. I wouldn't stay there again unless I absolutely had to.;2

Extremely dissatisfied with our room!  The shower was broken and we could not shower in the evening after a long day.  We had to call the front desk and they thankfully sent someone to fix it right away. But it was late and should not have been an issue at such a hotel. The style of the shower door allowed shower water into the entire bathroom and the floor was puddled.  We put towels down to be able to walk.   The heating/air unit was extremely dirty and had trash in the vent section (dirty Q-tip, wrappers, etc.). Also, all night long there was loud clanging in the wall and was very disturbing.  For such a nice hotel, there was no complimentary water in our room.  The price of a bottle was expensive at $5. This was our first time staying at the Empire Hotel. We were very;2
"Great location, right across Lincoln Center.  Unfortunately, my room was very tired, meaning in desperate need of renovation and updating.  Not enough lighting (the desk light didn't work at all) no convenient outlets for electronics (you have to climb under the desk or night table to find an outlet to connect your phone) adds to the overall tired impression.  The bathroom shows the sign of lots of flooding from the shower, the sink drain is extremely slow and there is no room for storing toiletries.  The kleenex box is so high that I could barely reach it.  The bed was clean and firm and I liked the overhead shower.  The hotel lobby displays the same ""tiredness"" as the room.";2

"The Empire Hotel has a fabulous location, steps away from Lincoln Center. But aside from location, it was a disappointment for $420+ a night (with NYC taxes and other fees). Tiny rooms with 2 uncomfortable double beds, dark and outdated decor and minuscule bathroom, $8 bottles of Evian and $3 cups of coffee IN the room made me glad that we were staying for 1 night only. The 'pool' on the rooftop is postage-stamped size; it's maybe 15 feet long and 4 feet wide, so more of a plunge pool than a pool. Had that feeling that NYC takes advantage of its tourists. Wish we had found something else and will be glad to move on. Best to do your research on Trip Advisor before booking anything in Manhattan as there are much nicer hotels in this price range.";2
We stayed here recently for a friend's wedding (also at the hotel) and were very disappointed with the hotel and service. The location is good but that's more or less it. The rooms are tiny, you have to pay extra for a window which has an external view and everything is very tired with paint peeling off the doors. We arrived after a long trip and the hotel had no hot water - not ideal!   There is a club at the top of the hotel, which means it is very busy and noisy if you are on the higher floors.   The staff are unhelpful and the bar staff especially on the rooftop are particularly rude. We expected so much more from this hotel given the price, location and city it is in. We would never stay here again and would recommend people against it!   Considering my friend had her;2
"The Days Hotel Broadway is an acceptable, no-frills, place with a great location across the street from Symphony Space.  I had no problems with my room, which was shabby but clean with a comfortable bed (but no alarm clock).   The problems were with service.  My business schedule while in New York required me to be out quite late into the evening, so I had hoped to sleep late in the mornings.  Despite the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door, I heard the housekeeping staff shouting to each other across the floor around 9am each morning.  This was not simple work conversation, but out-and-out shouting.   The elevator situation is dire.  There seem to be four elevators, although I cannot be sure how many work.  They are incredibly slow and very small (two or three people with luggage";2

Stayed for two nights at this hotel due to its close distance to Universal. During check in you got the impression that the reception staff would have felt much better without the guests, no smile, no friendliness and no service. Room had to be changed due to malfunction with air conditioning. Switch went fairly smoothly with a very service minded luggage guy which provided new keys and moved the luggage. Only thing was that the hotel probably knew about the malfunction when the room was assigned. Positive side is that the hotel has a free shuttle to Universal and a nice pool area. Would not stay again.;2
"When you book a 'privileged fare' at $378 dollars for 1 night you expect to find a beautiful service, and an outstanding set of features in a hotel.  Well Roof Top was closed (both of them), Our room (I requested a double queen bed) was at the Pool level (which was the best one) and it was old, with wall paper ruined, the bathroom was not a bathroom but a cubicle; Then a bottle of water $8, and, this is totally unbelievable, the in-room coffee machine available was to be charged $3 for each coffee made (it was a very normal automatic little machine, like the ones you find in motels).

We had a party of 7 stay here in Dec 2019.  We occupied 4 rooms that had been prepaid in November.  1 of the bookings was lost and then found again.  This resulted in problems with payments and charges being applied to credit cards for the different rooms.  It took a month to sort it out.  We stayed just 2 nights and had the buffet breakfast for 1 morning.  This had to be the most expensive breakfast I think we had all trip.  Beware when going to the restaurant it's not cheap.  Also those from other countries may be confused by the bed configuration.  What the US call a queen bed in Australia is a double.  So we had 2 very small beds.

We had 6 people in our party so booked a suite at The New Yorker. The suite looked nothing like the photos on the website. I know that NY hotel rooms are much smaller than other cities but I did expect the suite to be a little larger. The small pull out sofa in the living room was stained, there was no coffee maker in room (later found out they charge for it, which is a first for me) bathroom was very dated, small and no counter to place items on. The AC did not work well at all so we were very warm, and there was no hot water the day we checked in. We had 6 people take cold showers. I called housekeeping at one point for extra towels and they never showed up. Overall, so not a good experience. I've stayed at the Lotte New York Plaza and the W Hotel in Times Square. Huge;2
I booked directly with Woogo and thought I had myself a bargain. Rooms are nicely decorated etc, and pretty modern. However TV wasnt working, sheets were dirty and the toilet plumbing kept gurgling every night making a right racket. I told them and nothing was ever sorted.  They said id get a refund...and 1 1/2 year later ive yet to receive it. I have called numerous amounts of times, still being told il get a refund, yet nothing. They are compulsive liars.   Hotel is good if nothing goes wrong, but if you expect a refund, then trust me you wont get one.  Try and avoid paying all in one go, and best to pay as you leave cos then you can refuse at least!;2
Location next to Lincoln Center was ideal for us, but the room we had was pathetic.  Constant rattling noise made sleep almost impossible.  Complained to front desk, but nothing was done.  Highly unlikely that I will ever stay here again.;2
Stayed here for 4 nights last week...reception area was nice enough as were the staff...took 150 dollars off my card as a deposit when we arrived fair enough...arrived home on tuesday...still no refund to my card yet theyve managed to take Â£8.90 for a bottle of water haha! Oh and the maids are shocking they leave rubbish in your room there no bin and luckily my partner spotted 2 half drank mini champagne bottles in the mini bar which was a good job or we would of been stung for them aswell! Wouldnt return to ny in a heartbeat...but wouldnt return to this hotel thats for sure!;2
"If I could do it again, I would pay a little more and try the Sheraton.   Or maybe a different hotel (there seems to be shuttle services at the other hotels).  First off, the King sized bedroom we had originally reserved ended up being a double Queen.   ok, fine... I can live with that.   Front Desk told me that all the other rooms are taken... ok.. I can live with that too.  Secondly, the A/C didn't work as intended.   The coldest it got coming out of the room was 65.8*F.   For the latter end of May and after a full day of activities... that did not provide me with the comfort and relaxation I had hoped.   The ""engineer"" that they sent up could not fix it.   Their solution: to move us to a SMOKING double queen room.   That was it.   I don't think I'm being unreasonable here.";2

We had two rooms on the premier floor, the 8th.  One room was WAY more premier than the other, both were severely lacking in just basic cosmetic fixes that would have easily bumped up my rating to average.  Stains on the carpet, peeling wallpaper, unusable hair dryer etc.  I've stayed in worse, I've stayed in better.  At the end of the day, I'd like alot more for my $300 whether or not I'm in NY, Erie, or anyplace USA.  $300 is alot of money and I expect more.  And don't be fooled:  indoor parking means a parking garage around the corner at $35 per 24 hour period.  Luckily we found street parking and it wasn't something I needed to deal with.;2

"I made my decision to stay at Astor on the Park because of all of the positive reviews here on TripAdvisor. I am a college student on a budget, so I wasn't looking for luxury, just practicality and cleanliness. Months before my check-in date, I asked for the hotel to put a note on my room, requesting a park view. Upon check-in, I was told that they were out of park view rooms. However, the gentleman who checked in after me was in the same position, and was offered a park view room. Now, maybe he paid full price for the room, and I was given the ""Priceline Treatment"" (I booked through LMT) but I found it extremely rude that the lady working at the front desk had lied straight to my face. And that's just the beginning...upon arrival to my room, I found it to be less than";2

The hotel is ideally located for the Met Opera House. The lobby is welcoming, the rooms comfortable, the bathroom small and probably needing refurbishment. The hotel seems to have outsourced its provision of WiFi and dining facilities. I was mistakenly charged on my credit card for the free WiFi and have still not received a refund despite multiple emails with the reception manager. I felt there was no ownership of the outsourced facilities and it was not acceptable to have to relinquish ones credit card in the rooftop bar area. This has rather overshadowed an otherwise enjoyable trip to the opera and New York. Itâs speaks volumes about how the hotel views its customers.;2

It started the wrong way even before I arrived! I was trying to call the hotel in order to notify my wife on a cancelled flight, but the only telephone available would go through to a call center, where the option to speak with the front desk was not working.

Then, they charge the WIFi in the room!!! In 2017!!! SO, if you have to do some work just forget about it!

Let's just say this is a hotel for party animals. My boyfriend who had just travelled 18 hours from Kuwait and I stayed here dec 26th on the 24th floor which was a disaster. First of all, the room was tiny and dingy. Every corner you peeked in on the outside had a hidden room. We were kept awake all night by party animals especially a couple who was fighting next door. It was so bad where I had to call the front desk multiple times since I thought someone was dying. This noise went on for a few hours until the police finally came to escort the couple from the hotel. No sleep and even with such inconvenience, the only thing we were given was an extended check out at 4pm and 2 breakfast coupons valued at 9.99 each. We were promised by Michael Simms who's the member service manager;2
During our stay, one day we didn't have housekeeping service. Other days they forgot to replenish some articles, like shampoo, cotton swabs, towels, etc.  The air conditioner also had a very bad position in the room. If you were sleeping at the left side you died by the cold but if you sleeping in the right side you felt a high temperature.  We stayed for 7 days in July, it was really hot outside because it's summer. The pool deck was closed during our entire stay. We didn't notified about this, I would have hoped an offer for discounts or something. We definitily considered this hotel when we booked because they have pool deck availiable and we didn't have the opportunity to even know de place.;2
Rooms are too small and no counter space in bathroom for personal products. Products were either placed on the ground, or on the toilet seat. I will not stay here again, nor will I recommend this to any one.;2
Check-in is 3 pm but our room was not available until almost 3:30.  I've never not been able to check-in on time and what was even more frustrating was they didn't seem to care that I had to sit in the lobby with my kids just waiting.  We were downgraded and promised a room on a higher floor with a view since we were waiting but instead we were given a room on the 4th floor which had a view of the side of Lincoln Center which was fine except for the noise.  The windows were so old and drafty and we couldn't sleep at night from the road noise.  The wallpaper in our room was peeling off the walls.  The bathroom didn't have any counter space to put anything down on.  I go to NYC four times a year so I'm used to small bathrooms but this was just hard to manage.  The coffee and tea;2

We stayed at the Empire hotel on the last night of a three week trip. I had only booked it as it features in a TV show my daughter watches and she was desperate to stay there.  We arrived and the reception is impressive. We checked in no problem and were impressed with the size of our room. Two double beds, two large windows and a seating area. On opening the curtains we discovered the view was basically straight into other people's rooms.  It was 10pm but we had travelled from LA so we hadn't eaten since lunchtime. The hotel guide stated food is available in the lobby bar until 2am and the restaurant until 11.30pm. When we went to get food we were told food wasn't available at all that night as the restaurant had closed due to lack of customers. We were advised by reception to;2

Issues at check-in, leaking bathroom sink faucet, malfunctioning light switches, corridor doors slamming all night long, and a grumpy bar staff member. The only good thing about the property is the Club Lounge breakfast. And the only great thing about the property is the continuous 24 hour shuttle service.;2
Nice enough hotel, good location.  Tiny rooms but not unexpected given its NYC.  The most disappointing aspect was the variable service.  On arrival after a 10 hour journey the receptionist was the least welcoming I've ever met, a little rude in fact.  We also had breakfast served by someone who seemed to look down his nose at us.  But then we also had great service in the bar, a different waiter on a different day at breakfast and the concierge was awesome (I think his name was Dennis - Empire if you are reading this - he's your best asset).  Pool is tiny too.;2

Hi, I went to the Jane in December. The rooms are small, if you get a bunkbed cabin! You can't get dressed together cause there is no room! The beds are really hard, you can feel the wiress through the matrass. The residents that live there smell really bad and are not friendly.  The staff at Cafe Gitane are rude, they keep asking if your done eating when clearly you are not!. And when you give them a tip, they come back for more money..  In short, if you have MORE money, don't go to the Jane!  Regards, Caroline;2
"The property was nice and located to a lot of attractions. That's all that's good about this property. Slow elevators, no hot water (off peak hours) and front desk staff let's just say as a Hilton Honors Member not the service I come to expect from a Hilton.  Do not pay extra for the High Floor, They consider the 11th floor of a 22 story building a ""high floor"".";2
There needs to be help with that with the bell person to help bring up luggage to the room, also standardize times of departure for shuttle would be helpful rather than randomly going down to pick up the next shuttle as it comes around. The hotel was within walking distance of the of the terminals, which was great, however it seemed like they were more focused on getting me out of the the check in area with my rental car than they were with helping.;2

booked for 6 nights. the night we checked in the counter staff (guy) was extremely turn-offish. not helpful, not friendly, not welcoming. he just gives off the vibe that he dont want to be there and couldnt give two hoots about who walked in. paid in full (after deposit when booking).  booked a double room ensuite. went in, the room was tiny (that is alright, at least still managed to accomodate 2 luggages). looks clean. floor was oily though. but overall fine.   the problem is, there was absolutely no ventilation at all whatsoever. no air-con, no fan. windows couldnt be opened (we tried). but even then i really dont suggest/recommend anybody to open as it opens up to a back alley where everybody else throws their big black garbage bags at.   so the whole tiny room was extremely;2
We stayed one week in the hotel, first 2 days in one room very very small where you cannot even open your luggage because of space, AC so noisy, old TV, bouble bed but I think for 2 children not for 2 adulds.We complain and we got a bigger room with an huge bed, much more space in the room. Furniture old like all hotels in NYC. AC is noisy in all rooms being the window installed one. Window cant be opened. Good thing: very close to metro station 96st, 4 elevators, cleaning good, good reception services, coffee from the house in the room, starbucks very close, supermarket under building, wifi quite ok.  Be carefully which type of room you book.;2
I've stayed here many times and I have to say the place has taken a nose dive. I remember getting a complimentary baked good on my pillow each night. A small, but immaculate room, and great service. This stay was filled with an inadequately cleaned and stocked room.;2

I have traveled to New York many times, and I must say despite the great location, it is not worth the hassle.  First, everytime I went to the lobby, there were people registering complaints either in person, or over the phone.  Everything from TV's, plumbing, to appliances that don't work, to people checking in complaing that once they had booked online, and then the price changed once they checked in.  In the room where we stayed, the TV never worked, and no one bothered to even try and fix it except for one person who came in tried to turn it on then confirmed it didn't work.  No big deal since there was no time for TV, but just the start.  The refrigerator leaked all over the floor, and their answer was to give us some rags to put down to soak up the water.  They did come;2
"Unfortunately I was not pleased with the quality of this hotel.  The lobby was filled with a cigarette smoke like scent and while I sat and waited for my room for hours I spoke with a very drunk woman and another (not drunk) woman who was "" killing time waiting for a bus to Philadelphia."" The check in process was overwhelming, with a long line that lead to three visibly stressed front desk agents. Check in time was 4pm and as an 11am arrival, they made sure that I checked in at 401pm. It felt like a line at the meat market that never ended.  Keep in mind that this property is right next to the train station so the transient traffic is unreal. When I finally got my room key I was told that I was upgraded to a double  room with a balcony. Well, the excitement vanished when I";2
air conditioner is old, noisy and donât work properly. doorman bullys guests for tips. I donât mind tipping good service, but thatâs not the case, some of them are rude and not friendly, but even than they think they deserve tip and bully you into giving. makes the place uncomfortable.;2
"Upon arrival the desk clerk was very pleasant and told me she was giving us a room ""with a viewâ like it was a special favor. The room certainly had a view- of bright lights that could not be screened out because there were NO curtains, just two sets of grubby looking mini blinds. There also was no heat. It was frigid and windy yet the unit in the room was blowing out cold air. Neither of the two thermostats in the room made a difference. At about 10:00PM I went down to the desk as no one answered the phone. I said the heat wasnât working and they said someone would be up to fix it. I took the dog out for a walk and when we returned we remain in the lobby for a time with the rest of my party (also staying at the hotel). I went back up around midnight and the heat still wasnât";2
I was pretty let down. I've been by the Empire numerous times and seen it on TV/movies so I decided to splurge a bit and stay.   First impression- front desk staff was tired and over their work day. I get it, it was the end of the night and it was busy. I had to come back down from the 11th floor twice cause my key card wouldn't work. Nothing said expect keep it away from your phone. As i was carrying my purse, carry on and suitcase its safe to say my phone wasn't near the key card I had in my opposite hand. No offer to help me back up either time.  Room small but expected for NYC. Bed was HARD as a ROCK, probably one of the worst I've had in a long time.  Both lamp shades were broken, still functional just looked like crap. Room was fine, phone was so dirty/dusty I didnt want;2
I went in this hotel for the second time last month always on a business trip: the first time I was there my collegue and I we were quite satisfied about it (even if it has not a good quality for price rate) and we decided to come back but we had a very bad experience last time. The room was smaller compared to the previous time and quite dirty: I've even found a used napkins on the floor of our room! but the worst thing was the fact that the boiler of the hotel broke up and all the guests had to stay without hot water for two days! and at the reception they were assuring that the inconvenience would have been solved fast... well 2,5 days without hot water in winter time is not a short time! and the only thing the hotel has done was giving the guests the free entrance to a close;2

"Lucky to give it the 2 stars after the invasion of privacy we experienced. I mean what is the ""do not disturb"" sign for if they are going to come in anyway and disregard your wishes??! Not good. When they did come  in they did not replace bath mat or non skid mat as shower floor was very slippery.  Budget hotel at best. Common areas are better maintained than rooms themselves.    Shower stalls are small, old, and uninvitingâ. I almost did not want to walk in the shower barefoot as it did not appear clean. Beds are VERY hard. And VERY uncomfortable.

Visited here late January... hotel reception it lovely, staff are very friendly, which is a big shock as everyone in NY are rude! But every staff member we spoken to was so nice! 5 minute walk from central park, 15 minute walk to time square! So great location, they also have a roof top bar which was very nice but expensive, HOWEVER the rooms are VERY POOR! , so small no where to store any clothes, dated heating system blows out cold air for 5 minutes and then blows out cold, bathrooms are tiny and not very clean, although the shower is very powerful that was probably the only good thing about the room, and also the hall ways are very dated, i feel like all the money they have they have put into the lobby and roof top, looks like two completely different hotels   Wouldnt stay;2
Probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Itâs dirty and in need of modernisation. There is only 1 elevator which barely fits 4 people, this is to prepare you for the small rooms. The rooms are tiny, more like converted store rooms. The hotel boasts views over Central Park but most rooms face onto a brick wall. The heat in the rooms is unbearable but the Air con is small and very noisy, you either donât sleep due to the heat or due to the noisy Air con. The bath had mould around it, there is no drawers in the room just a small cupboard with no hangars and a small fridge with nothing in it, no space to put your case except on whatâs left of the floor space. The location is ok as itâs only 3 streets from the nearest Subway which takes 15mins to get into Central Manhattan;2

Ok, so it's in a good position for Macy's/Penn Station. And that's the positive. The hotel is tired beyond belief. Painted tiles in the bathrooms. Upkeep of the hotel leaves a lot to be desired...but I guess the staff are just polishing a turd!!! Tiny rooms, and I know the rooms in NYC are never that big. You can here the TV/music coming from the room next door. Drab corridors. No tea/coffee makers in the room. Seriously this hotel needs major investment. It's Art Deco style isn't for me and I think the last time it was painted was in the Art Deco period.;2

The Hostel is clean and near to great stores, restaurants and the bus station and underground Hammersmith, just 2 minutes walking. Bathrooms are very clean we have a lot of options in every floor. The walls are thin, so if nosy bothers you, rethink your choice. We order a double room and they gave us a twin. We were tired to make the change. The first days everything was ok, but by the 4th day we found a bed bug. I don't have to say that we couldn't sleep well anymore thinking about the bugs. We told the staff what happened and he seems to blame us, telling that the bug could be our fault. He advised us to wash all of our clothes and then go to another room, what didn't happened. We prefer to stay there and we found other bugs, 5 to be precisely. I won't stay there again.;2

"You expect fees like state taxes, tourism fees (which btw are normally not supposed to be passed on to the customer) etc on your bill. You DON'T expect a 25.00 Plus Tax fee for being a customer.  Disclose this upfront - better yet build it in to your rates.  Furthermore - some people don't use the pool, fitness centre, business centre, etc... and wi-fi should be either included in the rate or charged at a minimal rate of around 10.00 a night. Charging a ""resort"" style fee thats not disclosed in the rate is underhanded and false advertising.  Charging ME for what are basics in a hotel is ridiculous.  To clarify - an advertised rate of 88 a night - turned out to be 130...!! 130!!!?? that's crazy. (that's just their room charges - no food or chosen services added). This hotel's";2
This small hotel has a fabulous location, unfortunately the hotel itself is dark, damp and dated.  Check in was really no trouble and our room was ready even though we arrived before noon.  However, our room was so dark with no real windows we called down and asked for another room.  The manager said no, all their rooms are dark.  So we headed out of our subterranean existence just to find ourselves stuck on an elevator for a scary long ride.  Some of our fellow passengers had panicked and were screaming.  This did nothing to calm my 14 year old daughter who was there to audition for the ballet company.  After the ordeal of getting the engineer to help us escape the elevator the hotel offered no apology at all.  Just kinda shrugged and stated that the hotel was old.  Other side;2
We booked through a travel agent who said it would be cheap and cheerful, well I would say cheap not cheerful. Hallway smelled stale. Our room was musky.

However the staff were friendly and welcoming but the rooms are the let down. Will not be returning.;2
I didn't care for the attitude of the woman who checked me in.  I described to her that I would like to stay only 2 nights instead of 3 since I wanted to volunteer for disaster relief efforts in the Camp Fire animal shelter in Oroville, CA for the rescued pets from Paradise, CA.  She informed me that my deadline to change the reservation had long expired and that essentially it was just too bad.  She'd charge me $75 anyway even though it was over 48 hours in advance of that night's stay.  Especially as it relates to volunteers for a national disaster, I thought her attitude was quite pissy and not at all compassionate.  It tainted the entire stay at your hotel and I told over 20 people at the hotel that next day how disappointed I was with your hotel.  They all agreed with me.;2

The Park West Hotel is in a great location by Central Park and reasonably priced. The hotel is beautifully decorated. The staff was friendly and welcoming but to our dismay the  communication was lacking. When we awoke and went to get ready for our day, we found that the water was coming out brown. We left the shower running for 15 minutes and it stayed brown. We went downstairs to see what could be done but no one had solutions or suggestions. I had to quickly find another hotel and leave fore I had a meeting in the afternoon. It was extremely inconvenient but i made it work.

Well I'm just about to check out of the days hotel after a week and I hope to not stay here again. Some staff hav a couldn't care less attitude were others were really nice. We were given 2 rooms during our stay the first was dirty and small (rm300 do not take this rm unless ur a lone traveler) the bed ( suposingly a double) was a 3/4 bed ( size between double an single) and they expected us to accept that wen we are a big built couple who paid for a double rm! We got our double after complaining twice and insisting on a move. The second room had a standard double bed that was comfortable. I don't think th maids are given correct equiptment as evewhere has a thick layer of dust an inch between th wall and rest of th floor. Shower was dodgy, curtains dirty, wires hanging from;2
Room was small. Sink in small bathroom drained slow. Had to call security 5 times because of noise in room next door. Was charged 10.00 a day for a facility charge. Was not told of this. Ask what it was for a nobody knew. 300.00 a night was too much for this hotel.WILL not stay here again.;2

I did not choose to book this hotel - it was part of a group tour.  And unless I was going to  Universal I wold never stay here.  This was the first time I have stayed at a Hilton and now I know why!  I note they didn't send me a feedback e mail.  Maybe they didn't want my less than effusive review.  The entrance foyer is lovely.  However the check in staff lack warmth and the lady who looked after me was officious.  There always seems to be a queue for check in which doesn't start things off well.  My room while  very very specious had two small double beds (not even Queen) so would not be suitable for 4 people.  Luckily it was only one person.  The room was dark and dingy with a semi green outlook.  Internal lighting as with many hotels was poor but the bathroom lighting was;2

"My friend and I stayed at the Hilton 3/7 and 3/8 for its convenience to Universal Studios.  This is a long one!  Let me start off with the positive points: The staff (all that we encountered) were very helpful and friendly.   We arrived late (about 12 AM) due to a delayed flight, so there wasn't anyone else checking in...no complaints there, the process was fast and easy.  We had room 1767 which had a beautiful view of the mountains, valley and also overlooked Universal City Walk.  Beds were comfortable, although the pillows were a bit too ""poofy"" for me, but it's all a matter of preference.    The shuttle to Universal runs every 15 minutes like clockwork and we (luckily) never had to wait more than 5 minutes for it.  Saturday night the 7:30 shuttle was packed (it picks up";2

Check in was pleasant enough but the guy behind reception was more interested in selling us a bus tour.  The hotel has a very old musty smell. The rooms a more motel like and in need of a good clean and up date.  The breakfast was just OK. Only one egg/omlete per person, cereal, sometimes some fruit and pastries.   We were charged $66 for parking for 3 nights - a bit of a rip off when the security guards leaves the gates open when he goes for lunch!   I'm sure there are better hotels with good value for money - unfortunately for us this was not it.;2

"Don't be fooled by the cool ""goosip girl"" effect ...   It seems this hotel got stuck fifty years ago. It's old (everything from the carpets to the bedding to the bathroom appliances), my room as super small and dark.  The only things that save this hotel are 1) the location (just by the Lincoln Center, Line 1 of the subway and a block from Central Park) and 2) the rooftop which is pretty nice.   Will not go back";2
We stayed at this hotel during the heavy snowfall in February, the heating didn't work properly, and when it did, it banged all night, other guests were getting annoyed at the noise and started banging on their floors at 2am.  The hotel staff did try to fix the heating, it came on for a few hours each night but not really enough given the sub zero temp outside.  We didn't sleep much due to the noise of other guests and the noise from the heating.  The hotel was clean and tidy and our beds were made every day, the room was very basic but for the price you cannot expect more.  Staff were friendly and helpful and kept our bags at the hotel on our last day as our flight wasn't until the evening.

Decent location but don't be fooled by low room rates. You pay a $25 charge every day for the privilege of being in the hotel! So whatever your rate is add $25 a night min! Staff on the desk are rude and blunt. Not very helpful.  Rooms are small but clean. Gym is ok and Internet in the rooms but at $25 each day plus your room rate there are better places to stay for business and vacation as a regular visitor here;2

Not the best Hilton Iâve stayed in by a long stretch but I suppose when youâre next door to a major theme park you donât have to really try.  This hotel has more than 22 floors and the most depressing bar area I have ever come across, with itâs 70âs retro decor, beige ceiling tiles with no relaxing âold man setteesâ to chill out on after a hard days slog around the shops.   You could have stood at the bar of course but when youâre my age, those days are over.   The purpose of the stay was to see a gig at the Gibson Amphitheatre which was just a ten minute walk. I had paid extra for an alcove room which was spacious and had a cracking view of the motorway and LA hills. Shower over bath was adequate but you had to run the hot tap for ten minutes before the water got hot and why do;2
The Morningside Inn is one of the cheapest hotel in NY and this is exactly what you get. The room what small and worn but the bed sheets and towels were clean. The location is very convenient and quiet. The staff was rather unfriendly but competent.;2
The staff here are even more arrogant than the average for the US.   The service is awlful but a tip is not an option but an expectation.  The menu is really limited and when served the food is stone cold.   I have been here for 6 days so I think you will understand this is not a crazy rant.;2

"I have stayed here twice.  The first time was alright, a large room, relatively clean but the place was terribly noisy.  This time, however, we were in a shoebox that was far too small for two people and made intolerable by the warm weather â there was no fan and no air con obviously so we had to leave the window open all night therefore exposing ourselves to the gobshite neighbours (ear plugs proved unsatisfactory).  The bed was so soft that every time I moved I woke my partner up and the bathroom was so small that you actually had to squeeze past the sink just to sit down on the toilet; if youâre overweight you might actually seriously struggle (Iâm not joking by the way).  The place is very noisy too, doors are slammed shut with little thought to residents, the walls are rice";2
The hotel is very old and quite interesting. There are renovated rooms, but we stayed in an older room. The beds were super comfy. The view was of the Empire State Building.  The bathroom was tiny as was the closet, but at least there was an ironing board and iron. One floor length mirror was helpful for getting ready to go out.  The diner downstairs was open 24/7, but the food was mediocre.  The bar and restaurant off of the lobby wasn't ever too busy with super cheap drinks in our opinion.  There was work being done right next door to our room so it was quite noisy for several hours, but not too bothersome. If you must wait for your friends in the hotel lobby, it was always super busy without a spot to sit at all so we waiting outside as the weather was nice.;2

I stayed here for work and was surprised by the mediocrity of the property.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  Everyone went the extra mile to help (When they could).  However, there were several things that were downright poor: First and foremost was the gym.  It is small and dark and dingy with only 7 cardiovascular machines.  The TV's on several of these machines only displayed one or two channels.   Second, the showers. We had about 150 in our group and for some strange reason the hotel ran out of hot water by 7 every morning.  Last and most disappointing was the business center.  The hotel charges $1 a page to print.  No, not for high quality, high res color...that is for black and white.  You can only imagine my shock when I needed to print a draft copy;2
"The hotel is in an old and characterful building in a good location, but the decor is a bit dated and tired.  They also need new double glazing as both rooms we had were noisy, one from air con just outside and one from the street.  We also had a bad experience with room allocation on arrival.  We turned up at 8pm having flown from the UK, and very tired,  to be told that despite our having booked and paid months in advance, a room was not available for us.  The one they had allocated to us was ""not ready"" as renovation work on it had not finished.  After waiting 45 minutes we were given a room, which we have to assume was the worst room in the hotel and one they only give people when they have no other space.  Directly outside the window were several huge air con outlets from a";2
This hotel takes great pictures but is not at all what it looks like in person. Room is very small.  There is only 1 door on the shower which puts water all over the floor, not to mention you can not go into the bathroom without going to shower to close the door.  Lastly, I was here with 5 employees and they all had their own room and we each got an apology letter for not cleaning the room on different days.  See example below.   Also felt this hotel may have been a hotel for one night stands.;2

"The room was teeny. I mean, so small that we couldnât have a suitcase open and walk by it at the same time. There was no closet and only two small hooks for clothes which held 4 hangers. When I complained,  the front desk sent up an enormous clothing rack which was too large to fit in the room! The bathroom was passable, but just barely. The Toilet ran constantly unless you adjusted the handle; there was no plug in the drain in the sink, so you were screwed if you dropped something in the sink. The safe was located on the floor which was really awkward to access. All in all, the hotel needs a makeover. The lobby was lovely, and the staff was polite. So thatâs saying something in New York. Additionally, the location canât be beat. Luckily we only stayed for 3 nights. Any longer";2
This hotel has bedbugs, I was bitten fairly severely. Check out the NYC bed bug register for more details and many more reports. It's a shame as it's a nice place with friendly staff and a nice cafe.;2
The hotel looks so nice on the website, and has the price to match...first setback occurred even before we got our suite - it wasnt ready. Thats essentially fair enough and we were told to come back after 30 mins. We came back after 45 mins and the suite still wasnt ready. The receptionist now plainly told us we shouldn't have trusted the first message. Apparently lying to the hotel guests is to be expected from the staff...  The pool is tiny. So small, you basically have to get out to turn is you're trying to swim.  The suite was worn down and the air conditioning was making a LOT of noise. We got enough towels only the first two nights, the two last nights we were a towel short and it took close to an hour for the hotel to provide us with another one. The beds were comfy,;2
The rooms at the Empire are not clean and in need of some basic repairs.    The bathroom doors are cracked, dirty and molding in the cracks.  The frosted glass to the BR door has stained spots all over and appears dirty.  The leather rectangle cube next to the mirror where you would put your luggage had white stains all over it.  The blinds had oil marks and stains all over them as well.   I also found it quite disturbing that the cups for the coffee machine were place right above the toilet in the bathroom.  Beyond Gross! When you flush a toilet, there is a ton of bacteria that becomes airborne so I cannot believe that those cups would pass a health code inspection.   The AC unit made a horribly loud rattling sound so I actually had to sleep without it the first two nights and;2

I have just returned from spending 3 nights here. We had to move room several times as the room cleanliness was very poor. First room had mould round the bath and a terrible smell. The second room was so small and had a window that was the smallest window Iâve ever seen. After complaining, the manager was called and he upgraded our room. Our room was a lot bigger and was better but still very basic. There is no fridge in the rooms like they say, there was no bath stopper either and when I requested one I was told to take a shower. I wanted a bath and it took them 45 minutes to bring a bath stopper to the room. Check in is at 4pm and check out is 11am, not what they advertise when booking.

The front desk staff at the Hollywood Hotel were very helpful and nice, other then that the hotel wasn't great. The bed felt like sleeping on a coffee table, so uncomfortable and hard.

Robotic front desk staff .. going through the motions of the job in a disinterested minimal way;2
We have spent four nights here. Before we arrived we have read the reviews and they were all pretty positive and we can certainly see the appeal - the location, the atmosphere, as long as you do not need any space besides the place for sleeping, it is satisfactory. But here's the thing - as long as you have two luggages (which, to be honest, fair amount of tourists have) it is virtually impossible to live in the room. That is not an overstatement, with two luggages on the ground there isn't space for any movement, for any manipulation, for nothing. So when we went out we delayed ourselves just because one of us had to do the business with the luggage and the other had to be on the bunk and then switch. The corridors are fairly clean but there is a cigarette smell, the bathrooms;2
"I flew in on the red eye. Normally rooms are not ready for check in at most hotels. I was planing on leaving my luggage and making due. The front desk said you can have a room now on the 2nd floor. ""OR"" you have booked a better room with a view. You can check in later for the better room your choice. So i went for my original better room that I booked. When I returned after a long day working. 10 PM. I was given the room on the second floor. I said wait. We made arrangement for me to check in my original booked room not the down grade. The front desk said sorry. I waited for the manager after he had a long conversation on the phone with another guest. He was not helpful. I will never stay here again. I come to NY 5-6 times a year. Looks like the Ace or Standard is going to keep";2

This was formerly the Quality Inn, at west 94th street.  The location is the best thing going for this hotel, which appears to be a combination of several buildings.  The regular rooms do not have radio alarm clocks, and the oversized furniture actually cramps the rooms.  But the renovated baths are modern and the staff is helpful.  The rates are competitive for manhattan, especially if you can get one of the group discount rates such as aaa.;2
"The Hyatt Regency offers tremendously affordable rates, and it is quite close to LAX. I was impressed by the size of my room, it was spotless, and it was pristinely quiet for an airport hotel. I slept fairly well, and the bathroom/shower were well-appointed with good water pressure.  The staff, however, were openly hostile. This started with bus driver, who seemed completely ""put out"" that I would want to go to the Hyatt Regency (the shuttle also serves a parking facility.)  At check-in, the staff couldn't even look up to say hello. They weren't crowded with other guests; they just didn't seem to want to do anything. No ""hello,"" ""thank you""--just stares.  There is a strong ""security presence"" at this property. Security personnel accosted me and two members of my family on";2
This hotel is located in a great spot but that is pretty much the best I can say... For a 4 star hotel I was largely disappointed with my stay, the room was shabby, very noisy from within and out of the hotel, TV reception was bad and I ended up slipping and bruising and grazing myself quite severely in their non slip shower/bath. So much potential but didn't meet minimal expectations at all.;2

I originally took my husband (then boyfriend) here for his 30th back in 2002 and had an amazing time. Although we have returned to New York since, it has been for work/to see family so we have not had to choose where to stay again until this year. For his wedding present, I surprised my husband with a skiing trip to Canada and then a weekend in NYC for St Patricks day. For nostalgic reasons and based on our trip years ago (see the 5* review I gave), I choose the New Yorker.  We arrived after a long connecting flight from Vancouver and were checked in fairly efficiently. We had hoped to upgrade on arrival as I remembered last time, it was easier (and cheaper!) at the hotel but thought we would check the room first. The room was tiny. Even by NYC standards. To this day, I suspect;2
The location is great, next to Penn station so excellent access to transportation links. However, this was probably the only good thing about the hotel.  Check in was slow (staff on reception even ignoring the queue at times to allow others to jump the queue). Our room was clean but very tired and in desperate need of an upgrade.  The walls were very thin: we could hear the showering running, the toilet flushing and people using hairdryers at all hours.  In addition, we'd emailed the hotel two days prior to our arrival to make a request, they were unable to help us with the request (that's fine) but it took them 4 days to reply to us - not really acceptable. There are many better hotels in the surrounding area at a similar price and we won't be staying here again.;2
There was black mold on the ceiling, I killed a roach in the bathroom and the general condition of the room was not very clean. Cannot recommend this hotel even though the location is great and the lobby is beautiful.;2
"For a 4-star hotel, the amenities are subpar: The provided refrigerators don't cool down below 50Â°F (I had a thermometer on my keychain), which management should make clear to guests. In fact, I had them send up a second after the first didn't cool down enough, but all are of the same model, which are only suitable to ""chill"" drinks and candy bars typically found in a mini bar. I had counted on the fridge to store breakfast items (e.g,. yogurt, cold cuts, etc.) as well as leftovers and basically all of them were of questionable safety after one night in the fridge. No coffee maker or hot water kettle were provided. The fitness room was left unkempt: no towels and no wipes on the two days I visited. Subpar lighting and insufficient outlets, especially near the bed. Doors slam";2
The location is a bit outside of the heart of London, taking about 20 minutes to get into the center. For that you get a lower cost.  Upon arrival there were 2 people at the front desk behind a glass/plastic pane which raised a few red flags and I had to wait about 5 minutes as they finished counting cash. You must pay in cash upon check-in. A bit sketchy if you ask me.   After a 5 pound key deposit we were off to our private double room with bathroom which was actually pretty nice and clean. All furniture is IKEA quality and the design in regards to lighting, placement is just awful. The shower did not have any racks or anything to place soap or shampoo and there were no towel racks to be had (although it was nice that towels were provided). We did have our own bathroom but it;2

Multiple maintenance issues in the room, noisy air-conditioning, no fan in the bathroom. Internet access $99 for the week, not acceptable in the digital age.   This hotel survives on the quality of its staff. The management people need to lift their game. When you save a few cents on the cost of toilet paper you have taken you eye off the ball.;2
Awful towels.  Stained furniture/blankets.  Slamming doors all day/night.  The worst bathroom and design for a shower you will ever see.  They charge $3+ for K-cups IN the room.  Internet service is spotty at best.  Other than the location and the friendliness of the staff, this property is horrendous.;2

This is an okay hotel with functional rooms and close proximity to Central Park and Time Square. There are hidden fees called resort fees of 19.95 - though this is really not a resort and they hold a 100 dollars for incidentals though there is nothing in the room/no minibar. The front office gave me a room which already had someone in it (!) and I lost power when I turned on the hair dryer in the morning...not really endearing experiences to have. Hence the rating.;2
"We stayed there as a family of 4 for 3 nights and as much as the hotel is well located, the hotel is ""exhausted"" and in terrible need of refurbishment. Out of 4 lifts only 3 worked during our stay and they had an ""erratic"" behavior, making a real pain to have to go to your room. AC in the room was noisy and not really efficient. View from the room was a nice brick wall on the 7th floor. Pictures from the roof pool are misleading and far from the reality. Additionnaly, access to the pool was blocked from 9pm to accomodate private parties, using specific lifts. Rates were quite acceptable for NYC, $300ish a night for a double room, but really the building is in line with the price Won't go again";2

"My friend and I stayed at the ""Astor"" in the weekend before Christmas 2005. Despite reading some mixed reviews here on TripAdvisor, it was one of the only places left in a lower price range.  Astor is located opposite Central Park on the Upper West Side. The Neighbourhood is fairly quite, so expect to grab a taxi or subway if you want to get anywhere interesting.  The subway (103st) is about 4 blocks away (5 mins walk).  This line will get you to Times Square in about 10-15 mins and we found this to be an easy journey.  The Astor isn't a pretty hotel. The lift, stairs and corridors are small and pokey. Our room (210?) was quite small and drab, but did manage to squeeze in 2 double beds, a small TV and a wardrobe. The room had one window looking out in to the centre of the";2
Booked a room for 2 adults and 3 children, no effort made to accommodate 3rd child and given a blanket and pillow to make our own bed. If they cannot accommodate a larger family they should not have accepted the booking. Rooms and windows very poorly insulated so heard road noise and people talking in corridor as though they were in our room. Iâll put up with a lot but when you pay over $400 per night I do expect to be able to get a good bightâs sleep.;2
I arrived at the hotel at 630 pm.  My room was NOT READY.  No offer of a drink at the bar while I waited almost 45 mins for the room to be available.   Bathroom needs a complete redo.  Don't work out in the fitness center.  The smell of mold is OVERWHELMING and the treadmill shuts off repeatedly during attempt at a workout.  Turn the heat down.;2
You walk in and surprisingly the lobby is quite nice the girls were friendly at the front desk but our room was horrible. You can immediately notice the worn our carpet.. there was water damage in the doorway between the bedroom and bathroom and the tv was from the damn 90's ... we ended up not even staying the night ..;2
"The room, although touted as ""superior"" was dark and gloomy.  For some reason the hangers in the ""closet"" alcove are about 7 feet above the floor level.  My 5'5"" wife had to stand on tiptoes to reach them.  What do short people do?  We heard intermittent (very 5 or 10 minutes) scraping and scratching noises coming from behind one wall.  This continued all night.  We told a staff member about it, but they continued the next night, waking us up occasionally.  When we checked out the clerk did not seem to be very concerned about this.When I got home I noticed my bill was for a ""package"" rate.  The only thing we got was the room.  When we tried the wii fi, we were asked for credit card info, so I don't know what was supposed to be in the ""package"".";2

Ramada - what can I say. Seems like they're ALWAYS finding new ways to screw things up.  I booked this hotel through Hotwire and cringed when I saw it was a Ramada.  I just KNEW that something would go wrong.  And as usual Ramada found a new way to disappoint.  Our flight was delayed getting us to our room around 11 pm instead of 11 am as planned. We were told that the hotel was overbooked so we'd have to fend for ourselves and find another hotel room on Fri nite in LA. good luck to us after 22 hours with no sleep. Our room was PREPAID!! But that didn't matter because they resold it anyways! I guess if we couldn't/didn't show they'd be getting double paid for rooms that were not even there. Unbelievable! The next day as we checked in I explained all of the above to the manager;2
I stayed 4 nights at Empire Hotel. The interior is gorgeous and location is top-notch. I loved going up to the rooftop bar, because the view was lovely. The food up there was excellent minus the drinks, but the manager was very accommodating and tirelessly tried to find me a cocktail I would enjoy, and she did just that, so the customer service was excellent.   I was very disappointed in the noise level of my neighbors and how hard the mattress was in my room. I developed lower back pain and shoulder pain. I don't believe the caliber of a 4 star hotel should have such sub-par mattresses considering the amount of money I'm spending just to be there.;2
Stayed two nights and regretted it. There was paint peeling off and the floors were dirty. There was no hot water in the bathroom the second day which for a hotel that charged me $450 for a day is inexcusable. Will not go back.;2

I wanted to share my feedback regarding our recent stay at the Empire Hotel NYC., Check In 02/12/2014 Check out 02/13/2014. To begin I chose the Empire Hotel based on the feasible location to the event we were attending on 02/13/2014.                  We were highly disappointed with our stay unfortunately. It began with our return back to our room after having a lovely dinner, we had brought back some food and deserts to eat later. Our first concern was we were bombarded with alcoholic beverages and other items filling the entire refrigerator up. We could not fit any items in the refrigerator without removing most of the bottles out of the refrigerator. To begin weâre not alcoholic beverage people and were disgusted at the fact there were multiple options in the refrigerator,;2
There is a popular nightclub in this hotel -- directly under the hotel rooms on the 2nd floor.   Unless you plan to be at the nightclub until 4am when it closes, DO NOT stay on the 2nd floor.  It is extremely loud and you will not sleep, but it will be too late to change rooms.  You will be awake until 4AM!  Other than that, the staff is friendly and the rooms are nice.  Location is good for Meatpacking shopping and eating.;2

On the surface it looks like a nice place, but our stay was less than satisfactory.  I stubbed my toe on the Metal Bed Frame the very first night.  Housekeeping didn't replace cups and or washcloths during our 5 day stay. When asked to bring up ice, which was not available on our floor, it took way too long. The worst part was that you could  hear everything out on the street at night, especially the garbage trucks at 2 am that lasted for over an hour.  I think they need to improve their windows, as I have stayed in NYC before and never heard this much noise.  On top of all that, we payed an average of $300 per night.  I have stayed in less expensive places in NYC that were much better.;2
Stayed on a holiday weekend~ Hotel was very crowded (sold out according to staff) and understaffed for housekeeping (told this by front desk staff & house keeping staff we were able to track down in halls. Room was not ready at 7pm when we checked in. A bunch of 'excuses' followed by being originally put into a smaller room than promised. After multiple complaints~ upgraded to a Jr Suite- which would have been wonderful, except the AC unit didn't work properly, room was joy properly stocked, housekeeping never came to service and repair person (for AC) never arrived either.

We stayed here as someone in our family is a fan of a certain series, and you would think that the hotel might reflect the show, but we were well and truly disappointed. A list of things to be aware of.... 1) Front desk staff was surly (three interactions, two very negative). The saving grace was the concierge, he was fantastic!. 2) Expect slow elevators. 3) The rooms show excessive wear and tear. We had two, on the same floor, so we were able to compare, and both showed the need for new paint, poorly planned fixture placement (which contributed to condition). 4) Excessive noise. Yes, this is New York, so you come to expect the sirens, traffic, etc.. But I measured the noise from the air conditioners, and other equipment in our room to be between 45 - 50 dBA, and this was;2
The Good: Location, location, location. The Challenges: The newly remodeled rooms (which we were told were on floor 7 & 8) were (we were told)150 sq ft.,  but seemed smaller. The closet was about 8 inches deep so shirts, jackets, etc. couldn't even fit except at an angle that prevented the closet door from shutting. Imagine a bathroom where you can't shut the door unless you lean up against the small sink! The hotel is under construction so we heard jack hammers through one of the 3 nights we were there - they didn't work over night on the weekend - but bring earplugs!  We also had problems with billing. While we did have 6 rooms (family) when it came to charging appropriately at the hotel, we had to go through several different clerks, at different times. We also experienced an;2

We needed a hotel near Mount Sinai Hospital.  Our reservation was for a queen bed standard room but we received a double bed standard. The room had no heat and the hotel told me that heat wasn't scheduled to be turned on for a couple days and there weren't other rooms available that night but to check back in the morning. My husband was under cancer treatment at Mount Sinai and unable to sleep the first night and the internet did not work. The hallways and room was full of very worn out carpets, peeling wallpaper, and broken off plaster. You could get a contact high in the elevators. The next morning we were able to move to a king bed room at the same rate, still without heat but the hotel placed a portable heater in the room which made everything much better.

Chose mainly for location, next to Lincoln Center, where my daughter was graduating from NYU. The only good thing about it was location. We arrived at 11 AM knowing that check-in was not until 3 PM, but when making reservations they said they would accommodate an early check-in if they could. We  had asked as we needed to change before going to Lincoln Center at 2 PM, and preferred not to change in a restroom! They also said that they could not provide any other area for changing.  After lunch, we came back and checked again, at 1 PM. They said nothing was available, and that since they had upgraded us to a larger suite, our room might take longer to clean! I asked to be downgraded if it woulds be quicker, but they said they could not accommodate our request. Finally at about;2

We arrived at The Empire Hotel on Friday 12th January. I was extremely sceptical after reading the Trip Advisor reviews, however I had booked this trip a year in advance as a surprise trip for my daughter who is a Gossip Girl fan.  On arrival we checked in and were given room keys for a room on the 7th floor. ( We had requested a 10th floor room for the view.) on entering the room we noticed there was only one bed (We had requested two). I returned to reception and was given a new room on the first floor Room 0111.  On entering we noticed the room was closely situated next to a laundry cupboard. What a nightmare constantly on edge because during the day and night as staff accessed the laundry cupboard it sounded like they were trying to enter our room. When opening the blind to;2

For a start this is not a cheap hotel and can charge up to $800 a night and for that I really expect my room to be serviced every day not just by request and that is due to expense and not the lame excuses listed on there website  Also when classed as high end property I would had thought the room would have a shaving mirror. The Staff on the whole seem very unmotivated and the Cafe Sierra Breakfast is quite poor with not the greatest selection in the world and a buffet that has no drinks or coffee available to serve yourself and have  as much as you like ,obviously to save money and attempt to get tips from the very miserable staff.;2

I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last 2 months the 1st time the room was new totally refreshed and was very nice albeit small the 2nd time this past week I received a very old room that is not been  Refreshed in at least 25 to 30 years. The bathroom was dirty there is very little storage in the bathroom. Carpets were frayed and over all was a very uncomfortable room. The pillows looked like marshmallows but felt like rocks. If you use the hotel demand a new room;2
Ok I paid ahead of time for this hotel it is on the other end of Central Park in Brooklyn not near Manhattan at all this was my first trip there so I gave up the money and stayed at The Piedmont Hotel which was a great deal at the time it is right across the street from the Famous Hamilton play and was perfect for my 3 day trip.  Close to everything the room was small but clean and in New York location is everything.;2
Was excited to stay at the Jane Hotel. Heard really good things and was pleased with the room, but was awoken in the middle of the night only to find that I was being eaten alive by BEDBUGS!!!!!   I was so disgusted, I left my room at 4 am and Jane Hotel staff did not do ANYTHING to help the situation. I was not offered an alternate room (it would probably be infested with bedbugs as well) or compensation. I spent the rest of the evening/early morning waiting in the neighbourhood starbucks.  NEVER AGAIN. Completely traumatised.;2
Arrived early at the hotel (1230pm) after a long flight with a 2 year old, quickly checked in no dramas - paid $25 to have access to the room early (which is a joke). The rooms look a bit tired but it was comfortable and the views were nice. We were up on the 8th floor, not too far from the lifts. Room service was ok, not great but ok. The shower was awful, very weak, often lukewarm but that was particularly bad on a saturday and sunday morning as the hotel became busier.  Now the location - spot on! Can't fault it a bit, theres either a nice short walk to universal or a free shuttle which runs every ten mins.  We had breakfast our first morning at the buffet and it was a waste of money, the fruit was over soft and the strawberries were borderline mouldy. Generally very poor;2

I was told I you pay a $20 daily fee and it would be free....do the math and that makes no sense. My father called and spoke to front desk manager who agreed to send the general managers contact information and documents to support fee disclosure. Well this was never sent to him as agreed. I was walking by the desk and was told they had the wrong email address and my father called and left the message with correct email again and still no response...";2
I have to say that while the hotel is in a fabulous location close to central park, the Metropolitan and Guggenheim and the neat places in the Upper west Side and Harlem, with lots of cafes and especially a great Bagel place called Tal Bagel, and the subway connections were great, we found the hotel a little rundown and definately our room let in all the considerable noise outside.  In fact, because the air conditioner was put in the window and then tape was used to try and seal the space ( which had disappeared in one section , so the cold night air was blowing in - although the hotel staff did at least put more tape on the next day), we could hear conversations on the street below , as if the window was open. Add to that the fact that there were construction things on the;2
We stayed 4 nights in a double queen room. For the most part the room was ok, bathroom was a little small, towels were on the desk. The AC at the hotel worked horribly, last night there we had to stay in separate rooms. The swimming pool is about 5' by 15', it is small, cute, not heated. The pool closes at 9pm which sucks. I loved the location, it was a great area. Price of hotel was ok for NYC. Also we were told 20% off at restaurant Chowder, and at pool top, but we only got 10% discount. Staff wasn't the friendliest. We stayed at The London and loved it, we will most likely not return to The Empire Hotel.;2
After booking this hotel I was excited to arrive. Upon arrival we were very shocked. First of all I have traveled all over the world and I have over seven years of experience in hospitality. In all of these experiences I have never ever once had my personal ID scanned and printed for the hotel to keep. When I questioned as to why they took photocopies of IDs. I did not get a straight answer the front office agent, who replied âall hotels in LA do this. â well first of all this is untrue. I work in a five star hotel in California and have stayed in Multiple hotels in LA and not one of them have ever scanned and copied my ID. This is something you should stop immediately. What are you doing with our personal information once we check out? Why are you keeping a piece of paper of;2
I came to NYC to celebrate my 40th birthday. While here, I also got engaged. My thoughtful girlfriend had flowers shipped and delivered to the hotel at 5:00am this morning, but they arrived to our room at 7pm. When they arrived, after we finally called to ask where the flowers were, they were damaged. All of the other places we have visited in NYC have excelled in special occasions, really making this trip memorable. Sadly, this hotel does not do a good job. We had a long wait (without an early check in) when we got in a yesterday because the computers were down. The staff was luke warm and lacked empathy about the wait time. Today the elevators were broken. The hotel itself is fine. The location is fine, but it is just NOT a hotel which cares about memorable experiences.;2

Don't judge this place by the photos. It is nowhere near that good. As we are 2 adults and 2 children we needed 2 rooms. They were on separate floors. The shared bathroom toilet facilities were badly needing renovations and grotty. Carpets in the rooms need replacing. I wouldn't stay again.;2
There was only one outlet in my room that would actually charge my phone and that was behind the bedside table which I had to move to access. None of the other more easily accessible outlets were recognized by my phone.   The bathroom door was badly in need of painting.   The rainfall shower head was more like a light drizzle than summer storm. After playing with various components, water pressure remained a drizzle, and this was at various times throughout the day.   There was no chain or pulley on my Roman blinds and I was unable to lower them.   My keycard deactivated before 9am so that I had to have it reactivated when I returned from breakfast so that I could prepare to check out.   Could have used an additional pillow.

"Our daughter's starting Barnard in the fall so we really want to find our go-to hotel when we visit her. This is not the place. We came last October, 2012, while we toured Columbia. The hotel location is ideal but upon arriving, we were re-routed to a sister hotel 10 blocks south, due to ""a mystery leak"" that happened to be in the room they reserved for us. This after a 7 hr trip. Next night we were back for the duration and we had to change rooms no less than 3 times. They were either too noisy-there's a huge fan that blows all night if you're on the south side of the hotel; or too small or badly configured. You'd think a fresh remodel would have wrought bathrooms with doors that opened outward and not into the toilet on the other side. Disaster. Plus the Euro night life that";2

The rooms as nothing special - lights out, bathroom lights dim and dingy, and overall not at a Hyatt Regency standard.";2
The hotel is great location for Chinatown and soho, also the metro is just on the corner of the street so access is great to the rest of manhattan.  I expected a basic hotel but this was worse than I expected.  We stayed 5 nights, only 3 of which they cleaned the room.  The bathroom was dirty, and the fridge in the room you wouldn't dare open.  Our curtains wouldn't open so it was generally dark so I found it difficult to do my make up. No safety deposit box, we asked 3 times about this but they just passed our complaints around and nothing happened. Although this is a cheaper end hotel in the city it's is very expensive for the quality.  I have stayed in much nicer hostels. Would definitely not recommend staying here at all!!;2

So We're sweating all the nights: windows are blocked and so .... Client service doesn't  exists, only Pasquale has been friendly and thanks to him my rating is higher than minimum.

I wanted to love this hotel. Yes the rooms are tiny but the location is fantastic. However it appears from my experience that the hotel has a bed bug problem in its bunk rooms. I stayed in room 360 and woke in the middle of the night having been bitten very badly. We also saw bed bugs crawling up the walls and we caught a few to show the front desk. We had all our belongings taken away for steam treatment and were moved to room 342,  another bunk room.   Unfortunately room 342 had bugs as well and we had to go through the whole treatment regime again. We were then moved to a captains cabin room 218. No bugs thankfully and a very nice room, but I would recommend anyone staying on level 2 to bring ear plugs due to the very loud music playing at the bar downstairs to 4 or 5 in the;2

While the employees were good to deal with the overall experince was not a good one.  Upon arrival of my room it seemed as if i was placed in the smallest room that was soaking up all the noise in the area.  Not to mention the rooms around me.  The bathroom was very small, no space to spin around in there. After sitting in the room for about 20 minutes with all the noise I went to the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction.  The manager on duty was able to change the room to one that seemed to be recently upgraded, although you could see that it was just a minor face lift to the room I had before. The money paid for the room wasn't worth it at all not even half the amount would have been worth it.;2
A very old hotel.  The lift was a little slow, and barley big enough for 2 people and 2 bags.  The TV has limited channels, but what else do you want.  It is not a fancy hotel.  Low budget hotel so you get what you pay for, basic accomodations.  It was a tiny room but the view was aweson: facing CENTRAL PARK (the only good thing).  The air conditioner was not good and very loud and noisy.  Small wadrobes and a dressing table.  Old TV and old closet.  Also, furnitures were old.  Needs to update very soon.  Definitly would not stay again.;2

TV is a nice flat screen, but the cable was barely functional. The blankets and bed cover are old and outdated. Blankets were staticky which is not a good fit for the cold dry winter (I got zapped a bunch). Floor is tiled so it's pretty cold walking barefoot; other hotels where I've stayed with tiled floor usually provide disposable slippers.

The location to universal studios can't be beaten, but honestly it's the only thing this hotel had going for it. First my taxi couldn't enter the hotel driveway because of emergency vehicles coming it (no emergency, fire department assisting with elevator upgrades).

Finally got in an elevator after waiting for fifteen minutes and it just traveled up and back down a few times not letting anyone out on the floors. Finally got into a working elevator and to my room, television wasn't working. I had to call the front desk 4 times during my stay to fix the tv. There was no communication between the staff so I kept having to explain the same problem over and over. This was the final stop on a 6 week trip of the U.S. and I chose it;2

We were upgraded to a lovely big room however this meant there were not one but 3 drafty windows.  I had the heating up to 38 degrees and was still sleeping in my socks and puffa jacket.  We paid an extra $30 ish for taxes and premium WiFi.  The WiFi was atrocious and when I called tech support I was put on hold for 15 mins so simply didnât have the internet for my stay there.  The bathroom was tiny with another drafty window right next to the tiny shower.  Apparently women in the 30s didnât have as many toiletries as we do.  There wasnât even room for my toothbrush, I canât imagine that ladies didnât clean their teeth almost a century ago.  Donât expect free tea and coffee facilities - thatâs an extra $25 per day.  The receptionist was very pleasant when I complained but;2
The room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open.  We complained but it didn't get fixed  It was very hard to sleep and get ready when you are sweating in November. There was no fan in the bathroom which made it even hotter when we showered.  Just very uncomfortable.;2
"After reading all the mixed reviews of this place, me and my sister were a little wary of staying here. For the price, its great, a nice neighborhood and quick walk to the 72nd and Broadways station.  When we first checked in, we were told to go to the ""elevator"" at the end of the hallway. After walking around, we finally noticed what looked like a closet door with elevator buttons on the outside. This was the elevator. Our room looked pretty decent and was exactly as it had been described by other travelers as a dorm room. The shared bathroom was right next to our room. However, my sister noticed a pubic hair on the ""clean"" towel that was supplied in our room, the bathtub was disgusting and I showered in my flip flops. There was rust on the drain and all we got was a bar of";2
We booked this reservation at the last minute, so I was pleased to be able to get the price at $150 per night on average (not including taxes and everything else they throw in). All the other hotels in New York City were way out of our price range. Funny how a Days Inn hotel anywhere else would be $50 a night! Our flight was delayed on Friday and we spent the night in the airport. I called Expedia and they called the hotel to see if they would refund the money for that night, and they would not - said it was their policy. So Expedia gave us a $100 voucher. The hotel is in a good location - next to subway and off Broadway and a few blocks from Central Park. It is old, wallpaper peeling, stained carpet, small room, but the bathroom was upgraded and it was quiet. The 'fitness;2
My toes really did not like the room.  High threshold to the bathroom and exposed feet of the bed stubbed my toes several times.  Odd velveteen cover over upholstered headnoard was odd, just not done properly.  Shower was nice, but without a tub edge, you really need more than a 4 inch triangle shelf.  Really missed common amenities like coffee (none in room or lobby) and ice (only available  in lobby).  Was there for 3 nights and never got housekeeping.  The most annoying was no information in the room, portfolio was empty.  Nothing telling me to put trash in the hall to empty, or the need to ask for fresh towels.  To top it all off  the TV was out for 2 nights, unsuccessful attempt to fix it, had to ask for them to come again, 2nd person got it done.  Next time I will pay the;2
Everything was great except one of the most important aspects of the experience and that was the bed. Hyatt needs new beds. Just because it is at the airport comfort is important after a long day of sightseeing and sitting in traffic you want to lay down on something that will help not hurt.;2

The hotel itself has all the characteristics to make it an excellent find, however the outside bar terrace was never open whilst we were there. The inside area of hotel was lovely but wifi could not be obtained if you stay in a corner room. The location of the hotel is not the safest and even the 2 min walk to underground was not a pleasant experience. Word of warning. Do not turn right up the road as this is not a safe neighbourhood. Even during the day we did not feel safe. If staying in Hollywood again I would choose a completely different area/neighbourhood. Having a security officer patrol your room one evening was not a comforting experience and i come from a hotel background!;2
"Booked two rooms for week of June 25th.  Arrived at 5pm, one room not ready.  Similar story with friends who also had two rooms.  A very unfriendly front desk staff explained that the rooms had not been ""inspected"".  Room was finally ready at 5:30 pm with no apology, or an offer of a free drink or coffee or anything.  Clerk was not happy that she had to come to my room to give us the keys.  How can it take 5 hours to get a room ready ?? As many people have stated this is all about the location.  Other than that there are few positives here.  Roof top pool is tiny but deck is pretty cool but gets crowded  Rooms are small, some outdated but most amazing to me is the general attitude of the staff from front door to bartenders - seems they have forgotten they are in a service";2
We though we would stay near Central Park so we chose the Empire. The location is great but the rooms are tiny and the Air Conditioning was so noisy we could not sleep all night.

The hotel looked good on line but is definitely not a 4star. This hotel needs some upgrading!. On entering the hotel the lobby was beautiful but as we entered the elevator I realized how tired the building was. The room was very small with no coffee maker, no fridge and the bathroom!!!!! The bathroom!!! The smallest toilet I have ever seen and the flooring was dark green and definitely needed replacing with dirt stuck in the corners and a broken towel rack. Because there was no fan in the bathroom the paint was peeling from the ceiling. To make matters worse I was handed a bill at the end of my three night stay for 38$ per night for taxes and amenities. What AMENITIES???? This is the last time I will be visiting any Wyndham.;2

There is a hidden fee like resort fees that were not included in bookings through agoda. Many other 4star hotels like doubletree doesnt charge you for keeping the luggage for you, but this hotel does! And it was $2 per bag! I would gladly tip the person $5 for our bags instead of just paying $2 per bag. The staffs werent friendly either. The showerhead was bad thus shower experience wasnt good. And the tapwater in the tub, at first, pour brownish water for like 10-15mins. A really bad stay for a 4-star hotel. Price wasnt that cheap either.;2
Careful to do everything according to their rules.  And don't think they'll do anything to remedy the situation.  They won't.  Booked 12 rooms for a week.  When we didn't check in on time they sold the rooms out from under us.;2
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, relaxing place to stay. The room was clean, but lacked standard ammenities like a bath mat, wash clothes, reading lamps, etc. The first evening I asked for an iron and the person at the front desk (which was literally 5 feet from our room door) said someone else in the hotel (and I use that term loosly) was using it and I could have it in the morning. I did finally get the iron that next morning and enjoyed a cup of instant coffee. Ewe.;2

My best friend and I went to NY to celebrate her 30th birthday. We chose to stay at the Empire Hotel because we thought it looked really cute online. It was an added bonus that after we booked the hotel, we heard that the Kardashians stayed there, too!   We booked a standard room with 1 king sized bed because it was almost half the price as a room with 2 queen beds. We arrived before check-in so we asked if it would be possible to check in early. The woman at the front desk said we could check in early if we upgraded our room, which we weren't interested in doing at that time. She said she would call us if our room was available early.   We left to walk around and eat lunch, but after a few hours, no one ever called. We came back to the hotel to ask if our room was available -;2

It looked loke sometihng you can see in a horror movie.  We have seen it all: Ants, mice and cockroaches.  The location is great but the house is crap. The standard is awful and bathrooms/toilets are crappy. Owners would need to invest in it properly.  I am happy we managed to keep our stuff as the room keys looked like something we used 30-40 years ago.  I am going to upload a video of the place on youtube soon so search for it.;2
This hotel is the essence of janky. Don't let the slick veneer fool you. It's only slick if you squint. The bedding had holes, towels were stained, carpet was stained (recently spot treated which did not remove the stains & left the carpet & subsequently my socks soggy). Coffee maker was full of mildew. Wi-Fi is spotty & unreliable. I had to call the front desk twice in an hour to get an iron that worked. Bathroom sink was clogged, & the HVAC smelled like urine when I turned on the heat. My fave part was when housekeeping knocked on my door at 7 AM, didn't wait for a response, & barged in on me while I was undressed, just out of the shower.;2

This hotel was convenient for the NYC marathon, since it's close to Central Park.  Aside from that, I can't say that it is a good hotel at all.  The rooms are tiny, there is no place to put your suitcases, there is no coffee maker or any way to obtain coffee (especially before the marathon!) and they have so much stuff for sale on the dresser and in the frig that there is actually no place for any snacks or breakfast stuff you may have purchased for your own use-- not even one bottle of water.  We were there for 4 nights, and on the evening of the 3rd we realized that again, the shampoo hadn't been replaced.  Not once.  After we drank out of the glasses, they were also never replaced during the entire visit.  There is no shower door in the tiny bathroom, although it's clear that;2
Just got back from this hotel yesterday. This was my 3rd visit to New York and probably my last. Previously stayed near grand central and on 42nd street/Times Square.  Chose this hotel for the location and it was part of a virgin holidays deal with lounge access at Heathrow.  Arrived at JFK (what a joke immigration is!) and got the air train and LIRR straight to Penn station in half an hour.  Reception allowed us to check in early for no fee into our queen metro room ( did ask about upgrading but for $65+ tax per night didnât bother). Corridors to the room looked like something from American horror story (the hotel one) and the room was very small. It was clean enough but very tatty and rough around the edges but we were told the other side of the hotel had been upgraded and;2
Perhaps when you have a great location in a city like New York, you can be cavalier about things like design, service, cleanliness, and upkeep.  The lighting in the bathroom is dim, the tiles were separating from the walls in the shower, the carpet badly in need of cleaning or replacement.  The mid-level priced rooms are uncomfortably tiny, especially the bathroom.   An upgrade is well worth it.  The designer for this hotel had to be a European male accustomed to small living spaces.  The sink is shallow with the faucet designed so that it only has about 3 inches from where the water flows to the drain.  Washing your face is quite a challenge.    The bed, however, was clean, the linens good, and it was comfortable.  The air conditioning worked, and did a good job blocking out;2

Staff were rude and unhelpful. Cash payment only is very annoying. The renovations were ridiculously loud, the staff didn't care at all that it began at 8am every morning. It was horrible. I've never heard such loud noises in my life. We were hoping to sleep in until check in as we had a long 15 travel trip head of us (definitely not possible with the horrendous noises). Maybe low season would be a better time for renovations? Or at least during the day when people aren't around?!  The stairwell or fire escape was left open all hours, so anyone could enter the hostel/hotel at their leisure (which I'm pretty sure was happening as there were homeless looking people wandering our floor in the late evening), it felt so unsafe. I suspect people were staying long term, as the kitchen;2
Not a great hotel. Wont stay here again.  Best location is the reason we came. Chipped paint on doors, water splashed onto floor due to door less shower.. Noisy location near the elevator. We will not return.;2
We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel itself was good. Staff went above and beyond to assist us with any needs we had. Location is convenient. Our BIG complaint is the drilling happening all night from construction down the street. Itâs currently 4 am. The drilling has been going on since 10PM! What a horrible horrible night.   We would come back here but only when construction has finished. If you are planning on staying anytime soon please beware that you will not get any sleep. Thankfully our flight home is tomorrow and we wonât have to listen to this again. Alternatively I suggest you bring ear plugs.;2
The place is good for the price, and reception people are friendly and helpful. But during our stay a bag full of goodies I bought in the pharmacy - and I bought a lot, for $145 - was gone. It was sitting there on the bathroom floor, and then it was gone. To be fair the manager offered us refund but since he didn't know who took it we didn't want him to impose the fine on an innocent person. Apart from that good place and good location, and if we are in new York we will go for it again I suppose;2

The view was not the same.  It was obvious by looking up the view would have been much, much better on the 22nd floor.  Plus I choose the high floor so I would not have to deal with full elevators all the time.  I also thought when making the reservation the breakfast would have been on the executive floor (that was my fault for not checking), it was not, you needed to go down  to the restaurant for the breakfast.

There are some positives about the Days Inn Hotel, the location is great. For starters, outside I heard no noise which for New York is great. In addition, the 96th Street subway is right next to the Hotel. The Subway goes to Central Park, Times Square, and Broadway. Which are all great tourists attractions. The Hotel lobby is pretty clean and the seating is very comfortable, staff was also friendly. Downsides of the lobby was they do have an exercise, which is good for workouts, but T.V quality was horrible and very few channels. Also, there was only two exercise machines. There are bathrooms in the lobby but the doors do not open and the smells were TERRIBLE. The elevators were fine a little slow and smelly but whatever. We got onto the top floor and the smell of weed was SO;2
We picked this property because it is so close to Penn Station.  And that is a nice advantage.  But it doesn't offset the fact that this is a very outdated property with teeny tiny rooms.  Our room literally felt like a closet.  We could barely get around each other in the space around the bed.  We were only in town for one night and were so busy all day that we barely had time to be in the room except for sleeping, so it turned out to be fine.  But if we were there for even one additional day, we would not have been able to take it.  And even for one night, we'd never book here again.  We'd rather have a short cab ride and stay in a nice place going forward.;2
I requested a specific side of the hotel when I made the reservation and again on the day before we arrived. They didn't manage this. Despite the reasonable size of the room, there were almost no surfaces on which to put things. The bathroom was closet-sized, with a tiny toilet. Shower pressure and showerhead were great. The windows were dirty. There was a pint of Fiji water on the night table -- $7. The starchy robes were on sale for $95. There was $13 internet charge. The heater / ac was ancient. No thermostat in the room. TV had Fox, but not MSNBC.No ice machine, since they wanted you to use the lobby bar. You had to call rm svce for ice. The room hadn't been properly vacuumed. There was no top sheet -- just a duvet. On the plus side, the location was great, except for the;2
Not worth the price, need some renovation. Major problem is that windows are pretty old, and noise comes either from the street or from the AC located in the inner court (I personally prefer traffic). The big added value is the pool on the roof, open only in summer. And the terrace bar, since if you are in the hotel you can skip the line.   Staff was not very helpful. First night the superior room I was given was a first floor room with the window on the inner court, a few meters from a very noisy AC tower ... you cannot name this a superior room. I also found not nice to sell bottled water at four times the price of the shop 50 m from the hotel.;2

Myself and my partner had booked our holiday to NYC through a travel agents so we didnât have much choice as far as hotels went. We arrived at the New Yorker and immediately were told we had to pay a $250 fee as âinsuranceâ which was the first red flag, I was aware that there are city taxes etc but when booking I had asked my travel agent to find out was there any other fees and they had told me there were not going to be. After reluctantly paying the $250 we then went up to our room which was probably one of the smallest hotels rooms Iâve ever been in ( I was expecting small but not this small and especially for the price) and our view was facing another wall! We were also told that our price included breakfast which turned out to only be a pastry and coffee each morning. Iâm;2

We stayed at the empire about 6 months ago to go to Lincoln center.  The location is great but the hotel room needs much improvement.  While the size of the room was acceptable the condition of the bathrooms was not it was dirty there was mold on the curtain and the furniture was very dated and needs an update. We are returning again at the end of May because of the location and hoping for an improvement of the room conditions.  Elevators have a very long wait time;2
Location is great. Service is great. But the room is narrow and VERY noisy. I had to put a pillow over my head to be able to sleep. I tested 2 rooms with similar noise. On the inside court the AC is axtremely noisy. On the street, Broadway is... noisy too.;2
So, I got home yesterday (27.11.07) after staying at the Astor On The Park for 4 Nights!  My partner and I arrived on Thursday (22.11.07) to a lady at reception who was on the phone, so instead of finishing her conversation she proceeded to check us in whilst still on the phone which meant that we had to repeat ourselves a few times as she wasn't concentrating.    We got in our room which was room 311, small but clean and adequate.  The room had an amazing view of some walls and windows but that wasn't really a problem as it was just a room to sleep in.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were GREAT possibly the best pillows ever,  At night when we were sleeping it was cold, so we turned the radiator on, at about 2300 hours, but didnt kick in until about 0300 - 0400 hours;2
The room was EXTREMELY smaller than advertised, Not only that, but a balcony at the hotel had a direct view into the room. I was extremely disappointed with the hotel considering the rate. Look elsewhere if you are looking to book in NYC and if you are looking to avoid the touristy areas, defintely do not book here.;2
The hotel is convenient and comfortable. Nice lobby spacious modern rooms. Unfortunately something was wrong with housekeeping and I was not able to get a room until 8:30pm. Not so good when checkin is supposed to be at 4:00pm. Many other guests had the same issue as we waited in the lobby. The staff were sympathetic but never explained why. Too bad because the hotel itself is very nice and a decent value for the price. As a busy traveler, this inconvenience makes me unwilling to try this hotel again.;2
"For simplicity, this is a copy verbatim of the letter I sent to the General Manager after checkout. The management last night wanted to just say ""well, hotels have mice, we try. We moved you half naked at midnight, scared you.. Wasn't disruptive.""  Hello, After a long day in the city I was relaxing after a nice bath. I had not even gotten dressed yet, when I saw a mouse sitting atop my suitcase. This set a course of action in place which disrupted my night, embarrassed me, and made very uncomfortable. I requested first that someone come up as I feared it may have run into my suitcase. I also requested, as all my clothes were in my suitcase, that the person sent be female as I was in my room alone and scantily dressed. I received a call letting me know only men were available at";2

The best of this hotel is just the location if you want to go to Universal Studios, otherwise... Nothing.

In my case I would even better consider the Sheraton, just beside. This is not good for families nor for business. Wants to be good for all and is for nothing.

OK, so it's New York and we all know the affordable hotels are pretty cr*p, but this takes the biscuit! The room just held the double bed, no storage space apart from a couple of hooks, and thank God for flat screen TVs, in the olden days a tube telly wouldn't have fitted! If you sat on the loo your feet were in the shower. At least it was clean and had hot water, but not great value at $305 for the one night we stayed. Never again!;2
My mum and I stayed there for 8 nights. I booked the hotel through Hotwire. Room was small and old with cheap furniture and very dirty window. The pipes were very old and crumbling at night so sometimes they woke us up. Heating was not working properly, either was very hot or very cold and radiator heating control was also broken. The floor was uneven and you could hear everything through the walls. The biggest minus is electricity in the bathroom that was constantly breaking out from somewhere. Nevertheless, cleaning lady was great. She cleaned every day, put new sheets and clean towels and maintaining room as much clean as possible. The great advantage of the hotel is distance to Downtown and Central Park (in front of hotel) and good connection (metro, bus). Also, there is a;2
Rooms is tiny, tiny.  Bathroom is tiny, tiny.  Impossible for two people.  Everything is extra including the in-room coffee maker:  $3.00 per cup.

I spend about 20 nights per year in NY, and I will not be back to this one.;2

The location was the best thing about this hotel. The room me and my friend booked should not be advertised for 2 people (even the toiletries were only for one person when we arrived and had to leave a note to get extra as 2 people sharing). We shared this tiny overheated room with bathroom so small, you had to step over the toilet to get in and close the door behind you. Our room had no wardrobe - unless you call a rail with a curtain a wardrobe. Deposit box was faulty, so couldnât use it for my passport etc, we had a lovely man coming to check it out and were told the box is very old and we should get a different one. Whoever was in charge with that never made it happen, so I ended up carrying everything like passport, all money etc with me. Our shower was also temperamental;2

I should start by saying I wouldn't have chosen this hotel, hotels.com moved me here after my original hotel cancelled. IF you don't mind sharing a bathroom (which was clean) and don't mind a minuscule room, this place is fine. My only issue was the music blasting out. I was so tired from travelling that I could barely register what was happening. I 'think' it went on from 10:30 until 4, and that was a Tuesday.  Due to the small rooms, and bathroom arrangements I had already put in headphones and was listening to music to help me sleep. The nightclub music was vibrating through my mattress, ensuring a restless night.;2
In a family trip to NYC,  I paid twice for this hotel compared to Sheraton. Almost everything was worst compared to Sheraton!   Shower doesn't have a door! Facilities are old, looking prehistoric.

We booked a room with a queen-sized bed but the bed was only a double, despite the queen-sized headboard. Also, the toilet plugged with little toilet paper. Overall, this is a very old place in need of renovation. On the plus side, the staff is friendly and the location is great. Next month, I'm staying at a place that is similarly located, similarly priced, and offers a complimentary breakfast.;2
The rooms are very clean and well maintained, this is the only plus.   Being an international traveler with short visits, one of the major criteria for selecting this hotel is free wifi.  This hotel promised a free room wifi, and upon check-in I was given a unique wifi login n password accessible from my room that later turned out to be a sham.  The wifi wasn't working at all and upon checking I was told to use the business center wifi ($2 for 8 minutes) which was quite disappointing.  There is no cafe n hence no breakfast options, the hotel covers just lodging.;2
"We have visited this property four times in the past six months and have noticed the service level decline with each visit.  The Club Lounge is a joke.  We watched people arrive during breakfast hours to find food items had been depleted and not refreshed.  Staff seemed oblivious even when manageres walked through they didn't seem to care.  Turndown was requested but not completed.  We were sitting in the bar area when several employees returned from their ""break"" reeking of marijuana.  The best feature of the hotel is it's proximity to LAX which is practically right next door.  The modern redesign of the hotel is also very pleasing but they need to realize they are in a ""service"" industry.";2
We had a brief stopover here before a long haul flight. It is very close to the airport, the shuttle came quickly, and the room is nicely done, very clean and modern. But the experience with staff was the letdown. As I approached the check in desk the receptionist rudely told me 'the rooms are not ready yet' before I'd even said my name. It was 12pm and check in is 3pm so this was fair enough. I asked if that applied to suites, which we had booked, and all of a sudden the attitude was gone and we were given our room key straight away (so are the rooms ready or not? they clearly had some!). But she had already lost me with the rudeness. I am a World of Hyatt member and used to a very different standard in Hyatt hotels. Then we tried to go to the restaurant, unityLA, but asked the;2
Rooms are small and cramped.  No frills. Decorations somewhat Spatan. We had a view of the inner aspect of the hotel, so no view. Bathroom is tiny.  Temperature control in the room was poor, pretty hot.  Charges for WiFi nonPremium is $12.95.  Coming into the hotel it was a line of people that we had to get by there waiting to go upstairs to a nightclub.;2
Just a generally bad stay.  Not a good part of Hollywood.  The mythical hotel bar is apparently closed on Super Bowl Sunday (and no other bars close by because the neighborhood is bad).  Bathroom door looks like it hasn't been painted in about twenty years.  The hotel is in deteriorating shape.  No A/C even though it's 85 today.  Front desk was a ghost town when I went downstairs to ask about the bar.  No valet when I arrived.  Not much good to say.;2

My experience of this hotel was ruined on the last day.  The hotel itself is fine the room was quite large and good view of times square from the window. It was constantly noisy but we didn't really mind. They gave us free wifi as well.  However on checkout we paid in cash. We then realized they took the whole payment off our debit card as well. They charged us twice for a 4 night stay. I had to ring them to escalate this and it then took nearly two weeks to refund the money that was taken off our card without any approval (Over $1000.00 including deposit!)  New York was an amazing trip and I have been three times and will probably go again but will definitely not be staying at this hotel again.;2

My Cousin, a friend and I booked to stay for 8 nights at this hotel and got what we thought was a bargain, when we 1st arrived we'd thought we had done okay as It seemed like a smart pleasant little hotel. The room seemed fine, apart from the room opposite which absolutley reeked of stale smoke and sweat, we think the room belonged to someone who worked there as the lock on the door was an old key lock. The shower leaked when we used it but apart from that for the 1st couple of days we thought things were okay. We was made aware we cpuldn't call out from our room as we had pre paid our room bill and they didn't want us running up a huge bill and not paying for it - which we thought was fare enough, but then when we tried to call into the hotel phone it kept getting diverted to;2
The location of this hotel was perfect for our family event but the minute we saw the crumbs on the hallway carpet and paint peeling off the ceiling in our room we wondered if the cheap rates were reason enough to stay there. Only two towels, no daily maid service, no minifridge, no food in the hotel - those you can work around. Inability to control temperature of the room (one room was intolerably hot even with window wide open to January snow) is a little tougher. Another family member was in a room where temp was fine. The noise from the pipes at night was literally like someone banging on them with a wrench. I slept with ear plugs, which solved that problem. We reported our clogged toilet and nonworking tv, they fixed them that day. The general disrepair and poor condition;2

It started well enough.  I was warmly welcomed and given directions to places I needed to go.  The hotel is simple, but clean.  The trouble came when I had a medical emergency and had to check out early and was still made to pay for the two days I was not using.  I checked out by 9:30 am and informed them the night before, but they would not refund a cent.    I was here for cancer care and my son got very sick on the othr side of the country where we live.  He was admitted to the children's hospital.  My oncologist made time to see me sooner than planned and United Airlines changed my flight with no hassle for medical accommodation.  The Hollywood Hotel simply said, well it is not refundable, sorry!    Big fail, Hollywood Hotel!;2

I'm a long time lurker on these sites and I always try and do a little research here before going somewhere. I felt compelled to write my first ever review about the Hilton Universal City. I've stayed at many hotels, some famous, some not, some expensive, some cheap. Â I believe you get what you pay for and set my expectations accordingly. Needless to say, I expect a lot of things from a Hilton hotel. I will try to keep a simple, straightforward format in all the future reviews I write.  -dirty rooms- the first room we checked into had popcorn under the bed and under the chair and ottoman. I requested another room on a lower floor and this room had an empty water bottle under the bed. Â It was late and I didn't want to try a third room -no military discount- If a discount can't be;2
"The hotel lobby is absolutely underwhelming. A circus show with the feeling of a dilapidated theme park. Arduous check-in process. This place is stuck in a freeze frame of 20 years ago but with wear and tear accelerated. Carpet is threadbare and I'm shocked at how the fabric on the headboards is greasy and worn out. The fact this is a ""4-star"" hotel may be the biggest jokes on the internet. Many hotels in NYC get away with murder, so to speak. There's nothing about this hotel that is 4-star. It's a solid 2-3 star. It is also VERY loud in the hallway. Anyone walking by or talking in the hallway sounds like they are in the same room as you.   They charge to hold your bag where other hotels do this for free. The internet is not good. Excellent location but that's about it.";2

"The iconic ""Hotel Empire"" neon lights were out, which was so sad as my favorite show was filmed there. I would have loved to get a photo. We had to move rooms three times. First time, our phone, closet rod was broken (completely missing), and A/C unit was broken. Second time, they were kind enough to upgrade us to a king size bed. This room was wheelchair accessible. That is lovely for a guest who needs those accommodations. For us however, when showering, the water would go all over the bathroom. Soaking our clothes, towels, and making it dangerous to walk around. Not to mention, when the shower water would reach the toilet area it would smell of URINE. So nasty! When I went to see if we could switch, yet again, the manager informed me that they had no additional rooms";2
"Pros: The location is great for visiting NYC.  Very convenient for train travel to/from Penn Station, and there's an A/C/E subway entrance just a few steps from the entrance.  Con 1: Be prepared to pay an extra $30/night (hidden in the fine print on this site as a ""resort fee"" and called a ""facility fee"" by the front desk) for WiFi and an exercise room, even if you have no need for them.  It's unethical for hotels to advertise a prepaid price and then require you to pay another 10% per night when you show up.  To the manager: Include ALL fees in the advertised price.  Con 2: The walls are very thin and the room wasn't in great shape (peeling paint, etc.)  I was woken up one night by a neighbor throwing up in his bathroom, the other night by young kids screaming for a half hour,";2
This hotel was so disappointing.  It looks like the hotel hasn't been redecorated or updated in any way for decades.  The wall paper in the hall looks like something from a Willy Wonka movie and the paper in the room is dizzying.  The rooms are tiny.  The bathrooms ridiculously small.  The shower has this weird panel on the wall and only a half door.  The walls and the back of the door of the bathroom,  which is smoked glass, were dirty and peeling.  The whole bathroom felt dirty. The faucet was so close to the drain on the smallest sink I've ever seen in an hotel.  The carpet in the room is old and awful and worst of all I felt like I couldn't walk on it it was so dirty.  Even the air conditioning smelled when it was on.  There was no closet door- just a heavy velvet curtain;2
Not sure where to begin... Best to arrive by cab, no place for your car. An address to a local parking garage is provided. Two blocks, right turn, right again, then left, then right.....then walk back to the hotel. No doorman to help find a cab...walk to the corner and do your best. Phone buttons do not work. Seriously, To reach anyone you must select O- Operator. Front Desk- no answer, Housekeeping -no answer. We tried every button, nothing. Glad we didn't have an emergency! No blanket. Have never been to a hotel that did not provide a blanket. Bed was clean, sheets and a layer so thin it was nothing more than a thick sheet. Usually you would expect to have a spread on the bed or an extra blanket in the closet. Nope. None of the above. Had to call the Operator to reach;2
Very disappointed that for 2 days in a row, my shower trickled with cold water only.  Hotel tried to repair but took long time and my plans did not allow me to wait.  If not for this inconvenience, I would've had an excellent stay.;2
While staying at the hotel a priority package was delivery by Fedex.  The package was not forwarded to the front desk from the receiving dock until the following day even though the package was delivered at 10:30 am.   I was counting on Hilton's Excellent Customer Service to follow through.  I'm disappointed in their execution of a critical need.;2

Iâm sure theyâll never admit it, but someone in the valet staff messed with and destroyed the phone mount I had in my car.

Great hotel, really well placed and pretty affordable but the staff are unbelievable.   Rudest check in I've ever experienced. Breakfast staff who wouldn't take ppls orders, eggs Benedict done wrong, and cleaning staff that invade your room without your permission.   Perfect example of a hotel where the staff are so busy running the hotel they forget guests also stay there.   Board line terrible.;2
Chinatown meets Little Italy meets East Village meets Noho. With locational credentials like that, you'd think this hotel was onto a winner. Facing a small - but permanently busy  - park, this hotel sits in a pleasant residential district from which most of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn is just a walk away. Perhaps staff and management at the hotel recognise this because it is not the high quality of customer service that generates  business. At Windsor Hotel, customers seem to come last. On arrival, we were ignored for several minutes as the member of staff on reception was taking a call. A simple acknowledgment of our presence or an apology would have sufficed: we got neither. Guest information was given to us as if words were being charged by the minute. But most;2

We arrive late Friday night. We were greeted by the desk and  taken  it to our room. Room had no heat. Called downstairs and was told to go to the next level up to the same room number. Arrived unpacked and realized during the night that the heater had two temperatures. One was super hot and the other one was not at all. The room looks nice enough but really does need  a remodel. Woke up in the middle of the night with the room way way way too hot in the windows were blowing in cold air. Next morning we called downstairs and was put in yet another round. This room was bigger and more accommodating. This hotel needs some TLC. It is kind of beat. And there was no room service. The room service people didnât show up for work. The people that work there were very friendly and;2
Very tired hotel: rooms are very dingy and in need of massive upgrade. When I was there last month, I was upgraded to a big room. However, even this above average room needed a refurb. Finally, my bathroom was infested with roaches - yuck!!  Finally, they sneakily charge a facility fee of $30 + tax on a daily basis and I only found out about this fee at the time of check-in. Not cool!;2
What a difference five years makes since our last stay here. Dirty, unhelpful and rude staff on the main desk. We were glad to leave to be honest. Hotel is in a great location though close to time square and Penn Station.;2

Took a world tour in April / May 2011. During the trip we stayed at maybe 12 hotels.  The Empire Hotel was the most expensive in the whole trip.  We stayed at 4-star hotels and some 3-star. The Empire Hotel was also the worst from the point of view of the following: cramped standard room, fixtures and fittings not working or in poor repair, queues at front desk, concierge service poor.  The only real saving graces were the bell staff who were friendly and helpful, and the lady on the front desk,  Vanna, who worked tirelessly - against the odds.  The other saving grace was the location, which was very central and convenient.  I complained, was upgraded, and then it was better, but still poor value for money, and not a great experience.  My experience is that there are a lot;2

"I am SHOCKED that this hotel could have so many favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel prides itself on its Art Deco architecture, but that just means that your bathroom hasn't been renovated since the 1920s. The rooms are extremely small (I've been in larger rooms in Europe) - case in point, I had about 10 inches between the edge of the bed and the media console. As I said before, the bathroom is extremely small, with chipping tiles and almost no counter space (we had a ledge of about 4"" deep to store toiletries). Yes, the location is convenient, but expect more noise as a result (but this is nearly unavoidable in NYC) and panhandlers in the lobby. We also didn't appreciate hassle with having your hotel card looked at every time you enter since there are no card readers in";2
I knew it would not be fancy, or average, and it was not. But, that's ok. It was cheap and that was more important at the time. The room was fine, not dirty that I could see, but old and basic. This was my first time sharing a bathroom, I think there were 8 other rooms but I don't think the floor was full, so it was never a problem. Again the bathroom was old, and not the cleanest, but i expected that and it wasn't so bad as to freak me out. The walls are thin, i could hear the tv of the neighboring room quiet clearly. I will say the staff were not outright rude, but the made you feel as though you were inconveniencing them and they couldn't really be bothered to help you. My only real complaint was the breakfast, again i had very basic/low expectations. There was free coffee;2

Sitting at hotel on our last day here. No facilities - bar or restaurant for evening meal although stated on line. When mentioned to reception the attitude was disgusting - told manager wouldn't see us but to post our comments on Tripadviser and we would be answered there! Hotel isn't within walking distance of any decent places to get food. The trip up Vermont Avenue is intimidating with many homeless people asking for food/money. Having travelled to America for several years and thoroughly enjoying it this is the worst experience we have encountered. Was so disappointed by the way our points were dealt with.;2

The hotel itself was clean, very nice looking in the lobby, and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Our biggest issue is that they had us stay in the smallest room of all time. It was hard to walk around since it was so small. You couldn't close the bathroom door without standing in the shower. And then we found out it was about 1/3 the size of a normal room, but they didn't charge any less for it!  I won't ever come back.;2
It wasn't what had hoped for. The room was clean but the area surrounding the hotel was sketchy. We frequent California but have never stayed in this area. Won't be back. To enter the gated parking you have to get out of your car with quite a homeless population. We had to ask people to move to get in. They weren't very happy too... We faced the city (ask for the courtyard) so we heard people yelling, traffic etc all night. Saw two dog fights. It was close to a few of our stops this trip but I think we'll just drive in next time.  Breakfast was in the basement- typical food but was nice to have eggs prepared for you.   Between the area and outdated bathroom, I'd pass on this hotel in the future.;2
Ok, some things can't be blamed on the hotel, such as the terrible public transport system in Los Angeles.  But as for the hotel, it's kind of old and used, and apart from geography, its only connection with the movie industry are a few pictures from movies on the walls.  The rooms are small, but at least they have charming views of the mucky brick walls of neighbouring buildings.  It's a bit grungy.  As for ghe location, well, it's right by Hollywood Boulevard, but that's only a cool thing if you have a strong desire to photograph a couple of homeless people and a Starbucks.;2

"I have been staying at this hotel for years as it is close to friends and family in the city and very centrally located. I will no longer choose to stay here. It's been a slow, steady, and noticeable decline. The staff seems indifferent. I called room service and someone picked up the phone but no one answered. Just hung there on hold for an eternity. The doors to rooms 638 and 640 don't easily close which I feel is a safety issue. The pool was closed (summer may not be the best time to repair a pool deck) yet the rooftop bar remained open. No ice machines. They ""bring it right up"" which translates to ""perhaps ice may eventually appear"". I went one for two on procuring ice. There was a room service tray with a bucket of ice and a bottle of half filled wine that sat in the";2
Called in at this place for a drink. Told by the door man that we could use the bar in the restaurant and the roof top bar would be open in a while.

We then went up to the roof top bar area.Served by a guy that appeared not to want to be there.The seating area was dirty on the roof patio but you got a good view of New Jersey and the Scaffolding-hoist That was attached to the building.

We don't spend much time hanging-out in the room and we are used to typically-small NYC hotel rooms.  This ""room"" was so small one of us had to be sitting on the bed or in the bathroom so there was room for the other person to walk around the bed.  You also had to be standing in one very specific spot in the bathroom in order for there to be enough room to close the bathroom door.  It was almost comical is was so small.

My thoughts -  Pros - cheap, decent size room, friendly staff, very close to Penn Station which is why we booked it.  Cons - very tired decor. Rooms looked 1950's! In desperate need of a refurb. Lobby was ok but that was it. Cafe/restaurant that is linked to the hotel was very downmarket. I went in for an early morning coffee and there was a homeless person sleeping at one of the tables.   I wouldn't choose to stay here for a longer stay as the position is too busy and touristy. There are much nicer areas to base yourself at if you are visiting the city.;2

The hotel is in an excellent location, but it is clear that it needs to be renovated.  Our room had several flaws - crumbling ceiling, cracked walls, missing shower door, damaged door to the bathroom, worn furniture.  The beds were at least comfortable.  The view was terrific and we were able to walk across the street to Lincoln Center.  Despite its advantages, we will probably seek out different accommodations for our next trip to Lincoln Center.;2
we stayed here for 3 nights this week. The service was shocking never met a hotel that will not take a clients luggage after check out. Once they have your money they dont care.

"When you travel to New York, you have recognize that real world money rules don't apply. Everything is outrageously expensive, so it's all relative. So, relatively speaking, this is a nice option for someone wanting the bare basics, in a nice quiet part of Manhattan. How nice an area? Well, John Lennon's apartment in The Dakota is one street over    So, what do you get?

"HH member, I generally appreciate a lot Hilton standard but this one is a tourist trap. We arrived at 2pm and the room was not ready (ok hotel policy is 4pm but in Asia, Europe and other place in US I generally have a room even early in the morning). Only one file for HH for the checking so at the end we went on the regular file which was faster. But the worst is the breakfast. We are in executive and first of all there is no lounge and all the most the breakfast include is not the regular one but a bad joke call ""continental"" which is only bread and american coffee (no eggs, no expresso: nothing). For the price we pay for the night it's really a little and cheap policy.  They rather not include the breakfast than propose this thing. Even an Hampton Inn propose better t his";2
After reading reviews prior to booking this hotel I was excited about our upcoming stay. To say the least after our visit very disappointed. Location is worth 5 out of 5. That is where it ends. We were on the 21st floor. The bed was meant to be a Queen size bed, it was not double at the most. The pillows were about 400mm square pillows. If living out of a suitcase you could only have one suitcase open as there was not enough room for 2 to be open. The room was very small. No refrigerator, no coffee or tea making facilities, plastic cups in the room. Then when we were checking out we were hit with a $30 per day facility fee for use of gym. I did not know there was a gym and therefore never used it but still needed to pay. I am unsure which rooms they have upgraded certainly was;2
I travel with a territory of North America and with that have the opportunity to stay at many different hotels.  I have stayed at this establishment before, but regret that in both stays, I was not very impressed.  The room is worn, shower floor is black from age, floor near bathroom felt like it had experienced water damage and all they did was cover it. Water pressure would go from warm to ICE cold to BURN hot all while taking a short shower.  In NY it is hard ti find a cost effective hotel and if budget is your thing, this might be the place, but I would look a little deeper before pulling the trigger for this hotel;2

"I was very disappointed with the New Yorker - a Wyndham Hotel. The only real ""pro"" was its location - on 8th Ave near Times Square. I should note that some of the rooms had good views of the skyline - my room faced another wall of rooms 50 feet away. The experience started with lack of service - the couple that I was traveling with had a restaurant reservation that they were going to missed (NYC traffic), so I volunteered to take their bags to the New Yorker for them to pick up upon check-in. Unfortunately, there were no bell staff anywhere to be seen in the lobby or anybody at the luggage desk (this was only 8:15 in the evening). I had to go out front to draft a doorman to help check in the bags. He didn't know exactly how (he wanted to scrawl a first name on one of the three";2

This was supposed to be THE place to stay to be close to Universal Studios and make your theme park experience unique and pleasurable - NOT the case! Poor shuttle service, no connection to Universal Studios - no characters floating around, no specific meet and greets, no friendliness among the staff...long lines at the registration and asking/making requests felt like you were being a nuisance... perhaps you better off using the money at the nearby hotels... may costs you less...there was no clear advantage as advertised.Food, Lobby and Bar area beautiful and great... Nice environment, great food and excellent service.;2
I stayed here for 1 night whilst passing through New York. I chose this hotel due to it's close location to Penn Station. That was the best thing about it. There was no space to store luggage, or walk about, I was shocked as to how small it was. The toilet was blocked upon my arrival and when I asked reception for this to be sorted, there was no-one on duty to unblock it for me. I was told to use the toilet in reception as there were no other rooms for me to move in to.           There were no curtains in the room, just blinds, these blinds were useless for blocking out the light. The windows also were useless for blocking out the sound, meaning it was impossible to get a good nights sleep. All in all, I would not stay here again, or recommend to anyone unless they wish to waste;2
My girlfriend and I have just spent 4 days there. We had booked without checking any rewievs prior to booking. We were concerned due to the mixed rewievs of this place, but decided to take a chance out of necessity. The hotel is old and has seen far better days. The hall ways are confusing, the stair wells and elevators can certainly do with renovations. Our room however was acceptable. It was large, the bath room was in excellent condition and the bed comfortable. We encountered none of the reported bug problems, and our room was cleaned to an acceptable standard. The furniture was old and could need replacing, and the television should certainly have been in better condition with regards to general state and the programmes it could receive. Unfortunately this hotel is in;2
This is worst hotel experience. The heat was off and it was freezing, and called the front desk and they said they would call EV to turn the heat on. It never came on. I called again and spoke to someone different and they said the same thing. They came and bring some blankets they brought 6 blankets in total which didn't help at all. And in my bathroom, had no towels or wash clothes.  I had to wait for 1,2 hours for they to come. The hotel tv only had 3,4 channels.  The hotel was dirty it had spackling on the floor, the wall paper was coming off the wall. The elevator was broken. Stay away for this HOTEL...STAY AWAY;2
If you are going to charge high rates for a room, don't charge $5 for a bottle of water in the room, make the wifi free, don't charge $3 for a cookie etc etc. Are you modeling yourself after the hotel keeper in Les Miserables?;2
Budget spartan room with nothing moveable and unnecessary stern warning not to steal the furnishings. No TV, hence the bonus that there's no TV noise next door. Quiet street. Peaceful ambience inside, and the few guests seemed largely budget-conscious young travellers. Lifts and loos erratic. However, close by is Upper Broadway, a cheerful area with almost Parisian ambience, good eating, drinking and excellent bus/metro communications .;2
Location was amazing! I was working at Alice Tully Hall and I could not have asked for a more convenient spot. The building/block full of just what I needed. There was a big Duane Reed down stairs for last minute things I forgot and snacks. A Starbucks literally out the door for my grab and go breakfast. PJ Clarks out the door to the other side to sit for an easy (yet expensive) burger. Rosa Mexicana around the block for a catch up margarita, chips and fresh guac with the work team. The little plaza across the street with a few tables and chairs was a great waiting/meeting spot. The fish restaurant in the building was even quite enjoyable for a more upscale bite to celebrate at the end of the project.  HOWEVER, the hotel needs a refurbish. My fourth floor room was down a long;2

Spent a long weekend here recently, I was in town for a combination of work and pleasure.  My main (and only) complaint about this hotel is the level of noise from the rooftop club.    We stayed on the 9th floor and the music from the club was clearly audible in our room at night.  Perhaps we were directly under the speakers - the bass thumped loudly through the ceiling and walls all night.  On Thursday night, it ended shortly after 1am, so not a major issue for us.  On Friday night, however, the rooftop club (like many NYC clubs) is open until 4am.  We called the front desk twice to see if they could do anything about it - they said they'd call the club manager but nothing happened.  Not really surprised by that, I'm certain the club brings in a ton of revenue and that;2

"Why does this hotel get good reviews? The Pros are obvious -- location. The Cons are too many to list. The lobby may be fancy, the hotel ""historic"", but it is a dump. The rooms are small, and I mean Japanese small. The rooms and halls are dark and dingy. The woodwork and doors are nearly 100 years old and have the paint chips to prove it. The bath fixtures are old and nasty. Paint was peeling in many places in the room. The TV was in such a strange position it was nearly impossible to watch. Maybe to the many many Euro visitors this is an acceptable hotel, but by American standards it is an overpriced flop house. If you are a Wyndham fan, choose the Wingate just a few blocks away.";2

Overall I normally have a very good experience at Hilton facilities, but arriving on Monday the 21st and waking up on Tuesday to only a cold shower was a bit unsettling, but the return to the hotel after a wonderful experience at the Magic Castle to find emergency vehicles and word that there was some type of smoke or electrical issue on the 24th floor.  I was checked into the 22nd floor and we were finally informed we could go to our rooms at 1:00AM PST, but if we wanted to walk instead of wait for one of the three operating elevators that was an option.... not for this traveler.. Getting to bed just after 2:00AM, which for me was 5:00AM EST made for a very difficult day in meetings. Many of my meeting attendees were staying at your hotel, being awake was the #1 priority on;2

Fortunately after complaining the staff were very polite and helpful and did in fact move us to another room although much better we found the lamp, hairdryer and toilet didn't work properly (the toilets actually became blocked in several people's rooms including ours.)

The room change never happened and at reception they told me that they could have moved me on the following day to a smaller interior room.

To earn those kind of dollars, Days Inn needs a redo.;2
I hate to leave a bad review because the staff was so nice but... It's like the management is only doing the minimum, if that.  Beds are very cheap and horribly SQUEAKY. We booked a private twin but were given a 4 bed bunk room with very little space.  Showers had no shelves or hooks which makes no sense for a shared shower space. Kitchen - I wouldn't use it. TV room / common room is shut away and not very comfortable.    I wouldn't recommend for solo travelers who like meeting others on their trips.  We did like the location, though. And, of course, the staff was very friendly.  Not sure who owns or manages this but they need to step up their game.;2

My stay at The Jane was Hell.  I arranged lodgings for the day of 12 Jan. stipulating I would be checking in at 1am that morning.  I was given a verbal confirmation (twice) that this was acceptable as I was leaving NYC that morning.  When I arrived, exhausted from flight the desk attendant had no record of this.  At 2:30 am I was still renegotiating the booking.  I will skip the difficulty of that.  Once in room 610 the temperature was 93, even with the window and door cracked.  At 3:30 I was moved to a room where the air conditioning worked and I finally fell asleep.  The documentation and charges reflected on my card are a mess.  There are charges that reflect $144.00 for the inconvenience I caused the hotel.  Hopefully that charge will disappear, as well as the $86.00 hold in;2

We stayed here with our teenage sons for 4 nights and wish we didnât.

I asked security about attractions and he swiftly sent me to the âcome for a feee breakfast and no obligation to sign upâ desk where it took me 20 mins to explain I didnât want to do it and just wanted ideas where to go.  Not a great start to our holiday!;2

At first, my sister and I were happy we booked a room here, we were hesitant at first because of all the bad reviews but we thought it wouldn't bother us too much since we'd be out a lot. Long story short, we got there just to be let down. They said there was a leak and our room wasn't available anymore (we freaked out). Just two girls in NY for the first time, and without a room...you could imagine our anger. Anyway, the manager (after 2 hours) told us he booked us another room in another hostel on the lower eastside,  when we got to the other hostel there was a mix up and we had to wait another 1-2 hours before they finally straightened everything out and gave us a room. The only good thing that came out of booking this hostel was getting booked at the other hostel for less!;2
We had booked the Astor for 7 nights and checked in Oct 29th. The hotel is situated on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, across from Central Park. Indeed a fairly decent location for a stay.  The room was incredibly basic, the reception to the tv wasn't watchable. Lovely toiletries were provided in the bathroom and it was certainly clean and tidy.  The staff were friendly and the doorman certainly looked after us during our brief time meeting him.  However, when we arrived to our room, it was of a decent size (two double beds) but the room was quite sparse, what there was of it. I was a little unsure of the location, especially when we had to walk down to Columbus Circle. Whether or not it was just that weekend, I'm unsure, but the subway was only running from 59th street.

You hear about this hotel from everyone, see it on every tv show and expect it to be grand and beautiful. This place needs some serious work. It is truly run down once you exit the lobby and enter your room. The shower is a european type shower with only half of a glass door. There really needs to be a full door as water gets absolutely everywhere. To the point where paint is literally falling off the walls from so much water damage. The other issues in my room included: a missing shower drain (I slipped and fell into it--gross and painful), paint issues as mentioned, all of my bathing towels had holes in them--big ones, AC that was really loud and really didn't work and no coffee maker even though I was told I had one at check in.

Number of items not up to par at this hotel, compared to its competitors right next door.   1.  There is no information in the room. Hotel directory contains information on earthquakes and services times for a local Catholic Church.  Thatâs it.  Information like what restaurants exist, or when hotel restaurant is open are not there.  No data on hotels amenities at all. Nothing electronically provided on tv system or in room directory.    2. Room service menu is extremely limited, compared to Marriott just Dow the road.  3 . Lighting in the room was bizarre- took most of my stay to figure out how to turn on and off lights.   4. Hotel is next to one of the largest airports in the world- with various flights leaving at all hours.....breakfast buffet opens at 6 am. Not accommodating;2
I needed a hotel close to the start of the NYC Triathlon - and this Hotel had the best location.  Not only was it a 10 minute walk to the starting area - but a great location for restaurants and access to Centra Park ( a bit of a walk but safe).  Upon check-in, you will want to part on 95th PRIOR to check-in.  There is no area to park your car and unload.  Upon check-in we noticed the hotel elevators were out of commission - and only one set was working.  Our room was dark and the key NEVER worked.  Without boring you with the explicit details of our experience - let's just say this hotel is in desperate need of a makeover.  The hotel staff is really what  balanced our stay - very courteous and genuinely concerned about all the issues we encountered during our stay.   If you;2
I booked on hotwire for an average of 160 a night. They booked us in a small room next to an elevator. Worst sleep ever had in a hotel. Extremely noisy. A four star hotel simply should not be assigning these rooms. While the location is excellent and the checkin areas is trendy and upscale, service is substandard, single rooms are very small and this hotel will squeeze out every penny where hey can. Not recommended.;2
I woke up with a very sore throat and painful sinus.  I checked the a/c unit which was filled with grime and dust.  I was spending the day at auditions with my son - I felt awful the entire day.  Someone needs to check this stuff!!!;2
The hotel staff was friendly and tried to be helpful as much as they could, but they could not control the fact that people actually live in the hotel.  The hotel does not advertise as a hostile and that is exactly what it is.  The floors that have not been renovated(1-9 or 10) have dirty carpet and dirty exterior walls.  For the price I did not expect the Taj Mahal, but for an inexpensive NY Day's Inn I  did expect a clean looking exterior to compensate for the older rooms.  I did not expect the smell of smoke or food cooking.  It served the purpose, but I was not comfortable and felt slightly unsafe. If you are looking for a regular hotel with just vacationers or temporary visitors this is not the place.;2

The Empire Hotel is a beautiful, contemporary, wonderfully located hotel with a great roof top bar over looking Columbus circle and The Lincoln Center. The double room was a great size (especially for a NYC hotel) and moderately clean... That is it for the pros. Cons:  The beds are incredibly hard, no flat sheets were on the beds, and the room was very hot (even with the air on in Dec). With two hair dryers plugged in our power blew in our room and had to sit in the pitch black until they came to fix it. Do not expect ANYTHING to be included in the price of your room (450.00+) not even coffee... One morning I paid the ridiculous 3.00 for a cup of in room coffee to find out there wasn't even cream and sugar! The entire hotels service staff is unorganized, rude, and unhelpful;2
Arrived at 7 pm after a full day of travel, told room was not yet ready.  After politely confirming that we were not going to wait for a room, found one.  Large, poorly lit and designed, heat/ air conditioning-only worked on one side of room.. Room safe on top of shelf-needed chair to access.   Had am wake up call for an early event, and room did not have any caffeinated coffee.  Ended up phoning 4 times-staff could never provide. Brought towels to use in place of safety mats for slippery shower.  Because of multiple problems, given complimentary access to lounge for meals-but neglected to program access into room key.  The list goes on and on-a progression of slights, seemingly unable to rectify.  Would we return?  No.  Lots of hotels in this town.;2
Honestly the stay was a complete disappointment . Charge 600+ dollars for a basic room with rust in the shower with used products in the shower. Not only did I pay $600 for a basic hotel I also had to pay $35 per day for basic parking. If Iâm paying this amount for a room The minimum would be that you guys covered parking. Maybe Iâm just used to Vegas hotels but this was not up to par or up to standards for the price. Also, the water pressure in my room was a joke. The sink  had better water pressure than the shower. The water pressure in the shower was a joke! also spent $70 plus tip on breakfast. The breakfast was a basic waffle runny(wet) eggs and bacon. Nothing in the Buffay was worth $70. Not to mention the utensils and drink cups or dirty which I had asked my service to;2

A few friends and myself were looking for something on a budget to try and get to NY during December.  This hotel is very basic and in some ways really lets itself down.  The first room my cousin and myself were given was through a fire exit door and it was an absolute tip.  I only looked in and walked straight back out and went down to reception and advised that it was filthy and I would not stay.  I had read that you could upgrade your room and we had tried to do that via the internet before we arrived but the hotel didn't respond.  We were eventually given a family room with 2 double beds which was nice for the two of us.  I have to say that the room was clean, and there was a maid service everyday.  It is a very tired hotel and a couple of the desk staff are not very nice.;2

If I had known they were under construction, or what the conditions would be like, I wouldn't have booked my stay at the Hilton.  I was hoping for a nice, restful vacation, but what I ended up with was a lovely 7 am wake-up by the incredibly loud construction.  Fourth floor and I could hear banging, sawing, items being dropped or moved, it was awful.  Construction every day except Sunday, despite being a holiday weekend (Memorial Day)!  I arrived late Thursday night and checked out Monday morning.  The room was permanently set to 73.2, which was way too hot for us.  We didn't sleep well in the heat.  The elevators were unbelievably slow.  The decor was dated at best, poorly maintained.  The food was good but far too over-priced.  The small gift shop clerks were unhelpful if not;2
My experience at the Wyndham New Yorker was fraught with disappointment. I understand that rooms are small and that is accurate. But Construction outside my room (on the 26th floor, I mean outside my window) for 8 hours was a bit much. Then my electrical outlets went out on one of the two walls and another inconvenience. Then the shower would go from scalding to cold within minutes and without touching the valves. I tried to change rooms, but they only offered two double beds in an updated room. My wife and I enjoy sleeping in the same bed, so that was not an option. This may not be everyone's experience, just mine and absolutely factual.;2

Pros: Location!  Quick walk to subway, short walk to Central Park.  Starbucks, quaint restaurants, 24 drug store all close.  Heard very little noise from other rooms.  Cons: Staff uninterested and unhelpful, once outside of lobby everything is tired and dated. TWICE staff walked into our room without knocking (once mini bar person, once housekeeping).  King size bed was hard and the sheet is the duvet cover, no separate sheets. Walk up flights to rooftop pool makes the subway look clean and polished - ridiculous.  The pics on website make this hotel look very swanky, but it's much more skanky.;2
Location- Brilliant so close to the subway and easy to get to central park! Approx nearly 2 hours from J F KENNEDY airport because traffic is manic so make sure you have a decent flight time!   Hotel its self is very dated. It needs rennovating badly! The hallways smelt like cigarette/damp smell, which wasn't nice. The evelvator sometimes didn't work as well as you wanted it to the buttons didn't highlight to go to the correct floor. The vending machines didn't want to vend out the water serval occasions. (buy your water from the chemist next door). The staff at this hotel were very kind and really helpful even the cleaners spoke good english and understood me well.   The room itself was baking hot no instructions on how to turn the temperature down. No windows to open either- I;2
"Location location location is the only reason I would recommend this hotel.

It took them over 36 hours  after i complained to the housekeeping to get rid of a row of cocktail glasses lined outside a room in our hallway! Shower needed fixing - never got fixed during our stay. Needless to say - my kids refused to shower !

Stayed at the Days Hotel in New York july of '07 for a week. The Hotel is very worn, and a bit dirty but the overall experience we had was fine enough.  We had a room with a view over the backyard, not so very nice but hey....someone's gotta have it. Tiny room, and a carpet that smelled horribly but it was cleaned every day, the bed was made and we got clean towels every day. The aircondition made a terrible noice throughout the night, but we were so tired from the experience of the city so we fell asleep anyway. Bathroom was small and old but fine, and everything worked. Overall a nice stay for the price but I don't think I wanna stay here again. It was a bit TOO dirty for me...and the funky smell of the carpets everywhere was too much.

It was small, noisy, dark and dirty with a dÃ©cor straight from the 1970s. The bathroom was equally bad and tired with old uneven tiles painted over by green paint.

I stayed with my partner for a 3 day break at the Astor on the Park. We arrived late at night so we have a quick check in although the receptionist didn't seem very happy to see us-as this seemed to disturb his rest.  The room was very small and basic but clean. There was only one small window overlooking the inside court of the hotel. There were some facilities: an alarm clock, and tv with very bad reception in a wardrobe. The bathroom was also very small and basic but clean. It wasn't easy trying to work out how to use the shower and the receptionist didn't explain very well after calling her. There was also one hairdryer which didn't  work.   Due to the lack of facilities there wasn't much to judge the service on other than our interaction with the reception staff which;2

Tiny room with two comfortable double beds, great view of Broadway & great location to Lincoln Ctr- nice flat screen TV and safe in the room.  Unfortunately, there were too many little annoyances for me to ever go back.  Noise was beyond belief -windows did not filter anything and we were facing Broadway.  Beware the rooftop bar crowd exits in the wee hours and you can hear everything.  No shower door so bathroom floor floods-strange set up.  Wifi was not free, no complimentary coffee although there was a Keurig fully supplied and ready to go (at $3 a cup).  Outlets in room were scarce- 4 of us all had iPhones, iPads to charge and had to leave some of them plugged in on the floor due to the location of the wall jacks?;2

Booking one day before we were happy to get this for $95.  The room is spacious, comes with a fridge & sink. The shared bathroom was average and you had to carry your loo paper in every time.    Don't expect to sleep a lot - the bed was awful and it sounded as though the windows were open, when they were shut! But that's the charm of NYC so we got over the noise, but not the bed.   Great location - a couple of blocks from the subway, few more blocks from Central park and a great little corner diner / cafe nearby. It was a safe neighbourhood and about $8 cab ride from Times Square.   The reception staff were somewhat vacant and not very helpful.;2
We stayed 4 nights at the Ameritania early January. We arrived very late on the eve of the snow storm, the bar was closed so we went to the Three Monkeys next door, great little pub, nice food and good selection of drinks. The decor is modern however the room was very small, just enough space to move around in, however it was clean. Day 2 our radiator blew up and we were moved rooms. The room was bigger but was exterior facing and was freezing, there was icicles in the bathroom! The WiFi was intermittent and the TV did not work. When I went to sort our room key, the person on reception I spoke to was rude and dismissive.

My husband and I stayed here for one night (thank goodness).  Positives are that it was near MSG, the price was right ($117.) and the room was clean.  But oh my goodness was this room ever tiny.  There was no way I would have room to put make up on in the bathroom or even fix my hair.   I would have done all of this outside of the bathroom but there was no mirror anywhere else.  Wifi wasn't working and worse of all, the toilet didn't flush. Oh, I almost forgot.  It was about 90 degrees in the room and no way to adjust the heat.  When the front desk was called, they recommended we open a window (I suppose that would have worked as it was below zero outside).  I would not stay here again.;2
We had heard the top of the Empire Hotel had a great view, and that is correct. So if you want to see it, take the elevator up, but don't stay for drinks. I was expecting a really nice atmosphere, since this entire building was totally remodeled. If you like badly dressed staff, $16 drinks, riding in an elevator that looks like the worst freight elevator you've ever seen, decor that already looks run down, then you'll be happy.;2
Where to start:   We had booked via an agent who booked us into a standard double , this can only be described as a student accommodation. So small , tired carpets and room wasnât cleaned properly.  Becareful what rooms you book here !!   We asked to move rooms which we had to pay for an âupgrade â additional price per night we had no choice as the original room was disgraceful.   The hotel is so very very busy !!

I have stayed here numerous times because it's usually affordable. I used Priceline.com to book the room. Almost every time I go there, the shower has no hot water and I have to switch rooms (if possible). It happened again. I paid for a queen size bed, and received a single size bed! The room was near the staircase, and for some reason, people were coming in and out of their room all night and slamming the door. The hotel is in a good location with many stores around. I actually live in NYC, and just stay in hotels for a change of scenery. The Days Inn is a good place to sleep, but that's all I can really say. The elevators are cramped and slow. There is nothing special about this hotel at all...;2

"I would never stay in this hotel again ever. I forgot my iPod in my room when I checked out to catch a flight, I tried for days to get through to the hotel but was unsuccessful, on hold for over 30 mins each time, emails went unanswered for days also. When I did eventually get through to someone, they literally could not have cared less, "" no iPod was handed in"" end of story is what I was told.  Drinks in the hotel are over priced â¬16 for a glass of white wine. The room was fine, very small but I expected that, the price of snacks from the mini bar is also overpriced.  One good point was the location, it's within walking distance to the main tourist spots.";2

Going to make this a short review:  This hotel is not a pleasant place to stay in at all - my mum nearly killed me for booking it!!  HOWEVER, we decided last minute to stay in NY, so we wanted something cheap!  You really do get what you pay for and although i would not stay here again, we had a great time and the location is very good!!  Also, we were up and out early as we did not really want to be in the room!  So probably got to see more of NY than we would have otherwise!!!  That's about the only good thing i can say!!;2
Poorly designed, tiny tiny bathroom with no ventilation for the steam from the shower causing the whole room to become dewy. Room was hot, the ac was on but didn't work very well. We also found a roach in the shower. We are pretty laid back people so, this is not satire just honesty. The staff was friendly.;2

Bad customer service, not friendly staff or front desk. At least staff we interacted with were mean enough for us to avoid seeing any or asking any. Rooms are extremely noisy, you have to have an agreement with your neighbor not to flush the toilet or take a shower at night, otherwise, no sleep for you. Don't ask for an upgrade, they will downgrade you and tell you we upgraded you. As mentioned in the title, the only good thing about it is that it is that close to universal studios, besides that, there is no reason for anyone to come back to this hotel.;2
Any decent hotel - especially one in a major city - provides its guests with a coffee/tea maker in their room.  Not, however, the Wyndham New Yorker.  If you want this very basic amenity in what used to be a good hotel in a most convenient location, you will be extorted to the tune of $25 a night!  The New Yorker has some lovely, comfortable,  refurbished Art Deco rooms, and others with great views of the Empire State Building - but it clearly canât be bothered to make its guests feel welcome with this simplest requirement the for traveler.  Thatâs just shameful for what used to be a nice place to stay.;2

When we arrived late at night they knew it would be three of us, we booked a suite *wow* and payed almost $500 for one night, when we came to the room we had one bed and one pullout bed that wasnât even made so we had to call room service and they came 45 mins later. Got the feeling of walking into a hotel room like 50 years ago. Yellow and brown sofas, the curtains.... just no. The rooms are bad, and the carpet is really not ok. I really donât wanna know whatâs been on that one... This hotel needs a renovation, ASAP! Wouldnât recommend to anyone and will not come back. One thing thatâs good is that beds are comfy.;2
The room was fine, the location near the train station so that was a plus. We left though feeling ripped off. We asked them to store our luggage for a couple hours after we checked out. We wanted to walk around a bit before our flight. They charge you $5 per bag, even if the bag is a briefcase and a camera case! They wouldn't let us consolidate our bags. I think they charge enough for the room, storing your luggage for a couple hours should be gratuitous.;2
Just checked out, room was a strange shape and so the furniture didnât actually fit properly in the room making it a bit awkward. Bathroom was very small and while I know itâs going for an Art Deco vibe, the place really seems dated. We could hear a crying baby most of the first night we were staying there. Not a very friendly staff, people sort of look past you when they speak. Ate at the diner several times for convenience. Food was good, service is terrible! Canât beat the convenience to Penn Station and MSG. Iâd probably look around a bit more, especially since itâs not the cheapest place in the neighborhood.;2
I had booked a surprise for my husband for one night stay at The Empire Hotel for vanentines weekend. I have been to this hotel before for a New Years Eve party which we enjoyed. The lobby area and mezzanine decor looks beautiful. The roof top is also worth checking out!  I was disappointed however  on how small the rooms were. The shower door was dirty. The wallpaper in the bedroom was peeling off, the bed cover was all torn!  We had breakfast the next morning in the restaurant located on the 1st floor. Was very disappointing. For the price they charge for a hot & cold Buffett it really is not worth the price. I believe our bill came to $60.(for scrambled eggs and some potatoes) The food selection was very small and not much food to offer at all. Both the food and coffee were;2

Disappointing stay.  Understood these to be serviced appartments - far from it. We had no service in the 9 days we stayed. Bin not emptied, sheets not changed, towels not refreshed.   Reception staff were rude and unhelpful, did nothing when we made a complaint. Also charged per bag to hold items after check-out (not even in a secured area).  The only positive was the location.;2
I booked at this hotel because somewhere I saw it had 4 stars.  I can't emphasize enough how terrible my stay was.  For 6 days my air conditioner only worked intermittently.  I called and stopped by the main desk to complain.  One day prior to my departure, they finally replaced the unit.  The refrigerator barely worked, I asked for a replacement, that never happened.  It was very hot outside the days I stayed and each guest was given 2 bottles of warm water which you had to ask for.  There was no coffee available in the lobby and no newspapers.  The room itself was nice but very small (I had a queen bed) and they did an excellent job cleaning daily.  The front staff were not helpful and often had to be told multiple times about problems.

I had a job interview and my potential employer booked me a room at this hotel for the night. I guess it is somewhat of a famous hotel, but I don't see why. The room I stayed in on the 9th floor was about the size of a large closet. My home office is bigger than the room I stayed in. Worst of all was the bathroom. The sink basin barely had enough room to put my hands underneath the faucet. The drain in the sink was so slow that you could not use it for a few minutes after you washed your hands and you had to wash your hands in a hurry before it filled up. There also was no soap in the shower. I had to use the hand soap from the bathroom sink to wash my body. The shower was a nightmare to use and there is no door on the shower. The room as a whole looks dated with the wallpaper;2
We arrived at this hostel (it's not really a hotel but hostel) late in the evening (by 11pm) and were surprised they had changed our booking and provided us with a single room without bathroom. I was sad and disappointed at least by this and on my question why had they done so with any notice to me I had a reply that's usual practice with people who arrive late and do not call in advance. Fortunately next day they provided us with a decent room we booked before. The manager promissed me to give the difference back to my bank account but they didn't do it yet even though I sent some messages. Strange experience, take care if you arrive late and try to call them in advance. I wouldn't stay there any more, definitely;2
Beautiful lobby, not indicative of things to come. Staff where friendly. Hotel corridors, lifts etc where very tired and grubby. Well worn.  Room was freezing ! But it was February in a cold snap so hey ho. However, the bathroom was a different thing altogether sub zero temps. No heating at all in there. Old and utilitarian. It is central but I would forgo that for a coffee machine or a bottle of water in the room. The WiFi IS NOT COMPLIMENTARY AS STATED, ITS AN EYE WATERING $22 a night !!!  This included use of the gym and business facilities ??? On a birthday trip and Iâm a disabled elderly mum. But still paid for use of the gym !! I was told, rather patronisingly , itâs there if you want it mâam Non negotiableð¡.  We could have had a coffee maker in the room  for $25 a night.;2

I explained we could of been robbed!!! What's going on?? She walked off and wouldn't answer.  I asked a collegue and she wouldn't reply  So I don't know where it was genuine or why she got in our room but I wouldn't return. Not just due to the unwanted guest but also due to the flippant staff not taking my concerns to task  The hotel was nice hence me not giving one star.;2
Stayed at the Empire Hotel near the Lincoln Centre this weekend.   For a hotel that calls itself the Empire, the service was somewhat Peasant-like.   Had precooked a room on Hotels.com because the rates were great.  When I arrived with my family, the 'standard room' that I was given was the size of a closet, faced the wall and had a heating unit that was broken and wouldn't stop working...felt like I was in a sauna.  So I called and was moved to a different room, at an additional cost of $40.00 USD / night.  Next room was very nice.   I bought some wine for the room to have with dinner on the Saturday.  I called down to see if I could get some wine glasses, as there were none in the room already, even though there was wine for sale in my mini bar and a corkscrew, just in case I;2
I stayed here because I was speaking at a conference next door at Fordham. The location is AMAZING. Next door to the Lincoln Center and tons of restaurants and shopping. However, the hotel itself is run down. The lobby is nice but the rooms themselves are small and outdated. The heater kept up noise both nights I was there and the hot water didn't work either night I was there either. The front desk said that the boiler was having issues. So, I ended up having to take a cold shower both days. Would not recommend staying here. It'll only lead to you being frustrated and annoyed.;2

"The hotel lobby is absolutely underwhelming. A circus show with the feeling of a dilapidated theme park. Arduous check-in process. This place is stuck in a freeze frame of 20 years ago but with wear and tear accelerated. Carpet is threadbare and I'm shocked at how the fabric on the headboards is greasy and worn out. The fact this is a ""4-star"" hotel may be the biggest jokes on the internet. Many hotels in NYC get away with murder, so to speak. There's nothing about this hotel that is 4-star. It's a solid 2-3 star. It is also VERY loud in the hallway. Anyone walking by or talking in the hallway sounds like they are in the same room as you.   They charge to hold your bag where other hotels do this for free. The internet is not good. Excellent location but that's about it.";2
I have stayed at this hotel for years, I used to recommended to everyone. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore. The facility, along with management, are falling apart. AC did not work and the overall infrastructure is showing itâs age.;2
Pros: Check-in was good and fast. Perfect location, everything is nearby just 10 -20min away walking depending where do you want to go. Train station next to the hotel.  Restaurants in hotel and nearby Nice lobby I guessâ¦  Cons: Rooms are really small and all decor of the hotel itâs old fashioned and rusty in some areas.  Bathrooms were clean not the best satisfaction when seeing it, you can notice it has not been renovated in a long time. Walls on room were damaged, dents and scratches. I can understand itâs a historic hotel as what iâve seen but still I understand that the company managing needs to keep everything up to date.  I was not impressed at all with the hotel.  If I ever return to new york I will definitely look other options.;2
when we first stayed here the room was great we even had a balcony 2 time was also ok but third time was rubbish the room was really tiny and the bathroom was even smaller just enough room to get in ,it seems since the wyndham has taken over the hotel has gone backwards they now charge a resort tax or as they now call it a facility fee with tax is 29 dollars which they never used to charge so save your money and stay else where;2
We were allocated this Hotel as a part of our group package and it appeared to be a good deal as the daily fee they charge to use the fitness centre and have free telephone and wi-fi was waivered. The location is superb right where you want to be to explore wonderful NYC, close to subway, manhatten, empire state building etc. First impressions are good also, as the foyer, bar and reception are all art-deco clean tidy and the staff are very engaging, polite and helpful. The tick tock 24 hour diner attached to the Hotel serves great food and the eggs benedict is out of this world. 10/10 thus far. Our booking stated we was in a standard queen room and when we arrived reception informed us that we had been allocated a room without a view and he would upgrade us to a room with a view;2
"The hotel is tired and needs updating. It's not up to the standard of modern hotels and it feels like it's stuck in the 70s / 80s. Some staff were unhelpful and unwilling to think for themselves; however others were very helpful. Overall it was a poor experience for the money. There are much better New York hotels for the same price.";2

This is obviously an older hotel that has been remodeled. While they have done a nice job, there is still much to do.   Good Parts - Comfortable bed - Nice shower with rain head  Needs Improvement - Windows on the street side need to be replaced. Paper thin. You know its bad when you have ear plugs on your pillow - Extremely slow elevators that creak - Front desk staff is disorganized  I called down to get a quieter room on the interior and was told all Doubles are next to the elevator so I opted to stay in my room on the 3rd floor where the traffic noise was pretty disruptive. Thank God for the ear plugs.  I called down to the Front Desk to extend my stay. I was quoted a rate of $229. I wanted to use a new card so I came down the next morning to confirm.

expecting much more from a big brand accommodation.  Visible appearance is nice but room was noisy being next (5th floor) to heavy traffic and employee(?) parking below me both contributed to a loud sleepless night.  Bath door opens in to block sink area and light switch inside behind door - very poor layout. Shower fixture leaks and will not stay positioned. Room heater does not respond to auto thermostat and ran long time continually increasing heat.  No microwave.  Front desk on checkin (8pm) was very cold  with no warmth to extend feeling that I was welcome.  Have found lesser known brands have been more concerned for customer care.;2

Booked on Hotels.com - pay at property.  Used a card to hold the reservation as required and assured that I could use any payment at the hotel.  The day before check-in the original card was charged.  I immediately called and said I want to use a different card for payment, was assured that I could.  When I got to the hotel the friendly front desk person issued a refund and charged the correct card.  I was assured that the refund will take 2-3 days.  Three days later, still no refund.  Called the front desk again today and was told that the refund would not take 7-10 days.  So the hotel has $646.00 for a $323.00 stay.  I will think twice about booking with Hotels.com and using my credit cards at hotels.;2

I am disappointed in several things.   1. I initially had booked for 3 adults and 1 child, and paid the $40 fee for the additional adult (which was absurd in the first place). That adult canceled, and the hotel refused to refund me the $40, even when Expedia contacted them on my behalf, as well as at the check-in desk. This single night cost me over $400. They couldn't refund $40 for a non-present guest?  2. The bathroom door in our room (1134) looks like it's been kicked in before, and the 'patch jobs' all over the bathroom look terrible. For over $400 for the night, I expected better.   3. The food at the overpriced and under-serviced breakfast was awful. The bacon was burned, the sausage tasted like wet cardboard, the french toast tasted like a dry sponge. There were no;2

"I've been really disappointed by the hotel. First of all, I paid a reservation through Booking.com and I had to pay the full price when I arrived at the hotel. So in the end, I paid the amount of the reservation in extra. But whatever. For this kind of prices, I was expecting a better room. You'll see in the photos attached, stains on the walls, ugly bathroom, stains on the bathroom's mirror, not a wonderful smell. The only good thing was the bed, which is good. But that's, I think, the minimum. Parking is expensive for an uncovered parking. I won't go to this hotel again. Hopefully I was there for work and didn't have to spend a lot of time in this ""hotel"".";2

"The great thing about The New Yorker is the location. Right in midtown, you can easily reach most of Manhattan's ""must see"" spots, as well as being conveniently placed for shopping. The hotel also has the fantastic Tick Tock 24 hour diner which is great for breakfast.   Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.   The second we stepped out of the lift and saw the dull brown depressing corridors, we nearly turned back.  Our room was tiny. A corner room with two queen beds, there was literally no space to move around the room, let alone store a suitcase! The decor was old and tired, the TV didn't work at all and the bathroom looked like something from an old movie.   Under no circumstances would I ever return to this hotel again. There are so many choices in Manhattan - do";2

The check-in was disorganized and we were late arrivals.  I can only imagine if you're there during peak hours.  We were called at 8:00 a.m. on departure day to remind us to check out.  When we went to the front desk we received a smile and were asked if we wanted our bill emailed.  I said yes.  WE STILL DON'T HAVE AN ITEMIZED BILL AND IT HAS BEEN FOUR DAYS.  (No reason was given why they felt the need to call us at 8:00 a.m.);2
Room provided very late after published check in time. Room then smelled very badly of strong carpet cleaning product. Breakfast terrible - harassed by multiple staff in regard what we were âentitledâ to eat. Far too much time spent up front by a total of 4 employees checking our room rate, age of kids, Hilton Honors membership level etc (which Iâm Diamond - so thanks for the standard fake recognition on that). When a family has young kids they just want to sit and enjoy their food - almost felt like I had to give the hotel my watch as a security deposit before we were allowed to consume any food.

I stayed in this hostel for 3 nights, the first thing I found wrong with this hostel was the window in my room was broken and you could not close it I was not to worried about this until the noise from the construction next door started, also this hostel advertises a kitchen where you can cook you own food but does not provide a single pot, pan, bowls, or cooking utensils (so if you plan to cook here you better bring your own pots and pans) also there is no free wifi you will have to pay Â£1 per hr to use it, the rooms has no TVs in them and the staff are unhelpful, I would not bother staying here.;2
This was my second time at the Empire and I was not impressed. It took the front desk 20 minutes to find a room that matched my reservation. I stayed in room 137 which really only had its size to recommend it. The room was very noisy with blowers outside of the window creating a loud white noise the entire night. The heating system made very loud knocks when it heated up, and desperately needs to be replaced. Several buttons on its control panel were not functioning. When I arrived at the room after the first day out, the bath matt had not been replaced, and the toilet not cleaned. Having really enjoyed my stay at the Empire several years ago, I was surprised at this negative experience. I didn't have the time to ask to switch rooms, but in my view there should be no rooms in a;2
We chose this hotel because of how close to Universal studios it was. We were coming into LA for one night from Anaheim to spend one day at Universal and the evening at the Halloween Horror Night and then the next day exploring LA.  We arrived quite early at around 9:30am so didn't expect to be able to check in because of the time. We were told we could for a $25 fee. We only had a backpack with us so declined and was told to come back at lunchtime and check in then.   We went to Universal and at lunch time returned and was told no the room isn't ready yet. So we walked back to Universal, and returned to the hotel at 4:30pm to have a rest before heading over for a night of horror :) When we arrived back to the hotel the lobby was packed, it was taking forever to check people in;2

"So here's a mid range hotel in the upper west - I usually stay midtown or around here... My go to hotels are the Parker Meridian, the Quinn , lately the ""One""- the very green hotel. So yes I get that for 300+ you are not going to get in nyc what you get in Savannah or even Napa or somewhere in Florida. But that price is typically what I pay at those other three.. (On my monthly visit to nyc)  . For some reason the Parker was jacked up this time so I decided to try the empire.   But seriously, this is a hotel that takes itself way too seriously. It's not terribly upscale, doesn't even aspire to being posh . But the lobby and bar think they are. I normally don't post unflattering pictures but in this case I have to.

It's a very basic hotel and if you use it as place to put your head down and shower you'll be OK it's dated and the staff in our case made no effort to be either courteous or pleasant but it is cheap and located round the corner from the subway and the lovely Manhattan diner.;2
I thought I'd get a place that would be all right, but not too good as it was priced fairly low with okay pictures. Compared to the other places I stayed in NYC, the standard was really low and the prices fairly high. There are way too many good alternatives in Manhattan to stay here.;2

This hotel is conveniently situated but the rooms, even double rooms, are small.  The furniture in the lobby is torn and run down.   But the worst part was that the female day manager was exceedingly rude.  She clearly should not be in the service industry.   She needs a job where she has no contact with customers.  Will never stay here again.;2
"Agree with the other reviews that the hotel location is great but...the rooms are pretty awful. I work in the hotel/luxury industry and so I have stayed in many similarly priced and rated hotels - this was a huge disappointment.   First of all, I had a view of other rooms from my window and there was barely any natural light in the room as a result.  The room was also small, run down and I heard the ""ding"" of the elevator all night and day long.  There was a fridge in an alcove with a curtain in front of it that was the only ""closet"" in the room. The gym is not really a gym but a hotel room that they put a few machines in (one of the two treadmills is actually broken right now).

"One would think that a hotel with such a name would positively represent the city, perhaps it does, the part that is over priced.  I don't mind a small room but mine is claustrophobic and I was alone. The bed had a distinct middle and it is as bare as any budget hotel. It can take 5 mins to get on and off the evelator. The tick tock diner has slow and rude service and provides unappetizing yet expensive breakfasts.  The bar is nice enough and certainly necessary after anytime spent in the facility. And speaking of such, it is under constant repair, and they even charge a ""facility fee of $29 a night, I guess that is for the nice towels? Good location but there are plenty of better choices in the area.";2

The hotel is very old and desperatly in need of a makeover, however, the bed sheets were very clean as was the mattress, the towels were also very clean and both were changed daily.  The carpet and curtains in the room were very old and were quite dirty, so take your slippers to walk about in.  Having given most of the bad points, I found this a good base, we didn't spend much time there anyway.  A taxi down into the heart of New York only costs $10 or there is the subway right out on Broadway only a 2 minute walk away.  You must try the City Diner whilst you are there, the;2

Let's start with the positives - this hotel is in a fantastic location, across the road from Central Park and in the lovely Upper West Side, also in walking distance to Harlem. The bathroom was nice, and most of the staff were friendly, especially Carlos the doorman!  On the down side - the windows are extremely poor quality, meaning that our street-facing room was both noisy and cold. Also, the lift broke while we were there and getting suitcases up and down the narrow stairs was almost impossible. With the amount of money they must rake in, they should really invest some of it in upgrading the hotel.  In addition, when we arrived we were told no double rooms were available, even though that was what we had booked, so we had to go in a twin room and change rooms the next day.;2

I booked this hotel based on other positive reviews. I can't speak for all of the rooms but the night we spent in 1130 was disappointing. (We had previously stayed at Parker Meridian. The experience was night and day but the price we paid was comparable).  On the day we arrived at the Empire they had a problem with turning the heat off and the 11th floor was a sauna.  The room was really exceptionally small to contain a king sized bed. It was very cramped to move around. It made a simple activity like getting dressed feel challenging.  The bathroom was like a very small powder room (not big enough for a bath tub just a shower). In front of the sink there was a load bearing pillar so that you couldn't actually stand in front of the sink but had to stand at the corner of the;2

We stayed at this hotel on Saturday 12/9/2017 in order to run a Â½ marathon at Central park the next day.  The plan was to get a good nightâs sleep  and not worry about driving in the morning as well as shower before heading back home after the race. Well, there was banging all night on the pipes, and around 3 in the morning when I called the front desk, I was told there was nothing they could do about it.  The bathroom also had roaches. We informed the front desk, and all we were told was that they will contact the manager. Never came up or called the roomâ¦nothing!!!!!!! Needles to say we also did not shower in there as planned. I understand that the price for this hotel is a lot lower than other hotels in the areaâ¦ we were not looking for frillsâ¦ we were looking for the basic,;2
Rooms are very small and noisy if on the street side. Not much here. The bar is way to loud if you have a child. They have a great outdoor area they could serve drinks and or apps and could draw a good crowd instead it's just seats and an empty bar. Very basic hotel. Nothing else really in the area and it's not a good safe area. My husband had business and we took our child. Ok but not a 3 star at all.;2
I arrived at the Astor on the Park Hotel (465, Central Park West, New York) at 10pm on Friday 2 June.  Very tired, hungry and having had a fractious journey from Newark Airport.  As I arrived a guest was remonstrating with the receptionist to the effect that 'she would not stay another night in this hotel'.  Alarm bells started to ring, made louder by the receptionist's comments that the hotel did not have room service.  The air conditioning unit in my room was so loud that I was unable to sleep for most of my 4 nights there. Even removing the plug from the socket would not stop it.  My complaints were met with a resigned shrug.  The unit was jammed into the bottom of a window, where the glass had been broken to accommodate it and, at the bottom, on both sides, there was clear;2
Establishment had falsely advertised prices I was charged $50 more than advertised Advertised price was a $129 charged price with a $179 restroom and entire suite was nowhere near as clean as other establishments I have stayed in before no trash can liners that I could see and the trash cans were microscopic not big enough to throw anything away. Connection from wall to fixture on toilet was rusty and disgusting looking as well as the shower did not look like it had been cleaned properly in quite some time with dark spots and light spots on the floor.;2

"We stayed here between 29 April and 4th May 2004 and to be honest when we arrived we were a little shocked and maybe expecting a little bit more, even though we only paid Â£399 each (inc flights). The hotel lobby is a complete dump and nothing like the carefully taken photo's on the website; there is some type of building work going on and a huge hole in the wall (maybe an old fireplace) was covered over with a sheet. The lifts are old, small and in need of an overhaul. We arrived at 12.30am after a long flight from the UK and were given room 413 and taken to the room by the security guard. Well, the room was nothing more than a dirty, disgusting bed sit. The bed was a put-you-up affair which had been roughly made, but not changed going by the biro scrawled all over the sheets.";2

Was on the main floor of a 3 day stay. Room was tidy and mostly clean. Great cable tv with flat screen. Thought it was odd that the touch up paint didn't match the finishing paint. Was disgusted that there were cobwebs on the ceiling, considering that was so easy to clean. Didn't appreciate the fluctuation between hot and cold while trying to have a shower. There was zero climate control. The walls are thin and it's very loud. When we put the sign on that we didn't want housekeeping they came in any way to clean which i think is disrespectful since we aren't messy people to begin with. Will we stay here again? Not a chance! Thanks for reading!;2
"I love the Chelsea area of Manhattan. The hotel was walking distance from The Whitney Museum, Chelsea Market and Google, all places I was visiting. However, upon dropping my luggage on the floor of my room, I ran back out into the hallway and asked the help where my bathroom was and she said ""Down the hall."" Bathroom facilities and showers were in an area shared by guests and weren't designated male or female. I know that many people are totally comfortable with this kind of arrangement, but I was not and it was not made clear when I booked the room that it did not come with a bathroom.";2
I am a native NYer and when I travel home it pains me to stay in a midtown hotel with tourists.  When I heard of YourStay, I quickly booked a room at the 73rd and Broadway location.  Good points:  If you want to live as the natives do, this is the best hotel for the experience.  The upper west side, where YourStay is located, is (in my mind) the best neighborhood in the city for a glimpse at NY living.  YourStay apartments is a minute from Fairway on Broadway and a few blocks from the famous H&H bagels and Zabars.  Walk up Broadway or across 73rd to Central Park or go the opposite direction to Riverside Park.  The Upper Westside is the best!    I rented a studio...was fine for me and I loved being able to shop and store my food.  A suite hotel room (with a refrigerator and;2

When we arrived our room was ready, but it was quite dirty. The bathroom had stains, especially the shower curtain. I was also charged an extra $200 when I checked in, and when I showed my receipt saying Iâd paid in full the man insisted. Weâd already paid, and I couldnât afford to go to another hotel. I just feel so ripped off.;2
"The place and the atmosphere among the travelers is quite ok, actually, and I found most staff nice. However, I will never ever go back there! The reason is that they decided to move me to another room without any notice at all (it was late so I had almost gone to bed already!). I protested that I had agreed to stay in that particular room, and therefore I felt I had the right to stay in that room till the end of the week I had paid for (they ""kindly"" showed me the room before I agreed to stay there but in the end that was completely useless because they threw me out of that room anyway). I was then told that I had no rights in that hostel, and I had to move right there and then. Well, at least I have the right to tell you guys that there are no rights there in that hostel.";2

For the most part this is a beautiful hotel but it could use a lot of upgrades beginning with the Elevators! The Elevators were off and on the whole time we were there. It was a whole process just to get out of the hotel. For such an iconic hotel the service and over all experience was a let down. They have a morning brunch on sunday that is $15 per person for a muffin and yogurt cup..not really ideal if you are on a budget but at the same time not terrible. The staff was rather rude and not helpful at all. The location is great its about a 5 min walk to central park and 15 minute walk to Times Square. I would not stay here again.;2

No remarkable perks or bonuses.  They charge to hold your bag, which at a budget hotel is ok I guess, but why not include that service in the facilities fee as it's about the only one I'll use?

I stayed with my family(totally 4 of us) in a non-smoking executive room last week. I booked this because the description said it can accomodate 4 but it turned out the beds are smaller than regular queen size and it was pretty bad to sleep on them for the four of us. On top of it, the bathrooms are the smallest ever i have stayed. It's suitable only for 2 people, it should be listed accordingly, pretty disappointing.;2
The hotel location and staff (from front desk to bellman to waiters) were great - but the hotel itself could do with some major upgrades. The fitness center is small, dark and cramped and one of the 3 treadmills was malfunctioning. The bathroom drains (both sink and shower) were sluggish and the room heater was unpredictable. Everything about this hotel was dark and dim.. which was probably a good thing so you don't notice your surroundings much.;2

I found out the Empire Hotel was 4 stars after my stay.  To say I was shocked is an understatement.  The rooms are dated, tacky, and dingy.  I.e. stains on the curtains, paint peeling on the walls.  Whoever selected the finishes didnât think about functionality.  For example, the shower is a hand held, modern, sleek cylinder.  It looks great but the shower spray shoots straight out and not at an angle so you have to hold the shower spray in one hand and bathe with the other.  Very annoying.  The air conditioning unit is the old floor model type.  It is VERY loud so itâs not good for light sleepers, not to mention it pumps cold air very intermittently so it is constantly kicking on and off and your room is rarely a consistent temperture.   When I left for a bit, the maid came in;2
Because of what their website declared, we happily stayed at The Jane Hotel the weekend of September 25th, 2021. It seemed funky, fun, very affordable, great location, had a rooftop bar/lounge over looking the river and a restaurant with great reviews which we thought would be convenient for  pre-theater apps and cocktails. Yes, the rooms with bunk beds are small but we didn't plan on spending much time in there. They were very clean as was the community bathrooms and entire hotel. However, upon arrival  we were told the rooftop lounge was only available & rented for special events and having  nothing to do with Covid, the restaurant had also been closed. You could order room service from a neighboring restaurant but wait time was one hour. The Ballroom which was presented on;2
First experience was the room. We were given a room at the back with a view of the hotel Laundry with big exhaust pipe emitting steam! After pleading/arguing we did a good room. We had topay two dollars for a bottle of water! which is complementary in most hotels.;2
The room was fine and undeniably conveniently located near the airport, with shuttle buses running every few minutes that drop you right near the hotel, and then pick you up from the entrance to take you back to the airport. There aren't many shops nearby so unless you want to pay quite a lot for the food in the lobby area, then be prepared to go for a walk. This wasn't an issue for us but might be for mobility challenged/less fit people. It was annoying to have to queue to check in and check out but all in all - the stay was fine. However, the post-stay customer service is appalling. In reporting an issue via Facebook (as they don't provide an email address - so the only way to contact them other than phone is via FB), and then multiple follow-up contacts with their staff, I;2
We had to ask/demand to move rooms as the first two were located next to a very noisy generator. We paid a lot of money to stay here and although the location was amazing, the rooms were not.

No-one should be put in a noisy room - ur entitled to a good night's sleep. We saw a lot of people complaining about the same issue - simply not good enough!;2

Good hotel location, walking distance to Universal Studios.  Hotel was quite dated but undergoing a facelift.  Sadly we didn't know this when we booked.  They had a temporary restaurant which was cramped and not very pleasant.    The elevators were also being refurbished/repaired which caused long waits at times so allow extra time or ask for a room on a low floor.     I am a Hilton Diamond member but was not given any upgrade on my room or even a third breakfast coupon for my daughter.  The receptionist snapped that my room was an upgrade (although it was what I had booked).  Another receptionist said they wanted to give me another coupon but Hilton corporate didn't allow them to do so.  When I said I had been staying in Hiltons all that week with no such issue he glossed over;2

The hotel was dirty--esp the bathroom. There was only room for a bed and desk. No mini-fridge as promised. (I spent very little time in the hotel, but still.) The check-in lady was extremely rude (but the check out man was very nice). The elevators are slow and even though they are divided, it takes forever to get one. If you are an upper floor like I was, you can take 30 flights of stairs down but going back up is a pain.   Tick-tock diner was a little overpriced, but the highlight of the hotel anyway. Open 24/7 with a really nice and friendly staff. Try the carrot cake!   In all, I've stayed at similarly priced hotels in better locations in Manhattan with better clearner rooms;2

I recently stayed at The Empire Hotel while I was running a training nearby.  If youâve gone to Lincoln Center before, youâve walked by this hotel! Itâs a great location, very easy to get to from a lot of things.  The experience Iâll detail below is atypical and much of what it was out of control of the hotelâs staff. There was an explosion/fire in the basement that caused power to go out and alarms to go off.    Iâll first comment on my general experience outside of the incident.  The hallways had a funky vibe with an interesting picture frame wallpaper.  The room was nice, it was mostly well designed with a decent amount of space for a hotel in NYC.  I had one queen size bed, with a work desk and a bench to put your suitcase.  There was a mini bar and a tray of goodies on the;2
Right, good bits first - the location is perfect for Uni Studios and Hollywood.  I have spent over a day considering my input to this site re this hotel, here goes - this s the worst Hilton I have ever stayed.  They charge you $20 a day and the car park is empty more often then not.  A disabled guy that I spoke had to get the LAPD to speak to the hotel to get them to drop parking charges for him!  Without boring you all too much with the details, the attitude of the management to my complaints was v poor in the extreme, the manager that I spoke to, Mr D, was so so supercilious and condesending, a real credit to Hilton......after a 20 min conversation re my view of his hotels shortcomings, his response was ' my staff tell me you do not have a car in the lot so why are you;2
They have a counter near the front desk where the people behind it are trying to get people to Wyndham timeshare presentations. The problem is they did not actually inform us exactly what they were selling! They advised us that we would be going to a new Wyndham hotel in New York and reviewing that hotel. There was nothing mentioned about selling timeshare. They say you will get breakfast so you think you will get a decent breakfast at the new hotel however you are taken to the Wyndham office and given an awful breakfast.  As for the New Yorker Hotel room we had, the hot water in the shower was weak and we could not dial out using the phone. Atleast we got 50% off the âresortâ fees for this. This is not a resort style hotel.;2
On two visits I requested early checkin but was told the room was not ready, in one case until 6pm. If I had  known I couldnât get into my room before 4-6pm I would have cancelled and gone to another hotel.   Late departure seems to have priority over early checkin, so I will not return to this hotel.;2
Old but semi-clean. Very small. No wash cloths or hand towels in our room.  No counter space or places to put toiletries.  No full size closet so if you need to hang dresses thereâs no where to hang them. 1/2 size ironing board but no where to place it to iron. Okay to hang Skirts and shirts.  Fridge in room was not cold.  There was a charging station in one room but not another room.  Very dark in hallways and rooms.  Great street view from room but only on street side. Ally side you can see into other rooms and brick wall with garbage.  No restaurant inside hotel, just next door. Many places to walk to. Central Park only a couple blocks away. I would not recommend children as it is very tight quarters.  Staff is friendly enough but doormen are awesome and helpful.;2
I donât know WHO waited on some of you people that RAVED about the staff, but I did NOT have a positive experience with one member of the staff.  First and fore most for those of you reading this review:  this property, even with its good location, is OVERPRICED.  By the time all the taxes, fees, and nonsense were added, my rate was over $55 per night higher than anticipated, and for the quality, and condition of the rooms, and halls, and lack of things, itâs not worth the price.  I booked through a travel site, MONTHS in advance, and am fairly certain I requested a room with a bath TUB, not just a shower. I walk a lot, have back and hip issues, and like to soak at the end of the day. In any event, even if I forgot that request on the initial booking, I was sent a note from the;2

we have just returned from a 5 day stay in the astor on the park, the staff were excellent,however we did have problems with the toilet in our room, but in all fairness the staff came to the rescue straight away Enrique was a hero!! the problem was not fixed so they moved us to another room which was no problem but we found the room too hot so we had to ask for the heating turned down, the room was very basic, but also very clean,and clean linen every day...we felt that it was a little out of the way,but could get the subway to where ever we wanted to go ,although i would not use them at night...we really enjoyed our stay in new york,and would go back to the astor,value for money.........;2
This hotel should be rated 3 star in best case scenario. It does not qualify for 4 star. The front desk is very irresponsible. They refused to call the member line to solve my issues. They told me that I have to call myself! Then I really did not need her for check in.;2

The room smells bad. Because of the courtain and the carpet, the mold smell was terrible. The hotel is good but they need to renovate the rooms and aisle and change the carpet and courtain. The bar, the reception, the service is very good.;2
All is clean here. But there just is understanding of what  makes a place feel welcoming. This is stone cold and uninspiring.  The food is terrible and there is zero flair anywhere to be seen. Will never stay here again and now I doubt i would ever choose any Hyatt again.;2
I wouldn't recommend this for a short-term NYC stay, but if you're staying for a longer period of time and looking for a cheap place, this is it.  We were only here for 2 nights, and I wish I spent the extra money to get a nice hotel.  That said, the location is great - very close to the subway and within a walkable distance to Central Park.;2

We arrived half an hour before check in and thought that we may be able to leave luggage or check in early however we were rudely told to go away and come back in half an hour.   When we returned, the staff were not any more polite, very rude and made it obvious that they did not want to be there. We were given our keys and given vague directions to our room.   Our friend's room was ready, however when me and my partner arrived at our room, it was still being cleaned and we were told to come back later.   When we finally got in our room, it was very basic which is understandable for the price, however it did not feel clean and there was a hole in the floor under the window.   We were disturbed very early in the morning by the cleaning staff as well as banging doors continuously;2
The Hotel is completely run down.  My room smelks like sewage and it has signs that it has been flooded maybe as all the furniture and doors show water damage at the bottom.   The AC is super loud and I cannot control it (No AC control).  WIFI is non existent.. It connects but it goes 1990âs slow.  I paid for 3 nights, this is my first and I will be moving out after today (first night) to a different hotel.  The floor corridors are super dark! I mean haunted house dark, and I suspect it is like this so people cannot realize how badly everything looks. The ONLY, ONLY thing great about this hotel is LOCATION.  That is it.  Forget about gossip girl and all that.  Sorry Empire but.. wowâ¦ BAD. Disclaimer:  This is not an angry review, I did not have an issue with hotel management or;2
Good location is the only reason to stay there. The room was small and poorly light. The bathroom was very small. There was basically no furniture except for the bed and and a small desk. There was a straight back chair with stains on it. There was nowhere to put your clothes so you basically lived out of your suitcase. The WI-FI did not work. This place was a real piece of work. I would never stay there again.;2
We chose this hotel as it was close to our connecting tour. We couldn't recommend this hotel however as it was dirty, tired, service was unhelpful as  they didn't offer us much help even though we had travelled some 30 hours after a long flight .Reception didn't seem to care about making us feel welcome just want your money. We would have loved to have had breakfast there before going about our day. The saving grace is so very handy to china town and little Italy which is what we came to see.;2
Stayed for one night in November 2018 (reservation was for two nights).  I booked this hotel because of its convenient location to Penn Station and decent rate.  In this case, I learned I was really getting what I paid for.  When I checked in, another guest was checking out and complaining about brown water coming out of the faucet.  My room seemed well appointed, although I found a window that was letting cold air in and would not shut.  Maintenance came and fixed this problem.    In the morning, I turned on the shower, hopped in, and noticed brown water flowing down my body (I wasn't that dirty).  Same problem with the sink (see attached photo).  The hotel offered me another room, which I probably would have accepted had it not been for another guest complaining of the same;2
Unfortunately the location was the best feature. I forgive them the very small rooms and ridiculously small bathroom. I don't forgive the fact that the shower wasn't clean and didn't drain or the rooftop pool which is the size of 2 baths or the exorbitant prices of the mini bar and non complimentary coffee.;2
Good location near MSG and Penn station. The hotel has a number of floors/rooms occupied by students wasnât expected by us. We are finding it difficult to sleep on a night due to noise from the windows you canât avoid as a room swap did not cure the issue. Corridors and lifts need a refurb.   Donât believe the 4* talk itâs more like a British 2 star hotel. Disappointed could be much nicer. Can fault staff.;2

We stayed at the Hilton for the first 2 nights of our California vacation. We checked in on Saturday May 26th. Our flight arrived early so we attempted to check in early which we had requested. The clerk was very rude when we tried to check in telling us that check in time was 3:00 and check out time was at 12:00. (We tried to check in around 11am) She rudely told us their were no rooms available, that the guests had until 12 to check out and that we could go to the park and try back later. I wasn't upset that we couldnt check in early I was upset about the way I was told I couldn't. We did go to the park and tried to check in around 4:30pm. The new clerk told us at first their were no rooms available, mind you we had pre-paid for our reservation. I started to get angry because;2

Key system at check in not working, housekeeping didnât service the room, and water was not working in bathroom or hotel...you could be great but...  Movrad the bellman went above and beyond to accommodate and assist! The hotel must be brought up to par. The view was nice, we were able to walk everywhere. Could not take a shower due to water being unavailable in the hotel. We were out all day and returned to no housekeeping. Christy at the front desk made attempts to make it right.

First we had to switch rooms a total of 3 times. The first room had rust in the bathroom which means it's old and needs to be replaced. The second room had a huge stain on the floor and it smelled really bad. We settled for another room because I really didn't feel like going to every room in  the hotel to find one that I liked. There's no hot water most of the time it only gets warm and you have to leave it on for a while for it to even get warm. The room was cold apparently someone left the window open. The engineer put tissue in the window by the ac to keep cold air from getting in, WHAT? The room keys stop working after a while and you have to keep getting new ones.

Communication is lacking at this hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the valet attendant. He asked if we wanted to valet and we said no due to the price stated. We were told self-parking was available and we were only allowed to park up front for 15 minutes for check in. We checked in and was never informed about self-parking. We self-parked and upon leaving for a reservation, we were told that we had to pay to leave. We explained to the attendant that we were guests at the hotel and we were told we had to park our car and go inside the hotel to fill out a form. Being that we were running behind for a reservation, we paid to $20 to exit. We also paid an additional $20 the following morning to leave for a flight. We paid $40 in less than 24 hours for parking.

The shower cubicle could have done with a good scrub and appeared dirty along with the bedroom floor! No security safe in room, no lift, corridors very narrow and no room to do anything in our room. Literally just sleep and go.   The aircon unit appeared seemed to be jury rigged into the window as a result let a lot of noise through the window and itâs vents. The street was right below and as a result we heard the loud sirens and traffic go by during our stay!;2
Iâve never checked into a hotel were the reception staff put the pressure on to upgrade basically telling you on arrival your room is small and you should up grade for a more suitable one !  We did not upgrade Thankgod as it would of cost another 130 odd dollars ! The room on the 22 floor was actually ok to be fair but the shower was awful. At best a warm mist came out in the morning and by 7pm only cold water was available, luckily we were only staying for three nights.   The door staff were lovely and the tick tock dinner meal and staff really great.  However lasting impressions again of reception staff who seemed to not want to give back a room desposit of an upgrade we did not have. This was sorted in the end and I will be keeping an eye on my credit card to make sure ! We;2

This hotel has a modern look however there were cleanliness issues. During our stay we had blood on our sheets on our first night. There was immense dust on windows and drapes. In addition one day the housekeepers did not clean our room even though the sign was left on the door indictating service was needed. It also took 2hours to have some slippers and a robe sent to our room and it took several calls to have these items brought to our room even though we were promised the items on every call. Moreover, we had electrical problems with the outlet in the bathroom. (The electrical issues were resolved after a service man from the hotel opened up the outlet to expose the wiring and determined the wiring was done incorrectly) and the wallpaper in the room was bubbling. The staff;2

"First, buyer beware of the fine print. There is a $30 ""facilities"" fee per night.  Doesn't matter if you plan to use any facilities. This is not optional. It is also not clearly disclosed when you book. Since this is not optional, it should be included in the price. Anything else is a gimmick to lure in consumers based on misinformation about prices. I expected better from Wyndham. Second, the rooms are tiny and were last renovated in the 1960s. The corridors are plain miserably and a bit scary. We needed a mini-fridge for medications (an additional $20 by the way) and now we have to jump over it to get in and out of bed. Not impressed.

Good location.  Red Line 1 subway station across the street.  But hotel is under exterior renovation.  Scaffolding covers entire building. Twelve story hotel.  Of the four tiny elevators, only one, sometimes two, were operational.  Other two were completely shut down.  Wait time on 6th floor for elevator often took 20 minutes.  Room was tiny with single double bed with mattress that folded in the middle.  Had to have toilet plunged upon arrival and again in 12 hours.  No parking at the hotel.  Advised that there were 24/7 parking lots near by.  Both were full at 4pm on Saturday.  No place to park unless you could find a spot on a near by street.  One lot a half block away, while full, wanted $44 a night for one entry and exit. All for a reduced price of $172 a night.  Will I;2
I stayed at the Days Braodway for 5 nights at the begining of November 06.. The hotel is situated uptown and has nice resturants around it- its a little far out of time square (15-20 mins on the subway)..and away from the normal tourist places but i suppose it depends what you want out of you stay.. The hotel is having work done at the moment and looks very scruffy.. We asked for an renovated room- if what we had was newly removated then i would not like to see what the old rooms are like... The room was small and also its almost impossible to controll the temperature- either too warm or cold.. The lifts are horrid and look like they are going to break down. The carpets are scruffy. The maid changes sheets and towels daily although they dont vacume at all- not very good. Overall;2

Iâll get a couple positives out of the way, hence the 2 star review: -great location -comfortable bed -nice lobby  Now for the rest: -I understand part of this hotelâs appeal is the retro/Art Deco vibe, but literally nothing was updated or in good condition. Iâve stayed in plenty of hotels that trade in nostalgia and have been much nicer and better kept up.  -tiniest hotel room Iâve stayed in in a long time. Just a bed and a narrow walkway to the bathroom.  -Not nearly enough towels provided. Found this out the hard way when I was dripping wet and my husband had to call down for more towels. Took almost an hour for them to be delivered.  -the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. This means after you shower the whole bathroom and everything in it is literally dripping wet from the;2
The location of this hotel was convenient for the metro to Universal Studios and Hollywood Bouelvard.  However, it was not a fantastic area.  There were homeless people and I didn't feel entirely comfortable.  That said, I was in no way threatened at any time.  The rooms were fine but nothing special.  Bathroom was tiny.  We could just about see the Hollywood sign from our room.  The breakfast was an added bonus but you will have to pay for parking - $12 p/day.  For a couple of nights whilst you do the Hollywood sights it is fine.;2
Kind of a unique location on the upper upper West Side. Although not centrally located, it's proximate to great sections of the park and subway lines. The staff was helpful with requests (iron, deli locations, etc.), the halls were threadbare with crumbling plaster and chipped paint and the room was the darkest and most claustrophobic I've encountered in my 30 years of living in and now visiting Manhattan. It seemed more like a $150 hostel slot than a $350 economy room. Tub was repaired with some sort of epoxy that had raised and blackened into an organic looking form, but the room was otherwise reasonably clean. I'm sure a CP view room in the front would have proved to be a better experience than our air-shaft portal, but this was by far the worst $300 - $400 room we have had;2
"The only pros of this hotel are the location and friendly doormen/valets. However, the location is also a con. Because this hotel is located between 3 very busy streets, it is very noisy 24/7. Yes, it is a city, and I am use to city traffic/noise; however, this was non-stop blasting car horns and trucks. While the traffic is outside the control of the hotel, the hallway noise was an issue as well; there is a large gap under the door - as a result, every noise in the hallway was amplified. The biggest problem I had with Empire Hotel is the cleanliness. The carpets had dust balls, especially near the edge of the bed and curtains. The bathroom floor was not clean, nor were the tiles in the shower. It looked like the cleaning staff did a quick wipe down of the room. Unfortunately,";2
Stayed at this Hotel December 8th till the 12th. Convenient location for Subway and walking distance to Central Park. Convenience store on the corner was handy and Star Bucks, Subway in close proximity. Asked and paid for newly renovated room but was far from it. Room outdated and small. Not enough towels supplied for 3 people so had to ask which was supplied. Checkin /check out was done easy. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms lacked ventilation so in Summer would have to have aircon on to circulate room. Would be a problem if Aircon didn't work.  Generally ok but nothing fantastic. I had hoped for more for my dollar but maybe that is just New York. Would stay hera again if nothing else available.;2
We stayed here for 10 nights. Not your average hotel stay. There were 2 of us. Iâve stayed here before but not for 10 nights. For nostalgic reasons and the history of this hotel is why we stayed here. We asked for additional towels which were provided but then were taken away from us days later while we were out for the day. At 6am each morning the smell of food woke us up. Not sure where it was coming from since there is no room service at this hotel. We had a nice view on the 35th floor but for 2 people the room was small. When asked if we could move to another room with more space I was told ânoâ. We moved furniture into the closet to make more space. The water temperature in the shower ran too hot or too cold. It fluctuates on its own. The sheets were not changed once the 10;2
We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days in December. Our room was tiny, the size of a walk-in closet. The first night, we woke up at 6:30 am to two employees bickering loudly next door. The second day, we returned to the hotel at around 11:30 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes (as if someone has smoked in our room). On our last day, as I was brushing my teeth, the water from the sink came out BROWN. This is the most disgusting experience Iâve ever had at a hotel. I am very surprised this happened at a 4-star hotel.   Putting all of this aside, the room smelled bad in general, the bathroom was dirty, and the TV didnât work properly. Safe to say I will never stay at this hotel again.;2

Letâs start off with the following, for a month prior to our stay not only did I, but also our travel agent tried emailing both reservations and concierge on multiple occasions to arrange an upgrade, bizarrely no one got back to either of us. When we arrived, check in asked for my credit card which I assumed was for bond...however Iâve now just found that my card has been deducted over $475 AUD in addition to the already $2300 AUD we paid for a weeks stay.  This is not acceptable, a charge like this should be discussed properly before charging someoneâs credit card.   This room was seriously the smallest hotel room I have stayed in (smaller than my own bedroom at home). As a couple we have two suitcases, there was barely any room to store them which resulted in them being in the;2

The hotel room was clean and the housekeeping was very good. However the rest of the hotel was extremely poor. There was an awful smell in the corridors and carpets were dirty and stained. Walls were marked and the hotel needs to be renovated. I wouldn't stay here again.;2
This place is kind of a dump, especially for the price. There were three channels on the tv, the phone didn't work and I could not get a signal on my phone cell phone. All the furniture was beat up and the walls were peeling. The only heat consists of a radiator from the 1920's that smells and makes noise when turned on. The is no way to regulate the temperature of the shower despite attempts to adjust the hot and cold knobs. The towels are basically card stock. I booked directly through the property and paid an exorbitant rate only to be place in one of the worst rooms.;2
Uh, so, if I had been actually planning on spending any time in this room, I would have been extremely disappointed and likely requested a refund. It was just me, and I mean...the shower worked, the door locked, and the bed was alright, but my room was extremely run-down and a little bit scary, to be honest. If a couple booked into this hotel and expected a romantic getaway or something, they'd likely just be trying to getaway from this room entirely! Yikes.  The staff were nice and polite, though. It's not their fault! This place just needs a massive overhaul. But location-wise, it can't be beat, so why would they fix it up, y'know?;2

we were told that we had been upgraded. i would hate to see the standard room. broken elevators (over 1 year), strange layout & very poor lighting. our view was another building. no drawer space, we lived out of the suitcase.;2
"Good location and overall amenities. Poor room furnishings: the bathroom door was misaligned and wouldn't shut; same with the double door between the bedroom and the living room; a bedside table and lamp were missing; the living room couch tilted forward, making it impossible to rest on it; the unit was not well lit.";2
Our room was not very clean.  Furniture looked updated but was worn.  Bathroom was clean and updated, except for the worn toilet seat (paint rubbed off).  We were on the first floor as to avoid the small, slow elevator.  Overall, the price for Manhattan is great.  But you get what you pay for.  Extremely basic and shabby.  Old mattresses (had double room).  The size of the room is typical NY- small (but I expected that). The location is nice in that it is right across from the park and very quiet, but the trains are slow (wait time b/w trains is bad) on weekends making it somewhat time consuming to travel downtown.  Overall, I didn't find it a very efficient place to stay if you're planning on being everywhere but the UPPER west side (back and forth travel is WAY too time;2
The room I stayed in was pretty old and the bathroom was the smallest I've ever been in (and yes, I have stayed in other NYC hotels before).  The shower nozzles weren't properly installed or sealed which is challenging in that bathroom.  They don't give you a thick comforter or extra blankets so be prepared for that.  And housekeeping doesn't bother to turn off the alarm the prior guest set so be aware.  But the location is good and it was really cheap so that makes up for it a litt.e;2
Great location.   Staff were rude and generally unhelpful apart from the one young lady on reception.   Toilets smelt of urine. Poo stain on the wall for the whole duration we were there.   Shower knob not secure and kept falling off whilst showing which hurt my toe!!  Doors really heavy and slammed by guests would wake you up during the night.  Breakfast was poor. Limited supplies. Get there within the first 10 mins of opening or nothing left.  Bed was comfortable but left with bites on my body...   If more effort was put into the upkeep of this place, it could be really successful.   Would I stay again? No.;2
Pros: awesome location, quiet, and very clean- the housekeepers do an excellent job  Cons: Extremely shabby rooms with old, uncomfortable full size beds with cheap bedding and 90s TVs. Showers are terrible and there is no space in the bathroom to get ready. Rooms are small with old stained carpets and extremely dated furniture. The hotel posts photos of a few renovated rooms to trick you into booking and does not offer refunds when you discover the true state of the rooms. Wifi does not work in the rooms in the stairwell- they end with 09.;2

When I complained I got an ""IÂ´m sorry but thereÂ´s nothing I can do for you except notify housekeeping"".  There was a lack of hospitality from the front desk staff, very ""friendly unhelpful"".

My wife and I booked New York for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  We booked the New Yorker hotel as it's somewhere my wife had always wanted to stay and with it being an iconic hotel in New York and it's skyline.  Upon arrival to the hotel, at the check in desk we were met by a very rude lady who told us that in addition to the resort / facility fee of $32 a night, we also needed to hand over a credit card for them to hold a further $400 to be held as a security deposit in case of damage to the room. When we said that all of our money is in cash, they said that if we wanted to pay this in cash they would charge up to $900?!? We advised that this was our spending money so they agreed to reduce this to $475 which was a massive chunk of our spending money. Excellent service (NOT).;2

Besides the grate location the are no other pros.. Cons: - old furniture, cranked and wobbly bathroom tiles, no view (#202) - on arrival@3am they gave us a used room, had lots of ordered food recipients...  gave a very weird feeling. Had to switch rooms.  Clean towels. Clean bed.;2
"Amazing location, right across from Lincoln center so very accessible to the subway as well. Location is the only thing that's worth it, yeah the lobby is cool and it feels nice to say that you stayed at the iconic ""Empire"" hotel, but still not worth it. We were surprised by the fact that there was never anyone at the door to open the door or help us with our luggage when we arrived. We bought a pizza from a restaurant close by and it got cold and we asked if someone could just heat up a few slices and in-room dining said no because they didn't want to be ""responsible for anything that happens to the food,"" which makes no sense to me since you can't really screw up heating up a slice of pizza. That's impossible, even a 10 year old can do that. I asked the front desk as well and";2

I found the hotel to be very noisy - our first night was Saturday, and as has been experienced by other users it was door slamming all night. The room itself was neat, and well turned but with 2 double beds in the room the cat was unableto be swung. The bathroom had obviously been flooded before and the had employed 'Barney the Bodger' to reseal all areas. If he had just used one colour of sealant it would have been a bad job, but where the 'touch ups' had been completed with another colour made it look very shoddy.  They expereinced extreme lift reliability issues during our short stay - of the 4 residents lifts, 3 were out of service for most of one day. You had the option for using the service lift, but was cumbersome coming back down when you could easility get lost. The;2
Ok, I like the Hyatt Regency. I like the rooms here, and I think most of the folks here are nice. I even stayed for a Summit which I think was handled well, and, although it's next to the airport, I can't really hear the planes.   But, and it's sorta a big but, with the hotel super busy on a Saturday night, we had to call downstairs more than twenty times to reach an operator--and guess what--we didn't reach one. When I went downstairs, the woman at the desk testily said she was working alone on the phone, but why? There were tons of other folks around. And she was none too apologetic about it.  So the hotel is right next to an airport, and they have a free shuttle. That's great. But, and it's another sizable but, they can't tell you WHEN IT RUNS. Yes, every 15-20 minutes, but;2
When booking my trip I purposely didnât go for the cheapest hotel as didnât want to stay in a dive. The pictures I donât feel the pictures online accurately represent the rooms provided. Location is good, lobby is nice but the rooms are sub standard. There was a lot of cracked paint, wall paper coming off the wall and day before I left noticed marks on the door frame to the bathroom which looked like mould. Deposit debited from my account multiple times and water stopped working on the last day so couldnât have a shower.New York is a great city, just a shame the hotel let it down.;2

We are two girls in our twenties and stayed in this hotel from the 23rd-27th January 2008.  We would not consider this a good location for girls travelling on their own as you need to get the sub or a taxi into town due to the distance and would not walk around the neighbourhood at night.     The room was an average size but when lying in our beds they were on a slope - very interesting! We also were awoken with a darfader like sound coming from the heating system followed by a loud banging sound, but gave out no heat so we were freezing!    Overall the room was clean and we would have to agree with other reviews the bathroom was the best feature, BUT on our last night when entering the bathroom we were greeted with something neither of us owned in the toilet!!!  We had to call;2
Very basic accommodation, shared bathroom had poo smeared on the sink. The Tv was wonky and there was a constant smell of Cannabis in the corridors and faeces smear on the sink in one of the shared Bathrooms that didn't get cleaned for several days The Tv was wonky on its stand. The breakfast offering was Coffee and Cookies. Overall would never stay here again. That said it is very close to broadway and a lot of good local eateries and subway. I'm giving one extra rating for location purely otherwise would have been a terrible.;2

we were put in a superior triple room with private bath...the most expensive unit offered.  it was on street level in the front of the building so you heard all the noise, smelled the smoke through the AC.  the beds were horrible, felt like coils.

We stayed at the hotel based on positive reviews but our experience was disappointing. The room was dark, hot with no view, despite paying over $300 per night. The only positive was the location. We did not have any issues with the staff as some have indicated.;2
This hotel was a huge disappointment.  I read all the wonderful reviews before booking and was really excited about my stay.  The rooms are dated and overpriced for what you get.  Vent system is very noisy.  It is a trecherous hike to Universal, especially with children.  No sidewalks.  If you are visiting Universal and simply looking for a room to sleep in, stay at the Comfort Inn on Highland Ave. and pay the $9 to park at Universal City.  Comfort Inn is about $80 per nite and is beautiful.  Everything is brand new and the basic rooms are very large, especially for a family.  Hollywood walk of fame is nearby.  I was very impressed.  Best deal you will find in all of Los Angeles.  I am a Hilton Diamond Member...trust me!;2
So, there is a bed and a shower. But that's about it. The clerks are as friendly as the usually are in London. Not.  The room seems clean but i found a q-tip that was not ours, and the floors were dirty.  The blinding does not cover the entire window, so by 6:00h it was bright. The fridge smelled of chees even though we never had chees in it, and if someone in the hallway or the next room talked, you understood every word. And as a topping: our room was directly over the smokers area. Do whenever people smoked we had to close our window. I would advice you to ask for a room that isn't into the back jard.   On the plus side: we've seen worse in london and the hostel is located close to the hammersmith station.;2

I will not recommend this hotel. The best I can say is that it is located in an interesting neighbourhood close to Central Park and the subway. The rooms are worn down and shaggy with filthy/greasy carpets. Cleaning is mostly OK, but it is hard to tell because everything is so worn down. Some rooms have been renovated recently but even these are sub-standard and seem like they need to be renovated. Beds were small but mattresses OK. Air condition worked. TV was a joke. Security box worked. Bathroom worked OK, although I found the water to be suspiciously luke (with potential for legionnaire's disease). The hotel is generally noisy. The guests seem to be a weird mix of little-knowing tourists, long-term residents and low-lifes. The hotel desk was OK and helped us switch room when;2

The hotel is need of a facelift.  The furnishings are old and worn, and the overall feel is dark and musty.  Our rom had insufficient power outlets (2), no full length mirror and a dangerous step into the bathroom.  There is no complimentary coffee or wi-fi in the rooms.  The saving grace of the hotel is it's fantastic location;2
It is embarrassing that a name as the Empire Hotel feels like a 2 / 3 star hotel. You should revisit pricing and upgrade structure. This has been the worst price quality match I have ever received. I strongly suggest not to use this structure;2
"First off, three of the four elevators for all the 12 floors where not working. This meant that if you were staying at the 11th floor, as i was, you would have to take the stairs. And if you absolutely had to take the elevator, you would have to make a line of about 15 min. The managers weren't in and didn't care, one of the staff members told me: ""we already called the engineers, anyway my shift ends in 30 min so it's not my problem"" A family member of mine was staying in this hotel as well with a large group (about 20 people) and they gave them the worst rooms because of the large number of people eventhough they had made the reservations months ago.  There are cochroches in the rooms.  Terrible room service. The hotel was way too full. They made us wait 5 hours to get our";2
"This was the hotel for our conference, so I stayed here for the group rate and convenient location. I checked out after the first night, two nights early.  I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor. The curtains had visible dirt on them. I woke up with a sinus headache and a cough that disappeared after I left the hotel. There was a coffee maker in the room but the wanted you to ""enjoy a cup of coffee for $3.50""!!? The makeup mirror in the microscopic, shower only, dirty looking bathroom would only be of use if you stood on the toilet or were 7 feet tall. They were nice so I couldn't do the lowest rating, but the place is yucky. A friend had a live cockroach in his room. Not sure if they charged him for the extra guest or if the roach had any coffee...";2
This hostel was cheap, and itâs located near a tube station. So it feels central, even though it is in the outskirts of central London. The room was clean during our stay but the comfort was very low, we had read on trip advisor that some visitors did not find the rooms clean at all, but other than some dirty corners, the room was clean enough. The rooms are really cramped, and the beds are horrible, they were constructed of two mismatched boxes with a mattress on top of it, so we had to sleep in at a slant. I would not recommend this hostel for a longer stay, but if you need to stay 1 or 2 nights in London it is survivable.;2
Comfortable bed. Good location near to CP and subway.  Cold shower (for few hours thanks to boiler problems), Small swimming pool, small sink, nooo wifi, old airconditioning, broken handshower clip, short bed, rooftop at night often reserved for private parties.

Once we got to the room it was small...very small and not at all what we had before. We received a Alcove room. We mentioned this to the hotel operator and got no response.

I know your building is about 100 years old, but do your rooms need to look like they have never been renovated all that time???

"As we arrived to check into this hotel, we couldn't believe the line for check in. Apparently a flight had been cancelled and everyone was waiting to get a room. There was no indication that those that already a room could get service in another area. It was only thanks to the valet that we didn't stand in that line and were able to check in. We got to our room and I immediately noticed our bathroom wasn't fully cleaned. It was set up as though it was, but you could see there was still spots and dust on the back of the toilet. The bed was comfortable and we slept okay until about 7:30am when the housekeepers were slamming doors as they ""cleaned"" other rooms. They had no regard for other sleeping rooms around them.

Stayed at the Ameritania a couple times the past month. First stay was good. Check-in staff was indifferent and clearly not too interested about being friendly or anywhere to close to it.

Location, like everyone has mentioned is absolutely perfect. Close to Times Square, all the food, shows, subway, etc.   My second stay started on a high note.

He also took the chance to welcome me back to the hotel, little things like that make a lot of difference.  The;2

We booked the Morningside Inn as it was somewhat cheaper that the downtown accommodation, but this turned out to be a huge mistake.   The hotel was a considerable distance from all the main New York attractions, and any savings made in the cost of the room were swallowed up by the cost of transportation.  The neighbourhood (a Mexican Spanish speaking neighbourhood) itself is quite interesting, but it was two or three days before we felt entirely comfortable to walk about and make the short trip to the nearest Subway station at Cathedral Parkway, on Broadway between W 109th  and W 110th Streets.   The hotel itself is on W 107th, a pleasant street, and is flanked on one side by a very impressive church and on the other by a building housing a project for unemployed people. The;2

Having hit the toilet so many times, the door was falling apart And the toilet moves as it is not secured to the floor The bathroom magnifying mirror was filthy and rusty When turning the shower on, through the opening where a shower door should be, it sprays freezing water making it unavoidable because of the poor design.

the positives: for so much sharing of restrooms and showers itâs clean.  The rooms are tiny but also clean.  Josephine at the front desk is so lovely and helpful.  She was one of the few friendly people there.    The negatives: Noah who is a manager and also works in the cafe is incredibly rude and unfriendly.  He gives off a really bad attitude -I would recommend staying away from him unless you want to be treated like shât.    Personally I will never stay in a hotel like this again, basically a glorified hostel.  I cannot stand sharing showers with random men.  I would go in to use the shower and thereâs an old man in a robe.  Very awkward and uncomfortable.    Granted itâs cheap for the location but again I will never make this mistake ever again to save a few bucks.;2
The location next to the Met is excellent but there are many negatives to the hotel. This sounds minor but with no coffeemaker in the room one has to get dressed, etc just to get the first cup of coffee. At that price point WiFi should be included but it is $13/day. With the Lincoln Center location was hoping this would be a high class experience with maybe operatic or classical music in the background but found instead a poor mix of music in the lobby and too loud. The breakfast buffet, which we skipped, at $26 was the poorest we have seen in a major hotel and doesn't remotely approach some that have many hot entrees, instead of just 3, and include items such as lox, assortment of cheeses, house made pastries, etc. Apparently many people feel the same as the dining room was;2
My daughter and I came in for the night, the front desk  were accommodating, however the room was not I expected. This is an older hotel- desperate for renovations, sheets were stained and the manager apologized, It was late so we asked for extra sheets and made the bed ourselves.;2
Great location for Universal park and red metro into Hollywood. Checked in found crumbs on the coffee table. Attempted to order room service on the 4th call placed order then 30 min later informed that they did not have what I had ordered. I ordered a pizza not really that hard to make. Internet is $7.95 for 24 hours. Most hotels that I stay at don't charge for Internet access and if they do it's not this extreme. The staff are friendly and professional. Parking charge too high.

My family and I had a terrible time at this hotel. Came here to leave a review to warn others about staying here, and am shocked people are giving this place 5 starsâdid we stay at the same hotel?  Check-in: This was fine and went mostly normally. I rolled up with a large family of 6. I asked if the room would sleep 6 people and the person at the counter said âYes, the room allows 6 people based on the fire codeâ. Upon going into our room, we found that it only slept 4 people, so we had to go pay some extra money for additional rollaway beds. We stayed on the second floor.  Pros: This hotel is located close to Universal Studios and thereâs a cool little outside patio area you can sit and relax at. Housekeeping comes and makes the bed every day. There are ice machines on every;2

The only good thing about this hotel is the location: on the border between Chinatown and Lower East Side, it is also close to a subway station and it has some shops and basic restaurants close by.   The hotel itself is very poor and extremely expensive for what it offers. Last June, I paid US$ 230 (taxes included) per night for a double room which was really poor. Although clean, it was sloppy and careless: the chair was full of stains, the furniture was partially ruined, the blanket of one of the beds was ripped off, paper of the wall was peeling and the shutter of the window was half-broken. Moreover, there was no double glazing on the windows and so it was rather noisy. The room was tiny, almost without space for the luggage and two persons.  It was the worse relation;2
Dingy place with poor service and extremely small room to the point where I had trouble finding a spot to set my suitcase down. and Worst of all the fitness center was out of towels, hand sanitizer, water and had two dead cockroaches. I went and told the front desk staff and they said OK not I'm sorry for your experience, I'll handle that right away,etc.;2
I was very excited when my man Seamus decided to whisk me away to New York for a few days this August to celebrate our anniversary! Being the good Samaritan that he is, he also invited my sister Leslie and her husband Fergal. Let's just say that the excitement which had been coarsing through my veins took a turn for the worst as soon as we stepped foot in the building! After a long flight from Terminfeckin Ireland, we were very tired when we reached the hotel at 2am. The receptionist glanced at us as we stumbled in the entrance in a way that you would only glance at a fly in your Chardonnay! This was an initial turn-off and we couldn't understand his condescending attitude as we weren't exactly in the Ritz. Anyway, if anyone looks at my sister Les sideways she will put them in;2

All day I enthusiastically walked the city with family members, and was so looking forward to a hot, relaxing bath, and then some rest. My feet and calves ached. The tub stopper did not work. Could I try a foot soak in the sink? No.There was no sink stopper. Hot showers did not stop the muscle spasms, and so I had a sleepless night. Such a shame, because everything else about the city and my contacts there had been perfect.;2
To be fair, I had the smallest possible... To really put it in perspective of how small the rooms are, a man under 6 ft could touch both walls width wise (easily) at the same time. The room was about half the size of an average walk in closet, maybe 7 feet, by 3.5 feet. Community bathrooms on each floor (with a bit of a line). If you're young, on a budget, and don't care about sharing a bathroom with 60 other people, this is for you!;2
4 issues- first billing - I stayed 1 night hotel and when I checked My credit card was preauthorized for the standard $50 for incidentals (as room was paid in full in advance $343 for 1 night).  That day I knew I would be charged the $28 for self parking  Then the next morning (the day I was checking out) They (without telling me) ran a second preauthorization for $130.80, while the $50 was still on hold. I asked them about this and they said the computer decided since I had the $28 parking, it had to up the hold, but they didn't only up it, they reauthorized - so now I had $180.80 in preauthorizations for the day I was checking out (with only being a 1 night visit).  When I checked out I was told my total charges were $80.94 for parking and the breakfast that morning.  Well;2

"About the only thing the Empire has going for it is location. Check in was chaotic, although the clerk was quite friendly. Both the corridor leading to our room and our supposedly ""superior"" room itself were dark and dingy. The main overhead light in the room had only 1 of 3 bulbs working, and the three-way lamp had only one setting, presumably the dimmest, working. There was no full length mirror in the room, and if there was a coffee pot, I never found it. The doormen were friendly, if a bit informal. We met friends for drinks after the opera in the lobby bar and the waiter was surly. But, if you're attending something at Lincoln Center and/or want to be near the number 1 line of the subway, you won't find anything more convenient.";2
If you need to stay here for the location then go ahead.  It's a great spot just outside of the hustle and tourists of Times Square.  Otherwise it's just a tiny outdated room with unremarkable staff and unattentive customer service.  After our keys didn't work after checking in we were greeted by a tiny HOT room.  Hot because they didn't turn on the air conditioning and there is no thermostat in the room.  Also the room was tiny and we actually paid extra and got talked into an 'upgraded' room.  I hate to think of what the other room would've looked like.  The room and bathroom are so small we couldn't fit the crib they brought us without creating a fire hazard.  We were across from a storage room so there were a bunch of unsightly boxes right in front of our door for both;2

This was my 2nd stay at the New Yorker within 12 months. My first visit was fairly pleasant in December 2018, I was checked in by the manager at the time, who without asking reduced the facilities fee to $15 per night, as I was staying for 7+ nights which was a very well received gesture, however, the room I stayed in was not up to standard. Cold with an unreliable shower, dirty carpet and unpredictable aircon/heating but as this was my first visit didn't think much of it as I spent little time in the hotel.   My second trip as of last week (Jan-Feb 2020) unfortunately will be my last.

Bad Experience. We were disappointed on arrival at the hotel (10/7) to be told that the pool was closed firstly for bad weather, then for maintenance an indefinite period (maybe I think they will not open it until next year) Needless to say that for our entire 8 night stay we were unable to use the pool, especially as it was quite hot in NY during our stay. The gym was also closed.  Despite the Staff at hotel were very kind and friendly our rooms didn't get cleaned for 2 days despite putting the please make up my room sign out very early in the morning.

Clearly this hotel spent the budget on the lobby and rooftop restaurant and skimped on upgrades to the rooms. Staff are really nice and helpful which makes up for a lot and the bars in the lobby and rooftop are really nice but the rooms are nothing more than poor.;2
I stayed in this hostel with a friend in a private room for a week and a half in late October/early December. The room was like a box, absolutely no room for storage, it's also about 100 degrees in the room and the heating can't be adjusted. The bathroom is atrocious, you have to push a button every 20 seconds for water to drip out of the shower. Location is handy for a lot of things, which I dare say keeps this place in business. The staff were quite miserable, wouldn't let us split the room bill. No wi-fi either unless you pay a fortune for it. As it's London, unfortunately you have to pay a lot of money to get accommodation that's in the 21st century, I'd highly recommend doing just that to avoid a place like this.;2

Good and bad points in my stay here. I was there for a week with work, and the desk staff were great with trying to find me the best room of what was left. Which I really appreciated.  I had to ask housekeeping to replace some of the toiletries when they ran out, and one day came back to find someone else's dirty towels on the floor in my room! Not so great... The doorman were really helpful with getting cabs etc and alway really friendly.  Breakfast was nice, but the staff a bit hit and miss. Which was much like my impression of the hotel overall.  Great location, close to Central Park and easy walk to my office. But I think there may be better options where the standard is a little higher for the price we paid.;2

"I was going to stay for a few nights, but checked out after the first one. First of all... Hollywood is NOT a beautiful part of LA.  There is a ton of crime, and most of the areas around the tourist attractions are filled with drug addicts, homeless people and hoodlums. The ""attractions"" are absolute rip offs. I didn't come for that, was just hoping to have a nice place to stay while visiting family in the area.   On check in, you are asked to approve a deposit to cover ""incidentals"".  The pool is located out the back door and across the parking lot. There are some lounge chair there, but it is not really the relaxing place they make it appear to be.  The room was grimey, as were the hallways.  The breakfast, despite some reviews, was very average, and the omelette chef did not";2

I was told to walk around the corner and find a deli where I could buy a cup of coffee. When I asked for a bigger room, I was told it would cost me $75 more per night - or about $350.  I was also not given a refund so I could stay across the street for $189/night.  The only positive I can think of is that the room was generally clean - though a section of the wall was damaged.

Me and a friends stayed in the hotel for 2 days. I recommend the location as it's convenient to travel within Manhattan and quite at nights. We also visited the rooftop twice, once for a brunch and once for drinks. And I can say that the best part of the hotel is definitely the rooftop.  The room they gave to us was barely adequate for two with a very small bathroom. They didn't even bother for putting a bath towel there:) The bed was comfortable and whatsoever but will not stay again and don't recommend.;2
The lobby is very nice and of course the location is great but the rooms suck and the manager and staff simply don't care. Was put in a handicap room with this weird diagonal shape and the worst bed you've ever slept on with tears in the bed skirts. Asked for a new room and the Manager simply told me that in 3 nights from now the hotel is oversold and didn't want to move me 2 nights later.  Do yourself a favor and just stay somewhere else.  Your back will thank you!!;2
really a dump with shared baths, worn out furniture, dirty corridors, and no internet.  I've reserved it by mistake for its proximity to Columbia University.  Location is OK - in the Upper West Side near Central Park but close to Harlem;2
For the price - the hotel should have much more updated and equipped rooms.  It was clean and the front end staff were wonderful.  The room service was fantastic.   The pool and hot tub were an extreme disappointment however.  The hot tub was colder than the pool , dirty and not useable.;2

Close to Central park and time square. Bed was comfortable, sadly thats about the only positives i can think of. Room not ready on arrival despite turning up nearly an hour after check in time. Had to wait around 45 before we could check in to our room. Very poor room layout - huge mirror(unmovable) in an area with no lights, hardly any plugs in room(non near bed), all on far wall in middle of nowhere.  Air conditioning in room loud and broke after a few days - highly ineffective as placed on the ground, in a corner, next to the window. It barely changed the temperature up or down more than 1 degree. Heating system came on at random intervals in middle of night(despite being turned off on wall controls), to very loudly wake you up, then turns off 5 mins later to achieve nothing;2

Let's start with the positives though. 1) If you're going to an event at Madison Square Garden, this is a stone's throw away. 2) If you value hot water, they have an abundance of instant (very, very) hot water coming out of their faucets! --I thought hot water was going to be an issue when a guest was complaining about having no hot water while I was checking in. 3) Like to read in bed, they have a fantastic, bright light above the bed. 4) Front desk was great enough to bring a bucket of ice to our room:)  So what's wrong with this place? Let's begin that you don't want to stay here if you're traveling with heavy bags because you're going to have to lug those suckers up the stairs. Yes, S-T-A-I-R-S because there isn't an elevator.   If you're a light sleeper, forget about it!;2
Difficult to recommend this hotel, to be honest. Check in process is about the least efficient I've seen.  Anywhere. Ever.  I experienced a line 20-25 people long, with no particular urgency on the part of staff.   Rooms are tiny, but functional.  Noise is a problem, not from the city outside, but from the hallway.  Expect to hear every conversation that takes place outside your door.   The location is near Penn Station, but not much else, frankly.  So while the price may be right, you'll likely be happier elsewhere.;2
Voyage Price offered The New Yorker suggesting it is a four star hotel. We were so disappointed we checked out after one night. The staff on reception are shoddily dressed , the carpets grubby , the rooms tiny ( and we were upgraded ) the beds small with cheap , thin bedding. The hotel was swarming with students when we stayed  , so lots of noise in the corridors and queues for the lifts and reception etc Itâs very definitely a budget hotel;2
We love you hotel and have enjoyed it many times over the years.  This trip we actually received shockingly bad service.  There was a problem with the internet to the point where we had no signal at all most days.  As we were in town on business and had planned to work from the hotel this created a big wrinkle in our plans.    We called twice a day for 3 days to speak with a manager to just see what the problem was, if it could be fixed or if we needed to move to another hotel to complete our business.  We were continuously promised return calls and told there was no known problem with the internet.  When I finally called and spoke to the internet provider they said they were well aware of the problem with the internet.    The saga gets boring after that.  We were continuously;2
Upon our arrival we noticed that our room was dirty, bloody tissues under our bed, stains on the sheet and dirty ear buds on the floor. After asking to speak to a manager, we were left waiting a long period of time and had to leave due to a show. We asked again on our return and then decided it was best to move hotels due to the lack of customer service and the dirtiness. When we returned home I sent an email to customer services with no response, I also rang and again had no response. Very disappointed with the service, and it wasnât the first poor experience at this hotel.;2
Having paid what we would consider good money for a hotel room we were very disappointed in the quality of this place. The decor was tired and a bit scruffy, it smelt funny and our room could only be described as pokey. No TV or wireless internet was available in our room either. The staff were variable. Some were extremely friendly and helpful and others ranged from indifferent to downright surly and incompetent. And let's not talk about the lift! Given a choice I would rather have used the stairs to get to our 8th floor room - it would have been quicker. Two good points: it was reasonably clean and had an excellent location. The subway was just outside the door and the bus stop for the Hop on Hop off bus not more than 50 metres away.;2

They lost our booking as part of a large group stay. Then finally got a room only to be told it's the wrong room, so had to sit in the room whilst the staff made their way slowly to the room. No idea why this took.pvet 40 mins to sort . Hotel is terribly dated with poor facilities.;2
location is fabulous if you are going to Lincoln Center. But it does not obviate the problems with electronics (electrical outlets don't work), room amenities (coffee machine does not work) and bell hops who have to be called upon by hotel guests to come and find taxis. Really, can this be true? Holy smokes, this hotel has gone down hill over the years. We have been coming here for years to be close to the Met opera. Forget it. We will find another place to stay.;2

I havenât stayed in many hotels in New York so I donât have much to compare this one to, so this review is completely objective.  The location is amazing, right in the middle of so many things and walking distance to many more.  The lobby is beautiful and is a very impressive welcome to the hotel.   The rooms, however are downright appalling. Cleanliness is not an issue, everything is spotlessly clean. Even the tiny size of the rooms is not a real issue. Although annoying that in some rooms you can only just about walk around the bed you can accept it because the hotel has such a great location.  The lack of amenities is very disappointing, no coffee machine although I hear they will provide one upon request?? No fridge. The toiletries provided are of shocking quality, I donât;2
Would not recommend. Apart from the nice location on the upper west side I cannot think of any positives about this hotel. As you will read in the other comments - old, outdated, not overly clean. Lifts are ridiculously slow and dingy. TV didn't work at all. And staff in general were not friendly (a staff member  who delivered a mini fridge to the room so I could store my insulin was positively rude as we didn't hear him knocking on the door straight away. Just to note I requested said fridge prior to check in, again while checking in, yet still had to phone and request again after checking in. Just an example of the hotel's efficiency)  For the price you can find better. Would suggest you only stay here if you really can't find anything  else.;2
The current temp in my room is 80 degrees and rising! The front dest girl was sweet and nice but since the hotel is full there is nothing that can be done. The cost of my room was over 300$ and it is really bad to be completely sweating and unable to sleep. I read reviews from 2014 about the AC being bad but read it was taken care of. Just lnow that it has not and the rooms are so hot! Unbearable.;2

Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City January, 17 2008 Traveller from NZ Very over-priced -the night we ate at the Hotel the meal was cold and a pizza took forever and it cost a fortune.  Someone had been looking through my suitcase and happened to leave a used Hilton pillowcase behind.  Complained to security and room manager and I have had no response as to the outcome of their investigation.  Handy to Metro - if you stay there eat out and keep your luggage locked.  Air con very noisy.Concierge Dora on executive floor was excellent. I wouldn't stay there again.;2
We booked our annual trip to visit family in August, and then the morning before we check in I received a call that our room was not available. The hotel called back after the first call to say they were working on it, but never called back to confirm it was resolved. When we arrived at the hotel we were checked into the wrong room, and had to speak with a manager to get revised. The hotel did provide a one night credit for changing our room type, but there was a complete lack of communication or organization in how it got resolved.  The breakfast was good, but the service was absolutely terrible. This could be due to understaffing, but resulted in my family being told we were done eating and needed to leave part way through our meal.  The room itself was nice once we were;2
Having read some of the reviews on here we were not expecting a great deal and balanced against the fact that it wasn't, by NYC's standards, expensive we thought 'what the heck?'. However we were still disappointed. Doesn't look too bad from the outside but the interior certainly requires a lick of paint and some air freshener here and there. The first room we were put in was tiny and oppressive. The windows faced into a courtyard(???) and so very little light shone into the room, (exacerbated by the lack of Windowlene applied to the glass) but the worst thing was the air handling unit on the adjacent roof that rattled and hummed virtually all the time. Getting to sleep was impossible. We asked to change rooms but were given some spurious excuse that this wouldn't be possible;2
We needed a centrally located hotel for a short trip our family was taking to California.  It seemed like this Hilton would be a great choice.  From the moment we got there, it was a chain of disappointing situations.  I arrived after a long trip and my room was not ready.  We went for lunch at the nearby City Walk and came back, still not ready.  We hung around in the lobby and I watched several people check in and then I went up again and asked why I couldn't check in.  I got some story about a 4 pm check in time and that they had a certain room assigned to me and it was not ready yet.  I asked if they could switch my assigned room with someone else's of the same type that was ready.  They had me standing there for quite awhile while they checked.  I was told no, there was;2
"The Jane has all of the elements we usually love in a hotel: history, location, affordability and a good dose of ""quirk"" thrown in for good  measure. In this case, even the quirk and charm couldn't salvage our experience. We were in the city for a long weekend in mid October  for work and play, and booked a Captain's room, a  larger and more $$ room than the berths we had seen pics of on Yelp and TripAdvisor.   When we checked in, we were given a choice of a river view on the upper floors, or a side room w street view. Well..duh!  As we entered the room, which was mediocre, dark, and small, we opened the very small window, and were blasted by an overwhelming amount of traffic noise (West Side Highway).  If the room had been nicer, we would have stayed and just dealt with it, but";2

"Not a great experience.  We had the choice to spend more, but chose not to based on the reasonable reviews out here.  Wish we would have spent more.  Don't do it, people.  Don't stay here just to save a buck.  Pros:   1. Location- In Chinatown, on the edge of Little Italy.  Diverse, fairly quiet neighborhood with a park across the street. 2. Transportation:  subway to Uptown 1 block away; other lines about 4-5 blocks away 3.  Friendly front desk staff (but a bit disinterested or maybe resigned to their situation) 4.

I booked this hotel at short notice to near my brother who I was visiting.  I arrived after midnight. First night was in a room which bore no resemblance to the pictures on the website. It was dark, off a grubby corridor, and the phone, television and coffee machine were all broken. My shower in the morning was cold. When I mentioned all of this in the morning I was promised a new room, which I moved to much later in the day. This one was much better and looked more like the pictures. The TV and coffee machine were fine but, when I wanted a nice hot shower after an early run in Central Park (very close) the shower didnât work (switch between tap and shower was broken) and there was only very low power, luke warm water. I mentioned these the next morning but nothing was done;2
Itâs nothing fancy. Or posh thatâs for sure. Itâs a place to lie your tired body down. This was one of the places offered to us at a discount for HSS. Itâs not that much of a discount either. Nor close to HSS. Itâs a 2 hours walk and 35 minute ride with the traffic. Rugs and window blinds pretty but very very dirty. Very tiny room. Very tiny bathroom. Vanities are cheap wood and tiny being so tiny they should be water proof or steam proof. No coffee station in the hotel. Thereâs Starbucks next door. Wasnât an enjoyable place to stay for me at all.;2

I had quite a few issues with my stay. The front desk clerk did not fully explain the total fees for paying at the hotel through a Travelocity reservation. The amount charged was almost $200 more than the amount noted on Travelocity. When I called from the room to ask about it I was somewhat dismissed and told I need to call Travelocity. It took two reps and almost an hour later to get an answer as to why there was a drastic difference in price. The additional fees and total rate oer night should be disclosed during check in. I realized the discrepancy when I got a transaction notification on my phone. Also, we had one face cloth for my husband and I for a two day stay.

This place was newly renovated, and had great potential. However it's the little things, and there were many. We booked because of an internet special advertising 3 people in a 4 person room, but when we got there were put in separate rooms. Staff were rude and not apologetic. There was no toilet paper, and we were told to 'request it' at reception. When has it ever been optional?! We had to pay for internet and after doing so it didn't work. Staff were unhelpful and simply told us 'it works'. Showers were cold, there was water all over the bathroom floors and there was nowhere to put your clothes. Rooms were cramped, and there was someone living in ours. Ridiculous for the amount of money we paid. I wouldn't go back. And definitely wouldn't recommend it.;2

"We were not expecting much luxury in this hotel, but this was not what we had expected it to be. We slept in a small old room on the 7th floor: it is practically all bed and not so clean (would not walk barefoot on the carpet; small pieces of sand/dust (?) would stick to our feet). But that was not the problem. The problem was that we had to sleep all night long on top of the sheets and with the window open while it was snowing outside (snowflakes would fall into the room) because of the heater that couldn't be turned off. Actually, the heater was totally closed but it still was HOT; you couldn't touch the thing because you would burn your fingers.

My husband and I stayed in in Aug 06 - originally planned and paid for 4 nights, but changed hotels after 2 to a 4*.   The rooms are small, although bed and bathroom were clean, but the carpets desperately needed a good clean/updating. TV reception was extremely poor.  The hotel staff were very helpful, and we booked a helicopter trip with them, plus bus tour with no problems at all.  In terms of the area itself, there is nothing around it, except for apt blocks and other bargain hotels. Had to walk 3 blocks to find somewhere reasonable to eat.  The subway was close by, which we needed to take in order to get to central Manhattan, as this is a long way out.  I believed this hotel was 3* although far closer to 2*.;2

First thing is first, it looks spacious in the photographs.  However, it's not as big as you think.  The room I stayed in had the basics: a bed, pillows, blankets and sheets, a closet with hangers, television, small refrigerator, a lamp, some drawers, a chair, and air conditioning/heater.  You also get a sink with a medicine cabinet in your own room!  However, it doesn't come with a bathroom.  Your bathroom situation in this hotel is communal.  The bathrooms on my floor needed some work.  Maybe a lot of work.  The bathroom with a tub has a problem with privacy. The shower curtain for the shower/tub doesn't completely block yourself from the person across the building from you.

Expensive, in dire need of basic maintenance, noisy (not necessarily from street - from hotel housekeeping staff slamming doors), small rooms, and tiny furniture.

Unfortunately,  their few smiling faces are not enough to ever get me to come back to the Empire.    BTW - heed the reviews about the limited and/or slow elevators at times.

"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel a couple of days ago because we had an early flight out of Burbank airport and wanted something close by.  Location-wise, it is very good.  Walking distance to Universal Studios/City Walk, right off the freeway (but not so close that you can hear the freeway noise in your room). If you want to be close to the touristy Hollywood, then this is an ideal location.  The room was fine, nothing fancy.  Looked more like a business hotel than a vacation hotel.  Definitely needs some updating in the common areas, but like I said, just fine.    Our horrible experience began at about 9:30 pm  when we returned from having dinner at City Walk.  We came in and heard the neighboring guests being loud and ""partying"", but didn't really mind too much because";2
"The staff is excellent; however, the rooms are extremely small and in bad need of upgrades!  There is only one floor in the entire hotel that has updated rooms, and even those are in bad need of upgrades.  The rooms are so small that there is absolutely no place to put your baggage; I had a hard time closing the door of the room because my luggage kept hitting the door.  I had 2 rooms; one of the rooms was so small that when you open the door it hits the bed.  We had a great time in New York - after doing all of the walking all day exploring, it would have been nice to come back to a decent hotel room.";2

I came to this Hyatt hotel after a flight into Lax airport.   I sent a direct review to the hotel to try & do the right thing before publicly writing a TA review but they didnât even bother responding! So here is my experience as followsâ¦. When I got into the bed I felt all these lumps all over my body coming from the duvet..it was such an uncomfortable feeling but I was so tired I didnât even dare look until the morning.  When I looked at their duvet it must have been 100 years old & all the inside had matted up creating lots of lumps inside the duvetâ¦it was so disgusting my stomach turned thinking I had that on my body all night.   Then the wifi is absolutely abysmal!  They may as well have no wifi because it didnât really work.  I couldnât get any work done from the room &;2
This will only be a short review about the hotel, first of all i would like to say the hotel is clean and tidy and i found the staff to be helpful and friendly  There is not much at the hotel except for a small room downstairs where u can get a drink from the vending machine and use the internet access  The rooms in the hotel are small and very basic, the heating does make a lot of noise so if your a very light sleeper this will affect you, you can also hear the tube going up and down so this also can be a pain, if your a heavy sleeper like myself you should be fine.  there is not a lot of space to hang and put your clothes so we kinda lived out of our suitcase for the five days we were there, the lift also has a mind of its own and you will be lucky if you can fit 4 people in;2

"this past weekend a friend and I went on a shopping trip and stayed two nights at the Empire Hotel.  The reception desk was pleasant and courteous. I asked what our ""express queen bed"" was and it sounded very small for two people.  we received an upgrade which was greatly appreciated. would not have wanted to see the ""express"" room as the ""standard"" room was very, very, small and did not offer much.  bed was adequate and clean which is a plus.  there is very little space to store anything.  a tiny closet with a curtain hanging over it held a safe, ironing board, iron, and small rod to hang very few pieces of clothing. the shower arrangement, as there is no tub, was ridiculous.  no way to take a shower without spraying the bathroom.  sink would not drain.  bathroom door looked";2
1) HOT. It's cold out, so they have the heat cranked up. Apparently it's in the floor or walls, because there is no way to control it. There is an old heat/cool/fan unit on the outer wall, which I turned off, hoping that by the time I got back from dinner, it would be cooler. No. It's just hot, dry hot. Desertlike. Prepare to strip down to your undies. 2) NO fitness. They claim there's a fab new fitness center, but I'll never see it. I went down to the lobby to find the special elevator to the floor where the fitness center is, only to be told that the elevator doesn't work and guests are not allowed to take stairs to it. (What would you do to get out of the building if you were down there and there was a fire?) The clerk seemed unaware that this could be upsetting to a person,;2

I had to stay in NYC for an extra day due to flight delays, so quickly chose a hotel to get to with free WIFI so I could still get some work done with my office.

I stayed 7 nights in this hotel two weeks ago. It's in a nice neighbourhood and about 10 mins by subway to the center of Manhattan. The staff is nice although they act very slow if you have some requests. For example, I asked for an extra blanket because it was terribly cold and I had to wait one day till they gave it to me. Furthermore: do not ask for wake up calls! I asked for it because I had to get up early to get the bus to DC, but they didn't call. I found out that there was even nobody at the reception at 7am, though they promised to call... But in general, it's a cheap place, the bathrooms and toilets are clean (the rooms not really) and you're in NYC!;2
"First, the self-parking was confusing. No signs outside to say Parking for ""Hyatt Regency""; circled building 3x before some finally confirmed it was the right building to park in. Second why not use your room key for in and out parking privileges instead of going to Valet to get a second ticket; third no microwave in each room no matter what size of the room? For a Hotel of this magnitude not okay! Couldn't heat up leftovers or pop popcorn to watch a movie! Fourth, compact fridge was a joke. Get a real compact fridge for the rooms. The hotel brings in enough money to fix these issues.";2
We aren't tourists. We've lived in NY and usually stay with family when we go into the City, but since we had to be at an event on the upper West Side we figured it would be easier to stay in a hotel close by so we picked this place for its location. It's really in need of refurbishing. The lobby isn't very clean, the elevators were kind of scary in that you could look right down into the elevator shaft as you stepped into the elevator. The halls were dirty. The room had very worn out furniture, even an old analogue tv with poor reception. The bathroom walls were peeling. The towels were thin. Although worn out looking, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom adequate. I can't believe what we paid for this. It wasn't cheap. Most of the other guests were;2

Stayed here to visit ABC studios the next morning. As for location from the studio it was perfect. The stay was not great at all. The front desk services were horrible. They act as though they didn't want to help me. The room wasn't the best but would do for one night. The heater/ air conditioner made a loud clanking noise all night which kept us up. That needs to be updated/ fixed as soon as possible. Wasn't impress and probably would not have stay here again.;2

This hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary. The decor in the room was dull and beige.  My room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal, not much light was let in from the window.    While the bedding was new and updated, the furniture seemed old and dated.    The worst aspect of the room was the plumbing and heating controls.  The dual hot and cold water controls in the shower were unstable and hard to control.  It resulted in the temperature vacillating from scalding hot to freezing cold.  The tub surround also had been updated with new tile, but the tub was old and worn in appearance.  It took an extra ten minutes to take a shower to maintain the water at a comfortable temperature.  The room was drafty and it felt like turning the heat;2

Empire has so much going for it but falls short.  We stayed over Fashion week and I know rooms in New York are small but this was honestly the smallest room I have ever stayed in. There is no closet only a couple pegs with 4 hangers to put your clothes on.  There is no counter top in the bathroom.  The bed was a feather bed but didn't have a good cover and my husband and I both kept getting poked by feathers.  If the room wasn't over $500 a night I wouldn't be as upset but it was so not worth it.  The positives were that our flight got in very early and they gave us a room right away without waiting for check in.  The front desk people were super friendly.  We did have problems with the doormen getting us taxis, they NEVER offered.  However, I do know it was fashion week and the;2
"Location for the Lincoln Center could not be better and the public areas are stylish and fun; but the room is incredibly noisy (from the machinery under the window- see pic). I don't mind the horrible view but I really hate the constant loud noise which continues throughout the night too. The bathroom door looks like someone tried to kick it in and they didn't repair it and the shower is a bit mouldy. I tried to ring down to reception last night when I arrived to ask if there was any chance of a quieter room but no one answered the phone and I was really exhausted after a transatlantic flight so I just gave in and accepted it. I certainly wouldn't book this place if I had a choice and I wouldn't dream of bringing someone if I wanted a romantic weekend in NY!!";2
"I have stayed here several times before.  It is very convenient to Penn Station.  The room was always small but comfortable enough for one.   This time my room (203) was smaller than my son's dorm room at college; room for a single bed with 24 inches on one side and at the foot but less on the window side.  This cost me $140.    The bathroom had less than half a roll of toilet paper with no spare roll.  So I had to walk down (no elevator) to get one which was happily provided.   To cap it all off, the forgot the wake up call.  That goodness for my cell phone.   No more false economy for me.";2
On a positive note the hotel is in a great location in front of the Metropolitan Opera. The room is in serious need of updates and the carper was dirty. The heating/cooling unit was very outdated, had buttons which did not function. In my last night the cooling unit stopped working, began to heat in a dangerous way and the temperature in the room rose to 85 degrees. The technician fixed it but he did not clean the filter that was completely dirty and could be the cause of overheating.;2

My husband and I arrived at 11:00 PM and had asked for a late check out since we arrived so late. We we informed that it was not possible because there was a very large group arriving the next day. We understood and went to our room to find it completely trashed! Mind you we didnât arrive until 11 PM! Why was this room untouched? We were given another room but felt uneasy about the cleanliness of the facilities because of what we had just experienced. (Photos posted are of the first room we were given upon opening the door) The new room was cramped and small as was the bathroom and there were stains on the curtains. We have stayed in small facilities before but they were at least renovated and cleaned. We like to check out the hotels in NYC so when people ask for recommendations;2

"We stayed there 4 nights after having prepaid with Expedia for 5 nights. When we arrived at the hotel the receptionnist told us that it was all sold out.  So, he sent us to another place, a Best Western Hotel, where we had to pay another 150$ plus taxi and breakfast.   The next day, we went back to the Ramada where finally we could have a room for the rest of the stay. But the guy in charge, the front desk ""manager"" was unfair and rude, he said that he would for sure compensate for nothing. We are now trying to have Expedia sending us the money back.The rest of the staff, especially at breakfast, are extremely friendly and helpful, but management should learn some good customer service skills.";2
The location is great, I experienced this on a business trip last year.  I looked forward to bring friends and family here for a holiday, but unfortunately it seems like the simple things you need for a familiy are not taken care of.

the title should say it all. Also, we were initially given keys for someones elses room. Not cleaning the bathroom, and giving away people's keys willy nilly are two unpardonable offenses in my book.

Travelling is one thing I love doing and NYC was indeed a dream come true for me. Looking for accommodation was really tough especially in summer and good thing I was able to get a night at Days Inn after cancelling my reservation at The Jane Hotel which I find really too old, dirty and unsafe.   LOCATION. Very strategic. Literally near the train station when you plan to visit the Statue of Liberty, walking distance to CENTRAL PARK and just a short bus away to the TIME SQUARE.  Check-in wasn't rough esp. when you are greeted by a friendly staff. With my not-so-good and friendly experiences in other hotels in America, I would say this front desk staff named Jasmine was one of the bests...friendly and professional. Kudos girl (keep it up)! This industry needs you!   ROOM.  Well,;2
I was expecting more from a hotel of this caliber. I was struggling to carry all of my bags and the door men just stood there talking to each other whole I let myself in.   Then I saw them open the door for someone with expensive luggage.   When I got to my room I was thrilled to see a bottled water on the nightstand as I was very thirsty. Luckily I noticed the $8 price tag and didn't open it. I would think that paying as much as I did for the room the least they could do is free water. Then I noticed the phone charger on the floor which led me to believe that the floor wasn't vacuumed after the previous guest left. Then I noticed the ripped wallpaper.  Then I looked out the window and saw what looked like an alley and the side of another building.  I took a shower and with no;2

Really not sure the hotel is worth the money. The final bill was close to $350 per night for a super tiny queen size bedroom overlooking an alley way with almost no natural light coming in at all time. My daughter said the bathroom was like the one on the airplane. Super tiny and tight. The bathroom really needed some TLC, it was a bit rundown. The bed was comfortable and the sheet was good. The reception area was nice and the doorman was polite. The reception lady was non-chalant and uninterested. She did give us 2 bottles of water...Will definitely stay at other hotels in the area when we come back in February. BTW, Management, please fix the lights on the Giant Sign above the building. Its embarrassing to see the letter O and E are broken. Great location.;2

I purchased this hotel on priceline and frankly, I got FAR better rooms in MUCH nicer and more convenient neighborhoods for the same price.  The room wasn't terribly bad.  The hallways though are rough and worn and look really bad.  In the lobby there was this lady sitting in a wheelchair all night with a reddened and swollen knee who looks like she needs her leg amputated, I have no idea if shes a friend or long term resident or what, but it was nasty.  From the looks of some other reviews, they must be rennovating it one bit at a time.  Unfortunately I didn't get a renovated room.;2
This hotel is only suitable if you want somewhere to crash. It is in desperate need of a makeover and the carpets smells awful. Surprisingly though, the bed was very comfortable.  As for location, its great, you are in easy reach of everywhere and there is a great deli across the road that do fab sandwhiches and cakes to die for! Overall I wouldn't stay here again, simply as the place has been unloved for such a long time, but if it had a revamp, I wouldn't think twice.;2

We stayed in room 2550 for 1 night and could not believe how shabby the room was. For starters the bed was hard there was no coffee or tea making facilities which is a basic necessities in 2016. The bathroom is In Need of desperate repair as you can't take a bath without water leaking the seal around the bath is mouldy and had pubic hair around it and needs re-tiling there is no shabby chic about this hotel. Very disappointed tourists.;2

Location is good, but.... - Dirty toilet seat, still saw disgusting marks around the toilet. - Internet is crap.  It just doesn't work.  I had the ultimate internet service, it still take 2-3 mins to load one email (text only).  Most of the time, there was not signal.  - Chair and desk are dirty.;2
The Empire need to stop living on location and old merits!  It's time for an upgrade/renovation - the hotel is very worn down.  The time has changed, there are more traffic, both of quests and outside the window.   We had a suite, in which the sofa bed was totally worn out, with a deep sag in the middle and the top bed mattress was stained with bodily fluids... Not so fresh.   The AC made such a loud noise that it was impossible to sleep when it was on.   The windows are old and draughty and not sound proof at all.   Offering purchasing of wine and champagne, but only having paper mugs to drink from is not that fancy... why is there no glasses?   The wardrobe is useless. There is a shelf in the middle on which the safe box is. This means not enough hight for a standard gent's;2
We stayed for 5 nights 25th-30th October 2011.  Upon checking in, we were given the card to our room.  When we got to our non-smoking room, it smelt like somebody had just put out a cigar in there, the air-con units were outside the window and really noisey and the room was tiny.  You had to walk into the bathroom, half close the door, struggle through the gap  and then fully close the door (this is from a size 8 woman!).  I immediately called the front desk with my complaints, was told the hotel was fully booked that night but to leave our bags packed and we would be moved tomorrow, and that we had only paid for this type of room!  Upon returning to the hotel the following evening, we checked with the front desk where we had been moved to, to be told we had not been moved and;2

Room was in need of basic repair. Dirty walls water damage in the bathroom. No sugar for coffee. Did not restock coffee or bar. Minimal cleaning each night. Left iorn out. Saw a roach ang killed i.

I live in NY and I wanted to get a small getaway for a day of my busy days, to relax and enjoy the day. Main reason I chose The Empire hotel was for the pool in the rooftop, as showing on the website looked fantastic.... what a dissapointment!!! My first impression when I went to my room: a very very small room featuring a Queen bed that looked more like a full bed, I was not happy but decide to go Up to the pool and enjoy the rest of the day.... The pool LOOKS Nothing as the one in the website, is  maybe a 1/3 of the size that is advertised, the website picture is more like a drawn and is very deceptive because the space and the pool itself is very very small... two people side by side can fit in that pool but nobody else, was very bad. A happy note, was the service, All the;2

The hotel staff were very kind but were unable to recommend places to eat and drink near the hotel. The lift was big enough for 3 people with suitcases but I recommend you wait for it if your on the top floors. The room was very small and the bed was right behind the door. The bed was the most noisiest bed I've ever slept in. It was impossible to move in he night or go to the restroom without waking my partner. Then there was the air conditioning unit... this was the loudest things I think I have slept through. Most nights we would just turn it off and try to sleep through the heat. It was either a noisy night or a sweaty night. There were marks on the wall and a wardrobe that didn't look like it had been put together properly. The bathroom was clean however, the shower needed;2

Great location within walking distance to Soho and Noho. Subway is super close.   Upon entry into hotel there were some kind of little bugs or flies flying around (I stayed in late December). The knob on the heater was broken-luckily it worked anyway. There were black, yellow and brown stains on all the four pillow cases.   Staff is very friendly and helpful.;2
I stayed here because I was travelling on a budget, and everything in New York is ridiculously expensive. So I put up with this for the 6 nights of my stay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, as New Yorkers are in general. The decor was tired. A previous guest had pulled a bed fitting out, leaving nails exposed which I manage to push back. The toilet cistern kept flushing until I learn a trick of lifting the lid and turning it off. (I suppose I could have gone and complained to the staff about that one, but did not.) There is breakfast of muffins and coffee down in the basement. Everything basic.;2
Well located.  Noisy, not well ventilated and in need of another renovation  elevators look terrible. It is well located near Lincon Center but if you are not into music there are plenty of alternatives a lot cheaper. It has lost its luster.;2
Astor on the Park, New York We have just spent 5 days at this hotel and although the price should have given the game away other reviews we read before going seemed OK. Our experience of the doorman, was helpful in trying to get you on trips - but getting specific information about going places the maps we already had were more informative. The room was clean but needed some tlc, eg the hanging space/shelf unit had a wedge placed to keep it balanced. For information the room we were in was 713. The last two nights of our visit were blighted by four youngsters in the next room to us calling out loudly and using inappropriate language. Yes we did complain to the hotel on the second night and were told that we couldn't move room to get a good night's sleep prior to our journey;2
Got to the front desk and took my payment but they charged me for parking fees when I told them that I had no car with me. Lucky I checked my receipt because they charged me an extra $150. Rude staff and said they charge everyone parking fees even if they don't have a car but they will refund it by end of stay, WHAT!!!! Also the small shop they have in the hotel, the man working there is a crook. My girlfriend bought a charger for $10 which didn't work and was loose and faulty and when took it back 5mins after buying it he refused to refund the money. BEWARE!!!;2

We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading rave reviews. What a disappointment the experience proved to be. Stayed for 4 nights in a tiny standard room and not so much as free anything with coffee priced at 3 dollars a cup. The pool was also very small and more like a plunge pool. That we could have put up with but the 'view' from room 901 was a wall. You can check out the photos. The bathroom was also in a state of disrepair with paint flaking from the door and mould on the shower seal. Overall very poor for the price we paid. Wont be back. When we booked out I tols them what I thought and they tried to turn it back on me by suggesting I said something earlier. They shouldn't be giving guests this standard of room in the first place was my retort.;2

While the hotel is convenient, clean, and affordable, there were no conveniences and no amenities.  I would not likely stay at this hotel again.  The hotel is is very well-located if you want to spend most of your time in Midtown (at Macy's, Times Square, going to Broadway shows, etc).  And it's also close to Penn Station - Since we arrived early on a Friday and left late on a Sunday, we wanted to drop off luggage on both ends of our trip - It was easy to do since the hotel was only a block and a half from Penn Station (we arrived by train).  We found the hotel to be clean - the rooms, the hallway, the lobby.  Consistently clean.  We also found the rates to be very reasonable.  Very competitive in the otherwise expensive NYC hotel market.  The staff at reception was friendly and;2
The title of my review is the best way I would describe The Jane. Its in a great location and the staff was friendly This place is like a hostel, tiny rooms and shared bathrooms. I stayed here because everything else was sold out. I'm not sure about the good value that everyone is referring to. I did opt for the room with its own bathroom and that cost was what I usually pay for a 5 star diamond hotel. I was there for three nights and eventually found somewhere else to stay.  The room was so small that I couldn't fit all of my luggage. The lobby was pretty and the elevator is operated by staff so it can take some time since there's only one. My room had one small window facing the river and it was fairly quiet.   If you're flying solo and exploring the city, this might be the;2

This is my 4th visit to New York but first time in this hotel, In a good location, Just a few things put me off to a point I wonât be returning. We were being checked in by Mohammed who asked us to leave him a review, then said heâd waived all the fees of an early check and room with a view (we didnât ask for either) he must have asked us to leave him a review about 7/8 times. We then got into our room with the phone ringing - its Mohammed reminding us to leave him a review (No joke!) itâs not want you want or need after a 12hr travel day. The rooms are quite small but considering youâre only sleeping in them itâs not a big deal however they do need a deep clean. The curtains/nets were covered in thick dust and fluff. The lifts are very slow so make sure you donât need to rush;2
This hotel looks like it has not been painted, remodeled or updated since 1960 or earlier. Aside from the fact the rooms are tiny and expensive the rooms are so outdated in every way. The bathrooms, furnishings, paint and everything else are so old and cramped. There are much nicer hotels for the same price in the same vicinity.  I do not recommend this hotel. I am surprised Wyndham puts its name on this property.;2

Nothing to recommend. Service was poor and staff was hostile, and the rooms were very shabby. Beds are small, there are few amenities, and nothing is very clean. Internet is slow.

"Was here for 2 night with my folks. The good thing about this place is it is close to Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State etc and plenty of restaurants near by.  But this place is like a pigeon-house. Claustrophobic people keep-off! The pillars on each floor leaves very little space for people to walk along in the corridors. I would think some fat people may not be able to walk freely in the corridors! The rooms weren't spacious either! For 128$/night, I hoped for something better!  Room service didn't show up, they lied to the front desk saying we had a ""do not disturb"" sign out! They couldn't find anyone else to do it and so all I could get was fresh towels and toiletries.  Didn't have a problem with the staff, they were okay. They claimed to have wireless internet,";2

My Girlfriend and I stayed at the Empire for 6 nights from 28/11/2012 leaving on 04/12/2012. It was recommended to us by our travel operator and after his recommendation and looking at the hotel's official website we were satisfied that we made the right choice.  The holiday was booked seven months in advance and it was to be a special trip with me planning to propose to my Girlfriend whilst in New York. Two months prior to the start of the holiday I emailed the Empire explaining that it was to be a special holiday with me planning to propose and would it be possible to stay in a room with a view. A small fortune was paid for the holiday and I was certain that surely this request would be met due to the cost of our stay and the reasons behind it.  Our first impressions of the;2
The Morningside Inn was not as good as i expected.  We had trouble finding a budget hotel in NYC over the weekend, and the Morningside was one of the only ones with rooms but we had to share bathroom facilities.  We still paid more than we hoped.  The best thing about the hotel is that there was lifts. But the downfalls were the size of the room, which was tiny. The bed was sloped and I kept on rolling onto my husband.  The hallways were filled with smoke and being 6 months pregnant I was not happy.  There was also hot water pipes in the walls which rattled ever time someone on other floors took a shower or went to the toilet.  It was pretty grimy, although the staff were nice enough, but not all that helpful.;2

First of all, I was super annoyed that they don't have a front door that automatically opens or even a door man!  It was very annoying trying to prop open the door with luggage.   Also, to the hotel employee who was cleaning the glass doors and who I thought was going to open the door for us, you suck for walking away!    Check-in was smooth but I was a little annoyed that we had to wait 5 minutes for the other check-in clerk to call us over even though he wasn't helping anyone.  The lobby is really nice and a great place to hang-out. The elevators were also very fast.  We ended up getting drinks at the bar and taken back by the automatic 20% gratuity!  Our 5 drinks for two people ended up costing $160.  The pouring of my $25/glass scotch doesn't warrant a $5 tip! Didn't get to;2

Comfortable and clean hotel with friendly staff. Functional room. Very conveninetly located for Times Square and mid-town Manhattan. We very much enjoyed our stay until check out day. We were presented with a service charge to cover (we were told internet access). At check in were told it would be a nominal fee. It turned out to be $30 per day plus tax. - That is not a nominal fee and I would have happily not used the hotel wifi if I new in advance it would be that expensive.  We weren't told by our travel agent about this and whilst it was mentioned when we booked in it wasn't explicit. It's shame because without this service charge - which I feel is sneaky, expensive and actually covers things I would normally expect to be included in the price of a room - this would be a five;2

The location of the hotel being the only positive. I was looking at the reviews while i was staying here and saw people mention a facility fee of $35 a night!!!! We went to check if this applied to us, luckily it didnt as virgin holidays cover it.   If you're staying here just be prepared to have your wallet emptied, so bring extra cash!  $5 also to store your bags for the day, not a lot but still, wow!!! How is;2

I've stayed in many hotels in New York, and never felt less excited about one than this Wyndham New Yorker. it's a factory, not a hotel. I am with a group so it wasn't up to me wehre to stay but I wish I wasn't here. The city has sooo many cooler places even at this price. Yes, the Lobby is nice, and it's close to Madison Square Garden, but they hassle you for your key every time you go to your room like British school masters.. I don't know what they think they are preventing.. hotel security used to be smart, intuative, now they hassle everyone, three guys block your way to your room at times, always at least one making you show them a white piece of paper or key.. it's just dumb.  It's hack like a TSA inspection and not why people come to new york. why not use the money spent;2

This is a good place to stay if you're going to the opera. It had blackout curtains that let us sleep in late.   On the bad side....extremely slow check in. Three people at the counter and only one taking care of guests. Water damaged bathroom because the shower doors have been removed. I guess they were trying to be hip but all the seals for the door were still there so it just looked tacky. At noon plus 30 seconds a housekeeper knocked to tell us we were late checking out.  There are better options in the area. Check them out first.;2

The hotel was charging for my upgrade, plus they were reserving additional $600 per day for âany extrasâ, which was of course was never explained when I checked in and of course it affected my card after staying in the hotel for a week. I still was charged for upgrade for one night, as I only noticed it on the second day, which I found disgrace as I did not agree to it at the first place.

As we were only staying for 3 nights we left our cases and went out for the rest of the afternoon. We returned just before 8pm with the intention of having a shower and head out for the evening. We were told our room was still not ready. The concierge said that the previous guests had left late but that house keeping were cleaning it as he spoke (ânot out problem, find us another roomâ I thought but didnât want to start the honeymoon off on a bad note) The concierge gave us a drinks token each and told us heâd get us from the bar when it;2

Let me start off by saying that I have been staying in hotels for YEARS and have never felt compelled to leave a bad review until now even when past experiences were not that great.  1) Although I arrived early, I was very surprised that one room was not available.  Again, partially my fault because I knew check-in time was 3PM, but 90% of the time, hotels have open rooms and I doubt this place was fully booked. 2) The couch in the lobby was completely missing a cushion.  It gave a very bad first impression of what was to come. 3) Once I did check in, I had traveled a long way and wanted to take a nap and could not due to very loud construction across the hall not to mention outside noise due to my room being on the street side. 4) There was no hot water, I had to take a;2
There were larger issues for this hotel such as poor responses from guest services, slow responses for room service requests, and poor handling of complaints. There were smaller issues like poorly designed rooms, improperly installed TVs, inefficient elevators etc.   Overall this hotel is one that looks like a five star from afar but once you are in it you can see that it is just a facade.

"I suppose that its below market pricing should have been the giveaway, but even at that, this hotel should be a last resort choice and  only for its Lincoln Center proximity.  Rooms are small, dark, and dank.  Bathrooms have black mold.  Showers leak onto bathroom floors; cockroaches at play, and overcharging for internet, in room coffee, and even bottled water; silly nickel and diming is never a good idea.  Odd deal with the on site restaurant and its adjoining bar---food at the restaurant was good but service almost non-existent and bar was manned by thuggish guys who could care less about friendly service--insisting that bar tab be closed (not transferred) before allowing the restaurant hostess to seat us.  On a positive note, the front desk people and doormen were excellent.";2

While I liked the concept and the staff on site were fantastic these are the only positives . On the 1st night I got 1 or 2 bites and just put them down to a mosquito. But night number 2 something feasted on me . Initially I assumed bed bugs but some of the bits and the groupings are more consistent with flea bits .  I emailed them as the majority only came out properly after I'd checked out and my initial thoughts went to treating it rather than making a complaint and the response was little more than a good luck ........ not really great considering it looks like I've carried some of it home as the biting continued once I got home . So I've now had to deal with it at home to .;2
Stayed here for business for one night. While location is convenient near Penn Station, that's about it. Rooms are TINY and very noisy! I mean, I couldn't pull the chair from under the desk enough to sit down. The wifi was so bad, I couldn't do any work (emails mostly), forget getting on VPN. I gave up at some point and decided to do emails on the phone but my cell signal was just as bad. No music, no water, no coffee in the room, the bathroom shelf was so narrow, I couldn't keep my hairbrush on it without falling, never mind a little cosmetic bag. They charge $5 for storing bags for a couple hours - told me it was the requirement of the City of NY. BS! I come to NY for business every three weeks and always stay in different hotels, never ever was I charged for leaving bags;2
"Location was great.  Easy access to subway.... hop on off. Nice neighborhood. Room space small. If they did a deep cleaning & minor repairs; it might pass. Elevator broken, only had one to use,  long wait, cramped & tiny. Cable was out. One perk was the availibility to leave our bags with bellman until check-in.  This allowed us to venture out & see the city after our redeye flight. Probably would not recommend to a friend.";2
This was not my accommodation choice, but I ended up staying here after a double booking elsewhere. Location is extremely handy for a lot of things and this is the redeeming feature of this place. Bedding and towels are clean and changed daily and I accumulated a lifetime's supply of soap and toilet paper in just a few days. TV & fridge a bonus. Bathroom evidently cleaned daily. No sign of bedbugs in my room. However, the entire place is looking very shabby (unlike the pics online) and in need of a lick of paint and steam cleaning of the carpets at the very least. However, if you are on a budget and want central Manhatten accommodation, worth considering!;2
This is a great location close to central Park which to be fair is why we chose it over others. we are a family with two teenage boys on our first trip to NYC from Scotland.  We only used it once but the roof top bar was good with great views. The lobby bar is pleasant, relaxing, and staff here and overall in the hotel are friendly enough.  We booked two rooms - a king suite and a double double cost pretty close to Â£3000 for 4 nights. Maybe we expected too much given the location but at this price I was surprised to find the double room so small and our suite was actually just a fairly generous sized king room. Perhaps we should have expected that given the city location.  Downside - Having to pay for coffee $3 a cup to use the coffee machine (free at any good hotel in the UK;2
I stayed here for 2 nights. The location was perfect for what i needed, very close to the subway as well (also the express line). The service was ok, but the room was not so good. The small bathroom smelled like mold (and there was some on the walls indeed). The room door looked unsafe, anybody could have opened that by just nudging a little bit. I know that hotels in NY are generally bad, but this one can do better for sure.;2
This pricey hotel has a cool lobby bar and rooftop bar but otherwise, skip it. Tiny bathrooms, small rooms, dark, claustrophobic hallways with strange wallpaper that makes you feel uneasy. Staff doesn't seem to know what is going on when you ask questions. No coffee machine in rooms and no free coffee anywhere in hotel and no room service....big mistake.;2
The location is great, and for that price we didn't exactly expect gold and marble. But we did expect a decent place to sleep, but unfortunately we didn't get this. The walls are thin as paper, and every sound from showers or other rooms spread between the rooms. And the heating system has a serious problem making sharp hissing sounds from time to time. After complaining we got to change rooms, but the problem remained in the new room.;2
We stayed @ the NYer a few years back & the room had a great view but was very run down (especially the bathroom). When we noticed that Wyndham now runs it & we saw how beautiful the lobby was renovated, we couldn't wait to see our room - nice headboard, sheets & curtains - bed very hard, toilet too low, bathtub/shower old, moldy & a little scary, carpet old, musty smell in the hallway. Great location & friendly, capable staff.;2
I stayed in a Queen size room for tonightâs and have to say I was disappointed.  Walking in the hotel it is truly impressive and I really only stayed here because of it being a historical landmark and the pictures looked great.  The room was really nice in appearance but the sheets were super cheap almost like wrapping yourself in cardboard.  The price wasnât cheap so I was surprised  how uncomfortable the bed and bedding were.  The room was clean but the plastic toilet set had really strange and deep scratches on it.  The sink fixtures were worn and looked like it wasnât cleaned .  The positive about the room the shower was amazing and had some of the best water pressure Ever.  If your looking for a short stay and can get it at a cheap price itâs not a bad place.  Overall the;2
"Came for one night to see Broadway show; excellent location at Lincoln Center, short walk to all Broadway shows. Historic hotel, recently redone with interesting lobby decor. However, after that be prepared for a comedy of errors. Although I had made an online reservation months before, when I called to confirm they had no record of it, and I had to email my copy of confirmation to get them to believe me. Room was not ready on time, and when we got in, room itself needed repairs, and several basic standard items were not there. As mentioned in many reviews, everything is a charge: $3 per Keurig cup, $10 per device per night for internet, etc. And forget about room service or housekeeping bringing anything up: we had to call 3-4 times and wait an hour for any of the missing items";2
The room itself was okay, but the bathroom is far too small. The beds are firm, not very comfortable, not enough blankets. Booking through Trip Advisor was a disaster b/c the rep book one of our rooms direct and the other through Expedia, the promised special rate was not applied to both rooms. I called and spoke with someone for several minutes, but she could not help me. Very disappointing. I will never use this service again.;2
We arrived from an overseas flight and although the website says that the shuttle picks up at each terminal, when we called they said only at 5 and 7.  Understandable given the catastrophic traffic at LAX. Thought the shuttle was relatively fast and efficient once we found the get on spots. The hotel was overrun with wedding guests and staff told us that it would be long waits to for food (even in room dining) so we picked up sandwich from the Subway a few blocks away. The hotel is extremely noisy with thin walls. Highly recommend earplugs to anyone who visits.  Hollering and yelling and loud voices are heard throughout the night.  Other than that, the room was clean, the buffet for breakfast surprisingly good (I am a Globalist) and the trip back to the airport via shuttle was;2

The Jane is a neat hotel and is super cute and the food in the restaurant is pretty darn good and the bar is cute. For New York the rooms (the ones with private bathrooms) are spacious and nice and the bathrooms are cute with a nice bathtub as are the outdoor decks. However, at best, it will cost you $400 a night and it does not seem worth it at all. Especially when you consider this: starting at around 10 PM (on weekends at least) loud music cranks up (specifically The Pony by Ginuine over and over again) with amplified bass and it is super loud, I can sleep through anything, but not this. During our stay, around 2 AM when this was still going on I called downstairs and the person at the desk - who seemed to be very used to getting calls about the noise levels - said that the;2

"I have been staying at the New Yorker for the past twenty years or so, and it has always been my home in New York City.  When the Ramada chain owned it, it was a fantastic place to spend a weekend, or in fact, a week or more! Since Wyndham has taken over,  the quality of service has taken a nosedive! This past weekend I was told that I had to pay for an early check-in, something that I had come to expect as a regular customer when it was available. I booked a ""view suite"" which turned out to have absolutely no view, and was VERY tiny! The refrigerator door was broken and was sagging down. Heat was inconsistent and difficult to manage.

As long as you take some earplugs and you don't go in the hotter months you should be okay!

Reason to choose Hyatt is quality. This hotel doesnât live up to the brand promise. Dirty carpet, poor food choices at breakfast. Crowded lobby. You have to remind the staff about World of Hyatt membership benefits.;2
We were mother and daughter in NYC for holidays. Dissapointed with room provided. Room was ultra small and there was not enough floor space for luggage. The air condition unit was noisy and we were uncomfortable spending time in room.;2
We expected more from this hotel.  The rooms need updating, and most of the staff were just okay. As we were allergic to the feather bedding we requested other pillows and blankets.  They delilvered us the pillows and blankets and left it to us to change our own beds, we had to put all the feather bedding into the closets.  Also, when a hotel advertises internet access available  it does not mean free.  The hotel is next to Universal.  We were told by hotel staff the walk to the Universal Cily restaurants was just behind the hotel.  They didn't mention that it was behind the hotel back parking lot, over a rather dark bridge across a busy road and through another parking lot.  The hotel is not close to anything other than Universal, and if you are driving to the hotel and happen;2
The hotel is well located in Manhattan  The best thing I liked was that I was provided with a Keurig machine and coffee when I asked for coffee. I was not impressed with the rest of the service. I called to ask for a shower cap and a shaving razor, but they never showed up. I called after waiting for 15 minutes, and they still didn't show up. After 1 hour, I gave up. There was hair in the plastic cups in the bathroom- see photo, and hair on the towel. Housekeeping should tie up their hair. The rooms are very small and not soundproof at all. I heard the full conversation of the lady on the phone next door.  There is no space in the bathroom to put a makeup bag or any toiletries, or to hang your clothes.;2

On the positive side... Hotel was conviently located near the metro, central park, a few food places. The area was pretty safe and the bed and linens were clean. Most of the front desk staff were nice.  On the negative side... Hotel is run down and old. Most carpets are worn out and stained. Almost everthing in the rooms are dated and show some sort of wear (ripped, rust, dust, dirt, etc...). Price is high, but it is New York.  Overall, if you go in expecting a regular Days Inn prepare to be extremely disappointed. If you go in expecting hostel or a $30/night hotel somewhere else, you will be pleasantly surprised.;2
The hotel doesn't look old, but the carpets and the lobby look like chaos. The beds were clean and comfy, but the bathroom and especially the shower should have been cleaned much better. The we paid approx. $1000 for 4 nights, and it is most definitely not worth it.;2

"The lone bright spot was the friendliness of the staff working in the bar and at the front door.  Everything else about this hotel screamed ""past its prime,"" like a middle aged former high school quarterback still banking his popularity on his play in the big game against the rival team.  I get it - your hotel had a recurring role on CW's ""Gossip Girl"" - but it is time to let that go and spruce up the place.  The facility itself is old and crumbling (literally, in the case of the front desk), which is likely why the lights in the hallway and bedrooms provide very little illumination.  The aesthetic of the hotel is dated.  The king sized bed I ordered actually turned out to be a full size.  The room was musty smelling and the in-room AC unit made a wheezing sound.  The view out";2
Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights in order to go to the Metropolitan Opera.  The location was PERFECT.  Literally across the street from the Met.  Unfortunately, I have little else good to say about The Empire Hotel.    My friend had stayed there once before on a business trip, and came away with a favorable impression, which is why we decided to stay there.  The good: The doorman was very nice, and the front desk staff were pleasant and competent.   The bad: --the room was musty-smelling --the room was in poor condition with wall paper that was starting to peel and missing trim pieces --the climate control offered very little control over the temperature of the room, which was too warm and stuffy --our room was an interior room, i.e. no view, which I would have normally;2

The hotel is a 4 minute walk from Penn Station, which is the hub of the City, so itâs easy to get to. The hotel is not in a great area, especially at night.

The hotel consists of 3 floors, all accessed via a stairway, thereâs no lift. There is 24 hour reception where you get greeted with an abrupt âyes,â by the very young staff. There is zero customer service or politeness.  My first night, it was bitter cold and I asked for a heater, which I was given as the heating wasnât on.

This was our second time at the Empire Hotel so we knew there would be some things we disliked including the nightclub crowd and the additional charges for everything including in-room coffee that you make yourself for $3.00,  but we got a very good deal through bookit.com so we gave it another try. If it were not for the front desk staff, especially Ms. Katya, and the travel agent at bookit.com we would have checked out two days early. Rooms are in disrepair and not very clean. Elevators broke down. Management needs to give this place some attention such as replace burned out light bulbs, fix sink stoppers, replace worn out chairs, fix broken curtain rods, and at the very least offer free in-room coffee and tea even if they have to to increase the rate by $3.00 a night.

We were greeted with an angry security guard because the GPS brought us to the shuttle pickup/drop off door. When checking in the employee at the counter didn't even look up. I had checked in earlier that day and just needed my room key. She handed me the key and went back to what she was doing. Gave me no instructions on where to park, how to get to my room, or the overall layout of the hotel. I couldn't even get a welcome the the Hyatt. The bathroom was nasty with hair all over the shower. The shower nozzle was broken and we had to have engineering come to turn it on. Once it was on the tub filled up with water while you showered. The sheets and comforter were dirty and we had to remake the bed once we got new sheets. The comforter looked like hadn't been washed ever... The;2
I stayed at Morningside Inn for five months while doing an internship in New York. The hotel in itself is not bad for the price, the rooms are ok and itâs not too far from central Manhattan. The night staff are nice and friendly. However, I had problems with the daily manager:  The first incident happened when I was overcharged by $ 1,013 for my rent, two months before it was due â which is a big deal on a student budget.  At first I thought it was a mistake, and when I pointed it out I was told the money would be refunded soon.   However, after two weeks it still hadnât been refunded. When I raised the issue again, the manager flipped completely. He said he had never told me it would be refunded and that it was money that was owed to the hotel. I tried to keep the conversation;2
Well my girlfriend and I decided to stay at the empire hotel in Manhattan but before we decided to stay she showed me pictures of the hotel and it looked amazing the colors were bright and beautiful i told her i didnt want to stay at  a place where the colors were dark and dull so the empire was definitely not that from the pictures that I saw and it looked updated and the rooms looked modern  and well kept so before we got to the hotel my girlfriend called to ask if we can check in early our check in time wasn't until 3pm they said that they couldn't tell us over the phone we would have to go to the hotel so we drove from Jersey to Manhattan only to find out that we have to wait for an hour and half to check in so we sat around because we had no where to go and nodded off;2
It wasnât quite what we were expecting. The room wasnât clean. No mirror in the room. The price for food was way overpriced for the quality of food. We were there mainly for Universal Studio which was pretty nice located. Bathroom doesnât have any air conditioner so make sure you bring a lot of air freshener!;2
Easy to find thanks to it's roof top sign and check in was smooth. Was allocated room 1101 on the 11th floor and although very small looked good.  A/C was on when I arrived and it was  super loud. After a bit of fiddling around with the controls I managed to turn it off but I could still hear A/C noise. I presumed it was coming from an neighboring room and would stop in due course but it wasn't and it NEVER stopped. Turns out my room and all rooms on the courtyard side of the hotel are directly above the hotel's main A/C fans which run 24/7 (see photos) and at night the sound is broadly the same as being on an aircraft. Bring good quality earplugs if you want to sleep!;2
Not sure what is happening at this location. No recognition as a loyal globalist guest. I did receive an upgrade to a very nice suite so that was nice even though just here quick trip.   The hotel is filled with a mix of travelers and mostly families with screaming children. There was a lot of trash strewn all over lobby, elevators, hallways, etc. lack of cleaning crew despite disgusting guests that donât know how to act in public.   The Regency Club was disappointing as well. Usually at evening reception there is a hot dish. There was not only no hot dish but the other snacks were an after thought. Just sad.;2
"Resort fee?  For what?  Two small Fiji waters?  No coffee in room.  No refrigerator. What amenities did my ""fee"" cover?  Tried to check in after 3pm.  Room not ready. No recourse.  Just wait till it's ready. Ameritania is nothing but an old hotel with an over inflated since of itself.  I would rate this hotel at 2.5 vs. a 3.5.";2
We booked our reservation after checking out the website of the hotel.  Looked appealing!!  That's our first mistake! Checked into our room about 3:00pm and promptly realized that there was no air conditioning working and the temp was in the 80's outside.  Called the front desk and I was notified that someone would take care of it immediately. At about 9pm a a/c tech came to out room and told us that he couldn''t fix it and gave us 2 fans.  We were told we would have another room in the am. The next day after continuously calling the front desk,  they moved us to a larger room at around 4pm.  We were not happy as you may have expected.  They offered us breakfast coupons! Well, in the end, they offered us a $100 credit for a room that cost about $400 a night plus tax!  That's;2

Great location but fair hotel. Rooms are very small, with super small bathrooms. Street side rooms are very noisy. We also had rude guests nearby coming and going at all hours slamming their door so that was not great. Hotel itself is no frills has bare bone needs for guests.;2
I'll start with the good points. There aren't many.  +Our room was lovely. 314. It had two large beds, a flat screen TV, HUGE shower as well as a fridge and mircowave. + It was clean.  OK, now for the bad.  - First of all when we arrived, we were told that there was a $100 security deposit. After double/triple checking our reservation details, NOWHERE did it say that this was the case. I've also been advised that a security deposit shouldn't amount to more than one night's stay... which this was. However, front desk wouldn't budge. We found the manner of the people there incredibly patronising and often overbearing. So we handed over the last of our money (cue frantic call to the parents in the UK in the middle of the night) and headed to our room.  - We weren't offered any help;2

I was excited for this hotel due to its proximity to Madison Square Garden. When we arrived, I was happy to see the lobby was beautiful and the front desk staff was very friendly. However, when we got to our first room, it was way too small and we immediately requested a larger room. We did pay an upgrade fee and were moved to a larger room. However- this room was not very clean. The decor was old and dusty and there was black mold around the bathtub and window in the bathroom. We were so uncomfortable that we ended up checking out at midnight without getting any sleep, and just made the 3 hours trip back home. Upon checkout, no one thought it odd to ask why we were leaving so early, but again, the desk clerk was very friendly. I went online to provide this feedback to Wyndham;2
"I was meant to stay at this hotel on the 6th November 2019 after a flight from the UK, but I was taken ill and admitted as an emergency to hospital where I stayed for 7 nights.  I had booked a room at the non-refundable cheaper rate at the Hyatt Regency LAX, big mistake.  On discharged I put in a claim with my travel insurance company who requested that I obtain a ""no show"" letter / email from the hotels where I planned to stay.  I was not seeking a refund, just confirmation that I did not stay at the hotel.  - 20 days ago I put in a request via Hyatts website form - no response.  - 14 days ago I called the Hyatt UK customer service number and they received a refusal from Hyatt LAX's reservation and reception staff, no reason given.  - 5 days ago I sent a letter to the General";2
"Why is there a facility fee aka resort fee for what use to be called amenities? We were charged $31.57 for each night's stay at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. We were informed the fee was for the fitness room, wifi, and unlimited use of the in room phone. Weren't these called amenities a few years ago? People use to book a room based on what the facility had to offer or not offer therefore each facility would try to offer services that possible guests would like. Now like the airlines, hotels are adding fees for services that were standard - i.e. an in room phone for an emergency or for an order of room service. I wonder why is this even part of the nightly rental? Why doesn't the hotel just increase the room per night rental rather than add this ""resort"" fee?  Wyndham New Yorker";2
Small room. We got dirty sheets. And I discovered bites, bedbugs.. Terrible service at check in, the person behind the desk aswered the telephone, and talked for 5 minitues while we just stood there waiting..  Will not stay here again.;2
I wanted to love the Jane. Great location. So tastily decorated. Cool. People that work there nice. Not too expensive by New York standards.  I could even tolerate the tiny rooms because they are so beautifully done but...the airconditioner in my room was so loud and sounded like a 747. It was hot in the city but even hotter in the hotel. The hallways were smelly and humid. When I arrived in my room it was dreadfully hot. You have to insert your key into the wall to turn on the aircon. It took well over an hour for it to be inhabitable. What they don't tell you is there are tenants living in the hotel building so even if you can stand the noise of your aircon in your tiny room...you may not be able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke which wafts into the room from it.

The Rooms are way too small and too dark! No Free Wi-Fi, what is really a joke, I ask for a 6 day fee, and they wanted 70$ for Wifi, what a rip-off. Wi-Fi in the lobby was free, but after there are more than 20 people logged-in, you canÂ´t connect anymore. High-price, low service... will never go back there!;2
This hotel is just overpriced due to its location near UC.  The staffs in the front desk were bad, and the room was old and tired.  Bathtub and sink were both clogged and no one came to fix them.  There was a light bulb went out on the front door.  They came to fix it 2 hrs after I call them, which was ~10PM.  at that point, I just gave up on them.  this hotel is just not well managed and maintained.  Luck them that they are in a good location.   Paying >$200/night was really too much.  I am a Gold HH, but not really matter since we did not get any special treatment or welcoming from anyone in the hotel.  So, don't expect any if you are HH members.;2
No wifi at all for most if my stay, elevator was so horrendously slow, usually wait anywhere from 5-10 min, also got woken up by the phone at 4am because they thought I needed a shuttle to the airport????

The location is amazing however the beds were uncomfortable, no safe for personal belongings, no small fridge for longer stays, no phone to call reception- had to go downstairs for everything. Staff needs to be told to provide fresh towels and clean the room ( despite this - it still may not happen) not easy to access to ice. The washroom ventilation is terrible, after 1 shower you can hardly breathe - itâs too enclosed. Toilet smelled like a urinal at times.;2

Spent two nights here over Thanksgiving. We chose the hotel because it is about three blocks from the apartments where we'd be spending most of our time with family. We are native New Yorkers, and while other visitors may appreciate the relatively quiet, residential Upper West Side location, it helps to know your way around Manhattan if you plan to stay in the neighborhood.  The room was small but relatively tidy. The bed was fine. The bathroom was clean. Those are the pluses.  The minuses were many. The reception area was criminally understaffed, especially for a high-traffic holiday weekend -- it took forever to check in, the computer system was balky, the vibe not very welcoming. There were quite a few foreign guests with limited English, and the few staff members were not;2
Apart from its location, this hotel was dissappointing. The lifts were very problematic thoughout my 10 days stay and it was impactful every day and a constance source of irritation.  Bascially, on a regular basis only 1or 2  of 6 lifts lift was working.  On serveral occasions I had to use the service lift waiting your turn in line...Grrrh!   The room was pleasant enough but the reception area was also a problem given one had to regularly que for long than normally expectered periods to be served. The conceige  service was below average dispensing incorrect  information regarding restaurant opening days. All in all I would avoid this hotel if you have a choice particuarly as they are going to renovate it  & they will run out the old lifts which are unreliable.  Lift rescues;2
Just returned from a 4 night stay. The hotel lobby was Art Deco & impressive but our room left a lot to be desired. We had a twin double bed on the 22nd floor. The room was tiny only just big enough for one double and not at all like the rooms pictured on their website, badly in need of renovation. There was also some outside work going on as there were ropes outside our window but we were out all day so it didn't bother us. Should really have complained & asked to be moved but I'm not one to cause a fuss.  It was easy to get around from there, one block from Penn Station and 10 minute walk to Times Square.;2

It was a great location, for our day in Universal.  We stayed here 3 nights, we managed to get two rooms next to each other that originally they wanted to charge $35 to have your three kids next door to you!  Biggest complaint was no wifi included for a 4 star hotel and the shower was tepid every day, trying to shower three each day and kids were not happy about the cold water.. We were in rooms 754 and 755 so if specific to those rooms, please avoid.  Apart from that it was your normal Hilton.  You had to pay $28 per day to self park also, again we thought this should be included or less.;2
The Ramada Hollywood Hotel is well situated just one block from the Metro Red Line subway and two separate Metro Rapid bus lines. I found the location convenient for business and pleasure and used public transit for the duration of my stay. This hotel is ideal for business travelers and tourists who do not want to rent a car.  Locational advantages notwithstanding, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. During my stay, the hotel itself was sorely lacking on many fronts:  -The elevators are very, very slow, and the stairs are roped off as emergency exits only. -My room (one queen) was smaller than average. -The television set did not work well, and the cable went in and out every night. -The floor in my room was stained, and the comforter was severely worn. -The bathtub was;2
Great location with very friendly staff and good reasonably priced food. The room was advertised and bought as a view over the city. We had an inside room with no view except other hotel rooms. It was noisy from the air condition unit. It was the darkest room I have ever spent time in and spoils the hotel. Also advertised an apple docking station which was also not there.;2

He was inspired to give us a different, bigger room a a free drink to his credit.  I would have been happier with free wifi in the room.  Bigger = more dirt.  I booked through an express deal on Priceline, so I couldn't choose the hotel.  I know this hotel was among the options based on my specs, but I ignored the tripadvisor red flags (for the last time).  The bottom line is that that the location is about all this hotel has going for it and it's 4 star rating does not live up to comparable";2

I booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The only plus point was its proximity to the metro station. Rest I did not feel it was a hotel. It gave the feeling of an avrage bed and breakfast. Right from the staff at the front desk to the house keeping all are always ready to say no. We asked for an extra stool to keep our luggage as I had a back problem and could not bend. The plain answer was no. The room size was good. But there are no cupboards. Its all in the open. The bed was ok although the pillows were horrible. Requested to change them but they did not. They say that breakfast is free however there is nothing much than an omelette and waffle station.

The rooms were adequate but comfortable, although the carpet in my room seemed ""dirty"" and needed a good hovering! However, the second night into our stay and my toilet blocked and flooded the bathroom!  A man was sent up immediately to (successfully) unblock the toilet, saying the problem was because the plumbing was old.  However, I know for a fact that during the week we stayed there a further 2 toilets became blocked, causing flooding to the rooms below them!

I have to say that the staff were wonderful and were always willing to help, however the majority of them were not fluent in English which might have led to other people perceiving as being rude.

Rather than air our the particulars, I will report that the hotel is perfectly situated across from Universal Studios and thus very convenient.  The hotel is under going renovations in the lobby/restaurant area, so it is very noisy and there is no main restaurant.  Everyone is crammed into the bar area for breakfast.  Elevators are extremely slow and they warn of this in a letter on the desk in your room.  We were there to see a concert at the Hollywood Bowl.  Plan extra time to get there from the hotel as the Bellman has no clue on how to call cabs.  Front desk and security staff need to be trained on how to check in and return lost property.  Bar staff was wonderful.;2
This is not a hotel but a bed & breakfast without the breakfast. The location is excellent I must admit, but this is as good as it gets. It is noisy during the night and from dawn onwards but this is NY. First of all, if you are unlucky enough to travel on your own, you will be checked in in a single room which is less than 4sq.m. There is no wardrobe, so unless if you are a guy travelling in your jeans and T, you have a serious problem. There is nowhere to put your suitcase so you have to open it on your bed, get your stuff out and then close it everynight so that it can fit in the room (unless you wanna block the back of your door which I do not recommend in case of an emergency). The bathroom is so small and hot that you do not want to spent one minute there. In addition, its;2

The wait for the elevators was extremely long sometimes taking over 20min to go down from the 12th floor of my room to the Lobby.  I had to call the front desk to get someone to stop on my floor as elevators were bypassing my floor. This created business delays as I was on a business trip with time constraints.;2
After checking in,and trying to get a elevator to work we entered our room,we booked a superior double, but the first problem we noticed was the terrible noise coming from a very large generator, The sound was deafening! We spoke to reception and they told us that the Hotel was fully booked...Wrong, we left the room and went down to reception. They allocated us another room, on a different floor facing the street, the sound of traffic was considerably better than the noise coming from the generator. The bathroom was very basic and needs a facelift ASP. A very run down Hotel but in a great position,also a great disappointment was the rooftop bar and pool area which was closed, except for a evening doo. For over 300 guests. Would we stay there again ....not a chance;2
It is a very average hotel with extremely bad customer service. First, my husband needed to print out a document and was told that they could not provide such a service. Then some packages were sent to him during his stay. And although we contacted the hotel in advance to ask if there would be any fee and was told that none, at the moment of getting them he was charged 2 dollars per box. When asked why we were told there would be no charge, the answer was that probably it had been a trainee who said that by mistake, but they do not care and we must pay. It turned out that one of the packages was going to arrive late, at the day of leaving the hotel. We offered to pay for re-sending this item to another US address, but got a refusal in a rude form.

We decided to stay at this hotel for a lay over for our flight. The staff was professional and courteous.  I stayed March 30th and I went to the lounge for dinner. The menu was average. I was not very hungry so I decided on the chicken lettuce wraps. I only ate half of the meal and I got so sick. This is my second day home and I cannot do any of the activities I planned.  Because of this experience I will give the hotel a 2 star and I would definitely not stay here again;2

"Major problem with the elevators- it took me 20' to ""escape"" (that's what it felt like!) from my room to the lobby, this morning, and every trip from the 24th floor took at least ten minutes. management openly acknowledges the problem with signs and notices in the rooms. They are renovating the elevator system.  The staff is quite apologetic. I get it, and it is not the staff's fault.  However: I also run a business, and I don't sell capacity that I cannot service. You either have to cut back on rooms sold, or perhaps charge less. You just can't have it both ways and get your property renovated at the expense of your loyal customers.  Fail!";2

"What brought me to use this Hilton was location, proximity to Universal Studios.  After staying at the hotel, I'd have to say that is still the best thing about the hotel.  I'm sure that the hotel chain doesn't use this particular hotel as their ""Flagship"". For the cost, I'd say that there are a few things that are substandard.  The following are included.  Hotel staff willingness to resolve problems.  I found that the front desk and guest services to be too willing to ""pass-the-buck"".  I had asked for resolution to problems and was informed that ""I"" needed to direct my queries to some other hotel section (I needed to track down the appropriate person).

It was really disappointing. I booked two rooms for three nights and immediately want to check out after walking into the room. It was too late to cancel and I felt bad because I took my family here. 1. I was told at the front desk that there is 39 resort fee per night. When I ask what they offer out of the resort fee, they said it was actually facility fee they charge everyone including wifi and business center, fitness center etc...It felt like a random additional charge, PLUS the keys they gave me didnât even work for the gym! (Later I have to go ask them to add it) . 2. The room was very small and old. AC was loud with some random noise if you keep it open. No coffee machine, fridge, face tissues, which you would expect from a normal hotel room. Considering this is a;2
Stayed here for 4 nights with my sister in law for her first visit to NYC. Disappointed is an understatement. We had been told the hotel had been upgraded but the hotel looked tired in most places.  Our room was tiny!!!  and on the side of the street where construction drilling continued throughout the night! ð staff didnât seem to care about this. The beds were comfortable once we eventually got to sleep!  John on concierge was really helpful but the other staff I didnât find at all helpful.  The redeeming feature was the tick tock diner attached to the hotel who served great food and the staff were really attentive.  The hotel is centrally located within a short walking distance of times sq etc so a good spot in terms of location but the hotel is definitely in need of some;2
Heat ceased twice. Had to go to the front desk in person to ask to that the engineer be sent up. On checkout was not asked how was my stay so I volunteered that the heat was inoperative in the room. I was met with a cavalier indifference. Would have thought that they would want the information so that it could be repaired for the next guest.;2
First, I went back and forth from a 2 to 3 rating, but ultimately went with the 2.  The hotel staff was excellent and extremely helpful (which is the highlight of the hotel).  The room was very clean as was the bathroom and the shuttle to Universal was a great convenience (save your money and refrain from renting a vehicle - you won't need it).  Now the problems...   What ultimately upset me the most was the noise.  We stayed on the 22nd floor and were awoken in the very early hours of the morning by what sounded like furniture being drug across the floor.  We finally decided to call the front desk and were told that security would go to the floor above us to see what was happening.  After 15-20 minutes and the noise only getting louder, we called back only to be told that the;2
First, the location is fabulous. Second, all the things that went wrong-- the heat would not go off in the room and the window that looked out on an alley didn't open, they sent someone immediately. That was great. The hallways and rooms were so cramped it was like being on a ship. No bathtub, just this shower thing with no door so the water sprays all over the tiny bathroom. The check in staff was really nice, the check out, Oh my gosh, terrible! Didn't want  to give me a receipt because her printer was broken, and she'd have to use the other one exactly 3 feet away!!! Then I discovered they kept a $400 dollar hold on my credit card, even though I paid cash, 4 days later when I went to try to pay for groceries and my card was denied. Fun.

The hotel seemed an ideal choice for us, given its location. Immediately the staff seemed friendly and the lobby was beautiful but that soon changed when we went to our room and were greeted by a brick wall view from our windows. The room was grey, grubby, dark and depressing. It was filled with plenty of snacks, water and a well stocked fridge. Unfortunately even a small bottle of Fiji water was $5 so we didnât touch hardly anything. However, upon checking out we were still billed $60. I also left a couple of t-shirts in one of the draws and phoned them to explain but it soon became obvious that Iâd never see them again. We felt that the hotel spoiled our trip given how horrid the room was, I wouldnât recommend it to my worst enemy.;2

The hotel obviously have no control over but deny these are regular (I found 6 other reviews on here confirming this and their refusal to compensate), even the Police are aware and attended.

They also said, you have it all left to pay. Untrue. I was exhausted after a long haul flight and did not really take in what the difference was, unpacked and realized: no tub. Usual tiny, cramped New York hotel room with a view of a sheer wall of bricks. Wrong room.

I dont think this place is to bad. I mean, it's cheap- what do you expect!  Most of the people are friendly and I find the staff try to help out where they can.  It's cheap and in a great location.  Like most hostels, you need your own cutlery, cooking utensils etc They have internet, massive tv in tv room (although not enough seating), laundry (although a bit pricey)  Only problem I have encountered is trying to change rooms and bedbugs in previous room, although if you tell them they spray your room and things and if it persists, will move you to another room.  Some of the toilets are dirty- but i put that down to dirty people living there, not the staff. I have noticed they clean the bathrooms, floors and toilets every day and your room is hoovered and sheets changed weekly.;2

Offered room upgrade by email  with pictures of newly renovated ,city view ,larger room with two queen beds . Arrived received dark dingy small room with double beds and a view of the alley. When I complained to manager he said they had no queen sized beds in the hotel only double or kings and the upgrade we were offered didnât exist. We could barely fit the dog kennel (there for Westminster) between the beds.  By decor hadnât been renovated since the seventies.;2
We stayed in a 1 bedroom and it did not at all look like the pictures of the website.  They had scratches on the walls, the second television did not work, and the room was depressing.  The location is great but the service was not.  When I asked for a box for cable for the television that had nothing they said only one of the televisions were for cable and the other was for dvds.  They never sent the dvd box after I requested it.   Also a fire alarm went off at 2am.  When I called the front desk to ask about it they just hung up the phone.  When I tried to call back they wouldn't pick up.  I never asked for anything extreme just at least the minimum of what a person would expect when they arrive to stay at a place that is paid for (i.e. cleanliness, working televisions, basic;2
Stayed in a double room on the 22nd floor - honestly itâs like stepping back in time! View was non existent couldnât even see the kind of weather or how to dress appropriately for the day! Didnât mind the room been compact and it was clean but honestly in need of the biggest makeover, carpet so worn, decor so dingy and window is tapped up with black tape! It was clean with fresh towels but lord god invest in it as a result I wouldnât return! Staff were nice and security at lifts was excellent! Could be such an amazing hotel if money was invested in it!  I find this very disappointing personally!  Good location for sightseeing however the streets leading off from it or so polluted with drug users itâs hard to believe!;2
The only good thing about this place is the proximity to Universal Studios.  The beds are not comfortable, only 3 of 5 elevators work and one that works jerks and misses floors.  You have to wait a long time to get in to the elevator.  There is also a very long line for breakfast, expensive, mediocre food, and service will put on the bill if you stand up as if you cannot get a second helping for fruits after your meal.  Room is expensive and you are better off going a little farther and get more bang for your buck.;2
I stayed at the Empire Hotel from July 16 to July 21 (work trip). I had fine experiences with the Empire in the past, so I decided to stay there again. The hotel is conveniently located and has a nice rooftop terrace one can enjoy after a long day of meetings.   After checking in, I realized the rooftop was closed, and so was the gym. All that had not been notified to me by the hotel or the travel agent upon booking. On Wednesday night, getting back to my room around 10pm after a long day, I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that my room had not been cleaned, the sheets and pillows were in a mess, and in the middle of the bed I found... tweezers (see photos). Needless to say the tweezers were not mine. I rushed down to the reception and inquired whether it would be possible;2
On arrival got told we had to pay a deposit fee of Â£215! Be aware of this on arrival, we had absolutely no idea, booked through virgin holidays and was told nothing about this. The hotel, i found was quite scary and out dated. Walls in the corridors are filthy. Ancient carpets in the hall ways and rooms. Pictures online paint a different story to what you're getting. The location of the hotel being the only positive. I was looking at the reviews while i was staying here and saw people mention a facility fee of $35 a night!!!! We went to check if this applied to us, luckily it didnt as virgin holidays cover it.   If you're staying here just be prepared to have your wallet emptied, so bring extra cash!  $5 also to store your bags for the day, not a lot but still, wow!!! How is;2

"I will try to be as fair as possible with this hotel but it will be difficult to do so.  I understand that some of the things I will mentioned are not easy to resolve or/and are not up to management to change (specially room decor)  We checked in on 5/13 and out on 5/14.  The GOOD. - Customer service - Doorman and reception person did a great job by making us feel welcome. Suggestion - they should use their names when greeting their names.  - Lobby - If you are into old decor or animals hanging from walls then you will enjoy the theme around the lobby. (Lobby is fairly small) - Room - Beds are small but comfortable. - Rooms are equipped with minibar/snack-bar - nice touch; fair prices. - Bathroom - had 2 bathrobes and slippers; was not expecting it and I think it was a nice";2
Hotel lobby feels like a hostel or train station. No ambience and always busy. Charged a facility fee for Wi-fi that wasnât clear in online booking. Charged for storing bags after checkout. First time ever for me!  Corridor to room stank. Room narrow and lacking any charm and tiny bathroom with nowhere to put anything. Tick tick diner for breakfast, surly staff.  Good location for subway, Times Square and high line were the only good things.;2

Stayed here from 28th of December until 2nd of January. Reception is lovely, security and door men are lovely and helpful. Girls at reception who I dealt with were not so friendly or helpful. Room was tiny, you will bump in to the person you are with getting from one end to the other. Very dated tired rooms. Radiator wasnât on at all only AC. I booked a standard queen room, there was nothing queen about the small double bed. Told reception who said I got what I paid for after paying â¬350 a night for room only. I understand youâre in New York City but for a 4 star hotel there has to be some standards. Paid the $45 a night fee for extras. I didnât have any extras so got a refund for this when I got home. 3 days later this refund was reverted without notifying me. So â¬200 taken;2
The room we stayed in was tiny (not enough space to lay down a large suitcase), dingy and so outdated. I couldn't walk barefoot, disgusted how soiled with dirt the carpet was. And the bathroom...UGH! No proper exhaust and space to put your toiletries. Bed was lumpy and so uncomfortable. Small TV, no mini ref nor coffee maker. Don't get lured with the low promotional rates posted with third party agencies since there are additional hotel charges.The only redeeming factor is the location if you want to be in the garment district and Korea town. The metro (Penn station) is only a minute walk and about a block from Madison Square Garden and about 3 blocks to the Empire State. They offer valet parking but you have to allot wait time of about 15-20 minutes before you get your car.;2
disappointed wife booked hotel basis good reviews trip advisor, disappoionted, room bathroom big good value staff unfriendly, breakfast just ok asked extra bread example served begrudgingly, surly staff atmosphere hotel bad definitely not stay recommend look accommodation,  ;2
After departing from a nasty Air BnB we had booked and sadly paid for we had to look for a budget hotel and chose Days Inn. Very pleasant reception staff on arrival and during our stay, nice looking foyer. Sadly the room wasn't nice or pleasant however, in need of an overhaul especially the bathroom which was a bit evil and for some reason had no cold water just warm and hot! No fridge in the room just a space where one once lived. Hotel is close to Subway and not too noisy apart from the A/C units or ice machine if you are unfortunate enough to score that. Felt it was a bit overpriced for what you get. A spruce up with some paint or even clean grout would help a lot!;2
The location is fab. However on departure they claimed we were due to be charged an additional fee that wasnât included in our confirmation, despite our confirmation stating all fees and taxes were included. No explanation of this fee or communication from them since our stay when Iâve queried it and followed up.  So beware leaving your card and insist on a receipt which the receptionist did not give me.;2
I had the do not disturb sign on my room but the maid knocked once and just proceeded into my room when I was trying to catch up on sleep before check out. There is no meaning to the sign if they are going to ignore it. Walls are not soundproof and I could hear music from another room. Overall, not satisfied as I couldn't get much rest  Also, valet parking fee is way too expensive.;2
"The rooms are VERY small. The showers are poorly designed and will get your tiny bathroom soaked. The lobby AC is never below 80. It is impossible to get any staff on the phone -concierge, front desk, room service, etc'- forcing you to go down there physichally for a simple question or request. Even the bellman at the front door enthusiastically agreed and disclosed that ""everyone"" complains about the above. The lobby is beautiful, rooms are tiny and average in nature.";2
My husband, 2 daughters (ages 3 & 9) and I stayed here last weekend.  I was so excited to stay here cause it was SO CLOSE to Universal Studios.  Well, the price was pushing our budget but I accepted it.  When we arrive, we find out about the $22.00 per day PARKING FEE!  SURPRISE!!!!  Irritaed with that, there was nothing I could do.  There went our extra money for souvenairs.  Our view of the freeway sucked but at least we could see the pool.  We went to Universal Studios all day then took a walk through Universal City Walk before it started to rain.  We decided to eat back at the hotel (in the bar area- cheaper) and it was the WORST SERVICE I have ever had in my life!  The kids were already tired , I had to get up and ask the waitress everytime we needed anything and then they;2
My husband and I spent  Valentine's night at the Hilton.  The room had a beautiful view and the staff was very nice.  However, I woke up the next morning with bug bites on my body.  My lucky husband only found a couple of bites on his body.  The hotel took a report and apologized.  That was it.  Right now I'm in the process of washing all the clothes we wore.  I hope we didn't bring home whatever bit us.  Even though everyone was nice, I'll never go back there again.  I have traveled a great deal, and this is the first time I've ever encountered this problem.;2
The room was clean which is the only reason I didn't give this place a 1star review, the location was also close to a subway stop and right across from central park so getting around was easy. The room smelled strongly of chemicals and barely big enough for two people with luggage to be comfortable in. I wouldn't call what you're provided to sleep on a bed, more like a thick futon pad on the floor. Bathroom looked like it was recently redone but the shower was AWFUL water barely trickled out of the shower head. Also the man at the front desk was very rude. Next time I come to NYC I'll spend a little more on my accommodations, I wouldn't recommend this place.;2
- stayed there for 2 nights, three beds with shared bathroom - room was small for three people, it was clean though, comes with a small cabinet, dresser and tv - good location, subway metro and subway fastfood is within walking distance - be warned though, cleanliness of a shared bathroom depends on who you're sharing it with   - if you choose a shared bathroom, make sure to bring flip flops/ bathroom slippers (so that you wouldn't have to be on-foot on a dirty bathroom floor);2

Poor front desk service. No hot water on one day as early as 8AM. A child had to take cold shower. Location very convenient to the Universal studio. Don't stay if you are also looking for good service. If the room is not ready, they will not check you in and you have to come back and stay in line again. Even promised, will not send you a text message that room is ready.;2
I am going to start off by stating the good things about the hotel. -The hotelâs location is fantastic. If you are staying in the city after an event at Madison Square Garden, this is steps away and is the place to stay.  -The staff is very friendly. -The hotel is very clean.   Now the bad.  -The âFacilities Feeâ is obscene and misleading. To charge almost $40 a day for the use of a gym, that most people are not  going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong. I expected more from a Wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee.  -In spite of paying the âFacilities Feeâ, there wasnât even a coffee maker in the room. Come on, even when you stay at Motel 6, there is a coffee maker in the room.  -The room;2

"I would NOT recommend this hotel. I should have known that the price was a reflection of the quality of the place. I got a booking through Hotels.com for $160.00 for this ""air-conditioned"" hotel on the Upper West Side of NYC. I was there to do research at Columbia University so I needed to be close, which is why I chose this spot. The hotel was perfectly located, so I booked it. When I got there, the front door of the lobby was open and there was no air conditioning on. When I asked about that, the desk clerk said a guest who had been waiting for a ride was cold and had asked them to turn it off. That seemed weird, but I shrugged it off. I was in and out of that lobby for 3 days and never felt cool while there. When I got in my room, there was literally no room in the room to";2
This hotel was an ugly surprise! Everything positive about this hotel is outside its building: Location, restaurants, shopping. Housekeeping staff, friendly and efficient,and that's it. We had just two channels to watch on the room tv.I told the lobby staff about and they didn't care about it,zero reponse!! And the worst of it: when we checked out, we were literally harrassed by an african american security guard from the hotel, very agressive, pushy and abussive, ungentle!!! He totally disregarded the fact that I was travelling with my mother, an elder woman.She got really scared and nervous by the threatening attitude of this caveman!!! Some personnel is out of control!!! There is no one to report this outrageous behavior to.;2
The location is close to Penn Station so it is possible to get there from other main line stations and the airport without any problem.  There is also a tube line that runs the length of Manhattan. Although the location is good, the hotel is in need of decoration and repair, the whole place looks tired.  The bedrooms are small and dated and all furnishing has seen better days. Checking in can take a while, there is always a huge line. On the brighter side the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water and towels. The  gym was good and not crowded.;2

My room really needed some maintenance and updating.  The bed 'listed' and the toilet ran.  It was stuffy and stale throughout my stay.  The lighting in the room was so poor I couldn't even read by the light of the reading lamp. The restaurant was very overpriced and the food was not good (had a $20 hamburger and fries and the fries were old!) On the positive side, the staff was amazing!;2
This place has the potential to be awesome - great location, cool decor and long history. Sadly it is let down by a number of things.   When we arrived we were put on level 4 and no sooner had we put our bags down we noticed a strong smell of cigarette smoke coming into our room followed by the smell of cooking. This smell continued for some time so I spoke to a staff member who advised me that it was due to permanent residents that reside at the hotel. These permanent residents are those that remain from when the Jane was  used as low cost housing. So essentially you're sharing with residents of a boarding house.   Luckily we were immediately offered a new room but had to wait till the following night to stay on a level without any smokers (levels 3 and 4 have smokers).;2
Arrived at Hollywood only to see its not a great area and not particularly safe, only to be checked in by a lovely lady who told us she had two kids we never got her name but she was great.  Went to our room put on the five minute preview of music only for the five minutes to pass and us be instantly charged $14.99, that I can deal with BUT when going onto another menu to look at other channels you wipe off the music so if you return to listen to the music you had already bought, think again as they charge you another $14.99. So I had less than 1 minute of music for $14.99 only to be told its non refundable and there's no point seeing the manager as he never waivers fees! Not that he was ever available to complain to!  The shower curtain was half hanging off the wall along with;2

We chose the Morningside Inn for itâs upper west side location and value pricing.  We reserved a superior 1 room which had an ensuite bath and a tv.  The room was very small and Spartan, but that is to be expected for a budget hotel in New York. The room was clean and the bathroom had been updated.  The elevator is small, but even though the hotel was full, we never had to wait very long. The worst part about our stay was the bed.  It was very uncomfortable â you could feel every spring in the mattress. The pillows were also terrible.  The tv was mounted next to the head of the bed, making it awkward to watch. The location was ideal for us.  The subway is a few blocks away.  The hotel is located between Amsterdam and Broadway. Both of these streets are lined with cafes, so there;2

I read the reviews on this hotel the day before I travelled. I was really worried that my eagerly anticipated trip would be ruined.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be way too generous but, it was not as bad as I had been led to believe. The room was on the 2nd floor so the lifts were no problem, although I preferred the stairs as the lifts looked like they would break down any second. The room itself was pitch black even during the day! This was due to the windows being obscured by polythene sheeting. It was very dark. The bathroom was light and clean, the towels were changed every day. More towels were requested and were left the next day. The beds were large and comfortable, the matresses were clean and the sheets were too. These were changed everyday. The floor was;2
"Hotel was clean but room was tiny and painted an horiffic green colour with a view of a cement wall. There was a phone in the room which was very convenient as we could call reception to find out what the weather was like in the mornings. The view from the hall was was only slightly worse - curling barbed wire fencing. When I arrived the porter watched me struggle up the lift with my luggage without offering to help. The key, (yes and actually key) didn't work so I had to struggle back down and the porter had to come up and show me the trick of lifting the door handle, pulling it toward you before turning the key. My sister and I took turns trying to open the room door at night as it was almost impossible.  The Wi Fi was ""not working"" the 4 days of our stay with the hotel and we";2
I was there for a business trip . The location was great as it is close to a lot of places of interest. But I found my room to be generally dirty as the walls had stains , curtains and Windows  were dirty as well as dusty vents . I expected the rooms to be up to the standards featured on their website but it was nothing like it! I will not recommend it unless you don't mind paying for an expensive hotel but feeling like you are in a motel on the road!;2
"As it turned out, this was not a good choice after all. We chose this hotel because of its alleged proximity to Columbia University, where we would be attending a conference for a few days. It turned out that the walk there is at least 20-25 minutes, which in the cold rain, it was not fun. One good thing was the nice umbrella that came with the room and we could borrow. BUT THE KILLER, and what you should BE AWARE OF, is that the hotel will charge you $19.98 PER DAY, whether you want it or not, for Wi-Fi service, access to 7,000 electronic newspapers, etc., and a whole bunch of unnecessary ""services"" that would go on for free in any other hotel or at least included in the price.

"Convienent Upper West  Side location to Central Park, Columbia University, eclectic dining and public transportation. Other than that, rooms are extremely small with bare bones furnishings  ----- definitely a no frills place. Room and bathroom were clean, although bathroom could use some refurbishing. Staff not overly friendly. For $155 and a one night stay it was tolerable. The hotel advertises recent updates, yet I think this applies only to the new lobby doors (which, by the way, open opposite to what one expects; push to get in and pull to go out; I thought all egress doors had to open outward, not inward, but perhaps NYC has different regulations). Doubt that I will ever book or recommend this to a friend.";2

Understandably hotels in NYC are expensive, but I feel like deception was used in the advertising of this hotel. Their website shows a sparkling exterior, grand entrance, and modern rooms, but suspiciously no photos of the hallways or bathrooms- and for good reason. The entire building feels like itâs about to fall down around you at any minute. The stairs are crumbling and you can barely turn around in the tiny elevator. The bathroom had horrid lighting and the floors all felt dirty (and the carpets were stained). I felt nervous to take off my shoes. Our door did not have a deadbolt although there was a sign âreassuringâ us that the door locked automatically.   Lastly, besides the $20 residence fee/ night being absurd, we were not able to refuse it even based on the fact we;2
When you pay this much for a hotel you expect absolute top service. When we arrived the staff at reception were nonchalant, rather than welcoming. We were also surprised with a $25 fee Per night fee for use of facilities (which includes the business centre and gym both of which we have no intention of using on a holiday) and were told it was mandatory. There is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and we only discovered on the last night that you are able to ask for a coffee maker to be sent to your room - I only discovered this as I was feeling unwell and asked for hot water - it took 45 minutes for the machine to be delivered to the room. Water pressure in shower is poor and water gets colder as the day goes by. Despite all this the location is fantastic, the beds are;2
Traveling solo I did not mind the smallish room which I thought was nicely appointed.  The bathroom was fine, hot water plentiful and nice rainfall shower.  Maid service was excellent.  (I did not use the internet or room service.  Nor did I eat the pricey snacks and coffee in the room.) Despite the positives, the big problem that overwhelmed all else was the very noisy fan in the air conditioning unit which literally sounded like a working lawnmower motor.  I tried two rooms and was finally told by staff that the air conditioning units were noisy in ALL the rooms.  I had to turn the air conditioning unit off to sleep.  Fortunately the weather was cool so while the room was warm and stuffy at night it was survivable.  Otherwise I would have immediately changed hotels despite the;2
Don't be fooled by the trendy low-lit lobby which broadcasts coolness.  The Empire is, as its name suggests, a representation of a bygone age. The rooms are small and ventilation poor with archaic old ventilation systems and dirty controls. We moved rooms but our first sucked in the aroma of a restaurant. The bathrooms are small and you can barely move in them. The suites are the best value and best rooms but cone at a price.  Finally a word about the location - stunning. So you need to recognise you will need to compromise if you want to stay there. It could be so much better but that would come with a price. I fear a continued lack of investment will mean it descends in future years.;2

The only good thing is the front desk people and the subway nearby. The hotel smells weed and cigarettes and the lobby and the elevators are dirty. The room was clean but everything in it is too old. The tv has a few chanals with a poor quality, the bad was very uncomfortable, the bathtub need to be repared, it gets stuck all the time. We must wating for 15 to 20 minutes after putting the water on to have a hot water for a shower and in the bathroom was too much cold. The heating makes a terrible noise so you cannot sleep when it is on. So I realy do not recommend this hotel.;2
Let's us start with the good: location location location. The room is laugh out loud small. Barely enough room for the bed- there is basically no place to stand or get dressed. One small person would fit well here. Charge 3 dollars for instant coffee when there is a Starbucks downstairs. Bathroom is ALL form over function. Shower sprays on the floor. Water damage on the door from too much water on the floor. No counter space. Two few towels. No garbage can. Sink sprays when you wash your hands. Weird (two) shower head that is not self explanatory and soaks you when you turn it on. AC heating system was on blowing hot and cold air simultaneously. Mini bar is cute if you are looking for a tote bag, a vibrator or a iPhone charger. Lots of alcohol for purchase and a fridge if you;2

Service at hotel was not great. There were very few people checking in and it took 20 minutes before I was attended to. Later, I went to ask a question at the front desk...no other customer was there and front desk employees were talking to each other in the office behind the front desk with their backs to me. When they saw I was there they went inside the office and shut the door so I couldn't hear what they were saying. In addition, the pipes in the hotel were backed up...took an hour or so for water in the bathroom sink to empty.;2
Got an upgrade to the room with a fabulous view. Room was clean. Location of hotel is great. But room was super small. Hotel needs some renovation. Unlike other hotels, here Covid used as an excuse not to store luggage. I can't walk around with 2 suitcases, it's so uncomfortable!;2

The Jane is a budget hotel in an excellent location within the meatpacking district of nyc. The style of the hotel is very quirky and the shared toilets are some of the cleanest and best maintained I've seen. This said, it is not a hotel I would recommend based on my experience. Staff across the hotel were consistently unwelcoming and at times it would say verging on rude. We stayed in one of the bunk bed cabin rooms. While I understand this is a budget option these rooms are NOT appropriate for two people with bags. They were cramped and uncomfortable. Finally the rooftop bar which had been a selling point for us to book is only open Thursday to Sunday. We found this disappointing. All in all we felt the idea of the hotel was on the right lines but it fell extremely short on;2
A plus for this is the free shuttle from LAX, but I find the washroom to be made of cheap material. The showerhead had sharp edges and it poked me in the skin. For the price, I prefer the Hyatt Centric in Long Beach better.;2

The lady that checked us in had a bad attitude and was less than helpful. We were told our room would be ready at 12 noon to check into. We left Universal, went back at 12:30 and it was not ready and when I told her that we were told it would be ready, she seemed irritated at US and seemed to have a bad attitude about it. She didn't say much and kept sighing like we were an inconvenience. We go to Universal Studios on a very regular basis (about every 2 months) and we were very excited to stay here, as it is close and we wouldn't have to drive home to Ventura afterward. The room, the price and the attitude we received I felt was poor and we will check out the Sheraton next time. I also felt that room quality was VERY poor for the price. Great view, but that's about it.;2
Unfortunately this was the only hotel in this travel (in a total of 3) or in all others travels that provided a room whit only 1 bed for 2 adults and 2 children as previously informed in the hotel reservation. For my surprise when I told to the manager that has a mistake and we need an extra bed because we are 4 the manager told that we need to pay US$ 234 for 6 days extra bed. Frustrating experience because the hotel is nice and this kind of attitude shows some way to get a fake price when you make the reservation.;2

The hotel itself is very nice. Great bar, service, and location. However, the company's customer service is TERRIBLE! When I called the number on the website, I never was able to reach an actual person at the front desk.  There was a major storm in NY that caused me to have to change flights, but because I couldn't reach anyone at the hotel, I couldn't change my hotel reservation and so I ended being charged for two nights instead of one.  To get my receipt I had to call several times because the rude customer service staff kept transferring my call to a number where no one answered. Then they said that it may take 24 hours to email it to me. Makes no sense. It's a nice hotel, but not worth the trouble.;2
I was very disappointed with the amenities of the hotel. The bathroom and plumbing were horrible and the heating units were ancient. I really was expecting more for the price paid. We had to change rooms mid-stay because of the poor conditions of the plumbing and the toilet getting clogged, among other things;2

We stayed for two nights in July 08.  If you are staying in winter then this hotel is probably okay, BUT not summer!  When we first arrived we were given keys to our room, only to go up and find the room was full of rubbish.  Then we were shown two rooms, and told we could have whichever one we wanted, but one didn't have a key, and we would have to get staff to let us in every time??  So, we took the third option, and the room was small and clean - no complaints there, but the airconditioning is fan only.  It was so hot that I nearly passed out (and we're from a hot part of the world so I should be used to it).  Each night before going to bed, and again when waking up we would have to stand in the hall and fan as much air into the room as possible.  The windows did not open so;2
New York, USA:  Astor On The park, New York City: Initially a big disappointment. Date:  December 6th - December 12th 2008.  Arrived early pm and initial impression was 'OH MY GOD'. Our hotel room was a very small bedroom approx 5m x 4m. The bathroom was clean and the bed was queen sized for my daughter and i. The room had just been painted and the smell of paint was unberable. We decided we were not staying there and went to reception to ask for another room.  We were offered another room, smaller than the first, if that was possible!! Again we refused and were offered another room with a view of the garbage bins and old patio furniture. This was the last straw. Again back to reception and asked for a refund to find this was not possible. We were then given another room, king;2
My husband and I spent two nights here. We didn't mind the tiny bunk-bed room (we understood what we were booking) or the shared bathrooms (though there aren't quite enough stalls for all the rooms on our floor). Those we expected. But I strongly recommend against staying here in the winter, because the heating system is so overpowering that you have to run the air conditioner all night just too keep from suffocating and there's nothing the staff can do to fix it (we called down and asked). And, the wifi almost never worked during our stay and was made even more difficult by not being able to get good cell phone reception anywhere in the hotel. With a better HVAC system and reliable wifi, I think this hotel would be quite charming (and it is a good location, though a long walk;2

We staying in this hotel for two nights in room 1065 last week. The hotel/room/location was lovely however we were extremely disappointed the first day we checked in that the pool was closed due to a sanitation issue. Our first day was the one and only day we were able to enjoy the pool area and after travelling around America for couple of weeks we were very much looking forward to this. Later that evening we received a letter under our door advising we could use a neighbouring pool the next day, however we had a Vip universal pass arranged therefore we were unable to take advantage of this. If we had been advised of this earlier in the day (as pool had been closed since the early afternoon) then we would have been able to do so. We chose this hotel due to the location at;2
I called the Universal Hilton directly at 1:13pm on Friday August 5 to resolve an issue with the credit card I had in file(my bank cancelled card a few weeks ago due to a breach at a local Wendy's). After sitting on hold for 10 minutes, I spoke with a gentleman who updated my new card info.  I asked him if the update resolved the issue and if my reservation was still in good standing.  He stated he assumed it did.  I told him I was checking in tomorrow(Sat Aug 6) and that I needed better than an assumption.  He then told me he connect me directly to a booking agent.  After a few more minutes on hold, another gentleman picked up my call. I said hello and began briefly to restate my concern.  In the middle of my speaking, he said something and then threw me back into their phone;2

"I stayed at this hotel because I had business meetings in the neighborhood-- which I must say is in a very ugly part of LA. I won't stay here again nor recommend it to anyone.   This is a hotel that is past its prime. The rooms are ugly, 80s decor and the furnishings are old and neglected. There are scuffs and stains all over the walls; I found an old tea bag in the corner under a big splatter mark (obviously a previous occupant attempting to throw it in the garbage) which went unnoticed by housekeeping.   The room had a dorm fridge (which froze my salad) with an old microwave stacked on top of it haphazardly. There was also a space heater, which we didn't need to use. In our room there was a constant, loud hum of machinery operating. When I called to request a room change";2

Im really disappointed with Jane. OK, its great location and its really cheap for single travelers, but nothing else. I read in some flight magazine that Jane is really hot spot in NY. It was quite a few of us traveling, only us two a couple so it sounded like a good choice. Unfortunately it was quite cold with Hudson wind, and all double rooms are on that side. With really bad windows and hardly any heating it was just freezing, but not cold, really freezing. After bloking window with all towels and asking for more blankets we slept in all our clothes. All the single rooms were like sauna on the other hand... Unfortunately the stuff didnt meet expectation during the fight with cold...  And the rooms are smelly.  Ok its cheap but you can find a better double for this price.;2

I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of February, 2008. I was travelling as part of a school group. The first point I will make is that it is very common for school groups to stay here, and naturally good behaviour is not a guarantee - though I'd like to think my group was reasonably behaved! If this is likely to bother you, I strongly recommend looking for somewhere else to stay during your trip.  We had a couple of issues with our room. Firstly, a pressure nozzle in the radiator would occasionally release, leaving steam hissing out for a time quite frequently. Colourfully described by my roommate as sounding like 'two mice having a fry-up', the noise was initially irritating but eventually became white noise. Secondly, the provided hair dryer broke after giving;2

Our group stayed for 4 nights (I stayed 6) and we definitely got a feel for the facilities and surrounding area.  Some observations: - The rooms and bathrooms are laughably small (even for NYC).   - I do not see the value for the cost of this hotel (I moved to a different hotel that was a few blocks away for the last two evenings).  The new hotel was on a quiet street vs 8th Ave, was over $100 cheaper, and was better in every single aspect. - The staff truly treats people with noticeable indifference (they are not rude, but no impression was given that they actually care). - The locals who also live in this building show great disdain for the tourists staying in the hotel (share an elevator with them and you will understand).

My fiancÃ© and I travelled to NY for my birthday and I have to say I was surprised with how poor this hotel was. The location is good. Itâs next to Penn station allowing easy access to the subway. Also within walking distance is the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Port authority bus station, Macyâs. My biggest issue with the hotel was its cleanliness. I wasnât expecting anything special based on other reviews, the hotel is in dire need of a refurbishment with paint peeling off the walls and very old window frames that allow the cold in (it was -6 the day we left and the room was cold when we woke up, though there is an old noisy heater that can be switched on). For all of its cosmetic deficiencies (which I can get over) I would expect a clean room. Not the case. Thick;2
Very historic hotel in a great location.  Rooms are TINY, two of us can literally hold hands and touch the walls.  Bathroom is so far as to be non functional.  Our window was extremely drafty (and this was in the middle of a blizzard). The hotel didn't do anything at all to rectify this even though we asked twice.  Poor internet and they charge $90 for incidentals up front.  Bad management - stay away (but go check out the history).;2
I had high expectations when I booked this place, the location is great, but other than that everything needs to be inspected when staying. Our room smelled really bad, just damp and the bedding was a little damp and just smelled bad as if the duvet had not been washed. On our second night we had a massive cockroach running through the room. We were given drink vouchers which was very nice by the GM for our anniversary but when we tried to use them, the bartender accused us of writing 2 instead of 1 on the number area of the future. He was rude and unprofessional. They were however very understanding when I had to cancel 1 of 4 nights due to a cancelled flight.;2
I made a same day reservation at this hotel & called to make sure they had my reservation, whoever I spoke to on the phone must have misunderstood because when I got to the hotel Iâm told they cancelled my reservation and I wasnât given any notification or email (not even three days later) that it was cancelled.   The sole reason Iâm rating two stars is for the receptionist Briana who helped me, she was an absolute gem and had a room cleaned for me last minute so I wouldnât be stranded.   The hotel room itself looked nothing like the photos online, it looked like an old NYC apartment building that they stuck a bed in & hung up a modern looking art canvas from tj maxx and called it a hotel.   The bathroom had mold in the grout, the mirror was cracked, the wall behind the toilet;2
"Unfortunately I stayed there 2 weeks ago for a 3 night business trip, and came home with 5 bug bites on both legs.  I filled out a claim; however, I have yet to receive a response from anyone in management.  Very disappointing as our company gives this Hilton a lot of business throughout the year.";2
"Not what you would expect from a Hilton property. is in MAJOR need of a remodel. 2 elevators permanently out of service, paints chipping in rooms, tub is chipped, needs new decor (looks like it's from the 1980s), and the front desk looks like it came out of the 1970s. The staff were just average, nothing ""above & beyond."" I honestly was NOT wowed here, and the only thing that this hotel has going for it is the location (next to Universal Studios and a short drive to everything else).   If you're paying $300/night, you're better off at a Ramada or Days Inn, because that's the same quality you will get with this Hilton. I would recommend the Marriott down the street!!";2

We stayed one night just before x-mas 2011 on the ground floor. Perfect double room, own bathroom and shower, very clean, nice people at the desk but very noisy in the corridor outside. Came back for three days after x-mas, asked for a quieter room - 2-01, shared very clean bathrooms/showers. First evening we realized we had company - bed bugs. Killed about 25 in three evenings. I now have more than 60 bites all over my body, partner only around 15. Spent New Years afternoon unpacking in the bathroom at home and putting all clothes in plastic bag on the balcony to we washed the next day. Took a lot of time and bites still itch a lot!! Cheap and central place but will not ever sleep there again. We have tried many cheap hostels in London, no bugs in the others.;2
I have not stayed here yet, a party of 4 of us are staying there for Christmas,I have written 5 emails 4 to customer services and 1 to the concierge, to enquire whether we need to book a table for Christmas day and could they recommend any local attractions that will be available over the Christmas period so we could research and see if we need to book, not one of my emails were answered, so I rang all the way from the Uk, I was cut off before I even had chance to make an enquiry, this is not good customer relations.;2
Myself and my brother spent 4 nights here in a non smoking room with 2 doubles. First impressions of the outside of the building was that it could use a bit of a clean, the signs were darkened by dirt and only marginally cleared when it snowed. The entrance and foyer were quite nice, clean and well kept. However it all began going downhill once we stepped in the lift. It was dark, dirty and stunk of marajuana. I believe laws in New York allow weed to be smoked but I think lines should be drawn when it affects the smell of the whole of the hotel!! There were small children in the room next to us for god sake! Our actual room forunately didn't smell of it but it was dreary, in serious need of updating and we needed to be moved to another room because of broken WiFi on that floor.;2

Day one, we checked in and the AC was not working. They offered to send up a fan while they talked to engineering about the issue. Day two came and they offered to move us to a different room. The second room had a cover for an AC unit but there was nothing inside it. They moved us again. Third room had one working AC unit and the other was stuck on low. I didn't feel like moving again so I stayed in that room. They knew my wife and son were with me but didn't provide a sheet, blanket or pillow  for the pull out bed. We had to ask for them. I asked three times for them to remove the mini bar items from the fridge because they literally take up all the space inside. They never bothered, I ended up taking everything out and putting it in a bag in the corner just so I could put;2
Really really confused how it would be even plausible to have a review above 2 stars...  The location of the hotel and the staff are the only things that got this 2 stars. I will never stay here again. I stayed after reading reviews complaining about the same things thinking.. no way they have 4.5 stars and every room is like that. But really no way that our room is the only room with these problems!   First the room we got was the âking deluxeâ the bed was the entire size of the room. Which ok not horrible if youâre not spending the entire time in the room.   The TV has a black bar through the middle.

I stayed there for 3 nights, and the services at the front desk and rooms services is terrible. First of all, most of the time they only have one person in the front desk (imagine how much time you lose waiting, due to they have lot of people staying in the hotel), then when I arrived in the room, there was no towels, so we need to ask for them, and wait for more than 30 min to have a shower.  The rest is high considering it does not include breakfast, the hotel only has 4 elevators for hundred of rooms and the are really slow!, so in the morning we waited for more than 10 min for get into one elevator. In addittion, the hotel does not have a business center with free access to internet, so if you need to connect to the web you have to pay anyway.  The last thing, is now I am;2

I usually don't write reviews but feel compelled to share the lousy experience that many travellers would not expect from a hotel under Wyndham, let alone in an iconic hotel like the New Yorker. To get started, I've stayed there for about 5 days with a baby.   I came back one night to find that my little travelling kettle that I use for making hot water for the baby's milk missing. Couldn't find it after ransacking the entire family room. Now imagine doing that with the baby crying for his milk! When I called the front desk they aren't sure what happened and reckoned that it could be taken by one of their staff. Only after a few phone calls that they deduced it could be taken by their security team but couldn't confirm as 'the team is off duty'. What comes next takes the ante -;2

The feel of this hotel is much like that of a Disney family friendly mid range hotel. The staff were friendly but the service was slow. The restaurant had a cafeteria feel to it and the menu prices were high. We stayed in an executive suite on the 22nd floor which was clean but dated looking. Renovations were going on during our stay which made it impossible to sleep in as loud jackhammering began each day at around 7am. The walls between rooms in this hotel are also very thin, the slightest noise (coughing, talking etc.) can be heard so clearly that it is as if the guests staying in the room next door were sharing our suite. I would not stay here again.;2
I had to check in around midnight because my flight got delayed.  I was given the key to my room, and when I tried to open the door, the chain was on.  Yup.  Meaning that SOMEONE ELSE WAS IN THAT ROOM.  That's probably one of the worst mistakes that can be made during a midnight check in, no?  When I went back to the front desk, he started to explain it and then just trailed off.  My new room was empty, luckily.  But it was tiny: a queen bed, a small desk and a wooden chair.  Oh, and a large cement balcony with no furniture that faced a really gross street with drug-addled people walking by.  Charming!  Two of the lights didn't work, and while it didn't seem actually dirty, it just felt... wrong.  Creepy.    I went to the vending machine to get some water, and while it was;2

The lobby of the hotel is ok, but is a bit worn. The staff is helpful and friendly, but we were not allowed to check in till 3. This made it hard to change and get ready to go sightseeing, but at least they locked our luggage up while we waited. We stayed on the 8th floor in a room that hasn't been updated nor touched up since probably the mid 90's. The paint in the room and in the halls needs redone badly. The blinds were torn up and the carpet was very worn. We decided that for aprox. $150 a night in great location that it would do. We wouldn't do it again. Everything got worse by day 2.

I treated my girlfriend for her 40th a trip to New York, wanted to go somewhere iconic to NYC and had been told the New Yorker is the place to go due to the location and history.   The stay was fun and we enjoyed it, what I cannot believe is that the deposit they took wasn't held but actually took the payment and not returned. I have emailed loads of times and tried calling, nothing. The payment of over 260 EUROS has been taken on the 15th November we stayed for 5 nights, promised it would be returned within 10 business days yet no sign of it, right before Christmas too so thanks for that.  A nice trip tarnished by a lack of customer care, I guess once you got the money it doesnt matter right?;2
I generally try to overlook some things when I'm in a NYC hotel (I travel there frequently for work). I know the rooms will be tiny, and there will be street noise. But for a hotel of this rating, brand, and the reviews, I was severely disappointed with the facility.  I opted to try this hotel as it was next door to the building I was working in for the week. Check in was fine - I waited about 10 minutes, but that's not out of the ordinary for such a high volume place. There are a lot of elevator banks, which meant never having to wait too long. But entering the room, I was really surprised at how dated it was. Not only outdated, but also in poor condition. Turning on the sink, it would fill up quickly almost to the point of overflowing while washing my face quickly - the;2

If I'd paid half the price for a hotel that didn't have the Hilton label, I'd probably be averagely happy.  But it is absolutely inexcusable that there is over a 30 minute wait to be seated for breakfast EVERY day - and there are two dining rooms that are completely empty - evidently because of my mythical dust from the construction.  However, that didn't stop them putting place settings in that area for (I assume a conference event).   Room service was poor - it arrived cold. The elevators are designed to test your patience.  I'm sure I actually aged whilst waiting for these - again, EVERY day.  There's no excuse for this.  Other faculties are average.  There is a poor selection of in-house restaurants, but the room service menu is extensive (even if it arrives cold).  A;2

"I booked the Empire for my girlfriends birthday weekend and was very disappointed; there is no way this place deserves 4 stars.

Secondly, at night the hotel seems more interested in the club being opperated on the upper floor than the guests of the hotel.  In addition, having the club there brings around a lot of people you wouldn't normally want in the lobby of a ""4 star"" hotel.  Other issues that bugged us: We didn't get a turn down service either night, didn't have the morning";2

I will preface this by saying I have never once asked to switch rooms in a hotel. Never once. My first room I was given at the Empire Hotel had a pull out bed from a couch as a bed. It was clearly a suite split into two rooms. Unacceptable. The person at the front desk acted surprised that I was not happy with the room but was very nice and got me a new room. This new room had the ac/heat unit for the building outside the window which was incredibly noisy. Way noisier than the city sounds! I am from Boston so I am not too particular about noise. I once again asked for a new room since I don't think I should have to choose between a real bed and a quiet night's sleep. I also asked about a refund but I had prepaid on Trip Advisor. Finally I got a better room on fifth floor. I had;2
I checked in and my room stank of smoke.  I instantly got a headache.  I complained as I walked in to the bell man.  He told me call. I did and housekeeping said if I leave they will fix it.  3 Hours later still awful smoke smell. I call again, and 20 minutes, later they move me to a room with a view of the roof of the lobby.  At least it did not sink nor make me sick.  But lesson learned don't complain or they give you a crappy room.  Then on the second day I tried to order room service,  after being on hold 20 minutes i gave up.  The third day, I should have put out the do not disturb sign. Before 7 am they began knocking on my door. Then I went to watch TV and it did not work at all.  I was leaving soon and did not want to hassel with someone  yet again knocking on my door.;2

Hotel is in a great location. I choose it for that reason. Close to LIRR to get in and it of Manhattan with ease. Not too impressed with the room we had (metro double). Washroom especially was in desperate need of updates. Very worn down and grungy. Awoken all three mornings by the room beside us when they showered. Turning the faucets on and off and having to adjust them non stop while showering emitted a high pitch squeal which I'm sure disturbed them when we showered as ours did the same. The tv in the room was ridiculously small and the daily hotel charge of $29 is outrangeous for what you're getting at this hotel which is nothing at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest this hotel to others but if you're not going to be spending much time in the rooms than I'd;2

The only good thing I can say about this hotel is its location to Lincoln Center.  You literally are steps away from all that Lincoln /center and Julliard have to offer as well as a number of nice restaurants and shops.The hotel has no great facilities inside other than to drink. There are limited services at best so you are better off leaving to eat and drink elsewhere.  You will need to leave since the rooms will make you claustrophobic!   There are few amenities including glasses to drink out of and water is sold to you in the room.  Nothing worked well in the the room nor was anything pleasant either including the staff except for the doormen.;2
We stayed for 4 nights and was disappointed with the state of our bathroom. There was rusty bits on our tiles and the floor tiles were scuffed and chipped. The taps were covered in limescale and the room was very dated.  The staff at the lift area were extremely rude. When asking for our room cards to gain access they shouted YES and made me feel like a criminal.;2

If you are looking to sleep, not going to be happy here.  Room is small and clean. Sink was outside bathroom with zero lighting or a place to hang a towel. Overpriced. Not my first hotel stay in NYC but first time at a non-chain hotel and simply does not measure up.;2
This was our second visit to New York and we were very disappointed with this hotel, we arrived at the hotel to be advised that we would have to pay a resort fee of over 70 dollars for the three days, I asked what the money was for but was given no explanation, the receptionist just stated its compulsory. We were given a room on the 33rd floor it was tiny, it had no view and the dÃ©cor certainly requires to be updated. The bathroom was stark and not very clean, rust on all the door hinges. Toilet roll holder on a wall about 6 feet from the toilet. I know we should have asked to be  moved but we didn't think we would be successful. The only thing in its favour is its central. Not my choice and I don't think that I would stay again, and I wouldn't recommend to my friends or family.;2

The electricity in the room is whack as well as the water pressure in the shower.  You can't use the electric outlets because the lights will start dimming.  The water in the bathroom has a mind of its own and comes out when it wants.  Bed is shady.  People showed up at our room saying the front desk gave them keys to our room.  NO FREE INTERNET.  $10 a day. Get a life.  You can get locked out of the bathroom if you are not careful.   On the PLUS side, it is close to the subway, there are a few fierce bars less than a five minute walk away and there were some sexy Brits staying two floors down.;2
This was my second stay at Astor on The Park.  I like the hotel, it is inexpensive, the location is terrific and the staff is courteous and accommodating.  The condition of the hotel, however, is another matter.  It truly appears to be down on its heels.  We had a room on the top floor and it seemed to have been furnished with all the odds and ends in the hotel. the room was really ugly!  The balcony door did not close properly and it turned out not to be connected at all because one strong wind blew it completed off the frame.  There was mold in the bath tub and mattresses and bedrooms littered the stairwells.  While i would stay again, do hope they have a chance to invest a little money in the place.;2
Please take a look at my last review for this hotel. We stayed here again in April 2017, again in a pleasant junior suite. The good news at this stay is that WiFi was included, so my credit card wasn't hacked. Plus, the chambermaids and restaurant staff were all very cordial. However, the same cannot be said for the hotel managers. We had 3 concerns, and the 3 managers we spoke to several times were unhelpful, rushed us and were not listening, did not keep their word or return calls, and were obviously passing the buck to the next one's shift.  1. In the 3 days that we were there, our room keys failed and needed to be replaced 3 times. (No, the keys were not near our cell phones.) On one of these days, due to a power failure the machine that makes these keys wasn't functioning,;2
We stayed at your hotel for too days. The price was not bad for the location. But we didnt like paying for parking. That was the frosting on the cake. Paying  11$ a day is terrible.  When we tryed to leave the hotel there was an auction or something going on and we could'nt get our car out of the parking garage we had to pay 11$ a day for!!!!!!!!!  They were parked avery were. Couldn't even get out. I'll tell ya we were not happy!!!  We had better rooms at a cheap hotel in Vegas.   Also the people above were slaming thing on the floor for about 20 min.  time an again. We should not hear anything from the above floors at this price.!!! Again on the parking garage, It was a very dangers  situation. If there was a fire, no on could get out.

"We had a very bad experience with the owner of the company. Our toilet flooded early one morning; we called the front desk immediately. The owner came barging into the room, and began screaming that we flooded the toilet! Well, I do not think that we want to spend time flooding a toilet at a hotel for kicks! (Sarcasm). However, I wrote a letter to the Executive offices, but received no response or acknowledgement from our treatment. I am only giving it two stars because the staff was absolutely amazing! Kudos for the staff that made the rest of our stay more bearable, otherwise, we would have truly switched hotels.";2

Very poor service. I reached hotel around 9:30 PM and got my room ready at 11:30 PM. I called them in advance and requested that I have 2 kids and please provide double beds in room but they gave only 1 queen size bed. When requested to provide pull over bed first they gave very small sofa which is even not good for 3 years kids. Had hard time to get extra bed to sleep full family. They charged $63 for 2 nights as service charge and don't have any facility. Only good thing with this hotel is location.;2

The reason i am giving this hotel two stars when individually the lowest is three is because of this....  My sister and i stayed here during january.. we were very surprised at the friendliness of some of the staff and the room was fine.. small but what you expect for paying so little and we came to new york for new york not the hotel room..   the first nights sleep i get woken up at 3am by a rapping.. thought it was my sister and went back to sleep... we both woke up again at 4am to a loud rhythmic drumming coming from the radiator... this continued until 5:30am... it was a mix between a drum solo and ball bearing popcorn exploding.... not only this but from a nozzle was spurting boiling water straight next to a power outlet....  after not being able to take it any longer we;2

"Hotel looked very nice from the reviews and photos, but the room was small and smelled of cleaning product.  Reserved a room above the 19th floor but was given one lower down.  Also they charged an additional ""resort / service fee"" of an additional $75/night!  Perhaps you can argue it away, but they should be ashamed of themselves for that practice.";2
We should have known when the shuttle dropped us off at the âquik parkâinstead of at the hotel. The shuttle indicated that it made two stops, one at the parking garage and one at the hotel. No. You schlep your  bag from the âquik parkâ, across the alley and into the hotel! We checked with the driver, seriously?? We drag our stuff?? He said yes, you get out here, hotel is right over there. We went up to our room..decent king bed and for some reason they booked us into a handicapped accessible room even though we neither needed it nor asked for it. Fair enough. Two people, king room, one chair. We called the front and asked for a second chair,,they said they'd send one up right away. Never came. Soundproof? Hardly. Breakfast? 62.00 for two. Absurd?? Yeah. Is there a plus? It is;2
I stayed here with some friends a couple of weeks ago and it wasn't too bad but I don't think I'd go back there.  The staff where helpful when they didn't have our reservation and we ended up in a room with an amazing view of Manhatten.  I would warn people of the concierge who tried to sell us something everytime we stepped into the foyer - he even interupted a phonecall!   The lift is the noisest and most unreliable lift I've ever come across.  Which was confirmed just before we left when it broke down and we had to trek up ten flights of stairs.  The concierge did help us with our bags though.  They also decided to start banging holes in the wall half way through our stay which wasn't great, it left the place in a bit of mess.  Be warned of the groups of American teenagers;2
No internet. Seriously. Attending for business or pleasure for the cost of this hotel should include internet...working internet...at no cost. Additionally, the elevators failed on many instances. Oddly, I don't find that as terrible as no internet, especially when traveling for business.;2
I stayed 7 nights. On arrival wifi was down for almost all nigh, the second day my room was not serviced although there was not a NON Disturb sign out of the door, and finallly the worst of all as the hotel is making refurbishment in the restaurant on the entrance, there was no place to sit and work  or relax inside the hotel. The only option was sitting outside where there was no security from the hotel and of course homeless people from the street were coming and disturbing! Also from none of the reooms there is aEmpire state view as it shows on the interent!;2

I also asked for my room to be cleaned, and this did not happen.  Staff tried to clean it after I got back from work which i refused as I was preparing to have a shower, so they left.  Day 2: Toilet cistern stopped working. Had to use glasses of water to flush the loo.   day 3: The power cut out at circa 1945 hours.

Located in chinatown, the Hotel offers very basic facilities. The room size was very small and could just about accommodate 2 less than queen size beds.There was no coffee/tea maker nor Iron in the room. No room service was available nor offered. The locality was also very trashy and poorly maintained. The room tariff charged was very high for facilities offered. Inspite of requesting for early check in, no room was available and we had to spend 4 hours waiting in a nearby park with the homeless as the Hotel had no lobby to speak of.;2

Good location near MSG and Penn station. The hotel has a number of floors/rooms occupied by students wasnât expected by us.

My sister and I traveled to NYC to take in the holiday sights. We had four fun packed days planned! On our arrival, we checked into the Days Hotel on Broadway and 94th.   Another family we knew we also staying in this hotel. Our room was on a floor that had not been refurbished. The other family was on a redone floor. Our room had no frig or microwave, broken tv, telephone that did not work (you had to email the front desk), and only one towel. We were only in the hotel to sleep, and were quite comfortable as long as the air conditioner was on high (it was 20Â° outside).  I would not recommend this hotel for your NYC stay!!!;2
The room wasn't well equiped at all. No tea or Coffee, no kettle. No hairdryer.  Outside air conditioning was very loud. Basically we couldn't have a good sleep for 4 nights and we paid enough and had to pay at least $50 just on Coffee from Starbucks.;2
I would not recommend this hotel or stay here again.  I made my reservations online and upon arrival I was informed that there would be an addition $25 parking fee per night.  The room was extremely small with no walking room except one path in front of the bed leading to the bathroom.  The bathroom had ants crawling on the floor and the tub had mold and rust in it.  The front desk staff was unfriendly.  On a positive note, the breakfast staff was very friendly as they served fresh omelettes and waffles.;2
Absolutely loved my stay here, couldnât have picked a fault with location / hotel etc until I arrived at the airport realising my airpods were gone from my bag.  i did not check if my airpods were in my bag as they had not been used or left my bag in the whole time i was in NYC.  I contacted the hotel and they werenât helpful at all - airpods have been removed from Find my iPhone which after speaking to apple support means someone has them and has reset them. Extremely disappointed with the response as they were removed during my stay I would have thought the hotel may have been more helpful.  We 10000% checked everywhere in the room so they were not left at all - checked under the bed and every possible place things couldâve been left.  Very unhappy guest!;2

My boyfriend and me stayed at the Morningside Inn on December 2007. I didn't like it! In our room there was a terrible and a lingering smell of smoke. It was quite small and not so clean. I'll never come back there!;2
We were looking forward to a restful nightâs sleep after completing a 13-hour transPacific flight and continuing the next day to the east coast of the US.  I wonât choose this hotel location in the future.;2
We were staying on business and needed a room with 2 beds, for 3 people.  Reservations was very helpful and told us a few rooms had 2 queen beds, but most had two doubles.  Later, in requesting a room from the front desk we found out the double bed rooms had a much better view, so we requested that.   Upon arrival, we were checked into one, which was dirty.  We said we would wait for it to be cleaned, but were put in another room - on the 11th floor.  This had 2 doubles, but faced the interior space - an awful view.  Not wanting to make a 3rd trip to the desk, we kept the room.  The room ended up being REALLY LOUD - right next to the elevator.  I now believe it is probably the last room they sell, as it really is almost unbearable. Also, the elevators did not work very well.;2
Where to start:   We had booked via an agent who booked us into a standard double , this can only be described as a student accommodation. So small , tired carpets and room wasnât cleaned properly.  Becareful what rooms you book here !!   We asked to move rooms which we had to pay for an âupgrade â additional price per night we had no choice as the original room was disgraceful.   The hotel is so very very busy !! There was an issue with the lifts so the wait time was considerable to cope with the many many visitors and this was quiet season. We had a letter saying there is an upgrade due in March on the lifts. No compensation was made for this .   The place is in need of a refurb.   An issue with the revolving front doors meant you had to queue in the wind and rain to enter the;2

For the two good points which kept me from rating this the lowest possible - good staff & good location.  Other than that this is an awful hotel.  Pictures are shown on their website and booking sites are of the nicer rooms you have to pay extra for.  If you don't you're put in an outdated, dirty and old room.  We could barely find our room because the door to our room was located through a door on the 8th floor in the STAIRWELL.  The carpet was disgusting, as in don't take your socks off.  There was a lot of mold in the bathroom and a dripping sink.  There was mold on the bed skirt.  Wallpaper is peeling, furniture is probably 20 years old.  There was no bedspread as shown in pictures of the hotel.  I'm really shocked the Days Inn parent company/franchise tolerates this.;2
I have stayed at this property several times. It is clean, attractive and recently renovated. Check-in staff is efficient. The new Regency Club is attractive and offers a nice breakfast buffet of fruits, pastries, oatmeal, juice. The new suites are attractive, spacious and well designed. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with a recent stay.   The director of operations sent me a lovely welcome email and said if anything went  wrong that he wanted to know. At 9:25 am on my departure day when I had a 4 pm checkout, a housekeeper lightly knocked, did not pause and entered my room unannounced. There was no deadbolt on the door. The intrusion was highly inappropriate. It scared and upset me to have a stranger enter while I was dressing.  I left a voice mail for the manager on duty,;2

What can I say, after really looking forward to my first visit to New York, this hotel was a real disappointment.   My family had just stayed in a 4 star in Washington DC, the service was perfect, the room facilities were excellent, coffee machine etc., and the room had plenty of space.   In contrast the New Yorker had very poor service, the desk couldn't get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him. We were charged $20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin. Even though we had the rooms we booked in Washington the New Yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin.  The room was tiny with minimal facilities, the only thing on offer was water, at a price. The lifts made so much;2
Staff are slow, rude and belittling. If you look under 40 expect to be made to present your room card every time you pass through the lobby whilst the couple next to you breeze through and be told to have a good evening all whilst your being interrogated for proof that you booked a room. Rooms are old. TV looks like itâs 30 years old. WiFi is terrible and you have to log in every time you use it. You can hear every word of the conversation behind all four walls in your room so do not bank on getting much sleep. It looks as though it has been in need of a refurb for about 30 years if not more. Good location and it looks cool from the outside are the only two pluses. Iâve stayed in better in NYC for the same money. I actively avoided a Wyndham hotel in Washington because of my;2

Overall the hotel is in a great location, however the quality of the room was very low, run down, and dated.  Bedding and pillows were very low quality and uncomfortable.  Some of the hotel staff were very polite and offered great service while others were terrible, and were actually rude.;2
I was without WI-FI service for a six-day trip, even though I spent almost three hours on the phone with Tech services.  The WI-FI at Starbuck's across the street worked fine.  This hotel is in need of serious HELP.  The Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.;2
"I recently spent a weekend in the New Yorker hotel, in a ""room with a view"", however the view I had was very disappointing (picture attached). The room was tiny and the bathroom old and tired, with someone else's hairs remaining on the shower curtain!  It is not easy to order room service - a menu is not provided in the room, nor the number required to dial, so you have to go through the front desk each time. The food from the Diner is good, however on the final day of my stay I waited over an hour for my meal because the member of staff who took my order had written my room number down incorrectly and when it finally arrived it came with the incorrect bill.  To round off the stay, I found a large cockroach on the bathroom floor (picture attached).  For the amount that this";2

He blamed the GM of the hotel and said I would need to contact him directly and that the policy is on the website. This policy needs to change and it's nothing more than a way for a big company like Hilton to make more money. I bet if I took a tape measure out to the where this pole is placed, I would find that it is placed lower than the height indicated on the pole. I have parked my FJ in";2
Stayed in this hotel on 9-12 March and stayed on the 10th floor.  Room itself had seen better days and we could pick holes in it ie there was damp on the inside of the windows, noisy air conditioning, broken bath tap (still worked though!) etc but as a whole it was fine.  The room was clean on arrival and regularly cleaned every day.  The bed had crisp clean sheets and was very comfortable.  Some of the hotel staff were indifferent, others were very helpful and friendly.  The location of the hotel was a little away from most tourist attractions but at the price we paid I think it was only to be expected.  The hotel is located just by an underground station so a short trip and you can be in the heart of the city in no time.  However noise from traffic can be a problem if you are;2

We stayed here this week and we were so disappointed. The room wasn't very clean, we went to make a coffee and found dirty cups, stirrers and napkins still there. We waited for over 2 hours for fresh towels then we I phoned to enquire about it I was transferred 5 times then the housecleaning person couldn't understand my accent (we are from Australia). Our toilet also blocked really easily. The only good thing we found was the free shuttle to universal studios and bell boys were very friendly. Walking to universal studios was a hike for me because there is a steep hill which wasnt good for a sprained ankle. fThere is no laundry washing facilities and the taxi ride was a nightmare there and back.

I'm an Australian female, single traveller who has just returned from eight weeks overseas. I stayed at Morningside Inn for about a week during October.   The hotel did provide most of what it promised -- helpful staff who would call taxis for you and help you with directions for getting around the city, in particular -- a fridge and microwave in the room (without any utensils to back that up, though) and a laundromat nearby.    I was disappointed mostly by the very uncomfortable bed, the poor quality sheets,  the thin, tired pillow, and the single white towel (that was not replaced all week). To be fair, housemaids did find me another pillow and an extra cotton blanket with much ado following my request, but I ended up buying a blow-up pillow from the MoMA to supplement what;2

Second visit and 10 years apart, sadly what was a little dated in 2008 is still in the same need or attention. Standard rooms have enough floor space for your suitcase thatâs it, reception and lobby is as basic as you can get for what could be a very good iconic hotel. But in truth itâs a 2 star poor hotel in a good location.   A real shame this is sold with high expectations by many companies, pay a little more and get a nice modern hotel;2

I was excited to stay at the hotel when I booked my room. Once I got to  the hotel it was a different story. The staff was very nice, they need to be so you forget about your room. I mean I had never felt so uncomfortable at a hotel in my life. If it wasnt for the quiet location I would be afraid to stay at this place. First off they give a key for room that looks like it's been never replaced in 15 years. Its 2013, that doesn't fly in NYC. Now let's talk about the rooms... Nasty! OLD CARPET, FILTHY WALLS, STAINED CHAIRS AND FURNITURE. I was so turned off that I requested to get my room changed. Went through 3 rooms and they were all the same. The last room was enough. The frame of door was busted and you could use a credit card to open door lock. Honesty it felt like a hotel;2

Let's dispense with the obvious: the Empire Hotel has a sensational location, being just across the street from Lincoln Center, if that's where you are spending your entertainment dollars. And the rooms are nicely decorated, as is the lobby and its surroundings. So what's wrong? A lot. To begin with, we arrived at check-in time to find that the king bed room we had reserved could be had only on the smoking floor (a smoking floor...imagine that), and we took it because the alternatives were two double beds or wait. I tried setting up my internet, had trouble, and had to run back and forth between the desk and the corded phone on the other side of the room to catch the instructions. On the nightstand with the phone, I found a small bottle of Fiji water with a hotel-attached label:;2

I probably had the nicest room, as far as layout goes, on the fifth floor as I had the one room on an outside corner and, hence, two windows. As the hotel is across from a park, the room was pretty quiet. Unfortunately, I had planned a full day in my room on the internet to lead a webinar and do some work and the connection was horrible. I was completely unable to connect to the internet at all for hours on end and had too weak a connection to do any effective work for four days. I ended up having to go to a nearby library branch for wifi during the day and to make special arrangements to get access to a place from which I could lead my training.  While the room had a pretty good layout in that it had windows on two sides, the curtains were torn and difficult to close, there was;2
For my wife's birthday I decided to take her on the VIP Tour at Universal Studios, and the Hilton seemed like the appropriate place to stay for our 4 day sojourn.  This is the first time I have stayed at a Hilton in a while so here is an unabashed review of the facility.  The hotel is nice and pleasant with all the amenities one would expect  from such a place.   Transportation to Universal Studios is excellent with a bus arriving every 15 minutes.  But now let us go into the room and see what awaits us.  The room is large and spacious, well-lit and accommodating.  Likewise the bathroom is very large with all the traditional items one would require.  Now down to details.  The bed has a comforter on it which is way too warm. Fortunately I found a  solo blanket in the closet and;2

Did not enjoy my stay there. The good aspects are: it is 2 Blocks away from metro/bus station - but 40 min away from the center of london by bus. And they have towels.

I'm very easy to please, but I'm going to be honest and fair with this review. It's lengthy, but will tell you everything you need to know if you are considering staying here.  We stayed for four nights at the Hollywood Hotel. Upon checking in, I was told there would be a $100 authorization on my credit card and that I would be paying for the room once we checked out. Not only did they authorize that fee, they also authorized the full booked stay and the parking, which was 20 bucks a night.  To be honest, I prefer to be charged in the beginning of the stay so I don't have to worry about it later, but I also prefer to be told this. Communication was not the best in this situation.   The second and third day, we had no hot water and the elevators were not working. This was due to;2

Went for a wedding and all out -of -town guests stayed here.  This was the very worst bathroom I've seen in any hotel.  Ever.  Including hole-in-the walls in the middle of nowhere on the way to New Mexico or Colorado from LA.  No light at all.  It was so bad I went out to try and buy light bulbs --- no easy feat in Manhattan on a Sunday.  In the end I had to do make-up for the wedding outside in a cab.  There was no closet -- the wedding was black tie and we had to drape our gowns and tuxes over the furniture.  We were on the floor under the club and were disturbed all night -- not by the music --- but by the loose tiles that management had never fixed.  Any time anyone walked or rolled something over the huge cement tiles, it sounded like a a herd of elephants overhead.;2

This hotel is a total fraud. From the pictures you would expect a very different presentation than what you are greeted with! Even the image they use to advertise the face of the hotel with is of the rear and not the front.  This hotel is in need of a serious update. And they must know this because they advertise rooms with a fresh grey and lilac decor. But we were not given one of these, probably because there are only one or two in existence or they are staged for marketing. We got a room that had an awful stale smell and as soon as you sat on the bed it sounded like the springs and creaking would cause the bed to collapse!   A room with double beds and both made this terrible sound. Knowing we wouldn't be able to sleep all night we requested a change of room. This request;2

We were really looking forward to our trip to New York, we got married in New York back in March 2019 and we stayed at the New Yorker hotel, the lobby and coffee ares looked really good but once we got to our room we were not impressed at all, the room was really small and very dated, carpet was well worn the lighting was dim, there was no coffee/tea making facility in the room which we are not used to, the only positive we can say about our stay was the bed, i cant remember when we have ever slept in a more comfortable bed, real quality. but sadly that was the only thing that was quality, i would not stay here again so therefore i can not recommend this hotel. we visited New York, Las Vagas and Mexico on this trip and for me New Yorker hotel was by far the worst one we stayed;2
I loved the Bowery and also the Maritime and I was excited to stay here.   I stayed in a Captain's room.   It was a profound disappointment.   There were quite a few things I didn't like: - The window to the room are prison sized - The mattress is uncomfortable - The power off thing makes it very uncomfortable in the room on a hot day. - The housekeeping staff gave me 2 shampoos but no shower gel.  When I asked for that to be fixed I was brought up 2 conditioners.  okay.... - The TV signal seemed really off.  Not that I spend much time watching TV in NY but it was kind of annoying.   - The bar downstairs was 'closed for a private party'.  Apparently this happens often.    Also there aren't always cabs outside as the hotel is pretty out of the way.;2

Don't expect much. The exec studio apartments reminded me of a college dorm apartment. All the furnishings are all from Ikea and the sofa cushions and arms are filthy. We spread out a bed sheet on the sofa before sitting on it. The bed was hard but had clean sheets.  The bathroom was also clean but the shower stall was falling apart.   The water from the faucet was brown for a few minutes before turning clear.   If you're in high school or college and just need a place to flop after getting sloppy drunk, then this is a great, cheap, safe place that keeps you off the street.;2

We love this location and have stayed here dozens of times over the last 10 years but this hotel is getting really tired. This trip our air conditioner didnât work and after being told multiple times someone woild come look at it, they didnt. Instead they brought us a fan. The room was close to 80 degrees all night and it took multiple calls the next day to get it looked at. The place was booked so they couldnt move us to another room. They finally sent a tech to fix it and while it did kick on, we still couldnt get the room below 73 degrees to sleep. The staff is friendly and has good intentions but we will not stay here again. The pillows were lumpy and tired. The window literally fell entirely off the hinges when we opened it. This place could use a big dose of TLC.;2
Stayed here 4 years ago and loved it - decent to great renovation and hip vibe (but tiny bathrooms). They haven't done the upkeep necessary to maintain this property. Caulk in the bathroom gone. One entire wall of vinyl wall covering hanging off due to water damage. Headboard hanging off as well. A sink-down sofa with wrecked springs. Ghost lamps that dim when the want to and 3 bucks if you want to use the kuerig in your room, it cost me 25 bucks to move rooms because the only lamps in the living room refused to work. Elevators are being replaced but the rude fluorescent light in them sucks. And then there's the concierge without a sign who refuses to help people. Put a sign on them or move them from the front desk - it's confusing. Pluses - bar staff! I coulda stayed there all;2

Stayed here for 5 nights for daughterâs graduation. Weâd stayed here when it was a Days Inn and was happy with stay. Toilet ran, the huge piece of sheet metal in the shower fell (could have caused serious injury), the room smelled like a wet ashtray. Elevators were filthy, bellman was constantly on an earpiece talking on his phone and when we called the front desk about staying an extra night (out of complete necessity), were told they were booked but easily made an online reservation that we ended up canceling. There was one employee at the front desk early on in the trip who was very helpful in getting the shower fixed and accommodating our request for an ironing board. Unfortunately, he really stood out because the rest of the staff was marginal at best. Housekeeping just;2

Most obscenely small room I've ever seen. Travelled to NYC numerous times, and people always say rooms are small, but this place is next level small. Feels like you're in a college dorm, but without the RA and the booze.;2
Stayed at the Woogoo on 73rd st over Labour day w/e. Front desk was nice enough to check us in early. What was not revealed is there are no staff available after 9 or 10pm to help if you have any issues. You reach a front desk person who works for the apartment building the woogoo apartment are in. There were roaches in the room and the TV in the bedroom did not work after being told the TV woud be fixed for 2 days then I was told the TV only works with a DVD player ( even though I was told there would be 2 TVs upon booking). We were a party of 4 and were only provided with 1 key and had to leave it at the front desk if we went out seperately to get back into the apartment. Nice location BUTTTT?????;2
This was my first time visiting New York along with 1 other friend and this hotel and hospitality was incredibly disappointing. Months before arriving, we had requested two twin beds, but when we arrived in reception, we were informed that if we wanted twin beds it would cost $20 extra per night.   We knew the queen bed would not be big enough for two adults with a lot of luggage, so we agreed. When we go to the room we were incredibly disappointed. The room was very, dated and was also the smallest twin room I have ever seen (I appreciate that the rooms in a city hotel won't be as big as other places). The bathroom was very dirty, the tub was peeling, shower curtain was impractical- everything in that bathroom was a big NO. The view was of the back of a brick building. No view;2
We stayed her for 3 nights and we were not impressed. The lobby looks nice but it went downhill from there. The hallways and by the elevators are dimly lit which may be for ambience but not helpful. The design on the walls in the hallways was nauseating. We decided it was like being trapped in a funhouse. Our room was average at best and not the junior suite we were anticipating. In a 2 bed jr suite with 4 people I would have thought they would have put more than 2 towels. Our beds had no top sheet which we are accustomed to. We had to ask for flat sheets, towels, and wash cloths. It took me a while to locate a trash can. There was one small one in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. The sink didnât drain well so we had to be quick washing our hands and brushing our teeth. The;2
We're used to staying in basic hotels, but the room we were given at the Astor was depressing.  The walls are scuffed, the fictures and fittings loo rather beaten up. The room was on the fourth floor it looked out over the park, but the windows were so dirty this wasn't much of an advantage. The a/c unit was badly fitted into the window and was so noisy that we couldn't leave it on at night. The bed was large, clean and comfortable and the room wasn't as small as some we've stayed in in American cities. The bathroom was the high point, clean and modern. However as another reviewer has commented the hot water can be issue, I scalded myself when it suddenly went from warm to very hot. The cleanliness of the room overall was fine, but the carpet was very dirty. The Astor is a long;2
Overall customer service was pleasant.  Front desk - Pasquale - was very helpful, friendly and pleasant.  The hotel needs major renovations. The decor was nice but the mezzanine and lobby area furniture was noticeably worn.  My room was relatively clean, but the walls were dirty, wallpaper stained and peeling. The Roman shades was heavily stained.  Also, everything in the room had a steep price attached. Nothing was complimentary, even the coffe and tea in the room had a price-tag.  Also, the room was very cold. The heating/air conditioning unit was noisy and did not warm the room.  We had the temperature set on 80 degrees and the room was still cold.  I notified the front desk, was told it would be fixed, but it was not fixed.  Me and my family had a cold stay at this hotel.;2
My friend and I took our daughters there last week end. First, no lighting for putting make up on.   No top sheets.   You can't tell me they clean the  duvets after each guest leaves.  I asked for more pillows from house keeping in the phone they never came.  The elevator stuck while we were there.  I had to take my bags down a flight if stairs.   We were told be the bellman he would be there and help get us a taxi to the airport at 3:00pm.  Could not find a bellman at 3.  Asked at front desk.  No one came.   I had to knock in a door at the entrance to get anyone to help.   0He put us in a taxi that had to use gps to get to Airport.  He dropped us off at arrivals rather than departures.    Behind a stool in our room we found items from a previous guest bus tour raincoat and head;2
First impressions of this hotel are that the decor is tired, the lobby furniture worn and the whole place looks like it needs brought up to date. This was our first hotel in the USA that we had been in that needed you to pay for WIFI connection in the room and at $19 per device per day it was very expensive. You also had to pay for any coffee or tea which you made in your room $3 for a cup of coffee. There was 4 lifts to go up to the rooms but they were very unreliable and I never saw all 4 working, one day there was only 1 lift working and this caused long waits you had to add 10 minutes onto your times just in case you had a long wait for the lift. Our room was at the back of the hotel we looked onto other windows and had no view, it was also very noisy not sure if it was all;2
I agree with the reviews below from People who stayed in the hotel not just popped in for a drink.  The rooms need renovating they're worn and tired. The shower was nearly impossible to turn on and off. It can not be argued about the location though, we found it perfect and that is the reason for the 2 stars;2
We stayed at Astor for five nights. Upon entering the room we noticed one of the windows had been sealed with tape. We soon realised this was due to the cool breeze which was able to seep in though into the room. The heating was a major problem, especially for a winter stay, and extremely temperamental. For at least two nights there was no heating at all making the room unbearably cold. The shower seemed to only have two temperatures - scalding hot or ice cold.  Some of the staff were very helpful though one member was extremely rude and acted as if everything was an inconvenience. The highlight of the stay would have been the stray cats which we were lucky enough to have a clear view of from of window.;2

The room had various areas of water damage. Paint/wallpaper peeling from wall. Floor was uneven by the desk. The bathroom was very small the rain-head shower did not operate at all. Something what looked to be mold on one of the ceiling beams on several places. The hotel Shuttle policy is not helpful when you call for Two days before departure to New York and they will not return phone call messages or answer the phone.;2
On a positive note, this hotel is in a great location and just steps away from the subway.  Also, although it is shabby, our room was clean.  But, there are a lot of negatives.  On two of our three nights there, they left us with only one washcloth and one hand towel for two people.  The windows have no sound insulation, so we could here all the street noises.  It is the noisiest hotel room I have ever been in.  There is no central a/c.  Instead, we had a window unit that was very loud and not terribly efficient.  The hotel charges to use the computer in their Business Center.  The television had few channels available, none of which was the Weather Channel or national news.  In all, this Days Inn needs a major renovation.  It truly is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed;2

This hotel was chosen for the EHS 2015 Conference.  The first morning we were greeted with a cold shower and that evening we were woke up by fire alarms and confused staff.  Clear direction was not given to guests and the staff seemed to not know what to do during an emergency.  My key card stopped working three times and I had to request the be fixed all the way back in the lobby twice.  For someone who does not travel a lot, this sure was a let down for my first trip to LA.;2

The beds are so hard i barely had any sleep during the night. We asked right away for an other room or a topper. We had to settle for some extra blankets under the sheets. They were going to prep the beds by the time we were back at the hotel. When arriving in the room they were just thrown on our bed.The manager at the front desk was unfriendly and had no customer service skills. His staff was more helpful but he came in between to make sure they didn't try to help us more. The ac was super noise and the water didn't get hot enough in the shower. The paint was falling of in the room ( maybe mold?). The lobby is WAY to warm and was so warm we got our dinner in the room.  It looks like a great hotel at first but if you think it has 4 stars??? I had better experiences at 2 star;2
I will never stay in that hotel again!! Hotel Employees are very ruled. The hotel itself is in a good location but the customer service is very poor.The first room the gave me was a olda and run down. Housekeeping was cleaning it and it still looked a hot mess. They don't ever have to worry about getting my business anymore. It the Big guy at the deske h is so ruled. He don't realized if we don't if it was for our money he would have a job there.

This place was horrible, but for the price and location, it gets two stars, just know what you are getting into. More like an upscale hostel with unprofessional staff, no planning, and bad ammenities. The shower was not clean with easily visible mold on both the wall and curtain and the room had bugs, big and small. The second 'bed' that we purchased in the room was actually a fold out couch with a bad mattress, no hope of getting a switch for the room and my poor friend who slept on it couldn't sleep well. The only nice spot  would have been if we were staying longer and could have taken advantage of the small kitchenette, something you normally do not get in a hostel like atmosphere.;2
For at least a decade we have used the Empire as our hotel for trips to NYC.  The location is great (next to Lincoln Center) and the hotel is clean.  Fantastic shopping and restaurants within short walking distance.  But on this visit our experience was really bad, and we will try other hotels (and I'm sure will find one) for future trips.  First, they keep raising prices, so by now the Emptire is up to $375 per night, which I find expensive for what they office.  Then, they booked us into a room next to some sort of party suite in which a very intoxicated group of revellers partied until 3am, and LOUDLY.  Through a paper-thin wall/connecting door.  Lots of boisterous shouting and singing, some sort of beer-pong game, clearly a poker kind of ambiance.  And Mariacha music, too,;2
The room was tiny and the bed was too hard. Thermostat didn't work and room was unbearably hot. Heater rattled and was noisy. Bathroom was barely functional. For the price, they should at least offer coffee to go in the morning.;2
I stayed at this hotel on 09/12/2013. Small rooms, but they're well designed and pretty neat. Good hotel, however my overall experience wasn't as pleasant. We were given a wifi code upon arrival, although the wifi was extremely slow and wouldn't really connect to any pages. So I called to reception, who told us to stay in the lobby and use the wifi there. I thought that wasn't a big deal so I went to the lobby.   There is a bar next to what appears to be the lobby. I was with my business partner, and we look younger then the usual guests. One waitress of the bar approached us while sitting down and demanded that we order a cocktail or leave and stay else were. We noticed everyone else in the lobby didn't have a drink, and she demanded we leave that area so she could seat people;2
Stayed here when my husband and I decided to go to universal studios, horrible mistake, but that's another review. We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday. They must have gotten a larger number of travelers than normal because the whole staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  There were maybe five people in front of me but it still took a good 40 minutes for us to get checked in. Normally if they had said sorry we are running behind or something to that effect I would have let it go. But no, instead the manager starts pulling people from the Hilton diamond line and starts throwing them in front of me when I finally reach the front of the line. Again not so much as an apology or even an explanation as to why he is placing people in line ahead of me. Until I;2
We  travel to NYC two or three times a year and stayed at various hotels. This time we didn't have as much time to shop around for a bargain hotel and needed to book a room within a day or two of our trip. We used Expedia only because we were having difficulty finding a bargain through our usual travel site. First off, the location offers great access to the MTA, Central Park and all that the Upper West Side has to offer - and that's a lot. The hotel could use a major face lift. Its decor is a mishmash of various styles and looks cluttered and unkempt. Evidently, renovations are under way on some floors. Nonetheless, little attention has been given to where to place a/c units. We had to keep ours off at night because it blew over our faces. That wouldn't have been the case if it;2

Stayed here for one night at the beginning of December. Arrived at 2:30, which is a half hour after check-ins start. They tell me that my room isn't available! I had to wait 40 minutes for them to clean, which I'm sure just consisted of a quick vacuum. Once I entered the room, it was extremely cold. A huge draft of cold air came through both windows, and made the room unbearable when the HEAT wasn't working! YES, I was without heat the entire stay! Not to mention, I was also without hot water. Myself and many others complained about this and all management did was blame the customers for not making them aware?! They were made aware countless times and did nothing to remedy the situation, just said it was being fixed. My room was right next to their office so I had the pleasure;2
We stayed here for 5 nights, putting some exchange issues we had to the side, it could have been better. When we arrived we thought the reception looked really nice with a great Art Deco feel to it. Then we got in the lift which was quite old and broke down a few times whilst we were there. Our room was in the stairwell so anyone walking up and down the stairs walked right past our door which we could hear. It offered quite a few channels on a flat screen TV but we were treated with 4 channels on an old box tv. The best thing about it was the fact there was a 24 hour cafe across the road.;2

Paid 130 for queen bedroom. Couldn't watch NFL playoff that we wanted to in the room. Wifi is barely functional. Can see hallway lights peeking into the hotel room. No safe to use. Fridge is nice. Asked if there was an iron already in the room and was told yes but found out no. Went down to get one. Front desk is friendly and tried to do the best they could. Great location. A little sketchy at night. Best for people who will be out all day and just need to use the room to sleep in. There are no comforts of home here.;2

Good location and held our luggage once we checked out so we didnât have to carry it around for the day. Staff were polite.   Â· Beds were uncomfortable, windows werenât soundproof and street was always busy so a terrible nights sleep. No lift so we had to carry our cases up 2 flights of stairs (they did offer help though). Maid only made our bed once in a week - sheets were never changed and we had to call down for towels one morning because we werenât left any. Our key cards stopped working 3 times so had to keep going back to reception. Breakfast was just a muffin or bagel - and only until 9am and not 11am as it was stated in our room. Rooms werenât really clean and really dated considering the hotel is quite new. The bathroom layout was just odd -toilet right next to the sink;2

We arrived having booked for 3 adults as our teenager counted as an adult. We had to ask for bedding for the sofa bed as none had been supplied. When the member of staff arrived he only had sheets as there were no blankets available. We had to ask for additional towels as only 2 were supplied. The fridge leaked and having reported it it was not fixed for 2 days. The rooms were very tired and had cigarette burns on the furniture. There was nothing on the website to suggest smoking was allowed in the room but our room was smelling of smoke. The hotel overall was very tired and i am in the process of making a complaint to Days Inn. I would not stay again nor would i ever recommend it.;2
I stayed there Saturday night and was very disappointed. The first room they gave us smelled so strongly of chlorine that my eyes burned.  After complaining they put us in a room with a beautiful view of the air shaft.  The rooms were very dark and old looking. In the morning. I had to take cold shower. There are definitely better hotels for the money;2
The good:  Close to a subway stop. The bad:  Wet spot in the middle of the room, television didn't work, view of a brick wall, general state of disrepair, expensive, smelly, weird sort of maze, almost everything that could be stained in some way was, loud music playing from some rooms was tolerated.;2

My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and were not really expecting much, as it's a Days Inn... It certainly didn't deliver. We went on a search for vending machines the first night and learned that there are only three in the entire 13-floor building, and all were on separate floors. Each floor had its own distinct odor, none of which were pleasant, and all of which were cigarette based. We moved as quickly as possible whenever we had to come or go. The first morning I got up and found that we had no hot water. My boyfriend later saw that there were two master control knobs beside the toilet that controlled the hot/cold mix, but even after adjusting those, it was next to impossible to control the temperature while showering---it would fluctuate every 30 seconds or so.;2
Paid extra for this room however the WiFi was terrible and I wasn't contactable which left me feeling anxious. The kettle even after being half filled kept boiling over and I burnt my finger and had to keep cleaning up lots of spilled boiling water. The TV volume restriction was a good idea in theory however with the outside noise it wasn't watchable. When I left I wanted to tell the member of staff on the desk but was put off by her unfriendly manner and I wasn't even asked how my stay was!!;2
We were placed in room 130 and was really noisy, an annoying bumblebee because of the machinery. After talk with front desk (rude manners by them) they gave us room 122, no hot air, only air-conditioning, so really cold.

"Make sure you check the room out ahead of time! ""Hotel staff""--really just one person at a card table--are on duty 9 am - 10 pm only. Outside those hours, there's no way to contact them.

I called ahead to see about early check-in, knowing we would have a very full day. The person I talked to was quite rude, told me there was no such thing. Nonetheless, we came by at 11:30 am. No rooms available, but we did store luggage. I told them we wouldn't be back until midnight and was assured all would be well and to get a key from the doorman.

Yes, the price is right, but the bunk bed rooms are smaller than what I'd imagine a jail cell to be, the cigarette smoke from other guests could be smelled in our ""room,"" and our neighbor was a creepy full-time resident who stayed up past 3 am watching tv. Also, sharing a bathroom, especially w/ full-timers, is kind of anxiety-inducing. This place is too pretentious, too, and full of wannabe hipsters, which is too bad, because the cafe is lovely, and makes you feel like you are traveling elsewhere in the world, very far away. They need to knock some walls down and add some bathrooms to start to live up to their cachet. Also, I felt itchy in the bed. I'm just sayin'.";2

The first room into which we were sent was a disgrace by anybody's standards. Firstly, it was on a smoking floor. Secondly, a minature Yorkshire Terrier would be too big for this room and finally, the shower sprays water all over the bathroom and basically floods the place.  When I called to complain about these things, among others, I got the most frustrating responses from the Front Desk.  ""It's not a smoking floor, it's a smoking optional floor"" - what is that supposed to mean????  ""it's a European style";2
We stayed at the Hilton to have easy access to Universal Studios the next morning. The last thing we wanted to do was deal with a dirty and smelly room. Unfortunately, the Hilton staff did nothing to compensate us for our disappointing experience. On the plus side, it is very close to Universal Studios and we got there before the gates even opened! :) I think I'll try the Sheraton next time though, which is also across the street from Universal Studios.;2

I proceeded to book this hotel having seen many positive reviews, and giving it the benefit of the doubt.   During our stay the Westminster Kennel Club dog show meant that the hotel was packed full of dogs - whilst that was no problem for us, it might have been somewhat different with allergies.   The hotel lobby gives an impression of the grandeur that once was - unfortunately, the luxury ends there.   As mentioned in other reviews, the lift situation is awful - although they are supposed to be replaced next month, we found we needed to leave an extra ten minutes when we left our room to ensure we werenât late. Only two of the eight lifts for the hotel floors were operational during our stay.   The room itself was fine but extremely dated - this is particularly noticeable in;2
This hotel is very well located, and fairly inexpensive by NY standards. Now the bad news, and this seems to be a universal problem, great foyer with plenty of uniformed staff, but scruffy rooms, too many staff whose sole purpose appears to be to hang around the foyer looking smart and not that interested in assisting customers. After taxes, it probably wasn't even that cheap. Why, oh why, don't hotels invest more in the rooms and less in flashy foyers?;2
Just two days in this hotel and the review cannot be positive: Upon arrival safe not working,  WiFi  difficult to instal and you have to pay for it,  there is a lot of noise in the street and the room is not at all isolated from the sound: needed ear plugs all night. Today at 16:30 I arrived to rest before going to a Broadway show and the room had not been cleaned!;2
"The lobby is nice.  The elevators are slow.  The hallways to the room are dark and depressing.  The rooms are small.  They're ok, but are showing significant wear.  They charge a bogus facilities/resort fee that covers basically nothing; it's just a money grab because you are charged it whether you use the extremely limited facilities or not.  NOTE TO HOTEL: telephones are not a resort amenity.   Some of the front desk staff were rude like you'd expect of a stereotypical New Yorker on a TV show or movie.";2

My stay at The New Yorker has been the worst stay at any hotel I have ever experienced. When you get to the hotel the Lobby is very busy and very nice. The buzz gives you a real feel of the city. The hotel is on a central location with easy transport connections. This is where the beauty of the hotel ends. Firstly, I was told the rate of the room was $159 plus tax, my total bill came too $260. When I tried to pay cash, I was told the hotel does not accept cash. Even though you are given that option when making a reservation. I was given a room on the 21st floor. When you come out of the elevator you are met with an old musky smell and a very dirty brown carpet. Nothing like the decor that you are presented with when you first enter the hotel. On getting to the room we were met;2
I walked in and immediately LOVED the place  for it's decor. But shame on me, she who has on more than one occasion chosen wine because of it's cute label!  Not only was the service at the front desk lackluster, but when I had issues with my bill, it took FOREVER to have it straightened out. And when it was resolved, they essentially tried to make ME feel bad for the mistake even though it was their error.   The room was lovely, the bed was comfy.. and I'll even forgive the TINY bathroom. I swear the toilet might as well been IN the shower, the place was so small.    The air conditioning didn't work and the room was hot as hell. It was actually comfortable cool outside yet my room HOT AS HELL. I asked for it to be taken care of - politely of course - to no avail.  Got in late -;2
"This hotel may appear sharp when you enter, but the hallway sure make you understand that this is not an modern hotel. Itâs very old, and need refurbishment. Especially the bathroom which is very small with no storage.    In advance for our visit I kindly asked for one of the new refurbished rooms, with I read here, was actually existing. The answer I got was that they couldnât promise anything but would put down my request. At the check in I asked if we got one of the refurbished rooms. The person I spoke with said; oh yes you definitely got an upgrade. Well that wasnât true, so why lie about it?   The location is good if you want to live in the concrete jungle of Manhattan! The elevator was not late despite many floors.";2
The location of the hotel is good and convenient. Overall the hotel gives the impression of neglect and lack of quality control. The pool didn't work, the fitness center was not cleaned daily, my room facing the inner courtyard had unacceptable noise from the airconditioners, and the aircon in the room took a long time to cool. I guess this is New York, where the customer isn't king.;2
Just returned from a 3 day stay at Hilton Disney Anaheim (which was fine) and a 4 day stay in this Universal hotel. The Universal location is good but after that I don't have too much else good to say about the efficiency of the infrastructure of the hotel. The first day there the lift (elevator in USA terms) to the car park would not come up from the car park below to take us down to the car park as the buttons were not working. We had to wait 10 minutes for someone to come up from the car park so we could catch that lift. I informed the hotel staff about this and was given a free movie for my room (which we were never going to use) They told me they knew about problems with the lift and it would be sorted. The next day we caught the lift again as someone was coming out of it;2
We just stayed there on our honeymoon and it was the worst hotel we have stayed in, in America! The woman with the sour face on the front desk is rude and unhelpful to say the least, we called her Cruella! On the last day I asked if we could keep our room for another half day as we were not flying home till the evening to which she replied they didnt provide?! Whoever her manager is, she is losing him money and guests... awful breakfast, smelly rooms and very old fasioned.. oh and there are renovations happening at the moment, builders in first thing in the morning but actually they were the friendliest!!;2
This is not the worst hotel I've stayed at in my life hence 2 stars not 1, however it left a lot to be desired after my weeks stay in July 2017.  Starting with the positives: Check in was fine, the door men and bell boys were very polite and helpful, lobby was very clean and posh which is to be expected in a hotel of this calibre. The room it's self was clean and a good size and a nice big 6ft bed. There's also a safe in the room which is straightforward to use. They also include a good quality hair dryer under the sink in the room.    The first thing that ticked me off was the fact that my family and I chose this hotel because it had a rooftop pool, which very few hotels have, and having stayed in New York before at different hotels, we wanted something a bit different.

We spent two nights here December 25th and 26th. First of all I thought I did research and even though I am a HH member I thought I had to purchase the package deal from Universal studios to get into the park early. I was wrong, so since I booked it through Universal and not through my HH, my room was below average for $300 a night. The check in was just okay, the front desk lady was not that nice. It was Christmas and not a smile to greet us. She told me we would have gotten the early pass if we booked through the hotel. Well it doesn't say anything on the website. I asked her if there was a shuttle to take us to Universal and she said no. Well I found out later that there is a shuttle that takes you to Universal City which is right next door to Universal park. Duh, she should;2

I should point out that this trip was my partner's first time in New York, but my seventh or eighth time in the city, so we wanted it to be comfortable and memorable. Most times I've stayed in NYC I've ended up in a great hotel for a good price with super friendly staff. However, the Ameritania fell short of what I've come to expect from American hotels and American customer service in general.   From the lukewarm-at-best welcome at 9pm on a Saturday night when we'd been travelling all day, to the dingy room with damp patches, it was just a really disappointing experience. The one saving grace was the speed at which front desk managed to dispatch a maintenance guy to our room when we started seeing sparks from one of the electricity sockets.   Good points - It really is a;2
"When we checked in we thought, ""Why so many bad reviews?  This place is great!""  When we left two days later, I swore I'd never stay at a Hilton property again.  The hotel is nice and the location is perfect for Universal Studios.  Don't bother with the shuttle, it's faster to walk, it's so close.  The halls are often frigid and the elevators can be slow but they're being upgraded or something.  There is no free wireless.    Just a heads up-- You have to walk THROUGH a breakfast buffet to get to the parking garage or pedestrian exits.  Our rooms were expensive and some people in the group interpreted the sign for ""continental breakfast"" to mean ""complimentary"".  While a hostess berated some people in our large group for grabbing a muffin on the way out, I asked a chef looking on";2

If you want to be close to the Park, across from Lincoln Center, a three minute walk to Columbus Circle  then, in terms of location, this place can't be beat. Unfortunately, it CAN be beat in most other ways - or at least a key way for me. While the staff is friendly and the lobby inviting, the elevators, hallways, and rooms are tired and in need of some serious refreshing. The room was fairly large for NYC but everything from carpets to bed covers to the bathroom needs to be repaired, replaced, or refreshed. There are far more comfortable options nearby. It's an incredible spot, but far from spotless.;2
Get use to the street noise and no complimentary WiFi in the rooms. The hotel charges you after your first serving of tea or coffee in the room. The location was great to be near the arts district and Juilliard.;2

We just stayed here for the 1st time June 1st- 3rd. We wanted to stay close to Universal Studios due to having our 2 kids with us. The pictures looked amazing and the reviews were great. Pulling up. Your like WOW it's really pretty. Lobby was nice and girls at the check in we very sweet. But got to our room. We booked a room with 2 double beds and got the 8th floor. I immediately noticed stains on the carpet, our daughter found hair in the shower from previous guests when she went to take shower, the shower kept making noise like the pipe was about to burst. Beds were HORRIBLE. I stayed a lot of places and these were the WORST beds I have ever slept on EVER.

Beautiful lobby and potentially nice atmosphere.  When I woke up and wanted a cup of tea they wanted $3 for a kcup for the room.  Walked next door to Starbucks.  Room was seriously drafty with a heater that did not work.  This place would be so cool with a little effort.  Instead that nice lobby is full of slightly irritated guests.;2
Another stay at the Empire and same as last time:  no improvement.  The air conditioning does not work.  The shower drenches the bathroom floor. Dreary, dark dÃ©cor.  Wallpaper peeling off the wall. The room is dark.  Water is $7.50 per bottle.  Go somewhere else for your money.;2
Lobby is lovely.....guestrooms not so much. Our room rate $319 a night before taxes and fees bringing you closer to  $400. Tub was peeling, tile in bathroom cracked, chipped and years of gunk in the grout and edges of the floor. Beds were new and comfortable but the overall room was SUPER tired. You can see the potential here but they've got a lonnnnnng way to go.;2

I know this has little to do with the hotel, but I stayed there in early December and had bed bug bites.  I kind of feel like it may be more difficult to weed them out of this hotel due to the way its setup (tiny tiny rooms, wood bedframes, etc).  They were supposed to refund me one nights stay, but never did. I knew I should have gotten that in writing.  They did cook all my clothes and gave me a new room for my last nights stay however.  This was the 2nd time in NYC that I've been bitten by bed bugs (last time was at a Marriott)  Thankfully this time I knew what they were (last time I had no idea and ended up bringing them back into my house).  The room itself was extremely hot, and the noise from the bar was extremely loud on Friday and Saturday nights (until about 3am) -;2

Check in was a mess sadly, our booking wouldn't come up. They were rude to most of the group and rooms weren't ready. Some waited up until 4pm. They just have a very poor understanding of what it is to be hospitable and work in the industry where service is everything. Bathrooms were extremely small and shower was hard to work. There is no way you can turn the shower on without the shower wetting you. Luckily what has put me off this hotel, these are all things easy to fix. I hope they do.;2
"After visiting the Big Apple back in August and loving it so much I just had to return and this time bring the mother. We opted to book our travel and accommodation through Expedia.  On my previous stay in the city, I stayed in the Wellington Hotel which was rated less than the Wyndham New Yorker in all departments so I thought this hotel was going to be the real deal; how wrong was I?   Upon arriving we asked for an upgrade if there was anything available (at a fee of course, we were obviously wanting to pay for it). We were rudely told no and that there was nothing for the duration of our stay and when we asked if they had any king beds we were also rudely and aggressively told that they don't do king beds, only queen.    The main lobby was lovely but I couldn't say the same";2
I stayed at this hotel in mid July for 4 nights and I have to say that my stay there definitely prompted a concise but brief review. Check in was actually quite smooth, the front desk staff and bell men were both super helpful. Randy, the front desk attendant (I think that's his name) was awesome! I was checked into my room about 30 mins prior to the start of check in time which was also nice. I'd read countless reviews and looked at numerous photos prior to arriving so I knew exactly what to expect. I opted for the standard cabin with shared bathroom  for budget purposes (sharing a bathroom was my main concern but actual was pretty good considering its shared.) Everything was pretty much spot on, the room was tiny. I mean SMALL. I couldn't imagine more than one person staying;2
I stayed here for myself and my partners 8 year anniversary I had booked through travel agents and told them that it was our anniversary and if they could do something nice in the room or at least have a nice room. We arrived to the hotel and was greeted by a lovely door man called Jeff who couldn't of been more helpful Unfortunately our room wasn't ready until 3pm and a certain staff member at reception called Elina was very rude and unhelpful!! Once we got to our room it was like a small box with a bed in it only fit enough for 1 person which I was not impressed with as I asked for a nicer room or expected a bottle of champagne for the room or even a glass. I contacted reception and got the room changed which was much better and what we expected. I then got speaking to a;2
I booked this room through hotwire who marked it as a 3 star hotel, definitely something it's not. I liked the location (and it's not in Harlem, if that means anything anyway), and I don't care about small rooms or slow elevators -- it's Manhattan, and it's cheap -- that stuff is expected. However, the furniture was beaten up, there were stains on the carpet, our blinds were broken, and it was just generally a bleak, depressing place. It was clean, though, and quiet enough. The bed wasn't horrible but yet wasn't comfortable either. The TV didn't work at all, which they mentioned was a cable problem in the whole neighborhood, which I have trouble believing based on all the reviews here mentioning ongoing problems with the TV. So, yeah, it's cheap and in a nice area, but I don't;2

Every time we showered (morning specifically) we had to leave the hot water running for 15+ minutes in order to get some type of warm water. On the third day of our stay, we had no running water for more than 2 hours. Then it took another hour for us to get hot water cuz they were having boiler problems. We also requested bath towels twice, but didnât get anything sent until my daughter went downstairs personally. I never leave bad reviews as Iâm pretty easy to satisfy, but for this this to be a Hilton and the experience we had was such a disappointment. Unfortunately thereâs not many lodging options close to the park so itâs either this or The Sheraton right next door. Makes me wonder if I shouldâve stayed there instead.;2
I wish i had read the reviews before i booked. The staff were amazing and the bar across the road is fantastic. Its called whispers. These things were the only good things about this hotel. It kinda ruined my nyc experience. The smell of weed on the corridors is horrendous. I honestly thought the people who wrote this on the reviews were prob overreacting. They were not. I would imagine you would possibly get high if u stood in the corridor long enough. The rooms!!!!! I have no words. I have seen better squatter rooms on the tv. The carpets were so bad i had to wear my flip flops the whole time. Steer clear;2
The room was adequate. No dresser in room and old bathroom. Free wifi was ok. Better reception in am. Elevater was poor. One set up elevators was out of order making movement very inconvenient. Clean room, however. All this for $250/nite!;2
First the positives. Location is good - a short walk from Central Park and the Lincoln Centre. Metro stop nearby. Bed and pillows comfortable. Shower as good as any hotel shower. Staff friendly. Impressive lobby.  Not so good: we had requested a quiet, high room. We got a room on the 6th floor (The hotel has 11 floors). Whilst we were only occasionally aware of traffic noise, there was a constant background noise from outside the window, possibly something to do with air conditioning. We could not use the air conditioning within the room - it was too noisy. The room itself can only be described as pokey.  The bad: we arrived to discover our wardrobe door hanging by one hinge. We had to ask twice for a repair. Our friends had a similar problem with their bathroom door which was;2

One member of our party was very disappointed with the hotel but three of us found it adequate. It was clean and had the towels changed every day but it could certainly use a new coat of paint! In other words it was a bit shabby. As all we wanted to do there was sleep it was O.K.  The lifts were slow but at least they worked. Luckily the subway and Starbucks were just around the corner so the centre of New York was only minutes away. For a low cost visit to the Big Apple it was fine and I would probably stay there again.

We are a family from Massachusetts, and spend a night or two in Manhattan 2-3 times a year.  We always look for a room that can fit 4 or 5, has a central location, is in a 3-4 star hotel, and is in the same price range.  The room that we had at Empire hotel was smaller than any other we have used in the last 5 years, in some cases, less than half the size.  The beds were tiny as well- not queen, not full, but double.  The shower has the half glass enclosure, which was fine with me, but my kids spilled water everywhere. The room was clean enough. The breakfast was excellent, and overall cheaper than what we would have paid going to a restaurant/ cafe near by. The rooftop bar has amazing views and ambiance.

No porters to carry bags so i had to drag a rucksack and 2 cases through a reception full of unhelpful people after a 8 hr  flight an transfer.   We booked a junior suite as it was a birthday treat - we was checked in by Romeo who assured us the view we would have from our 2nd floor room was amazing. Natural instinct to check the view the second you get in the room. I wish i left the curtains closed the view was of 2 tower blocks of office opposite the hotel no views of central park as this hotel claims. The size of the room was totally underrated.

I stayed at the Empire Hotel on week-long business trip to New York, booking it on the recommendation of a colleague. Wish that I had checked the Tripadvisor reviews before confirming, as much of what is criticised by others here is accurate. To summarise my experience:   Rooms I had two rooms during my stay. The first was called 'courtyard' view, but this equates to the light-well in the rear of the buildings on the block. Natural light very dingy and dark, particularly on the lower floor where I was, and not helped by the low voltage lighting in the room - the compensation being that it was quiet. The second room was on a higher floor, looking up Broadway and over the Lincoln Center. Better view, highlighting the dirty windows, which really do need cleaning inside and out.;2
My husband and I came to Hollywood celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We stayed Sept. 14th-19th.  This hotel looked really nice on the website and got mostly good reviews, included a buffet breakfast, a pool, a restaurant along with a courtyard bar and A/C.  I thought it was a great deal.  We arrive and were told that the restaurant was closed due to a power outage.  Also only ONE working elevator for three floors!  That was very inconvenient because the elevator that was working was very slow so we took the stairs a lot.  The courtyard bar was having happy hour between 2 to 7pm daily.  First day we go out there, there was no one around and we noticed there were appetizers sitting out that was covered in flies!  We decided to check out the pool.  Pool area looked nice...BUT;2
Pros: Check-in was good and fast. Perfect location, everything is nearby just 10 -20min away walking depending where do you want to go. Train station next to the hotel.  Restaurants in hotel and nearby Nice lobby I guessâ¦  Cons: Rooms are really small and all decor of the hotel itâs old fashioned and rusty in some areas.  Bathrooms were clean not the best satisfaction when seeing it, you can notice it has not been renovated in a long time. Walls on room were damaged, dents and scratches. I can understand itâs a historic hotel as what iâve seen but still I understand that the company managing needs to keep everything up to date.  I was not impressed at all with the hotel.  If I ever return to new york I will definitely look other options.;2
We have just retuned from a New York break, 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. This is advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not, Iâve stayed at better 2-star hotels. Itâs really tired and shabby with tape covering the frayed edges of carpet in the communal areas.  If you are staying on 21st floor and above you may wait up to 20 minutes for an elevator as they are not always working. The windows in the rooms do not fit the frame so the wind howls like a gale through the windows, making the rooms extremely cold. We had to keep the curtains closed the whole time to stop the freezing draft.  The receptionists are not very helpful, when we arrived, we explained that we had paid for bed and breakfast and were advised by the receptionist that breakfast was;2
I stayed one night, Thursday night 2/28.  For the price I expected much more quality from my stay.  I paid $175+ for one night and expected a lot more than I got.  Parking, $10/day... and there is no other option due to location.  Checking in, the front desk clerk was decent and I could tell he was doing his best to be helpful.  He seemed like he was new as he fumbled a bit but I appreciated his helpful attitude.  The other clerk seemed apathetic.  However, after check in, it was all disappointment.  The room decor was bland and outdated, looked like it was from the 1990s.  The water in the room was $3.95 for a small bottle, larger bottle $5.95, not even complimentary.  When taking a shower I noticed that the only half the nozzles on the shower head were passing water, the;2

After booking this hotel online and only having the briefest detail on it, I was somewhat nervous after having read the negative reviews on here.  I can only say I wished I'd heeded the majority advice and changed hotels.  It appears that the hotel has changed hands and become part of the Days Inn chain and boy, have they got some work to do.  The foyer is generally ok and check-in was swift although I wasn't happy to be told I couldn't use the room phone as I had pre-paid.  It meant all local & national calls had to be made using my mobile (cellphone) and as I'm from the UK, that has cost  me a bomb.  Why couldn't they take my credit card details like all other hotels do?  There are 2 sets of elevators: don't use the ones on the right of reception as they never seem to arrive.;2

You can tell my general feeling of this hotel by the title, but I will start out with the one good thing...the  hotel's location. It's less than a minute walk to a major subway line (the 1 train), as well as across the street from beautiful Lincoln Center, restaurants, and a short walk to Central Park. Unfortunately for us, this is where the good stopped. This yet another Priceline received hotel, which they claim is 4 stars. However, this is yet another property that seems to have put much more into its look than the actual quality of the hotel.    The first issue, was the outrageous mandatory $150 incidental deposit required to check in. Not surprisingly, the room didn't even have $150 worth of amenities. This high amount was for a 2-night stay. Then, the queen room we were;2
Completely average, think motel rather than hotel. This is budget accommodation. Rooms very basic, very tiny but clean. Central heating poor, we had to request an additional portable heater. No catering just vending machines in basement.  This is an old building that has received a recent face-lift. Minor irritations with poor quality finish.  Not as good as picures would suggest. In our opinion just a bit too far out of town at 106th St. Some rooms have park views, but nothing special happening at this end of the park. If you are an experienced visitor and just need somewhere to sleep, this would be fine.  For first time visitors to the big apple, pay the extra and get closer to the city. we would not use this hotel again.;2
i find the hotel location perfect, but it was to noisy , we couldnt sleep the windows were old so the cold and the nois was coming in ! the hotel is VERY DARK, you just wan to go out. the resto was good food it was ok NewYork experiance;2
On paper this is a wonderful hotel, looks great (photos and physically)   Reasonable price, great location and large rooms.  The problem lies with horrific service due to major understaffing and unpleasant tiny bath / and impractical shower.  The problem starts with a busy checking in area which means one always seems to have a 20 minute wait to check in or out and with other problems,  Whenever you don't need anything, magically there is no queue,  We changed rooms as the shower has no door so water splashes in the bathroom, not ideal, and when we moved to a room with a bath the bath was so small with no ledge and enclosed by a wall, it was incredibly uncomfortable and impractical.  Being in Manhattan and not a modern building noise was a problem.   Beds were very comfortable,;2
We booked the New Yorker and werenât greeted when we arrived. We were confronted to stand and take a photo for a temperature check without any explanation or at least a âWelcome to the New Yorker, please stand here for your temper check.â The staff in general were dismissive, dry, and it felt like we were intruding on their space. We booked a stay at Arlo Soho for the remainder of our trip because we refuse to pay for services that are subpar. The best part of the NewYorker was exiting with our luggage in hand and 3 staff members watching us leave without even saying thank you for coming. Weâve never experienced hotel service as such. We just checked in to Arlo Soho and the experience was night and day, as it should be. However, I appreciate the clean room and hot shower.;2
I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel one week 8-15 may 2016. We were 2 persons at holyday. I reserved it through Hotel.com to a fair price.   Unfortunately the price for internet at $ 27.50 per day came on top when I arrived to the hotel.  And it was not optional. It made me angry, and the price was no longer so fair. The location was good, in uptown part NY.  But the room was small and old, and with a dirty window - without a view. The hotel is built in 1930 an have a glory history, which describes in the basement, where there is a small exhibition. The entrance hall is all right - but the hotel rooms in general could use an innovative makeover. The hotel advertise with breakfast for 1 dollarâ¦ It is a gimmick.  There is a small desk in the hall, where they have some sort of;2
This hotel does have a good location, pleasant enough staff and nice decor. The trade off is apparently made in room size (micro) and basic amenities which are missing or for which one must pay extra. Call me crazy, but I do expect to be able to get coffee... even bad coffee... somewhere in a hotel. Either the crappy brew-it-yourself or in the lobby. Nope.  Towels and oddly, bathmats, were in short supply considering the shower is wide open to the bathroom and puts water all over the floor.  The pool is hip, but waaaay smaller than pictures make it seem. Unheated as well, but it was in the 90s so we didn't care.;2
"Stayed one night earlier in the year, and boy was I glad I was there for only a night. Stayed at this hotel as I was stopping over from DC to catch a flight to Asia and thought it would be good to stay near Penn Station. Got a good rate for the room. Despite moderating my expectations, found the corridors Old and gloomy; rooms also dark and creepy. Hotel seems to enforce the 3pm check in time strictly - don't think the receptionist bothered to check if there were available rooms when I checked in at 1 pm after a 3.5 h train ride from DC. Extremely noisy rooms - sounds of water running through the pipes are incredibly loud, as are noise of doors closing, all starting from 6 am on the date of my departure.Not surprising given the number of guests staying in a hotel of this size.";2

Our first low impression of the place was confirmed when we checked into our room to find the bed sheets had not been changed from the previous occupants- there was dirt and hair and stains on both beds. We requested that they change the sheets immediately and they seemed confounded that we had a problem with it. The towels were threadbare and stained and they didnât provide a top sheet. The bathtub plug didnât work so my hope of having a nice soak after a full day and night traipsing the streets were dashed.  On our second day some money went missing from our room after room service and the housekeeping staff denied taking it. We had a hell of a time getting the staff to not pass the buck or blame us for not using the safe. When we finally were able to get hold of the manager;2
This was my third stay at the Empire Hotel and likely my last. I booked the hotel for this trip via Priceline and was very pleased with the rate I received -- I thought I was getting a stellar deal since I (thought) I knew what to expect from this hotel. It's in a great neighborhood, and in the past I've always been please with my stay. I was registered for three nights -- Sept. 2 through Sept. 5, 2014.  Arrived on Sept. 2 and had no issues checking in. Elevators were slow, but at first this was not a big deal. The room was musty and the wall around the air conditioner was a little mildewy. Not a deal-breaker, but I wasn't thrilled. There was a small stain on the fitted sheet, and while I left the cover pulled back every morning so that the stain was evident, the sheets were not;2

We booked this hotel as it seemed pretty central and large rooms.  Firstly I would like to point out that this hotel has no bell boy/concierge/porter, call it what you like they were non existent which means your responsible for your luggage, so if you are unable or unwilling to take your luggage to your room it will stay in reception. The first room we were given was very spacious but very dated, the bed was on a metal base and would squeak every twist and turn and the lights where difficult to turn on or off and would occasionally flicker, when I explored this it led me to a hole in the wall behind my bed that the light fitting was plugged into, not too safe with a metal bed base i thought, I then looked at other safety issues to find that there was no sprinklers in the rooms;2
I stayed a couple of nights in this hotel. It is a huge and ugly hotel, located close to a metro station, something which is very convenient. My room was in the eight floor and was not easy to find. I had to go through an emergency exit (in which somebody had written the room numbers behind with a marker) to get to it. It did not look like the pictures (I guess they have some renovated rooms, it was not the case for mine). The room had one big window with a busted dirty air conditioning machine on it, a big bed, a table, a huge piece of furniture with a very old big TV on it, a random closet and a bathroom. All of this in a really small space. The window was there but could have not been with not much difference, every noise 8 floors down could be heard up with no problem at;2

Although I had very low expectations, this low-end property was not as bad as it could have been. A bit shabby (with the same carpet I had in my apartment in 1978) and rundown but clean. But, there was no internet because my room was too far away from an access point. Not normally a huge issue but the desk clerk lied about what had been/was being/would be done about it...which was nothing. What else did they lie about? âRecently renovated.â ...yeah, in the late 1970s;2

My son and I spent one night here in December because we had an early morning event close by. I couldn't have spent more than one night here.  I chose this hotel because of it's close proximity to the event we were attending but also because it was one of the more *reasonably* priced hotels in the area.  We arrived at night and ordered room service ($22 for a cheeseburger...which is fine. We expect prices like that in New York City.) and planned to retire early as we needed to be up and out early in the morning. When we entered our room it was HOT. Ridiculously hot. I immediately went to the heating/cooling unit and put it on as high and cool as possible. It barely sputtered. I attempted to contact the front desk four times. All four times, the phone rang and rang and rang. At;2
We stayed in this Hotel a week ago with our nine year old son. I will list the good and bad points and you can make your own decision. GOOD: Location was wonderful, we went to places like: The Grove, Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, and La Brea Tarpits among others and never drove for more than 15 min. The room was rather large arounf 550 sq. ft. with a wet bar, fridge and microwave. It also had a patio but it was on their public patio and hardly private. BAD:  We were in a room between the back (main entrance) and the lobby, the noise was next to unbearable. We asked for a new room because upon sticking my head out my door after hearing pounding on the wall, a group of drunk girls threatened to kick my [--]. I did not know them, this was at 2:30 a.m. We asked for a;2
"This hotel was recommended by a friend and the online photos looked great. The location certainly is wonderful. However, the room is smaller than a closet...nowhere to put anything!! Seriously, my husband and I came with two rather small suitcases and there was nowhere to put things. The bathroom is so small; there is no room to put any toiletries. And, I HATE when hotels gouge their guest with extra fees for the internet (double if you each have a computer). ""Free"" internet in the lobby, but it's so loud there that there is no place to sit peacefully if you have to work. Why not just add a few dollars to the room fee and include the damn internet? We thought this would be a good alternative to the Hilton, but don't waste your money.";2

The hotel location is great. But check-in and concierge are very inefficient. Guests can cut queues. Nothing works as expected. Blinds not working. Very noisy room.

This hotel does have a few nice features - great location, nice lobby/2nd floor lounge area, and lovely L'Occitane bath products.  Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives during my stay.    The very narrow hallways with dark wallpaper were off-putting from the start. I was not expecting a large room, but was suprised to find such a small room with such minimal space surrounding the bed.  Although the TV was nice, I would've preferred a desk upon which I could do my work.  A leisure traveler might not have any problems with this, but between the lamp, TV, and tray of items for purchase on the small desk, I had no room to work on my small laptop.  The brick wall view only emphasized the small, dark, cramped feeling of the room.  In addition, the bathroom was not well;2
Pros: - Universal Studio theme park is just walking distance from the hotel.   - Room and toilet is big and considerably clean.  Cons: - As Iâm a Hilton Honors member, was being prompted to check in and enable the digital key. But the digital key function is out of order  - Room is generally dark, thereâs no ceiling lights, thereâs only 2 side table lights and a standing light  - Upon check-in 2 bottles of water is provided and thatâs it for my 3 nights stay - Bedroom slippers are not available inside the room, have to call housekeeper to request and the wait is about 45 minutes  - There is no mirror within the room except the toilet. So if you are travelling with a wife who needs to put on her makeup, be prepared she will need to stay inside the toilet for the longest time.;2
Stayed in a double room on the 22nd floor - honestly itâs like stepping back in time! View was non existent couldnât even see the kind of weather or how to dress appropriately for the day! Didnât mind the room been compact and it was clean but honestly in need of the biggest makeover, carpet so worn, decor so dingy and window is tapped up with black tape! It was clean with fresh towels but lord god invest in it as a result I wouldnât return! Staff were nice and security at lifts was excellent! Could be such an amazing hotel if money was invested in it!  I find this very disappointing personally!  Good location for sightseeing however the streets leading off from it or so polluted with drug users itâs hard to believe!;2
in short, PRO: well located for a decent price CON: NOISY, SMALL, staff not approachable, desperate need for refurbishment    spend 6 nights in June 2016 for our holiday in USA.  The Morningside Inn is easy to get to with the metro. From the stop (103rd or 110th) it's just a few minutes walk. The hotel is in a convenient location with plenty of shops and restaurants and bar in the area.  When checked in the receptionist seemed bothered that we arrived to check in, no smile not friendly but not rude either. just needed a credit card for payment and that's it, no registration to complete no need to see id/passport.

Ok this hotel is in a great location, but it misses the mark completely. First I got a winning bid on price line for a room. I didn't pick this hotel. When I looked at the other reviews I thought maybe people were being mean. Nope they were not. Upon check-in, I was told we would be in one of the interior rooms, I started to argue the point that my reservation didn't specify there were 2 different classes of rooms, but just went along with it. The staff was nice enough & the concierge was outstanding. The 2 gentlemen working there were incredible.  The room gets a 2 for several reasons. There is absolutely no closet space to put your things out of the way. In real estate they always say you can't count a room as a bedroom if it has no closet....So we had to put our bags on the;2

From the minute my fiancÃ© and I walked into the hotel, the obvious lack of customer service was apparent.  When we were checking in, the person behind the counter never even looked up at us, introduced himself, or welcomed us to the hotel. He was very curt with us and seemed like we were inconveniencing him by making him do his job.   After checking in, my fiancÃ© and I dropped our bags off in what was an extremely small, yet nicely decorated room, and went down to the lobby bar to get a drink. My fiancÃ© had to do work, and since wifi costs $12/day in the rooms, we were going to try and use it in the lobby. My fiancÃ© tried to access the wifi several times without success. He asked multiple people at the desk for assistance. They just told him that he had to stand by the check-in;2

Stayed at MIDTOWN  WEST HOTEL for only one night. Was in town for business  and stayed at another $$$ Hotel  and needed something simpler for an extra night to sightsee.  Liked the location of MWH but it is very bare bones with the smallest bathroom I have seen in a long time with the sink almost impossible to negotiate. The service was fine and the desk clerk helpful and it was CLEAN . One thing that struck me was the lack of a reading lamp  which gave the room more of a flophouse feel than necessary. Price was reasonable for NYC and it was a last minute booking but still hope to do better for $170 with taxes & fee. Next time Iâll search a little deeper.;2
My wife and I recently spent a week at the Empire Hotel, and while the location is great and the feel of the interior is modern and hip, the facility gave us nothing but problems. The first night there the plumbing had some sort of back up non-related to our room and created our toilet to over flow with water and some sort of cleaning product that filled up the bathroom floor spilling out into our room. The hotel decided to give us another room however it took an entire day to get it. Upon walking into the new room, there was a strong smell of mildew in the air that was completely horrible to endure. As I inspected the room, I found out that the air conditioner had been leaking condensate water onto the carpet for quite some time and the entire floor along the wall next to the;2
The rooms themselves were fine. The hotel is FINE. Its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area. But the rooms are VERY small. Which I know isn't that wild of a thing in New York City but its not ideal as I was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it. The bed took up half of the room. Which again I understand and its fine. Not Ideal but fine. My main issue and why I'm giving such a low rating is that when I booked my room well in advance in August I booked it for 2 people. I wasn't sure if my friend could come with me so I didn't add her name to reservation. That SHOULDN'T have mattered. But when I added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date;2
Nice, attentive staff and comfortable beds for a good nights sleep, but you will pay a $40 parking fee for each night, and endure a trip back in time using their outdated cable TV program. There are better options!;2
Would love to be able to concentrate on how nice our room was or helpful the staff member who booked our transport was. Unfortunately one week after our stay we are still trying to have $352 returned. We incurred no extra charges and have had our deposit returned. After numerous unhelpful phone calls and unreturned messages we will have to initiate a credit card charge back.  Really didn't help with the rest of our vacation and is very much at odds with the service we received but the lack of communication left us feeling ignored and undervalued as customers, thanks Hilton!;2

Charged $3 per cup of coffee using the in room machine (small sign in room warned of this charge, but we did not have any coffee!). Quoted a $25 fee per night for emotional support animal in room but never discussed the additional $100 per stay ""final cleaning fee"" in addition until we arrived.

I was VERY dubious about staying here after reading all the reports and pictures people have posted, but it wasnt so bad once we got there. We stayed in an exceutive studio apartment. Very small, only enough room for two people MAX.    I was expecting to see cockroaches running around the place - I seen NONE and you have no idea how relieved I was!  There were no creepy crawlers anywhere in the apartment. The floors were clean, but the rug had very bad stains which I would say are there for good. I dropped  money on the floor beside the bed and when I bend down to pick it up I could see old food under the bed which I turned a blind eye to!    The bed was rock hard and the pillows are worse!

"As a major ballet lover, The Empire Hotel has, for the past 30 years, been my go-to abode, as it is perfectly situated across the street from Lincoln Center. Even when the place went 'upscale' and almost doubled it's prices - and darkened it's lobby - 7 or 8 years ago, I paid the piper to stay at my favorite hotel. Sadly, I will never stay there again due to a terrible incident last month with a very arrogant waitress at the lobby bar. After a ballet performance, I decided to have a nice drink in the bar area before heading up to my room. The waitress saw me coming and sitting at one of the cozy plush sofas but did not come to me for 10 minutes, preferring to gab with the guy behind the bar. Finally she came and said ""would you like to order something?"" I said, ""yes, may I see";2
I used to swear by The Jane -- where else can you find a hotel in a top location for around $100 in NYC? Of course you need to be an adventurous type -- these rooms are insanely tiny - like ships cabins -- around 4' wide by 7' long. They are not the kind of room you'll linger in -- extremely bad if you're claustrophobic. My recent trip was my third time staying there, and the first in a few years. The common bathroom which was once beautiful in look and function still looks good, but the fixtures no longer work reliably -- toilet seats that are barely attached to toilets, funky showers that don't work well even once you've figured out how to use them. This may have been the first time I've been there when it was really full... but the fact that all the room doors close with a;2
Stayed here for one night in order to catch early morning flight. Very bare bones.  No extra blankets, internet didn't work, and bedside light was burned out. Had to call for coffee as coffee bar was not stocked. Then noticed dirty coffee cup left by previous guest. Gross!  Wish I had stayed at any of the other hotels right around the corner. Will not stay here again.;2

We stayed here because of the location. Right aacross the street from Lincoln Center. The room was so tiny, you couldn't open the bathroom door and see the toilet. The bathroom and room was very dated despite their comment of being recently remodeled. Lobby has a boutique feel. Other than the room being very small for $449/night, the only postive was the location. A big negative was the rooftop bar, we couldn't get to go because it was reented out for a private event, and then at 9:30 PM when others were allowed to go up, hotel guests had to join the same line as non-hotel guests which I think is absurd. Needless to say the one grat part of the hotel we couldn't enjoy.;2
Principle spaces a bit tired and elevators were in need of a good once over. Our room's decor was unattractive and even though it had just been turned over and was clean did not give the impression of being clean due to the musty smell and shop worn condition of furniture. Courteous staff at front check in desk. The lobby bar was fine, staff were attentive, we did not check out the mezzanine restaurant or lobby bar Originally booked for 3 nights checked out after one, the Empire's best asset is its location to Lincoln Centre.;2

"Listen, no one's going to complain about being on the upper west side of NYC, right next to the 72nd station and close to everything Gotham has to offer. When I checked in i was surprised to learn there was a $50 PER NIGHT ""deposit"" for the mini-bar. Per night, in my case, was $100 for my two night stay. I was just up on a quick meeting from Washington DC and had decided to spend a little time in the city to catch up with old friends. The real clincher was the ""mini-bar"" itself: a price list tacked on the outside advertised $3.00 per bottle and there were 9 bottles inside (no booze, which was fine for me as I don't have to drink). I spent the first night apologetic because my friend had to foot the bill at dinner and the next morning roaming around searching for a Moneygram (to";2

The Empire Hotel is located in a great spot and we were excited to stay here. Your staff is very nice. Especially the doorman. (Stan and Jose) They helped us get on the subway and told us which one to take. The lady who checked us in was nice also and checked us in right away. But unfortunately there are more bad things about your hotel then good.  Our room has a moldy smell. The door in the bathroom looks broken. The wallpaper is pealing off from the wall. The side table in between the bed has 2 drawers that wonât stay closed no matter how many times we close it. (I hit my leg on the drawer when I went to the bathroom at night and it was very painful) The air conditioner does not work well so we have to open the window which makes the room noisy from the traffic.

We stayed 9 nights in this hotel.  I'll start with what's good about the hotel (but do read to the end for the cons): 1. The hotel lobby is grand and gives a great first impression.  2. If you love history, this hotel is full of historical moments.  3. It is a 5 second walk from the restaurant to the entrance of the ACE Penn Station Subway.  4. It is a 20min walk to Time Square, Chelsea, Empire State Building.  5. The rooms are sufficiently large (we had two queen size beds and enough space for 8 pieces of luggage), the air con is good. The Wifi is stable (I did an afternoon of work in the hotel) 6. The gym is decent with 4 treadmills. Dumbbells goes up to only 50lb so for those who train with heavier, it might be a problem. However, there are the standard machines but no racks,;2

The hotel lobby is lovely. Thatâs about as far as it goes. When we checked in the receptionist asked to see my card, I assumed just to confirm the card I booked with. No, she swiped it and whilst doing so told me they were taking a $100 deposit which Iâd get back on checkout. If she explained this first I would have offered to pay this in cash considering I would now get an international card fee charge. When checking out they didnât even mention the deposit. I asked and she told me it will go back onto my card. I asked for a receipt and she seemed confused as to why I would want a receipt and told me to call the bank if there was a problem with the money going back in 7-10 days. So they can take the money in a flash but it takes over a week to return it. I may not have even had;2
Upon arrival they gave us a room that the bed wasn't big enough for my daughter and I to sleep in and the sheets were dirty and ripped.  TV did not work.  They came up to give us new sheets and expected me to change my own sheets (which should have been clean to begin with).  They changed our room and there were no light bulbs  and the room was filthy. They straightened it up but I still felt that the room couldn't get clean the carpets were stained and sticky.  The staff for the most part did try to work with what they had.  I have stayed in 2 star properties but was glad to leave this one behind.;2
I was very disappointed in the quality of my room. The mattresses were the old spring style and the room was dated. Even the bathroom was too small and outdated too. Also the came with no amenities. After letting what I had  sink in for a couple of had to check out and find another hotel. I refused to stay in a room of that quality on my first trip to New York City.;2
The location of this hotel is amazing.  It is very close to subway stations and right across the street from Central Park.  Staff at the front desk are friendly and the hotel is clean, however it is a little bit outdated.  The room that we had was very small, basically just for sleeping in and that's it.  If you need to move around in a room, the only place to do it here is in the bed.  We were here during winter and it got quite cold in the room at night.  The radiator made a lot of noise but did not heat that well.    You receive a room key and it has to be left at the front desk when you go out during the day.  When we checked in we were assigned a room that already had someone else's belongings in it - we received the key that they left at the front desk when they left for;2
I'll start with the positives:  Staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make your experience comfortable. As soon as we arrived, we were early for check-in and they were willing to store out bags for free until our check-in time of 3:00pm. The Lobby is extremely nice with a bar that seems to attract a huge line every night.   The rooms were clean with an LCD screen on both the top and bottom bunk. Every room comes with AC, an IPOD dock. Although the rooms were extremely small, it provides a nice and safe place to crash ( who would want to stay in their hotel room when they are in NY).   Bathrooms were also surprisingly clean. The cleaners do a good job in that regard.  Location is also very convenient, only a few blocks from the nearest subway station and;2
After looking at the hotel website before travelling, lets just say I was hugely disappointed on arrival.  The photos on the website are really quite deceptive.  Walking down the corridors to the room, I already didn't have a good feel about the place.  Despite the sign displayed outisde the hotel advertising a new look for the hotel, I failed to see where there had been any renovations.  The carpets where worn down and grubby looking and the walls were the same.  It was the same once we entered the room and the bathroom was not very clean, dust and hairs were visable.  The place definitely needs updating!  I was quite angry on arrival as my husband had honestly thought he'd booked a decent hotel, to the point that we considered booking another hotel, however we decided to spend;2
The whole experience was totally underwhelming. My husband had convinced me that moving to the 'iconic' New Yorker for our last few nights would be a great move. Turns out that at least half the hotel is accommodating students and our floor was just above. We had noise of students banging on our floor (their ceiling), student mess clearly visible from the window in the floors underneath and students using the hotel facilities. The decor was outdated and the room was small. The management were polite but didn't go out of their way to do anything special. It was a far cry from the Empire Hotel which we had stayed at just before the New Yorker. The Empire Hotel in contrast was stylish with wonderful staff and an excellent location. The reasonable location of the New Yorker did not;2
We stayed 2 nights at the hotel in mid July 2012. On checking in well after the check in times we were told to wait for an hour as the room was not ready and we were offered complimentary drinks as compensation. As non drinkers we were then offered breakfast vouchers. When we checked our delux king room we were horrified. We had requested a quiet room away from the service area and lifts. We were shown an run down broom closet on the 1st floor overlooking the entrance with lots of B&Ts trying to get to the roof top night club. The room had a curtain and a rail over the fridge as the cupboard, the room was so small that we had to carefully move around the bed not to bump anything. We immediately asked to see the manager, who true to NYC form, was rude and unhelpful. Sorry that is;2
I'm all for retro style but these rooms and corridors are just grim! It saddens me to walk into such a tired dreary room. The windows are drafty too. The paint peeling off the bathroom which is tiny.

Iâll get a couple positives out of the way, hence the 2 star review: -great location -comfortable bed -nice lobby  Now for the rest: -I understand part of this hotelâs appeal is the retro/Art Deco vibe, but literally nothing was updated or in good condition. Iâve stayed in plenty of hotels that trade in nostalgia and have been much nicer and better kept up.  -tiniest hotel room Iâve stayed in in a long time. Just a bed and a narrow walkway to the bathroom.  -Not nearly enough towels provided. Found this out the hard way when I was dripping wet and my husband had to call down for more towels. Took almost an hour for them to be delivered.  -the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. This means after you shower the whole bathroom and everything in it is literally dripping wet from the;2

Three nights at the Hilton were meant to be a nice treat on our trip to California. It was my mistake to chose one next to Universal Studio as it really wasn't up to the usual standard.

We called the front desk and were told that maintenance was on the way. Wrong. 45 minutes later, after talking to the front desk again, we finally had someone looking at the problem. It helped as the room is now better, but not cool enough to sleep under the comforters on the beds. The bathtub fixture doesn't turn off entirely and drips.

"New York is New York and you should not get your expectations too high for hotels...unless you wish to spend big dollars.  I have stayed at many Days Inns over the years and have generally found them to be serviceable hotels that return the quality for the price.  This experience did not meet that expectation.  The property is milking money out of rooms of yesteryear and in need of some true renovation.  To be specific, the door to the room was barely lockable requiring a slam to get it to latch.  The linens for the bed were torn and should have been replaced.  Bath linens were of a quality that I would have expected at a minimal cost hotel.  The TV was ancient.  The real issue for the room was the plumbing.   For some reason it had a ""extra"" set of valves and was not in any";2
This hotel is in a prime location opposite Madison square garden, with views of the Empire State, but that's all it had going for it.  We booked a room for us and our adult son, but the only bathroom in the room was in our bedroom!  He didn't want to come into our room neither did we want him to.  The staff were very reasonable and moved us into a room with 2 bathrooms.  We were assured that the 2nd bed would be made up, as it was a sofa bed, but on 3 occasions we had to pull this out and make it ourselves.  One morning we woke up to a mess where a rodent of some kind had chewed through a carrier bag and packaging and eaten chocolate that we had bought as a gift.

My mother and I stayed at your hotel due to the proximity to Central Park.  I ran the half marathon in the park on April 30th.  We had many issues while staying at the Empire Hotel.  When we attempted to check our bags on Saturday, April 29th, the bag attendant was rude and dismissive.  He snapped at us when we didn't do we needed to check our bags together.  When we arrived, the front desk told us there was happy hour on the roof on the weekends.  After ordering our drinks upstairs, they told us there was no happy hour there on the weekends.  They told us there was one in the bar.  We went to the bar.  They told us there was never a happy hour there.  It took us 30 minutes to get to the roof.  We tried to access it through our room multiple times and kept trying to get to the;2

Great location. Tick tock diner served great food. Room average... Very small. Found that once we'd booked and came to pay for the room once arrived there were 'hidden charges' which we were not informed about upon quote and booking confirmation had been received. Over Â£400 additional cost for 5 nights. Discussed with the concierge desk who advised it was an error, but we would have to complain in writing. Sent an email upon check out and still had no response nor refund. Not impressed and wouldn't return!;2

We picked this hotel because we wanted to be close to Universal.  It's a great location as far as that goes.    Checked in and went up to our rooms - Whoa!  It was occupied!! AND reeked of cigarette smoke.  Immediately went back down and told the front desk.  We were given another room.  Checked into our new room - noticed a red stain on front entry hall of room.  Ew.  We didn't want to complain again, plus we wanted to head out of for the evening and unwind.  Quickly showered and changed clothes (nice light up mirror and nice selection of soaps, shampoos)...  son (8 yrs) used bathroom, closed the door behind him after exiting and it locked.  We were on the phone with the front desk at the time who was nice enough to call and offer us  free breakfast  vouchers for the room mix;2

"Has anyone come to suspect that this hotel does not even have wifi or cable? I am chagrined to admit that I stayed at this hotel 3 times last year (because of the location), and the cable has always been ""out."" There is never any explanation for this, other than, ""It's out all over the city."" Some people have asked, ""who goes to NYC to watch television, and I say, ""I do!"" I am in a post-graduate training program which requires that I travel to the city monthly. I am dead tired at the end of the day, and would love to just chill & watch some tv. I guess i would prefer that they just admit/advertise that they don't have cable & wifi, you know? Otherwise, I would like to try to focus on the positives - the beds are very comfortable, the rooms are a decent size, and the bathrooms";2

"I booked this hotel through Expedia and upon arrival was shocked at the poor condition of the room.  It looked nothing like the pictures depicted on Expedia.  There were several hastily done patches on the walls to cover what I assume were water stains and the fabric of our headboard was peelilng and torn. The ac and heat did not work properly either.   I've stayed in better motels.  They did waive their ""resort"" fee, but did nothing else to make me feel better about wasting over $700 for the room.   This was a shabby, dark and cheaply decorated room.  Probaby much like the rooms one would find in TImes Square back in the '70's.   I would steer clear of this place.";2
the room was very small and unclean. the furniture was damaged and old. the aircontitioner is noisi, didn't use it at all. most of the guests are young european backpackers and have no expectation, except for having a place to stay in NYC. it's definately more of a hostel than a hotel. the only thing good worth mentioning is the service at the front door with a doorman always on stand by and their luggage storage which helps a lot.;2
"Stay away. After a 10-night stay I made a bullet list in my mind of why my feeling about the experience was negative and it was embarrassingly long.

Got to the room late after a very long day. Found that the overhead light had a short and was flickering non-stop in what seemed to be a disco hall. Advised lobby who sent a worker up to fix it. By 9:30pm he was done and left the 118sf room. Needless to say, I was unable to get anything done, or eat, or even dance as there was no room to do so. The other problem was the drawers on the seating bench which kept opening as the property is old and has wooden floors that are warped. Gravity did the rest and I had to kick them shut each and everytime I tried to cross the foot of the bed to get to the bathroom. Finally, I resorted to rolling over the bed Rambo style so as not to have to deal with the drawers. I was so tired I could not stop laughing at the situation as it is so typical;2
We stayed at this hotel from the 25th to the 28th of january and prior to our holiday we were apprehensive about staying at this hotel as the reviews were quite concerning. Yes! The heating system was unpredictable. On arrival the rooms were extremely cold and necessitated us moving rooms and during the night the heating was extremely noisy. On a plus note, bed and bathroom was clean. Not an ideal area to stay, it was a long walk to mid town.;2

I have stayed here 3 times because of the location and this time because I needed the pool to entertain my young children during our stay. However I really felt the lack of customer service this time and will not be coming back. I asked the restaurant if they could put my ice packs in the freezer so I could use them on my longhaul flight back to transport some medication but they refused. I was with my 2 young kids & asked if they could open a food container for me (it was closed too tight), dump the food and rinse it out for me but they refused. Another time it was about to rain, it was dinner time and I had my toddlers with me, so I asked the front desk for an umbrella. The response was they're all in the rooms. No one bothers to offer to go get one and as going back up to the;2

If you are trying to find a comfortable, upscale place to spend an enjoyable trip.e DO NOT stay here.  We stayed in a captain's room, and according to the fire escape map on the door, we were placed in the absolute smallest room on the floor (about 50% smaller than all of the other rooms).  It didn't look anything like the pics on the online profile. (Maybe because we booked through a third party site they gave us the worst room?)  There was literally nowhere I could put my suitcase that wasn't in the way of a door (and we had neither a veranda NOR a view of the Hudson- at least one of which was promised in the room description).  I guess it didn't really matter because the windows were so dirty that we could barely see out.  It was in the 90's during our trip, and the air;2

We stayed in this hostel as we were attended a gig at the Hammersmith apollo so wanted somewhere close and cheap for one night. The accommodation was very cheap by London prices bt for a reason. The window in our room was smashed and covered up and the room was as small as it could be to fit in a bed and a tiny wardrobe. The bathrooms are communal but clean. Many of the residents apear to live there?! And little English is spoken at the front desk. It suited ok for one night but I wouldn't stay any longer.;2
My children and I arrived late on Oct. 12, check in was quick. I had requested a room with a view and was told by reservations that we could possibly have one facing the Hollywood sign. Our room was on the 24th floor...no Hollywood sign. When I called the front desk I was told that there is no way to see the sign from this location, because it's on the other side of the hill. Sat. morning we had no water for at least 30 min. and Sat . night we didn't have any hot water when we came in from Universal Studios. I called the night supervisor Brian, and he seemed a little uncaring....said he would send up maintenance, but it was already 12:30am and I told him we would take care of it Sunday when we arise.

This hotel is ideally located near Colombus Circle and has a nice roof top with a great choice of cocktails. However, the pricey room did not meet our expectations : noisy air conditioning system, poor wifi access and dirty window. Unacceptable for the price we paid for.;2
Strengths: This hotel has been superficially renovated and looks upscale from the inside.  Room looks nice and the bathroom is also very modern.  The service was good, and many of the people in our party received champagne bottles for inconveniences they experienced.   Location is ideal.  Weaknesses: The hotel is literally falling apart.  For example, we were moved 2 times.  The first because our air conditioner was not working. The second time because our window literally came off.  Luckily, it got stuck and did not fall out, but if it would have, someone could have been seriously injured. The curtains also came down at some point. Our party experienced similar problems.  One person said that their drawers continued to open because their dresser was not level.They called down;2

"OK, so this place is iconic and boasts some undeniably lovely original NY Art Deco touches in and around the lobby. The location for Penn and The Garden is great and if you get, or request,  the right room on a high floor youâll get a Manhatten or New Jersey view to die for. But it ends there for me.   Firstly itâs vast, by my calculation over 1000 rooms, which results in long lines for the elevators (of which there are 12!) and reception at peak times. Donât doubt theyâre in a constant state of maintenance, but this high footfall also means, the floors themselves and certain aspects of the rooms are shabby; it could do with a refurb in fact.   On my most recent visit my key card kept failing, resulting in 5 minute round trips back down to reception (praying there wouldnât be a";2
We chose this hotel for location only as we were meeting family in the area. It is a basic hotel which we were aware of but it was very drab and tired looking in the bedroom & corridors. Lots of stains and old decor and not as clean as I would like. The first bedroom was reeking of tobacco even though we requested non smoking. Our request for another room was dealt with promptly without any hassle. This was adequate with a good shower and a comfy bed so we stayed. Noisy at night though with a bar opposite the hotel. We did have to ask for towels as there were none. The elevators also have a strange smell (marijuana maybe?). Not a hotel I would recommend with children. The positives are helpful staff, a nice lobby & good eating places nearby. Also close to Central Park.;2

We only stayed there for one night, and spent little time in the room, but the time spent there was not pleasant. The air quality in the room with the window closed was stuffy, and with the window open it was noisy. No blackout shades. Paint in the bathroom was peeling and the toilet kept running. No TV because the cable was down and wifi very slow. In the morning for checkout we waited for the elevators, but all were filled when they got to our floor (4). We ended up walking down the stairs with our luggage to checkout. I asked for a discount for the inconvenience. Still waiting to hear.  I will not stay there again.;2
The best review was actually from another guest as we were in the elevator heading to the lobby.  Location, location, location.  I had made the comment that the small elevator reminded me of our room.  Which was tiny.  Yes, I know that they do provide you with the information the room is 250 Sq Ft standard queen, but if you are anything like me, what does that mean actually.  Put it this way, take your queen size bed add 2.5 feet on each side of the bed, 4.5 ft from the foot of the bed and you get the majority of the room.  It was an interesting twister game for my wife and I to negotiate.  The bathroom was really quite unique and not very functional.  There was no way for two folks to be in the bathroom at the same time.  When we woke in the morning to get ready for the day,;2

The staff are welcoming, the lobby bar is lovely, but the rooms need renovation. The paint was peeling off the bathroom door, the toilet hadnât been cleaned, the shower pressure was a drip and when I came back to the room at the end of the day, housekeeping hadnât even taken away the dirty coffee cups. Iâve stayed at this hotel before and donât remember it being this bad. I wonât stay here again.;2
"I stayed a total of 4 nights in September. I was visiting NYC with my son, and booked a double bed. Points against: double bed was way too small, so was the room; water faucets were terribly old, with the bath faucets not able to turn properly. Carpets were old too. The worst thing about this hotel is that all elevators take forever to arrive. It is an old property I appreciate, but surely the owner ought to have considered an overall renovation to make the hotel more efficient. Sole saving grace, the Tick Tock Diner, which opens 24 hours. I will not consider this property again. No matter how near is it to the Penn Station, the streets in and around this huge hotel are dirty and I see much to improve to enhance the stay for all guests.";2
Am not a big boy, more a small dude. Am not too demanding. But seriously, despite a nice design and excellent location, I discover I was nearly claustrophobic! The room is so small. But like really small. I could even not open my luggage in it. Other bad point was the cigarette odor in the aircon... Gave me a huge headache... And I am a smoker! Lastly, bad soundproof, super noisy. However, the facilities are good : ipod player, free wifi (that works very well) and nice restaurant. PS: the lift was out of service, had to climb 4 levels of stairs with my heavy as hell luggage... A nice options when you are 20yo or below.;2
Small, AC units can't keep up, and the worst bathroom design I've ever seen. No shower door on the side where the shower head is and water literally puddles on the floor while you shower. No place to put your bathroom things to get ready. Not good.;2

I am currently sitting at the pool at the Hilton. That sounds like a nice vacation, BUT this hotel has been such a disappointment. For three nights in June I paid over $1,300 for a King room. My thought was that it would be worth it to live it up for the weekend. Upon arriving, the hotel looks nice and well kept, but as soon as you approach the elevators you quickly start to see how rundown it is. The elevators are extremely slow and not all are functioning. Over the non-functioning elevator they've placed wallpaper loosely over what used to show the floor numbers. The room hotel room is small and unimpressive. I paid for a room with a view of Universal, but I also have a view of the highway and a lot where old hotel items are left to die. The continental buffet breakfast is $18;2
Spent a couple of night with a friend, and came to this house wich is well placed (near Hammersmith underground station) and is cheap. Well, it's cheap, for sure. We had a two beds room (with a fridge), toilets and shower were in the commons. All is old and rustic, almost spartiat. The only way to get fresh water is to go to toilets (even in the kitchen there is only hot water). Not too annoying at a first glance as we were just here to sleep. And here started the problems. No blind, and the shade can't really block the sunlight right on the bed at 5:00 am. No soundproofing, meaning EACH noise in the corridor is well-eard in the room : slapped doors, voices, radio alarms, etc. We were awaken each morning around 6:00 am, even with ear protections.

We arrived at LAX and cabbed it to the Ramada where we stayed for six nights. Hotel itself is in good shape and surpisingly clean from what we had read in past reviews.

Area is not great but coming from Halifax,NS, a small province in Canada, we were in no way scared to be there, I just wouldnt go walking around by myself, at night. It is close to both the subway and bus stops (for future tourists....subway fares are based on the honour system as we later found out so we started paying then stopped since noone was there...on our second last day, we realized how it worked and you can be fined if pass is not on your person....but like I said previously, from what I saw, noone;2
Location and staff are outstanding.  This place nickels and dimes you to debt and at the same time charges $35 resort fee.  The only benefit is free wifi (which you have to sign in everyday.

When spending several hundred dollars per night, at the very least I expect there to be hot water in the morning to take a shower... especially at an upscale hotel in NYC. On the morning of our last day, there was no hot water to shower or shave.  I called down to the front desk, and they said they had received several calls regarding the problem, and that I would receive a call back.  I told them that I had meetings first thing in the morning, and that this is a huge convenience.  I received a call back, and I was told that there would be hot water in about a half hour, which was simply too late because I had to get to my meeting.  Honestly, taking a cold shower and shaving with cold water in the winter is simply unacceptable. I told the person who called me back that I paid;2
I am a Hilton Diamond member, upon check in no upgrade offered. Service is virtually non existent. We stayed for six days, everyday we had to visit the front desk and have the parking key reprogrammed. It failed every single time. Mind you we had to pay $25.00 per day to be this inconvenienced.   Breakfast $10.00 up charge for Hilton Honors members, $28.00 otherwise, is average at best. At $28.00 it would be offensive. I understand that this is a busy time for the resort, however none of the staff acknowledges you, reflects care or appreciation. It is evident that management has set zero in terms of expectations from their staff.  I utilized a points stay, but would otherwise have been nearly $300.00 per night. Unworthy at even half the rate. Rooms are outdated in design &;2
We stayed in this hotel two nights just before Christmas. We had booked Junior Suite with double beds since we traveled with a child. The first room on the 4th floor (we ended up changing the room) was one long rectangle, very dark with windows facing small inner courtyard. While we had these windows, even with the curtains open you couldn't tell if it was day or night, there was not too much light coming through them due to the opposite brick wall. The room was quite hot to sleep in and even with the AC running, the temperature didn't change too much. The real problem with this room was the constant humming noise that came from  some sort of heating units positioned outside. My husband checked the noise level with an iPhone app and it was 55 decibel inside our room throughout;2

The location is right across the street from Universal Studios easy walking distance.  The views from the room were very impressive.

The room we were in was not that much better, the room size was great, but the washroom and the furniture seemed dated.;2

Room had a strong musty odor. Bathroom was shabby.  On demand viewing experience was very poor quality due to sound and picture  breaking up frequently.

We chose the Hilton because of its location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor.  Our experience was the poorest of any Hilton we have stayed at !  After 16 hours of travel we arrived at the hotel just after 4pm to be told our room was still not ready, but âhere is some free water and I will come and get you shortlyâ said the receptionist.  20 minutes of waiting and he disappears from the front desk.   40 minutes later we go and ask and to complain that we had been waiting a long time only to be simply told the room was ready for some time and no apology or explanation from the 2nd receptionist.   Our room was large and clean but with the deco from 1970s and looking rather tired.  We immediately wanted to get some rest after the long travel but found that the air;2
You will never mistake Astor-on-the-Park for the Waldorf-Astoria, but then again, your final bill won't hurt as much either.  Located at the very northern end of Central Park West, the Astor presents itself as an alternative to the pricier hotels located further downtown.  The second you walk in, you notice the worn condition of the lobby and the smell of disinfectant.  I didn't anticipate much of a room, considering the nightly rate I was paying and what the lobby looked like.  As I ascended the stairs (my room was on the second floor and the elevator is VERY slow), I noticed that the carpeting was much in need of replacement and the narrow hallways were dimly lit.  Opening my room door, I was met with a small room with a flat screen on the wall, a worn wardrobe cabinet, an;2
I was disappointed by this hotel since I had heard fairly good things and the location is very convenient.The staff is friendly and trying to be helpful but my colleague and I both requested rooms away from the elevators.  We met each other back at the front desk moments after we had gone up the elevators because we had both been placed in a room RIGHT NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR.  Both of us - different floors, different check in agents! I got a slightly larger room but the curtains were stained, there was a random piece of tape on the wall above the bed and one of my very flat pillows had been cased in what looked like a pillow protector with the zipper open and the tag hanging out. I all gave me a very skeevy feeling. Also in a room where it is hard to get around a king size bed it;2
I recommend you do not stay at this hotel, the rooms were filthy (and I have back packed around Asia), small and freezing!!  I must admit however the sheets and towels were very clean.  We stayed at the start of Feb for 2 nights and were not to impressed, the first room we were given was small and filthy, we therefore asked to be moved and was given a slightly larger room (No cleaner however) When we went in the window was open which we assumed was to air it out however when we went to close it later in the day it would not close, I called reception who tried to close the window but with no joy, I therefore had to stuff towels in the window in the hope it would keep us warmer (It didnt) the central heating was not working and as there having one of the worst winters in years we;2
"Clean enough. But the room was freezing--we couldn't get the windows closed, the shower was difficult to adjust between boiling or freezing, the check-out line was long and slow, and only 2 elevators seemed to be working from all floors above 20.   The location isn't bad; especially if you are arriving in Penn Station. But I wouldn't stay here again.";2

My husband and I stayed here last weekend in room 741. We were not impressed. The room was tiny and weirdly shaped. The bathroom was so small, we couldn't close the door without stepping into the shower. The shower head was confusing and complicated to use and the shower itself did not have a proper door, so we ended up with water all over the floor. Needless to say, we weren't given a bathmat to keep the water down to a minimum. One of the washcloths was stained. The bed sheet had a hole in it. We found someone's dirty black sock on the floor near the bed, although I'm not really surprised housekeeping had trouble finding it because that part of the room was very dark. We will not be staying there again.;2

"The Empire has a great location, but I am not a fan. We arrived shortly before 3:00 PM and were told the only room available was on a ""smoking optional"" floor. We chose to wait for a room on a non-smoking floor. I left my cell phone number and we went into the bar for a beer and glass of wine ($26.40). After about an hour I went back to the desk and was told my room was ready. When we got to the room, it was evident from the odor that this was also a smoking optional floor. There were no ""No Smoking"" signs or symbols and the tobacco odor was strong. We were tired so we chose not to push the issue. The room was all bed- small and tight. Two small bottles of water on the tables, each with a tag ""$7.00"". I know it's New York, but that was too much. Noisy air conditioner/heater.";2
I am an experienced traveler and choosing hotels is someting I like very much, especially in New York.  It took a while to pick this hotel and everything looked great in the site. But it ended in being a total disapointment. The quality of the wifi in the room was very poor. Moreover, during the use of the wifi there was aways an announcement that the line is not safe. Also charging money for the wifi is something that hotels in the world don't do anymore. And charging for unsafe line???  The overall feeling was that the policy of the hotel is being ungenerous to its guests. It's true that my reservation was for 1 person in a standard room, but it was do tiny that there wasn't even a table!  On the first day of my stay;2

"Good Location but strange Management Policies; removal of shower doors and allow room to 'flood', no bathroom ventilation and advice to use extra towels on the floor; as a result the room smelt damp.

This hotel does not live up to its promotional photos and advertising.  The Pros: room and bathroom are clean. Cleaning staff are very friendly. Bed is very comfortable. Close to Metro red line. Breakfast was limited although you can get fresh omelettes made to order. Cons: Location although close to the Metro and the LA hospital district, is not particularly good with homeless people sleeping on the streets outside,  derelict and   run down buildings nearby. Hotel  interior everywhere except reception is old, dark and jaded.  Rooms and passageways are dark due to poor lighting. No ceiling lights just low wattage wall lights. No carpets- floors are vinyl timber look. Floors and rooms are cold. Furnishings are all dark. Inside generally is a bit depressing. A/c is slow to kick in;2
Decent looking hotel across the street from Lincoln Center/Opera House. We stayed there the night after the show, and the convenience was great, especially since it was raining. Overall, cleanliness was good, the bed was comfortable, and the check-in/checkout was quick and smooth. However, a lot of the details I look for in a nice (expensive) hotel were just not there. I tried calling the front desk (both before and during my stay), and a lot of times the phone would just ring and ring, and they wouldn't answer. Location is nice, but traffic started up LOUD at 7:00 AM. Water pressure at the bathroom sink was too high, and the faucet was oriented poorly, so it was awkward to use, and I kept splashing myself with water. One of the lamps had a broken knob. They provided;2
Pool closed on 88 degree sunny day and no service! Front desk said rainy day.  I regret spending the money on this hotel. We always stay at the Hilton Midtown but wanted to try something but made a mistake.;2
I believe they should downgrade this hotel from hilton to a lower level hotel of the hilton family. This hotel is old! And not good old. For instance elevators were not working when we arrived, we had to take the service elevator. When we asked the staff about it, they said that elevators are always a problem there, and apparently the owner wouldn't pay for its modernization. At the room TVs are old small Tube TVs, something you can expect at a motel or hostel. I usually choose Hilton because you can't be wrong with it. But not at this one. I rather stay at a 2 or 3 star new hotel then heading to this Hilton again. Pay attention if there's an event going on Universal at night you may find it difficult to get back to your hotel.;2

I am a Hilton Diamond member, so I stay at a lot of Hilton family properties all over the world.  Unfortunately, my recent stay at this property left me disappointed.  It appears they don't care much if you have been loyal to the brand and earned higher membership status.  When I checked in at the Hilton Honors desk, I inquired about the Executive Lounge.  I was told that they used to have one, that it was discontinued, but in its place I would receive two vouchers for a drink and food item at the hotel lounge.  But when I went to use the vouchers, on the back of the coupon in small print it says they are only good Monday - Friday during Happy Hour.  I was there on the weekend.

We stayed overnight and saw tons of airline people coming and going.  This is a great spot for maybe one person without a car.  We were offered valet parking or a garage next door, but the entire first four floors are only for valet so it takes a bit to find a space.  The room was clean and decent, but we reserved a room for three and we had one king bed and a sort of chaise which was definitely NOT a bed and far narrower than a cot.  No bedding for it was in the room.  We found a housekeeper who have us a zipper case from another room which had  a pillow and blanket, no sheet.  We managed, but it was not satisfactory and varied from the expectation we had based on the description.  It might be OK for a small child, but having no bedding was a problem.  Morning coffee brought;2
My room was one of the smallest Iâve ever stayed in (yes, even in NYC standards). A 6-foot mirror with a heavy frame stands against the wall and further blocks your ability to walk around the room. And the bathroom is so tiny you can hardly find room to use the toilets.  Being right next to the elevator and with no isolation on either the door or the windows - the room had constant noise from both the elevator and the machinery outside the window.  And maintenance - well there were no signs of it. The room door wouldnât fit into the frame and you had to push it hard to actually close it. And the toilet paper hanger kept falling off the wall. I have no idea how are the other rooms in this hotel, but with the risk of getting such a room - I will not stay here again.;2
So, if you have already booked then I am sorry!   But this hotel and staff really needs tuning to basics of manners. Extremely rude and unwelcoming staff, not all room offer scenic views (ours did of parking!!!!) and lack of basic services like free breakfast and shuttle to/from nearest metro station makes this place utterly unpleasant experience..;2

The following day, another traveler walked into my room, as he was assigned the room I was in. I was just out of the shower and naked at the time, so a tad inconvenient.

Great location, and a beautiful, 20s brick building. The lobby is a marble masterpiece. Unfortunately the hotel is terribly, tragically dilapidated throughout. Looks like it hasnât had a refit in 50 years. Dark and gloomy throughout.   Rooms facing into a central courtyard (filthy, incidentally) are marred by deafeningly noisy air-conditioning inverter which run 24/7. Water pressure negligible, showers an exercise in frustration   Roof pool was a disappointment, a sliding plastic roof arrangement means it gets very little sun. Not open until 11 in the morning which was annoying, and the space by the pool is crowded with far too many sun lounges. Roof bar is fine albeit service sporadic and inattentive.

Beds are very small doubles (weâve been to America a few times and never had a bed so tiny) Theyâre so hard that you barely get any sleep and you wake up with horrendous back pain which, coupled with the lack of sleep, made it very difficult to truly enjoy our first stay in New York! Our first room had a very noisy radiator / heating unit and thankfully we were moved but to a much smaller room with nowhere to hang your clothes and that was then filled with a tonne of chargeable items that you couldnât move anywhere to be able to put your own amenities out! Staff in the lobby bar either canât understand you and get your order wrong or are just rude to you. Certainly not a 4* hotel and nowhere near the âluxuryâ promised on their website.;2

We chose this location since it is right next to Universal Studio in Hollywood. Since we were taking our grandchildren, we wanted to stay as close as possible to enjoy the park.  My husband fell ill so we walked with him to the Hilton complimentary shuttle. Even though the driver knew he was ill, he refused to let him onto the bus since all the seats were taken. He waited another 20 minutes for the next ride.  When I left the area on a later bus, that driver nicely asked all passengers to have their children sit on their laps to make room for others.   My husband was treated poorly.  Also, the tub would not drain after each shower.  In all, it was a good stay at this Hilton.;2

The room was so small we felt claustrophobic and the bathroom was also so small and not even a place to set your cosmetic case.  We have stayed 4 other places in Manhattan and found this to be the least favorite place we have stayed.  We definitely would not recommend it and had not checked trip adviser and wish we would have.  It was such a disappointment and we were staying over Christmas.;2
This was our first ever visit to LA with my wife and 2 adult daughters. we had asked for 2 interconnecting rooms, but were given rooms at either end on the 12th floor. The hotel itself is in a perfect location if visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood. Only 5-10 mins walk to Universal Studios and all the cafes and restaurants at City Walk although there is a free shuttle that takes you there. Unfortunately, the shuttle gets full very quickly, and if no seats then you can't get on. A 10 mins walk downhill to the metro and 1 stop to Highland and Hollywood for the Walk of Fame. The condition of the hotel is pretty poor for Hilton. Very dark rooms with really old furniture and deco. They have a coffee maker in the room but no kettle for hot water or tea. We asked for a kettle but;2

"I booked this hotel as it looked nice on the pictures, seemed good value for money and looked like it was a good central location for visiting LA however if i had seen that to park your car it cost $18 + tax per night there is no way i would have booked to stay at this hotel, the parking cost nearly as much as to stay at the hotel itself, when i asked the receptionist if i could park on the street the answer was ""sometimes you can, sometimes you cant""....what sort of answer is that?  We had never visited America before and had no idea about parking laws, as a citizen himself i think he should have been a little more helpful.  I should have looked into the additional hotel charges before i booked but i never though it would cost so much to park there.     The hotel is clean";2
We arrived at the end of our trip into LA. The area was fine, what part of Hollywood, Downtown doesn't have a homeless person and isn't full of fast food places? We were driving by car, but would also recommend the metro. I wouldn't walk alone there at night however, but that also applies to a large percentage of LA. The hotel itself was fine, the rooms are good. Ask in advance for a 2nd or 3rd floor room. 1st floor is actually ground level and the rooms come right up to the reception area.  We personally had a bad experience here and I wouldn't want to put everyone off as it was only staff related. We found a human hair ball on a bath towel and got no apologies from staff until I asked for one.  The pool is nice, just not heated! Staff are helpful with tourist info. Be weary,;2
The room was 3.5sm. You have the bed (90*200), and the some space (80*200) next to it. No sink, no table, no wardrobe, no chair, no air. The room temperature (in winter) was around 30 celsius degree, and the mini window just cannot let in as much cold air as it would be needed. Positive: staff is really kind, shared bathroom clean, you can go home even late in the evening.;2

Upon arrival there was no valet parking offered, and the front of the hotel normally used for unloading luggage was blocked off forcing us to find parking nearby and carry our luggage.  The room was tiny, we had to climb over our bed to get to the other side of our room and there was nothing stopping a child from opening a window, climbing out and falling 20 stories.  The bathroom was terrible. Rusty faucets, broken handles and linen that smelled awful but thankfully the water was very hot, and the fresh towels we requested arrived promptly and smelled far better.  The staff were all friendly and courteous, the exception being the man who was requiring everyone to produce a room key before being allowed to use the elevators. He was short, rude, and forced us to produce them even;2

"It's a funky place that's a cool idea -- in the world's tiniest non-pod room I really did feel like I was on a ship. But a) the ""cabin"" smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and b) worse: doors slamming all night long. Loudly. Every five minutes. Until about 5 am when the door slammers finally settled down. One of the worst nights of sleep I've had in years and I have a toddler at home. Ironically, my room was pretty soundproof other than that. But absolutely insane, impossible to sleep through door slamming. So nuts that they haven't addressed this. Never coming back.";2
The wall paper has what appears to be water marks on it. The room is very dark and the bathroom basin stand is wooden, but it is not protected from water from the shower which makes the room smelly. The bedside on the right side of the bed did not have a lamp.;2
Pros - great location, one block from Penn station. Cons - the hotel is very, very tired and in need of a major facelift. The rooms are tiny, even by NYC standards and the noise insulation is non-existent - you can hear conversations in neighbouring rooms and the plumbing is so noisy that if anyone on your floor uses a shower or flushes a toilet, it sounds like they are in your room! Bathrooms are very small and basic with paint peeling off the walls. I couldn't recommend this hotel to friends or family, it is budget in feel but prices aren't reflective of that.;2
We arrived at the New Yorker hotel very tired with 2 children in our party, when we checked in we got told they needed a credit card to take $250 plus tax off this was for the 5nights we was staying ,when we questioned this we got told we had to pay room tax per night (none of this was explained in the UK). I had previously emailed the hotel asking for a refurbished room on a high floor to which I got a reply stating this would happen. On checking in this wasnât the case we was on floor 8 with no view at all, the bedroom was very small not big enough at all for 2adults and 2children, we just had to make doo as was told couldnât do anything else as no other rooms available. Whenever we used the shower is flooded the whole of the bathroom and into the bedroom area, this was;2
Stayed here from 28th of December until 2nd of January. Reception is lovely, security and door men are lovely and helpful. Girls at reception who I dealt with were not so friendly or helpful. Room was tiny, you will bump in to the person you are with getting from one end to the other. Very dated tired rooms. Radiator wasnât on at all only AC. I booked a standard queen room, there was nothing queen about the small double bed. Told reception who said I got what I paid for after paying â¬350 a night for room only. I understand youâre in New York City but for a 4 star hotel there has to be some standards. Paid the $45 a night fee for extras. I didnât have any extras so got a refund for this when I got home. 3 days later this refund was reverted without notifying me. So â¬200 taken;2
Located in the middle of nowhere. Restaurant not open and absolutely nothing nearby in the area for breakfast. Comedy club not open. Pool is substandard and âcourtyardâ is old and dirty with old furniture and uninviting.  Took over an hour to walk to town through streets full of homeless peoples tents and pavements that smell of urine, piles of rubbish and faeces. Not close to anything and did not feel safe at all to walk anywhere alone.  Old springy mattresses that squeak when you move and small very thin uncomfortable pillows. Seven nights that worked out on average five hundred Australian dollars a night. Completely not worth it and waste of money. Costs far more to travel anywhere on transport as so far away. Would not recommend at all.;2
Thatâs all It is well located but I prefer other areas of Manhattan It is an old hotel renovated.... but the style is tasteless  The main problem is the noise , there are wheelsâ noise everywhere and majes difficult to sleep Also the air conditioning is ver noisy in the room  Breakfast is less than standard, the cramble eggs are overcooked and sulfur color  It is plenty of tour groups and the common place is not enough for everyone;2

"I was booked this through priceline assured that it was a 4 star hotel quality. It was not. The hallways look like they hadn't been updated in 50 years. The room has been updated but some parts were still ""old"". The bathtub would be good example.  When I checked in I was assured that everything has already been paid for so I was surprised to find a bill under my door for a ""facility fee"" 29 + tax each night.  When I went to complain the manager told me he was sorry but the person that checked me in should not have said that. If you want a 2.5 star hotel in a good location then you should consider this hotel as long as you are OK with the ""surprise fees"".";2

We live in the area and stayed at the Empire because of on-going construction in our apartment.  I was surprised at the condition of the property - beaten up hallways and rooms.  All of the furniture in the room had small or large nicks and other damage.  The beds were uncomfortable, the bathroom was very oddly configured - with the toilet installed right next to the wall (less than a quarter inch between toilet and wall, while there was a foot and a half of space on the other side).  No shower door, just open space, minuscule toiletries (enough for one shower) - I didn't know that they made things that small.  There were so many other details missing from our room - at over $400 per night for a suite, I expected more.  There were no closets in our corner suite, only a very;2

Great location. Rooms small and very dark . No natural light. You could not see what the weather was like. Due to the design of the building. The room was noisy due to air con pipes going past windows. Take ear plugs. We had 5 rooms 3 had to argue for new rooms and managed to after a lot of stress.they were told but this is New York as if thatâs a reason for small/dark rooms.  Small bathrooms .

We were upgraded to a lovely big room however this meant there were not one but 3 drafty windows.  I had the heating up to 38 degrees and was still sleeping in my socks and puffa jacket.  We paid an extra $30 ish for taxes and premium WiFi.  The WiFi was atrocious and when I called tech support I was put on hold for 15 mins so simply didnât have the internet for my stay there.  The bathroom was tiny with another drafty window right next to the tiny shower.  Apparently women in the 30s didnât have as many toiletries as we do.  There wasnât even room for my toothbrush, I canât imagine that ladies didnât clean their teeth almost a century ago.  Donât expect free tea and coffee facilities - thatâs an extra $25 per day.  The receptionist was very pleasant when I complained but;2

"First, the good news: it's reasonably safe, in a good location within blocks of Riverside Park, convenient to nice (family-priced) restaurants and subway stops, and it can be had for less than $150/night.   However, it doesn't feel like a ""good hotel""; the elevators are tiny, the hallways are narrow and unventilated, and the rooms are small and outdated. We had a queen size bed that was moderately comfortable, but there was garbage left by a prior guest under a nightstand, and the bedspread was dirty. Still, we did have a nice, tiled bath that seemed to have been recently remodeled.   There are no amenities (short of an in-room closet safe and two granola bars we assume were left by Housekeeping?) and the carpets obviously need a good cleaning.

I've stayed at the Empire twice on business travel, once in August and once in September.  The Good: The location, directly across from Lincoln Center and along Broadway, just a block from Central Park, is ideal.    The lobby is kind of interesting, decorated in an art deco style.  It has a mezzanine level that is a good place to meet colleagues for a cocktail after work.   The staff is very polite and helpful (when possible).  The Bad: Everything about the hotel is tired, chipping paint, to worn carpets, hideous old wallpaper and a broken down rooftop pool and  barely working A/C units in the room.  My first stay here was in August of 2017 and the A/C in my room barely cooled the place.  My second stay was in September and the A/C was set on a frigid 68 degrees.  When I;2

Everything was fine until I went to the hotels restaurant located in the basement.

I walked over the cook also know as Chef Hugo and I noticed his cooking pan was disgustingly old and dirty, I asked if he ca replace the pan or clean it prior to making my eggs and he refused.

If you provide coffee making facilities, to charge for it is a chutzpah!  And $8 for a bottle of water on the bedside table - you have to be kidding! Paper cups instead of proper glasses and mugs just adds insult. How many stars do they claim to have? When will the hotel be refurbished?;2
This property is a full service Hilton hotel.  It is located immediately adjacent to Universal City Studios, City Walk and Universal Theme Park.  In that regard it is great.  Unfortunately, it stops there.  Collectively I have not stayed at a property that has had a more disengaged staff.  It was clear that they were tired of dealing with tourists.  From the head of valet at arrival (the older man in the beige uniform-not the valet attendants) that was gruff and unwelcoming to the restaurant manager, waiter and cashier who were to busy to acknowledge our arrival at breakfast.  In addition to the staff we were welcomed by a smokey room (cigs) and a second room where the air conditioning was inoperative.

Very dark, one lamp in the room, 75o and could not adjust temp.  Bathroom very tired and really no amenities.  Staff was great.   Fairly expensive for one night.;2
1st impression after settling into room was the noise level of the traffic below our 5th floor corner suite.  Windows are not triple glazed and could hear every taxi beeping their horn and every bus screeching their wheels into the very wee hours.  Although the bed was very comfortable, it did not make up for the noise level.  The lighting in the room is very poor (too low lighted to even read a book).  Chairs in the room were cheap and were creaking apart, lamps in room were also cheap and missing switches to manually turn them on.  Bathroom lighting was minimal and off centered from the mirrow ... couldn't put on makeup in there and had to use hand mirror by the window to see what I was doing.  As well there was very little space for one's own toiletries.  For a sutie, there;2

We were looking for a simple hotel for a week for a reasonable price. For us it was OK that we had to share restroom and shower with other guests on our floor and, generally speaking, the rooms appeared clean. However, we did have a few surprises: The shower closest to our room did not work for a couple of days, some guests were loud in the middle of the night, we could not control the temperature of our room and one day our room was not serviced. Worse however were the two bed bugs we have found the morning we left whose bites we still felt a week later, and how the guy at the reception reacted when I mentioned the bed bugs during check-out: He did not respond at all. Thus, I am sure they did not take care of possible additional bugs after we left...;2

We had an executive view double room.  We were told when we booked that these rooms had undergone a complete renovation.  That was very questionable.  The shower leaked all over the floor.  We put towels down to soak up the water.  The sink was so small you couldn't turn the faucet on more than 1/4 or the water ran over the sides of the sink. Apparently the shower was also leaking into the room beneath us also because we were told we had to move rooms because of a mechanical problem.  What a pain to have to pack, move, unpack again. At least they upgraded us to a suite with a view.  We liked this room until 5am the following morning when we were awakened by water hammer noise coming from the room above us.  It sounded like a jet engine in the room! The day we checked out there;2

We stayed in the New Yorker over Christmas. Our room was extremely dated as was the rest of the hotel. We expected a small room but perhaps not as small as we got. We couldnât even open our suitcases on the floor.   I arenât sure if the rooms get nicer as you go up but we were first given a room on the 19th floor but before we went up we asked if there was any any lower down. We were given one on the 13th floor. If this is the case, it would have been nice for the receptionist to say yes there is but the room isnât the same quality.  The staff who stood at the bottom of the lifts to ensure that you could only get in with a room key never said hello\good morning.   The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights of New York.;2
We were going to a concert  Friday night and had previously stayed at the Sherton Universal and decided this time to try what we expected to be a nicer Hotel.  This turned out to be a poor decision,  from the beginning the check in process took too long due to the fact that only two employees were working at check in desk and the hotel was quite busy, the next problem was poor communication from the staff, we were initially told that we could take a complimentary shuttle over to the Universal lot , we walked out to take the shuttle and were give three different responses to where and when the shuttle would be there, after waiting for 20 minutes we asked  the same person that had told us at check in about the shuttle status and he advised us to walk because he didnt think they;2
The hotel was under construction and disorganized. When I attempted to do a digital check in, the app didn't work for a digital key and the choice of where your room would be didn't have much relevance unless you have stayed at the hilton. The breakfast buffet is not worth the $30 per person price.;2
Travelling with my wife and 3 children (9-12-14) we chose this hotel because we love the calm that the Upper West Side offers after a day of discovery in NYC and we can't afford to pay to much. So, the price was OK and the location, perfect (on a quiet street, next to a subway station on line 1). The hotel is clean, quiet, but has no atmosphere or any personality. The staff was polite but not friendly at all. The elevator are slow, but they are working well. For those who have back problems, make sure to ask for a firm bed cause ours were so soft that I could barely walk on the 4th and last day of our trip because my back ached too much. So, the stay was OK but I would not return to this hotel just to get this little thing that makes a trip memorable.;2

The hotel is dated, the rooms are extremely small, old carpet, one bedside table only, bathrooms too old, and worst of all it is extremely noisy.

So on arrival the hotel looks quite grand. Don't be fooled. The hotel rooms are on floors 19-40. Floors 1-18 is student accommodation. The hotel is very run down and tired. Very old fashioned and constantly smells of weed.  The rooms are not very nice, very old and feel dirty. The bathrooms are quite disgusting and you can't open any windows. There is no tea or coffee facilities,no drinking water and no fridge.  The hotel has an Italian restaurant which is lovely and an American diner which is fairly average.  The location of this hotel was the main issue for us. 34th Street has got a massive drug and homeless problem. Everywhere you turn, every street corner or shop doorway there is someone rolling a joint, injecting drugs into themselves or being sick. I have never experienced;2

Rooms are old, dated and small. Corridors look like something out of 1920's movie. Totally disappointed in Wyndham for even trying to pass this hotel off a 4 star's. I did not expected to be given three different room keys to find a room that was suitable to me as a member and timeshare owner.;2
After hearing people rave about the rooftop bar (which is actually managed separately from the hotel), I was surprised by how run down this hotel was.  I had read negative reviews, but you cannot beat the location of this hotel.  I would recommend staying a few blocks away, this hotel was not worth staying.  The blinds were really dusty and the bathroom floors were dirty. It seems like the place could use a really good scrub and new bed linens.;2
The rooms were small, and it didn't feel clean since most of the interior were rusty and old. We both got sick after having the breakfast buffet also, not very lucky having a plane to Europe straight after ðThe only part that made the stay more enjoyable was the staff, and especially Chris at the front desk! The hotel is very lucky to have him working there!!;2
"We booked a room with two double beds. The night befor we arrived we called and sked if we can put a roll away in our room. They said that it would be a $35.00 charge. So when we arrived we were checking in we requested a roll away bed. The lady at the front desk said ""Im so sorry we can put a roll away bed in a double room."" Then we told her that we had two teenagers and a 8 year old and we need to a roll away. So she went back and spoke wit someone and came back and told us have a king room with a sofa sleeper and we can comp you a roll away."" So I asked her it has a sofa sleeper bed? And she replied ""yes"". So we told her ok. She called and ordered the roll away. Come to find out we could NOT put a rollaway in our room and it do NOT have a sofa sleeper. When we called down we";2

This hotel is a bargain compared to other hotels in New York City, but please put things in perspective: 1) If you expect things to be like a 4-star hotel, GO TO A 4-STAR hotel. This hotel was clean enough for me. Just like visiting a friend or relative who lives in an old house. Not perfect, but good enough. 2) If you are the queasy-type-because-I-can't-shower-pee-etc-in a hallway bathroom, please go (and pay for) a 4-star hotel. Morningside was cheap enough, clean enough for a $75-85 hotel in a city where rooms average two or three times that. Nothing more, nothing less. Would love a TV in the rooms, but otherwise, it was just what I paid for: a place to sleep and shine up. BTW, saw no mice/bedbugs. Just a stray cockroach. Stomped it, lived to tell.;2
Rooms are very small, bathroom tiny - couldn't stand in front of sink due to configuration.  Water pressure inadequate, heat controls poor, etc. Room location was very noisy.  I was surprised that upon check-out the front desk didn't ask me how my stay was, and if everything was alright!;2

The location is lovely and convenient and the doorman / bellman upon check in was helpful and polite -  and that's really all I can say positive about this place.  The front desk clerks were mildly competent if slow and a bit clueless, but the concierge was rude and unhelpful, which is really the opposite of what I imagine to be his job description.  So, the weirdness: no top sheet.  None.  I've never had this in North America, and I do really like one, so I asked for it to be done, but when we got back that evening, nothing.  So I called housekeeping and the guy came up with a duvet cover for me.  Close enough, I guess.  Now, the problem: 4 elevators, 2 of which were never in service when I was trying to use them, and 1 of which was frequently down.  And the noise of the;2

We went for a four day stay. Based on hotel photos on website, we expected a lovely hotel. Unfortunately, the interior of our family room was long outdated. The toiletdoor was long overdue for replacement and downright dirty. So wad the window area towards the street. The aircondition was very noisy but it worked. Two days in a row we received a letter stating that due to unforseen events our room would not be cleaned. On our third day, at 15.00 I went to the reception to remind them that we are a family of four in a very small room and that it needed cleaning. I was not met with much understanding nor service minded attitude but after some time I was promised that the room would be cleaned before the day was over - which it was.  The pool is VERY small and access goes through;2
I booked this hotel without checking the reviews first so after reading all the negative reviews I was dreading the worst. To be honest it wasn't as bad as I thought it would of been, the best compliment I could give it was that it was clean. We had a room on the 5th floor, no views just looking out onto other rooms, we never got any daylight whenever we were in the room the lamps had to be on. The room was small but the bathroom was adequate and no mould as had been described in previous reviews. My biggest problem was with the noise from the air conditioning units from outside the windows, in the quiet of the night it seems very loud. The pool was closed whilst I was there, no notices or apologies from anywhere and the bar on the rooftop did not belong to the hotel. Good;2

Also, no hot water from sink.  My room also was not cleaned for two days and was told that I had put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door but did not.  I called and filed a complaint with the manager and was told that they had over 1,000 rooms to clean and were doing the best they could.  Lastly, there is no refrigerator in the room and elevators were out of order one day and had to use service elevators that were not air conditioned.

It was very small and you could sniff the smell of cigarette (as someone just smoke in the room). The air conditioner was shaking and in the shower there was a puddle of water. The bed was broken and different pieces of carpet were hand -sewn. After complaining and asking for a bigger room (we couldn't even fit the 2 luggage) the guy at the desk told me ""this is what you paid for ... for an upgrade of 30 dollars per day I can give you a bigger room"" I accepted and they gave me a room in the upper floors and that was much better.";2

We had the delight of staying in two rooms during our stay, firstly room 430 which was noisy, the windows were held in with gaffer tape and the heating sounded like a steam train. However the receptionist assured us that this was normal and that she would send an engineer to switch it off. Said heating was then switched off but after one night we requested a room change due to the dirt and street noise. I asked if the receptionist if this room would be better and she insisted it would so she must have known it was a crappy room...  So moving on to our second room, 510, which";2

This was the most expensive of the four hotels we stayed in on our recent trip to the USA.   It was also by far the worst.   From the moment we entered the reception area we had a sinking feeling.   Our fears were realised when we opened the door to our room.   It was so small that only one person could move around at once and the other person had to put their legs on the bed so the other one could get by.   There was a broken venetian blind covering the window.   This had to be kept closed all the time as there were other rooms immediately opposite (see photo).   The beds were only about a foot apart.   The wardrobe was very small and there were no drawers.   There were no coffee making facilities and no room safe.   Neither were safety deposit facilities available at;2

What ever you do donât stay at this hotel in the summer. The AC didnât work properly. We called the front desk and they sent the engineer. He said it was a problem with the water tower and the entire floor (11th) had the same problem. As I was walking out the door I herd the woman in front of me saying her room was the outside temperature (about 88F) as well. They did offer to move us to a lower floor, we declined, our floor was noisy enough.  We checked into a âSuperior King Roomâ and next to the bed, looking like a gift were bottles of water with a label like those in Alice in Wonderland- instead of âdrink meâ they indicated that this bottle of water would cost me $8. There was the normal mini bar, although many hotels have given up because people have figured out it is a rip;2
I really wanted to like this hotel. I love old buildings, Art Deco architecture, and was looking forward to it.  Pros-- -Excellent location -Art Deco details -Staff at check-in were friendly and efficient -Shower pressure and hot water were excellent   Know before you go: --I had read the reviews about the small rooms and they are all true. We had a Metro View Queen, and I could have reached out from the open door and touched the bed. The closet had a luggage rack, but there was nowhere to unfold it.   Cons-- -The Wyndham Resort sales pitch. This happened right after check in, when a man at what I thought was an information desk waved me over and asked if I wanted information. After a couple of minutes, we untangled ourselves and avoided that area. Another woman on a different;2

If you go in October you will fight the Halloween Nights traffic. It took us over 1 hr to travel what should take 15 min. We overheard another guest in tears as he was in traffic for 3 hrs. We couldn't leave the following night because we didn't want to risk being stuck in the closed access roads to the hotel. Hotel staff was less than helpful. They need to put signs up in the lobby or send out a paper notifying guests of the road closures, best alternate routes and best travel times. It ruined our weekend.;2
Location is superb. Just out of the hustle and bustle but still very much in the heart of NYC if youâre visiting as a tourist. Central Park is a 5 min walk away and Times Square a 10 min walk away.   Hotel itself is very run down and old. Poor lighting in the rooms and the whole establishment. Old wallpaper and carpet. The lifts are extremely slow and make you feel slightly uneasy. Shower pressure is good but the bathrooms are TINY (and I mean small - honestly, barely fits one person) Air conditioning is a box in the room that makes so much noise, but staff are friendly are very friendly.   On Fridays and Saturdays, this hotel turns into a mating ground for young people. The empire rooftop bar is a popular place and gets completely rammed and lots of people end up booking rooms;2
Arrived for the weekend 2 adults and 2 kids. Found the hotel in a very accessible location a block from the 96 st subway station. The room was OK but in a second glance you can notice a need of a renovation or at list a cote of paint over the doors, the shower was not appealing with scratches and marks on the tubs flour and on a cold night like ours was, you had to wait forever for hot water. While I was waiting to speak to the front desk I heard other complaints of heating that doesn't work, misplaced parcels and other calls... Oh, and there was a party on PH level, we did not hear it in the room but the common areas were very loud.;2

"We booked it because of the price. Hotels were very high priced at the start of the 2019 holiday season and we found the Windsor on a booking website (that in itself was an issue since I was booking for 4 people, two adults, two teens. The booking website allowed four of us but the Windsor insisted we had booked a room for three people (I had confirmation for four) many emails between the Windsor and us and between the booking company and us and we were forced to ""upgrade"" for $35 per night to a larger room to accommodate the four of us. I should have cancelled then but rooms were outrageous the week we were planning to be there so I agreed to the the extra $35 a night and hoped for the best.   We were on the top floor (7, aka ""The Penthouse"") which I don't think had been rented";2
"So I expected the small rooms, shared bathrooms, etc. I'm someone who feels quite comfortable in hostels, so this doesn't phase me.   What I didn't expect was that some of the shower/toilet doors wouldn't close or lock, or that the night I arrived there's be toilet paper, towels and water all over both of the bathrooms on my floor; it was so messy that I didn't feel comfortable putting my toothbrush or toothpaste next to the sink. The blanket on my bed had holes, the showers and lobby smelled like mildew. The hallways were quite hot and humid. And the doors were slamming all night. Some of my neighbors were living there/walking around in underwear.   I think with a bit more effort this place could be great. Current state though: not so much.";2
The rooms and in particular the bathrooms need renovation. All is pretty used and not up to the standard of other hotels in NYC at same or even lower prices. At the high rate, neither breakfast, nor WIFI were included. Windows do not close properly, so it is very noisy at night.;2

I had stayed at the Windsor in May and thought it was OK. I love the location, right near the D train, and lots of great Chinese, Thai, and Italian restaurants, close to The New Museum and SoHo.The nice staff is very helpful.This time, however, the hotel had hot water only two days of my seven day stay, apparently because it was completely booked and there was too much stress on an inadequate water heater. Also the room did not have storm windows and it was cold as the heater blew out the inadequate thin drapes  and let the cold air in. I stuffed the windows with extra pillows which helped, but then the room was too hot with the heat on, too cold without. The card key stopped working so I had to go downstairs almost every time Itried to use it and gave it re-rogramned. The;2
Very noisy, old building so everything creaks, the bath tap leaked the whole 5 days I was there even though I had notified them the very first day I was there.

Booked this Hotel for my Boyfriends 30th, partly due to location and partly due to the Gossip Girl link and rooftop bar and pool! (30th August - 4th September).  We stayed for 5 nights. Upon arrival I was massively impressed by the lobby, the doorman and staff we passed on the way in were very friendly and pointed out which direction reception was located. The lady at reception who checked us in unfortunately did not come across as friendly, no big deal.  Worth mentioning I did email the hotel prior to arrival after I booked the stay to ask if they could organise champagne / strawberries, I never got a reply and when we arrived in the room they sadly hadn't put them in.  To add to this disappointment the room was considerably small, the carpet looked like it needed a good vacuum;2

So I travel a lot. When I come to NYC I usually stay at The Empire Hotel. My company books me here. I'm a easy going guy. Doesn't take much to make me happy. Clean room. AC that works and smoke free environment.  My last stay here a few weeks back, I was put in a room that clearly had been smoked in. I am very sensitive like a lot of people to smoke and the toxins in cigarette smoke. I called the front desk and promises of a visit from someone that may be able to get an air filter or something to help me. No one came, no calls came in to my room.  Fast forward to last night. As I was sweating my butt off last night, I called the front desk and let them know my room was not cooling. They sent up a box fan.  So then hours later there was air moving but still very little cooling.;2

I booked this hotel based upon the TripAdvisor star rating.  I spend 30-40 nights per year in hotels across the country.  The Empire is definitely not worthy of a 4 star rating.   I rate it a 2 star.  For the value and price of this hotel, the traveler has many better options in this great city.;2
The location is great but the hotel is run down. Room 114 was one of the worst hotel rooms I have ever seen. Everything in that room is old. The drawers would not close, they kept rolling open. The air conditioner made a lot of noise. The room smelled bad. The speakers out in the hall were crackling. We went back to reception and they were very friendly and moved us to 222. That room was better, but also old. The air conditioner made a lot of noise too. The little fridge in the room was warm and the safe was sitting loose on top of it. We would not stay here again. It was the disappoint of our trip.;2
Great location opposite central park west.  Room was very small and very basic, needs updating badly! but clean. We had a twin room.

This hotel charges an extra $35 dollars a day for wifi, gym, business center. I had my service charge removed but I bet most people pay it without complaining. This charge was never listed on the Wyndham reservation website.  Itâs an extra charge this hotel adds on to the bill to rip you off.  Very shady !;2

The front desk was very accommodating when we checked in arranging for us to have room with a larger bed than what had mistakenly been reserved through an online travel service. When we checked reservation online it in fact said Queen bed reserved,but front desk said we were reserved in a room with one  double bed. He kindly put us in a new room with king bed. Must have been a room that is not used on the first floor. Wall paper hanger /painter in hallway of first floor didn't move equipment for us to pass which was odd and should have been a sign we were on a floor under renovation. We carried our luggage through the painter's obstacle course and found that the room  had no outlet covers, just bare sockets with holes in the wall around them. Stand up lamp had no bulb, worn out;2

This was one of the very first 'luxury' hotels I stayed in back in 1989, when it was the registry, then it was a read destination hotel where you would bump into stars in reception - my first visit there I saw Bob Mitchum and Karl Malden - yes it was that long ago. whilst the hotel does retain some glamour its now horribly mainstream with little other than its great location to recommend it. Food looks good but is mainly all you can eat buffet style - this is great in Vegas but LA ? hotel is crowded getting a lift to your room can often take 10 - 15 mins. There is a general feeling of slight decay, its frankly not that clean and cost cutting is very much in evidence. The phone in our room didn't work and the bed is as hard as rock - worse is the fact that in our room at least;2

Greeted by doorman who held door with his foot. No welcome. Room was tiny and worn, even by NYC standards. Heat wouldn't turn off, sink drain completely clogged. Charge for everything in room, including coffee in morning. I've never seen this in a hotel. Received complimentary cocktail in lobby bar, which was nice. Bartender was charming but staff completely disrupted customers by dragging furniture across floor to,set up for large party. Made us feel unwelcome. Supervisor was condescending. Will not go back, nor will I recommend to friends.;2
The hotel has a great location. It's one of the closest to the airport, but if you check in at night the hotel is a mess. Really bad customer service and clearly understaffed. The hotel is almost new, however the rooms are dirty, lack of maintenance.;2
I gave this hotel two stars--one for location and one for price.  I was really grossed out by the layer of dust underneath the bed--the carpet was a different color because of the dust.  I also complained about the slow draining tub, and dust around the light/fan in the bathroom.  It was totally gross.;2
"The good: - Good position, 5 minutes to Hammersmith bus and tube stations, in the middle of a lively district with lots of restaurants and pubs.

I stayed there as it was the conference hotel. The room was dark, depressing and cramped. I needed hanger, and they were almost thrown at me. The desk staff and concierge were helpful and nice. The housekeeping was terrible. No pillow cases or bath mats one day. Then realized on another that there were no sheets on the bed. I found them under my 50-pound bag, which has to be moved to put them there, which made me very uncomfortable. My room with taxes was over $400/night. Not a good value.;2
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Astor the first week of Dec.  Overall our stay was ok but not great and I wouldn't go back.  It was very cold that week with snow and high winds and during our entire 5 night stay we didn't have any heating in our room.  When we enquired about the problem we were told the boiler had broken but would be fixed and if we gave it a while our room would heat up...we were told this 3 times and our heating never came on.  I suggested a heater to help but they didn't give us one. We gave up and decided not to waste precious sightseeing time trying.  The room was small with a dirty window that was high up.  There was noise each night from the radiator trying but never heating up and on the Sunday night when it rained lots the noise of the rain hitting the;2
Booked online through âlast minute.comâ first time visiting NYC as a family and I am appalled!  The lobby is beautiful which draws you in however the rooms we got were awful! Not 4 star at all.... The curtains are dirty, the walls had marks on it, the pillow cases had marks of makeup left on it, the mirror in the bathroom is rusted and the mirror in the room was not cleaned at all and the door in the bathroom needs to be repainted. I feel that I have wasted 5days here and wasted money that couldâve gone towards a better hotel and a much better room.   When I put the complaint to the manager they showed me alternative rooms which were EXACTLY the same as the room I currently have and in he exact same state! I felt insulted and quite frustrated as we was on a flight for over 8;2
There were three things that kept me from giving this hotel a lower rating. First the Manhattan Diner just half a block away is AMAZING! Second is the 94 Corner CafÃ© - they have EVERYTHING and the pizza is fantastic especially at midnight after a long day in the city! Third, at least in our room, the bed was very comfortable. Other than that this place is HORRIBLE! It is beyond Filthy!! I refused to walk on the carpets without socks! We specifically called ahead to find out about parking our car and they said NO PROBLEM we have a lot - they don't have a lot, they have a garage. We drive a Suburban!! We were charged an extra $20 a day to park for an extra large SUV so $65 a day and not the $35 we were quoted on the phone to park in the lot they did not have! The hallways are SO;2

"Just a block from Grand Street subway station and walking distance to East Village, Little Italy, Chinatown. Many places to eat in the area and a small grocery shop just around the corner. The hygiene was way beyond acceptable. At arrival there was yellow and red/brownish stains of what looked like human body fluids and/or feces on the bed sheets and all towels. It looked like the bed sheets was not changed since the previous guest. I told the front desk staff, and first they was not interested in doing something with it and said that housekeeping was arriving the next day. Then I said that this was not acceptable, and got a litte upset. After a short while I got a new bedsheet, but had to change it myself. The ""new"" bedsheet was also full of stains. I don't know what it is,";2
The nicest thing I can say about the Empire is that it is conveniently located across the street from Lincoln Center.    Perhaps the owners and management will recognize that form over function isn't a good thing when trying to give the illusion of precious space in Manhattan. The piles of attractive decorative pillows with the Empire Hotel logo have to compete with luggage space when one wants to sleep in the beds.  The small half-closet with no door with the mini-bar tucked inside left little room for a single carry-on.  I can deal with a miniscule Manhattan hotel room, but making it more challenging for guests is mystifying to me.  I might have appreciated the lovely Frette linens on the beds had the ancient air conditioner been working.  When one is simply lying on top of;2
Bugs in my shower upon arrival.  Heating/Air-conditioning issues throughout the hotel.  The room was uncomfortably hot.  Small, cramped rooms. Charged for everything in the room, even a cup of coffee. Not likely to stay here again.;2
Warm service and the entrance lobby is nice. We had to ask for a change of room. Windows donât fit, are drafty and street noise is really bad. We were given another room barely better. The maintenance guy told us all the rooms in the hotel need new windows. This is pretty bad. On top of that $5 for a 500 ml bottle of water says it all! Tired, in need of an upgrade and overpriced - I would love to have more good to say about it but I simply can find nothing more.;2
Took me back to my days of staying at youth hostels. Clean as in scrub clean but pretty beat up carpeting, stairwells, etc. Quite noisy w/window airconditioners especially in my 2nd floor room over the front entrance.Very small rooms with few amenities. TV w/maybe 8 channels, no in-room coffee or lobby coffee. Bigest drawback is location, long walks or cabs to food. On The Park means top end of park!;2
Very bad experience. super overpriced. staff not so nice. Place was under construction and dirty. We book two queen beds and front desk gave us one king bed. If I had a choice, I would not come back here.;2

I am going to start off by stating the good things about the hotel. -The hotelâs location is fantastic. If you are staying in the city after an event at Madison Square Garden, this is steps away and is the place to stay.  -The staff is very friendly. -The hotel is very clean.   Now the bad.  -The âFacilities Feeâ is obscene and misleading. To charge almost $40 a day for the use of a gym, that most people are not  going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong. I expected more from a Wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee.  -In spite of paying the âFacilities Feeâ, there wasnât even a coffee maker in the room. Come on, even when you stay at Motel 6, there is a coffee maker in the room.  -The room;2

The hotel rooms are small even by NYC standards.  The beds are comfortable, and the shower has excellent pressure.  But you have to stand outside the shower to adjust the temperature of the overhead shower.  The toilet is wedged between the wall and the commode so wide-girthed people need to use lubricant to sit down.  The work table that serves as a desk is too small to fit an average laptop because it is filled with products for sale at exhorbitant NYC hotel prices ($7.50 for water).  The internet connection in the room was flakey but seemed solid in the lobby (if you like working in a bar).    There is a small table-top ironing board in the closet but no table that will fit it near an outlet.  So I had to put it on the floor and iron on my knees.  However, the place is so;2
This hotel is run down, dirty and no better than a 2 star even by NYC standards.   Upon checkin the hotel stated there is a $29.99 plus Tax ($2.57) per day per room fee for wifi, health club and phone calls.  I do not use any of these services and it was not disclosed via Priceline and their fees.  This seems to be the new scam in NYC hotel circles.    I have used priceline for 15 years and have spent well over $50,000  on their site in in this time.  After 75 minutes on the phone they were unable to resolve the issue.  I was willing to purchase more expensive rooms via express deals  and provide priceline with the confirmation number and they were unable to help.  Looks like I will never use Priceline again.;2
While checking in, I was overlooked for the White couple, who had just gotten off the elevator to my right, and just walked up to the counter.  I had been patiently waiting in the Hilton Honors line, then Mt status as a Hilton Honors Gold Member was never recognized, so I informed to their staff, that my Platinum American Express Membership, would update my status automatically.  I was Not Ever offered ANYTHING, that my Gold Member Level comes with.  They even offered me a new membership, I reminded them I was already a Hilton Honors Member, the patron next to me was given a warm welcome, since she was a Diamond Member, guess my Gold Membership didn't count on this day.  Hotel walls were in need of repair, straight out of the elevator on the 7th floor, in fact every wall we saw;2
"It is not all redone as advertised nor is breakfast included. Our room was very old..cigarette holes in blanket, broken toilet seat, windows taped and couldn't see thru them. broken blinds.

The 11th floor is redone but didn;t have a room for us.";2
Great central location and clean modern accommodation. Hotel had lovely interior design features nodding to the 1930's architecture. However we were stuck in a backroom with a view of walls and abandoned debris. We asked if we could swap rooms but were told this would not be a possibility. There was only a coffee machine in our room, no tea available. The coffee machine had no instructions and when I explained that I couldn't use it at reception, she asked me what I would like her to do about that!!! Rude. On top of this, the room was noisy at night with some air conditioning unit whirring or something- even if all controls were switched off. And there was only one thin duvet and it got cold at night. I didn/t get much sleep. Also we wanted to be able to access the skyline;2
The hotel is beautiful but the front desk is awful and there is always hidden fees to your room.When I spoke to the manager she was so rude.  I recommend to go anywhere else because in NYC there is so many beautiful hotels.;2
We too had an issue with booking in. We had booked a twin room but were told on arrival that there had been a mistake and they did not have one available.  They offered us a queen bedroom or the possibility of going to another (unseen) hotel.  At no point did the receptionist apologise for their mistake and gave the impression that she was rather annoyed with us about the whole thing. After standing our ground for some time they eventually 'found' a room for us on the 7th floor with a double bed and bunkbeds.    This room was quite big and was cleen, but the carpet was wet on one side of the room.   The internet access in the basement is useful and quick but a bit expensive at $1 for 4 minutes.  The location is great - easy for travel and brilliant if you want to spend time in;2
I spent 5 nights in a 2-bed room with my friend. At first sight the room looked perfectly clean, the atmosphere of the hotel was super nice, felt like in a movie. The shared bathroom was also super clean, nothing to say regarding cleaning.   Though after 4 nights, my friend woke up with marks on her arms, and I figured I had also some in my back. We told the manager about it, that we suspected bed bugs - and his reaction was clear enough for us that they were bed bugs. Â«Â Well, can be, we will check your roomÂ Â». So to say, we felt disgusted and super worried that we might have some in our luggage.   When we came back at the end of te day, wÃ©ve been told there was nothing in our room, but they directly offered us the possibility to have another room. That we accepted.  On top of;2

This was our second time visit to LA with my wife and daughter. Since I'm Diamond HH, I was upgraded to 18th floor. The hotel itself is in a perfect location if visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood. Only 10 mins walk to Universal Studios and all the cafes and restaurants at City Walk although there is a free shuttle that takes you there. The condition of the hotel is terrible for one Hilton hilton. Very dark rooms with really old furniture and deco. My room 1854 is facing to the Hollywood hill and highway. Actually, there is nothing to see except running cars on the highway. I can hear the tremendous traffic noise in the room.  There are two terrible things happened during my stay. The first is that one horrible insect flying in the room when I came back room at the first;2
I really liked this appartment even though it cost us Â£900 thats over Â£200 a night for a week!!! should have been like the Hilton for that money, which is a shock when after all its just a room with a toilet! Anyway, it is a nice place to stay, one block from the subway and in an lovely area. The only real problem was cockroaches in the kichen, which frightened the life out of my girlfreind and i couldnt catch them, so that didnt go down to well. The service was basic, what do you expect from an appartment, to be honest if you want more for your money book a hotel.  I would not return or recommend this appartment.;2
Let's start with the positives. The bed is comfortable. The location is fantastic.   Other than that, I'm incredibly disappointed. Others have written about the small rooms. Well, it's Manhattan -- one expects rooms to be small. However, in a small space, it's all the more infuriating that practically every cubic inch of the room is taken up with STUFF FOR SALE. Not just food and drink, but also socks (why?) and a package of, um, adult accoutrements. There's no desk space because it's covered with two trays of stuff for sale (including k-cup coffee for $3 a cup. Really?!) and the room has a fridge, but I had to remove 12 for-sale items from it to put in my yogurts and beer. A few of the for-sale items have prices marked. But most do not. (One wonders whether this is even legal.;2

I was surprised when I arrived that non of the doormen offered to help me with my luggage.  They just stood around chatting to each other.    The front desk seemed quite bureaucratic (they kept telling the person in front of me that they couldn't do anything about her problem as it was hotel policy).  So, after I had waited a long time while they didn't sort out her problem they then took ages to check me in because there seemed to be a problem with my booking also.  My big problem was the room service breakfast.  They said they served from 6:00am.  I ordered the night before and was told it would be with by 6:10 or 6:20.  I called the next morning at 6:00am to confirm. I called at 6:30 when nothing had arrived.  It eventually arrived at 6:40 and there was no toast and no fork;2
Definitely not a 4* hotel as advertised. Old, dated, aging hotel. Rooms are tiny, with a musty, damp odor - charges for everything including storing baggage (never heard of such a thing before), refrigerator, coffee maker etc.  Best avoided in favor of any number of hotels in the area.;2
I've stayed in County Hall many times over the years.  Its location is excellent and usually the service and rooms are of good quality.  This time however the twin room I booked for two adults came with the usual large double bed and then the smallest single bed I have ever seen.  It was not only small but also incredibly uncomfortable.  I raised this the next morning with Reception as I had a terrible sleep, and they weren't interested.    We only had a couple of beers in the hotel bar on this trip as the beer was awful - whichever variant we went for, it was really flat.  We took two pints back and switched to another beer to be given a similar flat substance - not the usual quality I'd expect from County Hall.  Finally, while breakfast was generally good the staff tidied away;2

Booked 10 nights in this hotel through my travel agent and it was not cheap. Staff were great , room adequate however rooms were booked out to huge groups of college kids which meant no sleep for the last 5 nights .  Felt like I was staying at a backpackers or on school camp. Terrible. One star for staff and one for location.;2
First our flight in arrived roughly around 11 pm so we were instructed to call the front desk and inform them that we were going to be arriving past midnight to ensure that our reservation was not canceled. That in its self was a pain in the butt. We called several times and no one answered so we were forced to leave a voicemail hoping that they would actually get it. We got to the hotel and got our room, when we walked in we almost left because the room is roughly 11x11 and right next to the elevator. We could barley walk in the room and there was no room for the luggage. The bathroom was tiny as well. The bathroom was probably 3 feet deep and 7 feet long. Luckily for us the room was clean so we decided to tough it out for a couple of days, but if they give you a _20 room;2
This hotel was OK, but not brilliant! I stayed in a room above a central quad looking onto other rooms and the rooms were basic but cheap. This I didn't mind as you don't go to New York to see the inside of a hotel room. Facilities were basic but the hotel was clean and the stay was quite present.  However, the main negatives were the fact that the plugs in the bathroom sink and bath didn't work and the very noisy air conditioning unit from the basement rooms made a racket all night and it was difficult to sleep.;2
Very intriguing place, considering its very unique architecture & design, as well as its history.    Loved the neighborhood - meat packing district at the base of the High Line.  Close to  good food, cute neighborhoods to walk through, fun intellectual and physical activities of various kinds.  Felt like a safe neighborhood.    I recommend a captain's room, based on what I have heard from other guests.  Don't stay here if you suffer from claustrophobia.  The living spaces are really small and cramped.    We stayed in one of the tiny bunk rooms.  WAAAAYYYYY too hot w/o any way to control it, only one tiny window opening to a courtyard whose design allowed almost zero air movement, and A/C could not keep up.  Never able to bring the room below 79F.    Shared bath was just fine.;2
Hotel is adequate (small rooms) for the money and clean, but no heat (typical NY radiator heat that managment controls - only turned on the first night and then too late to do much good), TV did not work,  no wash clothes the second day, staff was pleasant but on morning we were leaving two employees got into a heated discussion complete with profanity.;2

"This hotel's location is great if you're going to the Met, which is the reason we booked it. It's right across the street.    We only stayed one night, for which we ended up shelling out $270 total, although the website we booked it through advertised it as $100 bucks initially. The room was tiny, not at ""user-friendly"", due to some faux-European stylizations which make for an odd experience.  For example, I'm 5'6"""" and had to stand on my tiptoes to reach the hangers in the tall, narrow closet as well as the hook for bathrobes. The sink in the bathroom is completely flat and quite shallow, causing a splash-back issue. The shower has a steel baton attached to it by coil for no immediately apparent reason, except perhaps to make you think water is actually going to come out of it";2

How can you make 80 pounds a night with a 15 m2 room? These guys found the answer: stuff four people inside. Jokes aside: The room is very basic, kind of cold, there's very little place for luggage and absolutely no security (no lockers, no keys, ...), The staff is of very little use. They seem to have forgotten how to smile and will gladly provide misleading information. There was a construction site by the building and it will probably continue all year (they don't work at night fortunately)  The elevator did not work and I was assigned a room on fourth floor. On the plus side: check-in is quick and the room is reasonably clean. Location isn't bad. Just go for it if you need one night without fuss, avoid this shared rooms for long periods. It would also work for you if you are;2
We spent 4 days there, for one of our best friend's big birthday celebration.  We waited long time to check into our room.  The rooms were SUPER SMALL!  The lobby was so crowded and very unfriendly UNSAFE.  One of the hotel guests broke my luggage, and I had to discuss with the hotel security to get them to hold her accountable for her careless behaviour.  Evidently, this hotel is indifferent to guests' safety or behaviours.  Only saving grace the doormen were always helpful, and two on-site restaurants were very good, and it is just across stress from the Union Station of Amtrak.;2
Just returned from a trip to NY, staying in this Days Hotel at Broadway/west 94th street. The staff was unpolite (except for the concierge, great guy!!). I booked a room for my son and me, booked for double beds but got a room with one bed double sized. So as soon as I noticed this I phoned the reception and told them that a mistake happened, as I made a pre-paid reservation for a room with two beds. We're sorry this is what you can get, was the reply. And they added: we consider a reservation as a request. Excuse me??!! A pre-paid reservation for a room with two beds, considered as a request? After I got a bit upset and spoke to three (!) people at the phone, while still in the wrong room, they decided to give me a room with two beds. I think my determined attitude made them;2
Hotel is good location but be prepared for no coffee maker in the room and if you awake before the restaurant opens you have to go down the street for coffee.  Room and bathroom is small but not as small as some I've stayed in, in NY.  No door on the shower and if you are heigth challenged you can't adjust the overhead (ceiling mounted) showerhead nor the switch that redirects water from the head to the hand held wand.  There are no directions in the bathroom for operation, had to call the front desk and they did send up maintenance to explain operation.  All of this in a superior King room.

Very expensive for what it was, and when we arrived we were put in the tiniest room that smelled of feet and above a noisy road (room 202, I believe). We asked if there was another room available and was told we could move the next day which was fine. The next room (206) was a million times better - much bigger, had a lovely huge bath, and access to a patio (noisy due to all the air con units, but nice to be able to get outside). Location is great, and the decor was quite quirky but that's where the positives end....  The real deciding factor was on the Friday night when myself and my boyfriend intended to have a drink in the bar before bed (around 10pm I think). Although we were smartly dressed, we were physically blocked from going into the bar by the bouncer and told it was a;2
I spent 5 nights in this hotel in January room 313.  The hotel is in a quiet location opposite Central Park.  The metro is just a minutes walk down the road and provides quick access to the rest of Manhattan.  The rooms were clean and the staff friendly.    Now the not so good bits.  The central heating was very noisy, it seemed to come on at about 4:30 in the morning and the pipes made a very loud banging noise, I am normally a deep sleeper and it woke me up every night.  The room had an air conditioner, so if you stay in summer I don't think this would be a problem.  Due to a very early flight back, we arranged for a taxi/car through reception at an agreed price including tolls.  Once at the airport the driver tried to extort us out of a lot more than the agreed price.  I am;2

Only the location will give this place any worth. Sadly, the potential for this hotel to be great is missed on many levels. Recently had to stay for over a week and there were too many issues to even bother about complaining everyday.   The air conditioning in the room repeatedly did not work, would shut off and would require a phone call to the front desk & 45 mins until it would magically turned on. Several times did it turn off in the middle of the night and one would wake in a hot room, i always wondered what sleeping in a cave in the city would be like. Why not open the windows? well NYC was having a heat wave, 90s all around. so why add more to the oven room. Secondly, upon asking within daily returns to turn on the air, it would still take over an hour for anything to;2

The room is absolutely tiny and feels really old a dingy. I've had four interactions with staff during my two night stay. Three of them were noteworthy and negative. Someone on the staff scolded me in front of a group of people for trying to use the stairs after a fire alarm had just gone off at 6:30 a.m. We were given the all clear to go back to our rooms, but apparently he wasn't okay with me using the stairs and he was really rude. I was allowed access to use the stairs 10 seconds afterwards. Then, later in the day a guy let a huge number of people by to get on the elevators. He saw me and for some reason forced me to show him a room key. He also used attitude and was rude after I asked why he'd let everyone else past, but me. I called for a late check out, and the guy was;2

So I stayed there for a conference. My room smelled like smoke. After several complaints I was moved to a room with an awful view. The food was awful Seriously I had to add salt to cashew Chicken that had soy sauce in it.   My TV never worked and no one seemed to car.  Either I have too high standards or service has gone way down.  Oh and in the ballrooms there was ZERO internet, and no cell service. Awful place for a conference.;2
"The room was incredibly small for the amount of money we spent. The ""closet"" was not suitable for hanging formal attire. Electrical outlets were loose and fewer in number and convenient location than we neeeded. The bathroom door's translucent glass let too much light into the room when the bathroom was used during the night, waking one of us. ... On the bright side, your doormen were fabulous, among the best we have encountered. Very well trained, exceedingly polite and friendly with a warm greeting and ready smile. They are true ambassadors for the hotel. Staying elsewhere next time.";2

We booked a superior room for 4 nights. If this was a superior room I dread to think what an ordinary room was like. The room was small and only a shower in the bathroom. There were holes in one of the duvet covers and the linings to the curtains were also full of holes. There was mold on the walls at the bottom of the window. The only hanging space for clothes was a curtained alcove less than 3 feet wide and this also housed the safe and minibar, 6 hangers were provided for 2 of us. There was a gap at the base of the toilet pan causing it to rock back and forth on the floor clattering against the cistern and there was always a pool of water ? on the floor beside it. There were no bathrobes in our room as someone else has said. The swimming pool is closed until May. We asked to;2
The hotel has negatives and positives. However the negatives out weigh the positives.  The girl who was on check in, was moody and unhelpful and was more concerned with playing on here phone that printing off the reservation, this resulting in a misunderstanding as to how long i was staying. Reception rang my room at 3.30 in the morning to question my departure date, not at all professional.  Upon checking out there were further complications due to the absent  attitude of the staff.  The room was reasonable, clean, but very dark. In future i will be booking my hotel long in advance as to avoid staying at this dump.;2
Me and daughter went here as a gift from sister and I was not impressed.  The room was not clean and this place is overrated. Rust was on items in room. Dirty bathroom and cracked ceramic tile.

I had a room on the first floor (actually the third floor, but the first floor of hotel rooms). I brought a white noise machine with me, which turned out to be a great decision since taxis honking their horns would otherwise have been a problem. The shower water temperature was at best lukewarm. A Keurig coffe machine in the room offered the opportunity to be charged $3 for making a cup of coffee, which was cheaper than the bottled water or the internet service in the room. The bathroom was quite small. But the price was cheaper than the Mandarin Oriental a block or so away. The lobby is nice.;2

Upon entering the lobby customers desk are dark, tall and uninviting the ceilings are low and hallways are dark. There's a foul stench in the front elevator whatever they were using let off a musky egg smell. The hotel itself is located near public transport - 10 minute walk to the subway and it was 15-20 minutes to get to Universal studios which is the hotels biggest strengths. We felt very unsafe and avoided going out at night. There are a lot of homeless people in the area, the street next to the hotel had a line of;2
You get what you pay for I guess, but I was surprised at how rough this hotel is.  Wallpaper peeling off the walls, frayed carpets, stains, a bed with lumps.

Lovely lobby but other than that, much rougher shape than other older hotels I've stayed in while in NYC.;2

"My experience was ""whatever"" as I needed a place to sleep for one night upon our return to LA.  The plan was drop off the car, fly out and when we get back, spend that night at the hotel.  Great plan, or was it?  I had made a reservation for outdoor valet parking and I was charged twice for parking the one night we stayed there.  I called Hyatt and it took 3 calls, as nobody returned the first two calls, and then I was told that though I paid for a week, there was a no ""in and outs"" and I had to pay an additional $55 on top of the previously paid nights.  I was told that it is on their website.  I didn't see it then, and I don't see it now.  I guess I have to call AMEX and dispute the charge, but if you are thinking of doing the same thing that I did, park and stay somewhere";2
This was the curt reply we got from a member of the front desk staff when we informed them we had booked a Queen room through our travel agent in the UK as part of our package. the luggage did not fit in the room if we went in there as well, no dress hanging space at all. We ended up piling up unopened cases on top of each other. Room dark, view not what we expected, looking straight into rooms across the alley: undesirable. We kept the curtains and windows shut, but the outdated air-conditioning kept waking us up. We were given a hanging rail for our clothes, but the only place to put it was to lift it over the bed and then down the other side - leaving only one side to climb into bed. Dingy bathroom (wooden shower tray was mouldy at the edges, and no door so we used one of our;2

As its name denotes, it's centrally located in the middle so it cuts commute time & many things are within walking distance) - Friendly staff (we haven't had much interaction with the staff but when we have they have been helpful & friendly.) - Windows open (this is typically not the case, and being able to let fresh air in during the temperate October weather was nice.) - Mini fridge did not have a weight sensor (items are charged only if seal is broken or if;2

"My husband and I booked this hotel through Priceline as a last minute deal on a 4 star hotel. The hotel looked fine in the lobby. Trouble started when we were told there would be a $31 facilities fee for the wifi, the workout room, and business center. This wiped out any savings over comparable hotels. Seriously? We were checking in at 8, heading out to dinner, and leaving first thing in the morning. Could the fee be waived? ""No, everyone pays the fee."" Thanks for your consideration.  It got worse when they said there is not a king bed on property, only 1 queen bed.

I like the location of the hotel which is why I use it when I'm in NYC but it could be vastly improved. I book via Expedia and am an 'Elite' member which should give preferential treatment and upgrades to hotels that are part of the Expedia  'VIP' booking program (which the New Yorker does). However, when I arrived, the front desk staff had no record of my status and were not at all interested in contacting Expedia to rectify the situation and so gave me an old, dark and basic room little bigger than a prison cell! After spending a while on the phone to Expedia, they corrected their mistake and instructed the hotel to give me the room that I should have had. The better rooms at the hotel are OK but the attitude of the front desk staff leaves a great deal to be desired!;2

The main disappointment at the hotel was the fact that the pool deck was closed, this was the main reason we booked this particular hotel and we were really looking forward to it. It was a major disappointment that we only found out once arriving at the hotel. After hearing this news, we headed to the hotel room only to find the room was very small, totally dark, facing a wall and with a noisy air vent. We immediately headed back down to reception, and to be fair, we were able to upgrade the room after expressing our disappointment, and really appreciated that at the hotel. The lobby area and bar was very dark so didn't want to spend much time in there. Wifi was only free in lobby and not in room.   I think the price of the hotel is made up for by the location, it's just one;2
Stayed here for 3 nights recently. The hotel itself is ok but in a very bad area, everthing closes at 9pm. No resturant onsite except for the average breakfast so dining elsewhere or calling dominos on Sunset for delivery is the only option.

The location and the rooftop are something that could entice you to stay, the noise, the fire alarms in the middle of the night should deter you.  The rooms are small and in need of some upgrades, the bathrooms in the standard and superior rooms are like a closet with a shower, toilet and skinny sink inserted.

We stayed in this hotel 4 days in early May. Hotel very cheap considering the conditions in NY. At this price it can not be too much to require. The hotel is located near the metro station at 110st. There is a supermarket in the area. Room was clean, but bathroom, unfortunately, was in the hallway (and definitely needs to be renewed). We had a room on the 2nd floor, so there wasn't problems with any noise from the reception. The staff is very helpful. No breakfast at the room price:(;2

Being so excited about arriving in New York (three hours late, but we caught the Manhatten skyline all lit up, so not so bad) so we weren't wholly bothered about our hotel.  That was until we used the bathroom - it was FILTHY. The hot tap was hanging off and the plug was obviously having issues staying in the hole.  The room itself wasn't too bad, the bed was comfortable, and we were towards the back, so noise was at a minimum. We didn't have much of a view though, but that was mainly to do with the thick greasy film of dirt on the window. It was lovely and warm though as the hot water pipe ran down the wall next to the bed - not a great thing to use if you are unsteady in the morning as it was boiling hot.  Overall the location is great if you don't wan to stay in the middle of;2
Staying in room 2621. Minute double, dated and noisy with paper thin walls. You pay a mandatory 22 dollars per room per day service charge extra for free wifi , telephone calls and conference facilities that nobody uses or has on their phone anyway. RIP off and certainly not recommended. No view. , The hotel location is convenient but then, so are many others.;2
Just back from New York and spent 4 nights at this hotel. As it was our first time visiting we wanted something quite central which it was. It's a 30 min walk to Central Park and not far from Times Square and Macy's. So the points definitely go for location. The not so positive aspects of the hotel is the rooms. Walking into the hotel reception you get a positive feeling as it's nice but upstairs it's very disappointing. We were on the 21st floor with a view of the Empire State Building which was good. The room itself was tiny and had a tiny bathroom you could not display anything. The wardrobe was small and there was hardly any room to move about in and it was really dated and looked like it needed a good clean. I would say it was probably a 2 or  pushing it a 3 star at most.;2
We arrived to find our room way too small...Maggi (fantastic customer service) gave us the opportunity to upgrade at a cost of USD50 per night (not including taxes).. still so small we had to go outside to change our minds!  So the room was small... the bathroom was worse... paper cups and no glassware... one cake of soap... the closet door hanging off its hinges.... not that you could hang anything up as it was designed for midgets only...2 of 4 elevators not working.... no hot water on the morning we checked out and had to wait almost 40 minutes for hot water to be fixed... not good enough for the rate paid...  To be fair the staff on reception and Chris on concierge were amazing... just don't go there if you're expecting a reasonably sized room with amenities fitting the;2
We left our booking late and so probably deserved to get one of the 'dogs' given it was graduation week. On arrival, reception was disinterested. The first room we got on the second floor had a 3/4 bed and a single bedside lamp (looked like a single room). The AC vents were broken. After complaining we were given a larger room on the 10th floor. Positives - great location close to subway, walking distance to Central Park, nice Corner Cafe across the road plus a nearby laundrette. Good internet connection. Helpful tour desk. Negatives - towels were too small, sink plug leaked, toilet cistern handle was loose, desk chair was unstable, carpet was 'sticky', curtains off tracks, slow elevators, wrong size sheets on bed, and absolutely no attempt to help us get a cab or handle our;2

Checked in for 5 days as the rate wasn't bad. First thing we checked were the charge authorised on our credit card. They decided to hold $140 for parking, even though we'd no car and didn't plan to use one. The I ordered 3 items from Amazon, I thought they'd be delivered together but they were delivered seperate. They charged us $4 for each package they took in, a joke considering the effort involved. Left a bad taste in the mouth. Location is good and other than feeling they were looking to make a buck off every move it wasn't bad.;2
Unfortunately we received confirmation for a different room above the 19th floor. We expected a small room, it is NYC. But we didn't expect a room where you could actually here everything that happened outside. Between the sirens, jack hammering and honking horns there was not one peaceful night. We were too close to the street on the 8th floor with absolutely no view of anything.;2
Having stayed in many hotels in NYC this was definitely not up to the scratch of the other ones!   Check in was quick and efficient. Staff were friendly on the desk and we got to our room via the old and creaky lifts! The room itself was tiny. I know this can normal in NYC but it was very very small. There was just enough room for a bed and a chest of drawers with a TV on the top. We did have a lovely view of the Empire State from our window but that was the only selling point.   The other disappointing factor was when we were checking out we got charged $2 per bag to leave them at the hotel in their secure room! In all the hotels we have stayed at we have never had to pay to leave luggage. As we had not been notified of this charge we only had $20 bills with us and the staff;2

I stayed there for 4 nigth. The only really nice thing about this hotel is the neigborhood. It<s 5minutes to 72th station metro and the area is really quiet, full of restaurant and accomodation like grocery stores and cafe.   Talk about the hotel now... It was really stain on the wall, full of cracks and the carpet in the room was dirty. I wasn't even sure if they clean the bedsheat. There were dirt on the bedhead and the shared bathroom hadn't been clean for at least 3 days. The last day of my trip I found a cockroach on the desk beside my bed and when we advise the clerk, they just said: I'm sorry.  If you want to pay a cheap hotel, I would strongly recommend you to check for the YMCA before this. If you keep your luggage close and want a place to sleep only and if cockroach;2

Not a good experience.  This could be a 4-star hotel but not close.  No Wifi service.  No help.  No one answers the phone.  Not the Operator....not the front desk.  The phones just ring and ring and then you get put on hold.  Terrible responsiveness / front desk service.

Letâs start with the good: beds are really comfy and location is great! Really close to a 1, 2 and 3 train which all go to Times Square! Bad: front desk is kind of rude, building is outdated and dirty, our AC fan was a dust mess when we got here, there are weird spots all over our mirror, like paint stained, you can hear everything in the hallway, bathroom fan is loud and dirty, we had to have maintenance up twice to fix our tv that wouldnât turn on. And last but not least... donât expect to have wifi!!! It does not work. Ever. Itâs a password-less free wifi so Iâm sure the locals are soaking that up. We stayed on the 9th floor and I only had it work in the early morning or late, late at night. Iâd avoid next time. For sure.;2

My reservation was moved to this hotel because the original hotel was still under construction.  The room was very basic.  It smelled like a damp dog, the air conditioner was loud, the hair dryer did not work, there is no fan in the bathroom, but it was bigger than my room at the W.  It cost me an extra $16 roundtrip in cabs to get to Midtown/Downtown because it was so far north.  But cute neighborhood & close to 96st. Subway station.;2
We stayed there with a free night from the Cendant best rate program. Upon check-in, they wanted to charge us for the night. We stated that is was a free night and nothing had to be paid. After discussing with the Days Inn Central Reservation agents, they agreed that we don't need to pay for the night.  In the evening, when we came back from a sightseeing tour we found our room's door to be locked. We went to the reception and had to discuss the matter again.   Next day, I had to leave early and my wife did the check-out on her own. Three guys of the staff and one women stayed around here, shouted at her and had her to pay for the night! I would call it sexual harassement. Why could not one single receptionist discuss the matter with her alone? And why did they want to charge;2
I stayed in the queen sized rooms which are off Broadway a busy street. They are extremely noisy, very small and fairly run down. Noise comes from an outside air system, and in addition the very old air conditioning units which I couldnât use while sleeping because they were so damn loud. The rooms are also very dark. Maybe to hide the fact they arenât so clean.  In terms of cleanliness I found a stack of used condoms in my bin from the previous tenant. Absolutely disgusting.    Also worth mentioning the pool is closed from late September if itâs a reason for you to book and Free WiFi is only available in the lobby.   Donât be fooled by the photos on their website.;2
If it wasnât for the location I wouldnât have stayed at this hotel. Thatâs the only going for it.  Scaffolding was put up outside our windows and guys could look right into our room. No prior warning of this was given and no discount offered for the inconvenience of opening my blinds in my pjs with a workman outside my window staring right back!  The hotel keys donât work every time you leave the room. Excuse given was that they are too close to mobile phones but mines wasnât and it still didnât work!  Heating. Room was frozen and when asked for someone to look at the heating I was told that they donât switch heating on till November! As a guest paying over Â£250 per night I would expect a better attitude than this. Some others must have also complained because next day it was;2
What can I say, after really looking forward to my first visit to New York, this hotel was a real disappointment.   My family had just stayed in a 4 star in Washington DC, the service was perfect, the room facilities were excellent, coffee machine etc., and the room had plenty of space.   In contrast the New Yorker had very poor service, the desk couldn't get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him. We were charged $20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin. Even though we had the rooms we booked in Washington the New Yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin.  The room was tiny with minimal facilities, the only thing on offer was water, at a price. The lifts made so much;2
"This summer I stayed at this hotel with a friend and our children. It was a fantastic combo package that include tickets to the Empire State Bldg and free breakfasts. We were on the 34th floor with a great view. Loved every minute of it. Two weeks ago I brought my husband and son back to enjoy the Christmas season in NYC. At check-in my husband was told that we were being given an ""upgraded"" room seeing as though we were returning guests....terrific. We were put on the 8th floor with a view of a brick wall in a small room with an extremely small bathroom. The bowl sink looked nice but the water drained slowly and the bowl was so shallow that it very quickly could have overflowed. The shower was awkwardly built so that you had to stand in the shower completely to be able to reach";2

The hotel is beautiful.  It is directly located across the street from Lincoln Center.  We got to see all the goings on for Fashion Week.  Thank goodness for a great location.  There is so much to do on the west side of the city. The room was less than desirable.  It was very small with a terrible view.  The heating unit was very loud and made the room sweltering hot.  The room was supposed to have a queen bed.  This was not a queen bed but a full.  My husband's feet fell over the edge of the bed.  The bed was extremely uncomfortable.  It felt as though I was sleeping on a concrete slab.  The pillows were quite flat and hard as well.  The bathroom was tiny.  Our sink did not drain properly when the drain plug was in place - we had to take it out for the water to go down.  The;2
I fly to New York every month, and I've stayed at this hotel twice, only due to location and price I picked this hotel... So here is my honest opinion...   Pros:   1. Lately the rates have been between $120-150 per night, for NYC in the summer, that's a plus! I wouldn't stay here If the rate was higher.  2. Rooms are roomy compared to your typical NY hotel.   3. Location is great! There are shops all around to eat and grab a quick bite.   4. My 2nd visit I left my id in the car, the receptionist was able to verify me by my previous reservation which was nice!   Cons:   1. The room appears clean as long as you don't move anything around or look under the sheets. It's grimmy and is not sanitary. There were stains all over the mattress and double mattress  covers.

Bellmen were the best service on property. And typically they are contracted out so guessing they aren't even hotel employees.

Get into the 21st Century - coffee in rooms should be free, wifi in rooms should be free. If you charged reasonable prices for the mini bar it may get used, but $70+ for a 70cl Merlot and only cardboard cups to drink it from is appalling. Safety should be paramount - putting brackets on windows to prevent them opening far is a fire hazard if there is a fire in the corridor - a person could not escape through that sized opening. Double glazing might prevent outdoor noises from being a disturbance - when you are on the 1st floor (above the Lobby and Mezzanine levels) hearing conversations outside is extreme.

It's hard to imagine that this much stuff can go wrong during one three-night stay, but trust me...  It all started with a much too long wait to check in, only to be greeted by a team of beleaguered people who, while efficient, seemed as bland as cardboard and ready to call it a day.   On to the elevators. Two of them are out of commission for some sort of repair. The other three are the slowest elevators on the planet. I waited along with about a dozen others for quite some time before we all piled into the one elevator whose doors finally opened. The arrows weren't working so we thought we were going up, but ended up going down first. I kid you not, it took 5 minutes for me to get from the 10th floor to the lobby one morning.

"Before leaving for our vacation my friend and I did a lot of research on this hotel. On the website we looked at it stated airport shuttle, absolutely a load of crap, when we arrived at the airport I proceeded to call the hotel and was informed that they don't offer a shuttle and we would have to ride the ""Super Shuttle"" which costs $15 one way and that didn't include the ""tip.""  ( Just a personal tip for any single woman going, DON'T take the super shuttle, we were offered a ""special tour"" in our drivers mercedes for 5 hours for $100!) When we arrived at the hotel the front desk man wasn't very helpful when I asked to have extra linen sent up to the room.

I visited for 2 nights on business, and being my first time in New York was immediately shocked by the tiny size of the room!! It had all the amenities I needed so I was not lacking anything. However, it is the most aged and tired looking hotel I have ever stayed at. I'm not one for quirky charm of the past and if my budget had afforded it - would have stayed somewhere newer and more modern. Regardless, it is a great location and thankfully I only had to sleep there (although it is super loud on the streets all night long even though I was 20 floors up - and the bed was slanted and not comfortable at all lol) my back is against the door in the pic I have included. Looks nice - but it's deceiving! The great part was that I had a short walk to Times Square for some sight seeing;2

I arrived for a stay at your hotel to celebrate a birthday, only for my room not to be ready. The clerk at the front desk told me that I would be upgraded to the Junior Suite king for the inconvenience which, in addition, came drink vouchers which was a nice touch. The over readiness of my room took much longer then the accommodations lead on. I sat at the bar for 2 hours, constantly checking back, and my upgraded room too was also delayed. After the clerk spoke to the manager because of my concern, I was finally given keys to my room, which was not a Junior Suite King as promised. If it wasn't mainly for the friendliness of the staff i would have given this survey what I feel management of this hotel deserves. Which is everything less than par. A great staff with poor;2
Only had 2 nights for a business trip, however I wouldn't stay here again. Very dated building and scruffy interior and rooms. Great location but just not comfortable at all, tiny tiny rooms (and I travel alot) overall very disappointing.;2

We booked this hotel for 4 nights arrived on 16Feb18. The 1st night was ok because it was kind a warm outside. The 2nd night the weather turn a bit cold so we cranked the thermostat to 72F but no warm air. I called the front desk and they offered me a heater (just like when you are in Motel6). They said they will send someone to fix it next morning. The space heater was noisy and quite working around 3am in the night. Later in the day while we were at the Walk of Fame I got text message on my phone from Violeta that the thermostat is fixed. We arrived back in our room around 8pm and it was cold outside. The room was ok for a while but than the thermostat died again. The room temp turned uncomfortably cold again. The engineer came knock on the door at around 10:45 in the night;2

One of the dirtiest hotels I have ever stayed in my life. I have stayed wonderful Hyatt hotels but this is a disgrace for Hyatt. Specially the roo carpet and the sofa were dirty and not cleaned. Room service lady opened the door when you are naked without even knocking the door. Need a lot of improvements.;2
Very Basic hotel. Nothing wrong with it, could do with the bathroom being cleaner. Free Wifi but it only works in certain areas. Staff are friendly & helpful.  Guy that checked us in said he would give us a room with 2 beds even though I already booked 2 x Double beds, got a room with 1 Double & 1 single bed.  Personally if staying again I would pay more to get a nicer hotel.;2

At first appearance the lobby looks nice, very Art Deco. At reception when booking in we was told about the room tax being $23 per night, when asked what it was for we was told for the WiFi. I asked if there was water and drinks in the room and was told no it was extra. Having traveled from the uk I was quite disappointed by this. The room tax seemed to be unneeded really. When we caught the lift to our floor and got out you could see it really did need redecorating, we was on floor 28. We opened the door to our room to almost trip on the bed!. Thankfully it was just for sleeping in as it was rather small dated and the bathroom was worse!. We nearly scalded ourselves in the shower as getting the water temperature right was nearly impossible, towels were very small but clean and;2
"Although this is a beautiful hotel with great location, amenities and food, their ""lost and found"" department is subpar. Or perhaps it is the housekeeping department? All i know is that i left my toiletry bag hanging in the bathroom and was excited when i called and they said that housekeeping had turned it in. They sent me a link to pay for shipping (which was not cheap by the way) and i was thrilled when my stuff arrived. I was not so thrilled when i discovered that all my stuff had been ransacked and my expensive perfume MISSING. It was the only thing missing. Coincidence? I think not. When i called to report the discrepancy, the head of security told me he was sorry but there was nothing he could do, that they sent everything they had. NOT TRUE. Who stole my perfume is a";2
Although they are slowly improving some parts of the hotel (in room AC) they still have an issue with sound isolation and especially the windows.  So, if you look for quiet... This is not the place for you.   I personally was quite displeased with the patronising and almost rude attitude from Pasquale. When you are a many times returning customer, voluntarily downgrade yourself to have a quiet room, dont take breakfast (because if lack of sleep due to the noise) and suggest them to offer the beer and coffee (yes coffee, first is complementary, after you have to pay !!).  I was amazed by the poor commercial approach and the almost lecture I was about to be given on the fact that the mini bar and breakfast were different things ! Sir, you need to review to your hospitality basics.;2
"Location is great, as we had plans for concert at Lincoln Center. Rooms small and tight; poor lighting (particularly task lighting); problems with plumbing; poorly maintained (had to change rooms because of various maintence issues); offered 1 tiny bar of soap for the 2 night stay; thin and rough towels; very dated and dark decor; charged to hold luggage until Room was ready. For our $700 2 night stay (which is a deal in this area of NY) very disappointed. Have stayed there before, but it was not this poor years ago.   On the positive- staff is very pleasant and helpful.  Suggest that management staff stay in their standard room for the average personâs experience. Might provoke an update!";2
Let me preface this review with some context. We travel a lot and have increasingly used Hyatt properties as they have been a touch above other chains. A priority for us is a nice lounge where we can get a healthy breakfast at our own pace. In addition, we enjoy a cocktail in the evening with a nice variety of hot and cold snacks.   With a few days in LA we decided to use the LAX Hyatt as our base. Checking in around 9:30 PM, after dropping our bags we were told at check-in that if we hurried to the lounge there would be drinks, snacks, and desserts until 10 PM. Sitting in the club, we decided this was a great choice. The coffees, yogurts, and cakes were great.   Exhausted, we headed for bed. The room was lovely, fresh and spotless with a firm mattress, nice linens and even 1;2
Location was great for Universal Studios. 10 minute walk or free shuttle. Room price was fair and rooms were nice. We got ripped off on meals. Normal buffet was $20 and premium was $30. That's fair but the father's day brunch was $80 per person! I had no idea and wasn't very hungry so I paid that for scrambled eggs and bacon! $160 for my son and me! Also, parking is $30 per night and the one drinking glass I used was dirty. Overall it was nice but that father's day brunch left a bad taste in my mouth. I do not recommend because the value dropped too much after those extra expenses.;2
Our stay at this hotel caused us lots of delay since they were experiencing elevator issues.  Wait times to go up or down were up to 30 minutes at a time.  Basic items that were not working in our room included heat and safe.  Very dissapointed with this Hilton property.;2
The hotel lobby is nice, but the rooms, and especially the bathrooms, are badly in need of restoration. The tile in the bathroom in the room where I stayed was painted a sick green color, and the paint was chipping off. Both the room and bathroom were very worn out. The staff is friendly, and service is good. They just need to update the rooms!;2
Poor check in service, I ordered tickets to take my mom and son to a show at 3:00pm. We arrived to the hotel at 1:00 and was told there would be a room ready by 2:00 for us, at 2:00 the rude lady at the check in desk said we couldnt check in until 3:00... Which I find hard to believe cause Ive seen people checking out all day as we sat there in the lobby. We missed our show that I paid $250.00 for because our luggae was in the bellman room and all our stuff to get ready was in there, and we had no room to put our stuff in once we left. So I am out $250.00 and I feel like I wasted my money staying at the hotel. Also, that night we ordered a pizza and I got a calll from the front desk to come down and pick it up so once I got down there I had to wait in a 15 minute line of people;2

"We were extremely disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist on arrival at the New Yorker and, sadly, the experience didn't improve much after that. Our credit card was not so much requested as demanded and, when I queried the amount that would be held by the hotel, was simply told it was hotel policy in case I incurred extras while staying and anyway ""your company will be paying for it"". As it was, this was a personal holiday not charged to any company and apart from the internet charge of $10 there was nothing else to pay. A $49 charge was excessive, especially as it took more than a week to refund it. Once we got to the room there were no facilities for making a drink, simply the option to ask housekeeping to provide something but no explanation about whether that";2

"I have stayed at the Empire a few times. I never had a complaint with the Empire until I recently booked and called to alert them that I was looking for an early check-in if possible. Check out is noon check in 3 pm. They responded they could not do this, without me and my cc being present, I  let the man at front desk know I was travelling with a baby, a small dog and many bags. he responded he could hold my bags while I waited to check in at 3pm. I explained that travelling with a baby and a dog it's inadvisable to ""show up"" and see what happens, so I asked if they could give me a call and let me know if a room popped up. No demands just a friendly request.  The front desk man outright refused to take my phone number and then he let me know that it would be impossible for this";2
Overall the hotel is in a good location, very central to everything.  Most of the rooms are small and outdated.  The check in experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  After at least a 30 minute line I asked to pay for a room upgrade and went upstairs to find one of the smallest rooms I'd ever seen.  We went back downstairs, waited again for approx. 20 minutes and were given another room.  In both cases the front desk clerks could not do anything without talking with a manager, a process where they disappeared for 10-15 minutes each time.  Upon checkout I was given a different room upgrade rate from what I was quoted and after waiting in line again...the lady at the front desk just stared at me like I was an idiot and it was my fault.  I travel 100+ days a year and;2

At around 7pm last night (11/28), I booked 2 rooms for my relatives through Hotels.com. Shortly after, I called the front desk at Hyatt Regency LAX to: 1) Double check the rooms were available 2) Inform that their flight lands at midnight and will be checking in after retrieving baggage and taking the shuttle 3) Make sure the airport shuttle would still be running after midnight   When my relatives got to the counter at around 12:45am, they were told that: 1) Their prepaid reservations were invalid because someone else had paid for the rooms- even though their names were listed for each room reservation.  2)  There were no more rooms left.   After a long day of flying and the need to catch another flight at 10:30am, my relatives decided to take the shuttle back to LAX and wait;2
Clean place, but it's as if the hotel scrimped on wherever it could scrimp. Front desk also acts like they're being bothered if you ask them anything.;2
"The location of this hotel is amazing - right in front of Lincoln Center and walking distance form mid-town. However, this is pretty much where the good ends.  The hotel grounds in general, and the rooms in particular are old, run down, and in some cases just filthy. Much of the furniture in the rooms is worn out (see photos) or broken. Some of the towels I had in the room had holes; others had mold (see photos). The A/C and heating system is very noisy.  The gym equipment is old and has signs of rust.  This was the first and last time I will step foot in this hotel. If you need to stay in New York, look for another place.";2
This hotel is situated at a beautiful location, very close to Central Park, ballet en Symphony hall. Lobby and bar are nice, bit Art Deco-ish. Reception staff courteous. So far so good!  The elevators are very slow and take ages, the carpets in hallways and rooms are worn out and very smelly. On my floor there was a constant low level âalarm noiseâ, there were no clear emergency exit signs. The rooms are for NY an OK size, but were in need for an overhaul and a brush of paint around 20 years ago. The AC is from the 70-ties, made the noise of a large truck, which kept me from sleeping 2 nights. When I called maintenance their comment was âBut it is cooling right?â Showers: no water from shower head, only via leaks in hose. Windows have not been cleaned since AC was installed,;2
Watch out room price can be all  over the place and can be expensive.  Seems like every day of the month has a different price.    The extras like parking are expensive.  Our room was below grade and felt like a basement.  It was setup for handicap such that the shower flowed directly on the bathroom floor. Don't bring a car.  Cost to park is $30 per day extra.  Don't use valet parking, the cost is $18 just to park your car and another $18 to get it from valet parking.  Don't ask for assistance to bring up stuff to your room that costs $18 also.  It looks like the hotel contracts all services with contracting companies and has limited actual Hilton Employees.  Given the fixed costs from the contractors, there is little or no incentive to tip personnel.  The food service was;2

The beds are hard didnât have a good sleep. With parking We ended up paying $200 a night. Pretty pricy. The staff wasnât helpful at all.

Overall the Hotel is nice, but a few things did leave me with a poor impression. I had a small problem with the bathroom door in my room, the door did not stay shut or lock properly and the door itself had started to rot. Since I was traveling with a friend not having a functioning bathroom door was a bit awkward and embarrassing at times.  I was most surprised with how the staff handled the situation. No one I talked to seemed very helpful. When I was finally told the the problem would be taken care of, I was disappointed when nothing happened.  Overall, the hotel has very nice social areas, like the lobby and bar, but the guestrooms, hallways, and other floors seem to be neglected.;2

Comfortable and clean hotel with friendly staff. Functional room. Very conveninetly located for Times Square and mid-town Manhattan. We very much enjoyed our stay until check out day. We were presented with a service charge to cover (we were told internet access). At check in were told it would be a nominal fee. It turned out to be $30 per day plus tax. - That is not a nominal fee and I would have happily not used the hotel wifi if I new in advance it would be that expensive.  We weren't told by our travel agent about this and whilst it was mentioned when we booked in it wasn't explicit. It's shame because without this service charge - which I feel is sneaky, expensive and actually covers things I would normally expect to be included in the price of a room - this would be a five;2

The location is perfect for an upper west side stay. However the accommodations are less than average. The air conditioning in our room did not work. We mentioned it twice to the front desk. At check in there were four operating elevators at check out we got stuck in one of two that were then working,  The only bright spot here was the concierges knowledge of NYC and his excitement to make recommendations. His suggestions were excellent and easy to access.;2

I do not recommend this hotel,  It is very difficult to sleep, very noisy, bad carpet smell, very cold. I tried to change rooms but they were mostly the same. I was very tired after the three nights I spent here.;2
Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby was decent but outdated but possibly The nicest looking area of the whole hotel. The elevator and hallways are small and appear dirty and outdated. The hallways were hot but the room was cool thankfully from a window unit.  When we entered our room the blinds were dirty and rusty, the bed sheets looked slightly from what looked like mascara marks, the tv was not updated, the bathroom pipes made lots of noise but the bathroom was fairly clean and functional. The bath tub drain did not drain well. There was a blow dryer in the bathroom and the bed and pillows were comfortable.;2
This hotel has a fantastic location, is close to the theme park. We had major issues with the elevators, and ended up spending more than 10minutes waiting for elevators whenever you needed to use them. The quality of food on offer does not meet the standards offered by other Hilton facilities around the world (not tasty and Valerie's is lacking), in addition to this, breakfast is offered as a buffet is the middle of a walk way (which to me is a fire hazard as the passage becomes blocked with people). You are charged for parking, but the garage is always full (how can you charge for parking when there is no space). There have been multiple functions and these can chased areas to be closed off or not open.  If you take the above to the side, then the rooms are reasonable and;2
Decor is dark and feels heavy.  Not much energy.  The rooftop deck is a lap pool with tables and chairs.  Bathroom sink does not drain easily.  Beds are as hard as a rock, no top sheet. Staff is pleasant.;2
The hotel is located in the Upper West Side section of NYC. The hotel was very basic. The elevator was so tiny and so slow. It is best to just walk up the steps. The room and bathroom are both tiny. The hotel is accessible to the red line subway station (few blocks away). It is an OK hotel for a one night stay if you intend to be out and about all day/night. When I checked-in, the front desk staff gave me a room that was not even completely cleaned. I also requested if I can extend an hour for check out and they did not allow that. Wifi stalls at night when everyone is using it.;2

This is definitely a 2.5 star hotel. It looks fancy in the lobby with its closed bar but it's actually kind of falling apart and needs updating. Rooms are the same. Bed was pretty  comfy and bedding was nice. I think I could have went with a better hotel for the amount of money i spent. Just be aware of what your getting here. I wouldn't stay here again.;2

The TV remote did not work and we could not adjust the AC. The rooms were clean but a little old. The location, rooftop setup, and beds were top notch.The empire hotel could easily with a little bit of work, be a great hotel.;2
"I was enticed to pay more for this room than I normally would because of the rooftop bar and pool.  Unfortunately, the bar can apparently be closed to guests at anytime at ""the boss's"" discretion.  The pool was being ""maintenanced"" during my stay, so that was out as well.  The room was nice, despite the oddly designed half of a shower door that unavoidably results in water all over the bathroom floor.";2
Stayed at this hotel for 3 days in May 2014.  It was chosen due to proximity to the upper west side.  It was not cheap, as I guess, are most NY hotels.  Turned on TV to find out it was not working.  Called the front desk, they said the cable was being worked on.  How long has the cable been out??  Wifi barely worked.  The outside of hotel had scaffolding all around it, which looked like construction was going on.  Not too happy with my stay.;2

I thought the best aspect of this hotel was the location, less than a block away from the Metro Station. Also the continental breakfast was acceptable.  While the lobby and the lower levels were attractive, there were several problems with my stay. The elevator service was terrible. The elevator closest to my room rarely worked. The doors to the stairs were marked emergency exits, and indicated that alarms would go off, so I was stuck using the elevators.   My room was a bit dingy. Gum was stuck to the carpeting and the furniture looked very worn and stained. The bathroom was not clean. Hair and soap were stuck to the walls. The bathtub was clogged and the TV and remote did not work properly. The TV was a plasma screen and looked nice, including a keyboard that was supposedly;2
The hallway smelled like urine. The furnishing and carpet in the room desperately needs to be replaced. Elevator clanked in a scary way. Bar was completely overpriced. Only saving grace was the location.;2
I preface this review with the fact that I rarely leave any feedback, negative or positive.  Iâm a busy mother, wife and professional. I did however, feel compelled to write this review to warn others.    My younger son and I along with a friend and her nieces spent one night to visit Universal Studios.  We are So-Cal locals.   Check in was fine but unaccommodating for even HH members. No upgrades. No view rooms etc. Thats all fine. Note to all: In order to get a park view room you need to ask upon booking.  There is no concierge level at this hotel.  There are no upgrades upon check in. This is what I was told.   There is a small gift shop with just water and juice.  If you want a bottle of wine or proper snacks you will need to take an uber or drive out.  I would suggest;2
OMG $660 AU per night and we got absolutely nothing for this money apart from a bedroom  (2 double bed).  No breakfast, no water, no ice if you dont want to pay $5, I'm supposed to be gold Hilton Honours with my Amex Platinum, but because I booked thru hotels.com.they didnt let me use it. Movies $38.99 plus tax if you're that stupid.  Honestly the only good thing was our check in with Steve that we managed to get an early check in be in an extrav $25 US.

We booked the biggest suite they had and thought there was a mistake when we walked in. It was an incredibly small room. Incredibly small bathroom- literally only 1 person could stand in there at once. The âdoormanâ outside helped us into an Uber once out of the many times we left the hotel to go somewhere. Overall disappointed with the service and the size.;2
We stayed at this hotel because it was close to an event that we were attending and was recommended by the event planner.  We had major issues with our bathrooms.  We had 2 connecting rooms.  Room number 1 had ants in the bathroom and a toilet that would not flush.  Room number 2 also had a toilet that would not flush.  Called maintenance everyday we were the and the problem still persisted each day.  Happy to get out of there.  Water pressure is really low. Breakfast buffet was good, my son liked the choices.  Nice to have a place to get a quick coffee and snack in the am .  Location is cool next to the citywalk turned out to be useful for a quick dinner one night even though we did not visit universal studios. I wouldn't wait for shuttles as it is such a quick walk to;2
The hotel itself is nice and the employees are very helpfull. Though there are a lot of noises commimg from the streets since the windows are very thin. The pool is also much smaller than on the picture on the webside.;2
Stayed here after a couple of nights at the Club Quarters Boston and at the Hilton New York Fashion district.  In comparison this hotel is over priced, has tiny rooms with barely enough space to open a suitcase. The majority of the tiny amount of space provided was occupied with mini bar items. Everything in the room including basic tea and coffee is an additional charge and really adding insult to injury the WiFi comes at an extra fee as well.  At a time when trains, Starbucks and some public parks have free WiFi this really isn't acceptable at all. The hotel lobby looks nice enough, but the rooms themselves are rather in need of repair and refurbishment. Definitely not a 4 star establishment, generously a low 3. Would not recommend.;2

"This is not a cheap hotel. And after driving quite awhile to get there we discovered that there is no restaurant. Although the website had terrific reviews for their chef. You can order delivery from a local pizza joint. We were stuck walking to the ""Wendy's"" up the block and bringing back a burger. The common areas are beautifully appointed, but the room had peeling wallpaper and paint, there were dead bugs on the less than clean floors and the furniture was not functional. Nightstand lighting was only controlled from the light switch by the door and apparently the lights are on a timer as they continually turned off after an hour or so. The air conditioner is noisy and we were unable to turn it off. After spending $200 for the night, we expected more.";2
"The location was great, I'll give it that.  Right next to the subway, in a safe neighborhood.  But the hotel itself was very disappointing.  We didn't mind that the room was shabby - after all, it was inexpensive by NYC standards.

If the price is your main cocern you could probably do worse.;2

Staff was incredibly rude, the room was dark and dirty, and they don't provide shampoo and conditioner. They barely supplied us towels! When we arrived in the room (which 3 out of the 4 lights were out on the shaking ceiling fan light), there were no towels provided. A rude woman came to the door and handed us towels without saying a word. Speaking of the bathroom, ours was private and the ceiling was falling apart.  I work in retail and I understand that its not easy to keep up a smiling persona all the time, but the lady at the front desk was miserable. Aren't they there to make people feel welcome? She barely gave us mind when we checked in.   Thankfully it was one night that my boyfriend and I stayed before we went to our other hotel (Belnord). The difference in service was;2
I understand that it's in NYC, but the room that we stayed in was tiny, expensive and not that clean. We called ahead of time to make sure we were going to have the right number of beds, but when we arrived we were shorted one.;2
"We have previously stayed here, and it was always 3-4 stars.   It has taken a decided downhill turn.   They charge for EVERYTHING!  Want early check in?  $50.   Late check out?  Same.  Or a 'deal' at $75 for both.  What happened to accommodating a customer?   Our room online was NOTHING like our actual room.   It was a tiny box, with stained walls, cracked tiles in the bathroom, burn marks on the furniture- generally, a run down flop house.  The hallway carpets were held together with strips of duct tape.   DO NOT order ""room service""!  It comes from the diner attached to the hotel, and it is dreadful.   Cold by the time it arrives, the burgers were a burger in that they were shaped like one....but tasted like some non-meat byproduct with soggy old french fries on the side";2

"Positives: (1) Location if Penn Station is important (2) great little breakfast diner in the Tick Tock (3) art deco if you are into that. Negatives: (1) the day that I was there all reservation systems were down and they could not check in guests until in my case after 6 pm. It was sheer chaos with lines of 50 plus people. Apparently no redundancy in their systems. I had traveled 1500 miles and had a dinner meeting lined up at 6. So that eliminated any opportunity to get into the room. From observation, it seems like the check in process is repeatedly in chaos. (2) they hit you with a $40 per night ""resort fee"" which buys you exactly nothing except access to a fitness facility that is just poor. In my view it just seems like a way to inflate the room rates without being up front";2
Our first impression was awesome but....... upon entering the room it smelled VERY musty and damp:(.  A luxury hotel at $340 a night  plus $45 a night parking fee should not smell like a mossy rainforest!  We took that in strides but getting into bed that night we found the beds hard and the pillows like wafers:(  We have stayed in hotels at $100 per night that were 20 times better! We woke up to absolutely NO hot water which made getting ready to hit the park very unenjoyable.  Again.... a luxury hotel?  We ended up not being able to shower that morning and water was still not hot in the afternoon either.  We complained to the front desk and got a voucher for a free breakfast..... this sounded great at first but...... we get to breakfast to find we only got muffins and fruit;2
Hotel room was comfortable and spacious but didn't make up for the poor water pressure that brought visions of shower under a sprinkler system. Bathroom sink was poorly designed without proper drainage so was not a pretty sight by the end of our 4 night stay. Hotel towels were worn, stained so we had to request additional towels multiple times. Overall, not a place I would recommend or plan for in the future.;2
Wasnt that impressed with the room..   Pros: -Beautiful Lounge -Great Staff -Decent location  Cons: -Very small rooms -Our glass sliding door shower didn't have the door on it. -Thin walls. Heard some interesting noises.  Bottom line, don't stay here unless you have to. Just visit the lounge area but bring plenty of money. Super expensive.;2
When looking at the pictures on Expedia or the hotelâs own website, the hotel looks really nice and almost luxurious but do NOT expect this. First of all, the room was old and in bad shape (See the pictures). Then the cold water wasnât working so the water was boiling hot and it started to leak under the sink. We told the receptionist this and he said someone would come within an hour and take care of it. When we came back to the hotel several hours later in the evening, nobody had been there. Then we talked to the receptionist the next day and finally it was fixed.  Also, the old hairdryer wasnât working and sometimes the light wasnât working. All in all, everything was just old, worn, and could use a renovation.  Next time I would also pick another location as there were a lot;2

Bathroom floor could stand a good scrubbing.Bath mats were only available ""on request"". Front desk staff were friendly and responsive to problems other than Cable. A gentleman we met on the elevator said cable had been out for most of 4 months he had been staying there.  Positives were proximity to subway , restaurants, deli on corner & family on UWS .

The service was just as bad, if not worse, they failed to mention a cover charge of 100$ when you check in (claims it will be returned in a few days) and the lady did not keep track of what she was doing, like she failed to give us the key and didn't remember if we signed a reciept.

On arrival I thought it was a retro Art Deco hotel but quickly realised it just hasn't been modernised.   It was clean although the hall to level 2 where we were absolutely stank, a kind of weird old musky smell. The room equally stank but you quickly don't notice it.  The room is clean, good shower room. The balcony is overlooked by everybody in a tiny courtyard so you can't sunbathe and also you hear everybody's phone calls etc really loud.  The fountain in the courtyard is turned on all night long so you can hear it all the time.  The bed sheets looked clean but stank of mens BO. I didn't notice until the first night. I didn't say anything because I was sure they'd be changed but no. This went on the entire holiday, too afraid to complain I put up with the smell.  Breakfast;2

"I always try to see the best in everything, unfortunately for the first time; I couldnât find that redeeming quality for the Empire Hotel.

When you enter The Empire Lobby you will be amazed by its magnificence, however donât be fooled! I tis well done to attract your attention, perhaps to hide what is yet to be found when you are heading to your room.  We checked in on AUG 25th with our stay until AUG 30th, 2015.

Driving north on Vermont from 101 the neighborhood looks seedy. Driving north on Vermont from the hotel to Griffith Park the neighborhood looks swank.  Stayed with free stay certificates but still had to pay $49 taxes for two nights. Taxed on nothing. Sigh.  Anyway, the rooms are newly painted as you will smell as soon as you enter. Due to the fumes we slept with the balcony door open and boobytrapped. The people in the room next door did the same.  The beds are comfortable and beautifully dressed. The closet was a contrived slit in the wall that held the ironing board and iron comfortably. Hey, it's an old hotel.  The bathroom had a tub with adjustable showerhead and good water pressure. Everything was clean.  The breakfast room is large and nicely decorated. Croissant;2
Paid $2400 for a room with a view for 7 nights and although I got a nice view the room was not clean and it was old. Dust everywhere, filthy towels and dated room. And only one small window 1 meter. It felt like a dungeon. Small room, not big enough for a family of four. Beds are almost singles (130-140).  Half of elevators not working so it takes around 15 min to get down to lobby in the morning.   Cons -not fresh room -small beds (those are not double beds, the size was 140cm)  -not fresh bathroom and super small. Hardly fit 1 person inside. The toilet is next to the door and the door opens inside. -shady area, unfortunately the area has a lot of junkies, homeless and mental ill people. Not recommended for families. -the elevator sounded all night (our room was next to it);2
Upon entering the room you could tell it was in need of repair.  The toilet handle was broken and the towel rack was falling off the wall.  Additionally because my fllor was below the lobby, it would take 10 to 15 minutes to catch the elevator.   While the staff was friendly,;2

Other than the location close to Madison Square Garden this hotel fall far short of any reasonable expectations. The property is beyond tired - itâs not being maintained. In my room there was water damage on the ceiling, cracks in the walls, mismatched tiles in the bathroom floor, mold in the shower and the tv didnât work. I called about the tv and no one ever came. Maybe thereâs hope - thereâs a surprise $29 facility fee tacked onto the bill, as part of the incidentals charged to the room. Maybe the hotel operator is using that as a funding source for the badly required renovations. Until thatâs completed Iâm going to stay away.;2

Hotel seems nice but once in the room the true colors show. Rooms are dark, even with every light on. Rooms are dirty. Maids only (hopefully) give new towels and hardly make the bed. They don't vacuum the room at all, dust bunnies all over the floor and under the bed. Walls are thin you hear everything and everyone, and yes you will hear other people being intimate. When a neighbor turns on their shower or flushes their toilet you think someone was in your bathroom. Another issue is the WiFi has connection issues and was spotty at best. The only convenience for this hotel is the 7-10 minute walk to Universal Studios, but there really is not dedicated path to the main street expecially at night where there is hardly any lighting and people flying up and down the hotel driveway.;2
Web site does not say anything about the $100 flat rate pet fee (when the rooms are $104 a night), does tell you that there is a $25 per night per dog fee, Staff do not know the rules around service animals, They ask for proof of service animal, instead of asking what your animal is trained to do. Lobby is lovely looking, but once in the room you will see a difference. Wall paper coming off the walls, grout coming off the tiles, no shower door and window lets in the cold and all the noise from outside. Check out was easy and the door staff are great, nice and friendly and willing to help. Check in staff can be very short with the customer and this does not give you a nice welcome to the hotel, First and last time I will stay there.;2

We booked this hotel the day before checking in as we were staying in LA for 6 days. When we arrived the rooms were jaded but clean however after a long drive we asked if the bar/restaurant were open? We were told they were not as the bar manager was on vacation!! When I expressed our disappointment and how this was an inconvenience as my father who was with us was disabled so this was why we chose the hotel, we were informed they were only informed themselves via email and there was nothing they could do about it. When I asked to speak to the manager was told he was not in there was no one senior available and even if they rang him he would not answer his phone as he never did! I was annoyed that none of this was mentioned when I made the booking only the day before and they;2
Stayed here in July for 10 days as part of a booking made via the internet which meant I couldn't cancel my stay once it started.  The location is great, the atmoshphere is cool, rooms very modern.  However, the entire focus of the hotel is the bar on the roof.  I stayed on the 9th floor, and the music was so loud the water in my glass was shaking.  I complained each night as well as in the morning.  The staff were very nice to talk with and explained how they can't control the volume of the music as the bar is not owned by the hotel.  There is a a huge line which goes around the hotel to get into the plush bar.  This crowd is very young and loud.  You will almost have to push your way through the line to get into the hotel at night.  Spoke with the daytime manager who simply;2

Got a private âdeluxeâ double room but there was nothing deluxe about it. Iâm not a snob in any way, but I was expecting at least a bed, not a mattress placed on a wooden base. The room was no more than 10 square meters big, so itâs good for bonding with your partner. You can hear absolutely everything through the paper thin walls, so you can bond with guests in other rooms as well. The place is a 4-minute walk from Hammersmith underground station, a Tesco and loads of great restaurants. If you need a place to just spend the night, thatâs the accommodation for you.;2

This hotel is a perfect example of FALSE ADVERTISING at its best.  It even has its own extremely lame website that absolutely misleads potential customers.  First and foremost, the surrounding area is an absolute dump and I did not feel safe - day or night - walking around the general vicinity of this hotel - even to get my car from the ghetto self park area in the back of the hotel.  Second - The hotel is very old and is in disrepair. Do not go to this hotel expecting to be in the glamorous surroundings of Hollywood. I had never been to Hollywood or Beverly Hills before and I was expecting a lot more from this place. Booking this hotel means you are staying in a ghetto of Los Angeles.

We got charged a facility fee for each person when we arrived which was not mentioned upon booking.  I had extra charges on my CC that I am still working to resolve.  Would not stay here again.;2

Disappointed. Arrived to be told that what we booked we could not have. No twin beds available despite being told there would be. Double would have to do. Told they would come back in two days to advise. They didnt bother. Windows need a good clean, but generally clean. Shower curtain stank terribly due to poor ventilation. Rest was average.;2

Booked and paid in full ahead of travel directly with the hotel an executive double double with a view. Room not ready on arrival which was fine as we were early, charged $5 per suitcase to store them, not impressed with that, rooms in NYC are expensive so to charge extra for storing luggage is outrageous.  Was allocated a room on 31st floor, not executive and so small you couldnât swing a mouse in there let alone a cat. Tiny window in corner of room, certainly not a view. Back to reception and told them the room was not acceptable as not what we had booked and paid for. We were given a room in 18th floor which was an executive and did have a view...but only 1 double bed. Back to reception for 3rd time, by this time I had steam coming out of my ears.

"I'll start with the positives - pretty hotel exterior & lobby, fairly spacious rooms and the guys at the hotel entrance were helpful and friendly.  The staff at reception were not.  They were miserable, unhelpful & put out when approached.  On checking out, the dark haired guy on reception in the morning addressed me with ""yes?"" No good morning, hello, nothing! He rushed through the check out process as if to rush me out of the door.  Very rude!  During our 7 day visit, we were never provided with tea, coffee or cups.  We had to chase housekeeping around the hotel in the mornings for them.    Aside from the above, parking is extortionate for guests.";2

I'm currently staying at the Astor hotel, I didn't expect much for $200 in NYC but compared to the Shelbourne on Lexington at $280 a night. This was a bit of a rip off. Very Average locations. It's fair way away from most things. Rooms are tiny and poorly maintained. Air conditioning, bathroom fan sounded like a jet engine. Rooms air was stuffy and it was Cold outside, couldn't sleep with AC on coz too loud. Room had no remote for tv. No globe for side lamp. Bed was uncomfortable. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything your neighbour rooms are saying. For the positives the hotel staff have been very friendly so far. Rooms are clean and safe. Close to a subway. Close to Central Park. This hotel would be good value for $100-$120 USD per night.;2
Our room was very small very damp, not well ventilated. When we ask to change room, they said it would be extra cost. internet was not working in the room. We couldnt even reach the front desk about the internet issue. The pool was not open at the time they said it would be open. So overall it was poor service but great location!;2
"As a business traveler and trade show planner I have had the best and worst. We booked 26 room nights in the hotel for a trade show March 24 through March 28, 2003. This place rates right at the bottom in terms of customer service and good old fashioned hospitality. The staff was less than courteous and the facilities were lacking quite a bit of the ammenities offered by even the most budget minded chains. No newspapers, telephone and dial-up rates that would balance the national debt, and a snotty barman that refused to allow us to watch the tv in the bar unless we paid 30 bucks to make it ""worth his time"". If you only want a cheap room with secure access, book the discount rate at any of the travel discount sites then settle back and prepare to be completely frustrated by the";2
We arrived at 12:30 on 6/29 and checked in knowing that the room would probably not be ready for us since it was before 3pm. The front desk person said she'd put us on the rush housekeeping list and would call us when our room was ready.  We didn't receive a call so we waited in line again at 3 pm to attempt to check in.  The front desk person said our room was not ready, but would be in 15 minutes.  We tried again at 4 pm and were told it was not yet ready.  We tried again at 5:30 and was again told the room was not ready.  They said one more hour and gave us a temporary room. We checked back at 6:45 pm and were told the room would be ready at 7:30 pm. When we checked at 7:30, the room was not yet ready but it would be ready at 7:30.  At 7:30 pm, Luis at the front desk said;2

Location is a gem. Only 3 minutes walk from the underground and bus stations, shops and cafes. 15 minutes underground ride to Piccadilly. Staff unfriendly, no welcome whatsoever. Wifi 1Â£ for 1hour. We have stayed in 2 beds room, with refrigerator, plates, cups, forks, knives and spoons. Kitchen and facilities are shared-lots of kitchens (with microwave, toaster and coffee machine) on each floor but not all of them had working devices. They do clean every day, change bed lining every second day. Also, the walls are very thin so it can be very loud in the night.  Hostel is cheaper than some in the same range  and I would say 'good value for the money' but it's just not - staff should be much nicer, and it is only cheap because things are old or broken, and of poor quality.;2

Having used this site prior to booking the hotel I wasn't expecting a huge amount - although neither was I expecting what I found.Personally, I won't be staying at the hotel again, on the day I was checking out, I discovered I hadn't been in the room alone, and noticed cockroaches on the floor. Other negative points for the hotel, small lifts, you can hear everything that's happening outside in the street (although I was only on the first floor), there were also cigarette burns in my bedding (odd for a non smoking room!?), the curtains and blinds were is desperate need of cleaning. Other than the cockroaches, all small things I know.If you are staying at the hotel - the subway (96th street) is located less than 60 seconds away, (1,2,3,9) and it's only two stops on the express;2
I stayed here last spring and had a bad experience (see prior review). a manager reached out to offer me a free night to reevaluate. When i attempted to redeem, managers had changed and the new manager didnt get back to me(after her initial response). I wrote a review concerning this response and was contacted again. They wouldnt honor the free night (despite having the correspondance agreed to refund me a portion of my original reservation), but agreed to refund me part of my initial room ( a percentage) and to reach out for an exclusive deal/upgrade on a future visit (in exchange for removing the 2nd review) I reached out last week (in our email chain) and was quoted a price that was at least $40 per night higher than the published rates (never mind what they would be direct;2
Moderately shabby lobby and rooms.  Lackadaisical service.  Many things not working properly: light bulbs, plumbing, windows, elevators.

We booked for a week, left after 2 nights and never looked back.;2

I usually don't write reviews but feel compelled to share the lousy experience that many travellers would not expect from a hotel under Wyndham, let alone in an iconic hotel like the New Yorker. To get started, I've stayed there for about 5 days with a baby.   I came back one night to find that my little travelling kettle that I use for making hot water for the baby's milk missing. Couldn't find it after ransacking the entire family room. Now imagine doing that with the baby crying for his milk! When I called the front desk they aren't sure what happened and reckoned that it could be taken by one of their staff. Only after a few phone calls that they deduced it could be taken by their security team but couldn't confirm as 'the team is off duty'. What comes next takes the ante -;2

For the last several years I've come to this particular Days Inn off of Broadway and have had quality visits. However, sadly, I can no longer say that  We decided to book in advance two short stays at the Days Inn on Broadway. First, for those interested, I will state the positives of this hotel.  The beds have always been clean and comfortable, and I've been able to take a nice hot shower with no issues. The staff understands that the hotel is very old and has issues that it can only manage. I found the majority of the staff to be helpful and courteous. The location is excellent as there are many fine restaurants in the general area, the subway station is right around the corner, and you are only a 10-minute walk from Central Park on a good day.  However, my last stay proved by;2

"The Jane has historic significance both as a rooming house for sailors and as the gathering place for survivors of the Titanic, so it held a lot of interest for me. The architecture and atmosphere are, indeed, striking but the handsome bar and dining areas are not open to hotel guests; they were reserved for private parties. Despite the very good location and seemingly low price for a NY hotel, I would not go back. I checked out after one night although I had reserved for three.   Keep in mind that the rooms were designed for sailors who are used to tiny quarters. For me, the room was dark and claustrophobic. (I couldn't see well enough inside it to tell if the room was clean.) When a friend visited, only one of us could stand up at a time; the other had to sit on the bed. One,";2

Some little things that just made me really irritated at this hotel.   #1 A telemarking call from the hotel to my voicemail box on my room phone, this is tacky as crap.  #2 Breakfast was not good at all and the service sucked #3 Slow elevators (they have been saying they are modernizing them for some time)  #4 The added rules on the back of the vouchers given to me as a diamond member.

Went purely on some reviews I had read and pictures... And all I can say is other than the location this is simply a roof for the night nothing special at all!! Hotel lobby is beautiful...

We knew what we were getting to when we booked this place. It was the only place throughout our travels where we had to stay somewhere without an ensuite bathroom. New york was just too expensive, nowhere else was affordable. So i knew that I was getting nothing for my money. I was almost pleasantly surprised to see that the room was clean enough, although I wore flip flops all the time as the floor was questionable. But as long as the bed was clean I didn't mind. The sink was also fairly clean. However, the communal bathrooms/showers were pretty grim. I also wore my flip flops the whole time in there, including in the shower, and just basically tried not to touch the sides. I struggled to get the water to heat up as well, which was an issue, but it eventually got to a bearable;2
"Our trip was interesting when concerning the hotel... Here's my story.... I'll try to make it short and sweet...

I was about to buy air mattress (which most likely wouldn't fit in room anyhow but we were desperate), and the manager got back to me very pleasantly and Finally ""gave"" me a room after I explained the situation. I'm still confused bc the front staff told me I had no other option and rooms were sold out anyway... So don't take their word for it, they tried to shut me up with drink vouchers. Not very helpful, manager was helpful though.   The overall";2
Stayed for 3 nights last week. First off the good points. Hotel central and within walking distance of Penn Station, Macy's, Empire State Building, Times Square and a decent walk to Central Park. Bad Points. On checking in we where given the key cards to a room on the 28th floor (2821), to say we where disappointed would be an under statement. It was the smallest room we have ever stayed in and would have been small for just 1 person with a single bed. It was so small that I had to lift our case over the bed to get it in the wardrobe (see photo). On complaining to reception we where offered a room on the 25th floor for the 2nd and 3rd nights provided we payed an upgrade which we did. This was an improvement but as with the first room it looked as though they needed a fresh coat;2
Very overrated hotel. Staff were USELESS, rude and so dumb! Doormen were great. Location was the only good thing, rooms we're very rundown (wallpaper falling off, ripped bed sheets etc) we had to move rooms coz of the idiots that work there and both rooms were overdue for a makeover.;2
The parking attendants are aggressive and Rude.  Yes, the parking is run by someone else but they do tell you to park there for self parking.  If you tell your guests to park there, you need to take some responsibility to not have guests frightened before they even check in!;2
I hated this hotel. No drawers to unpack, very few hangers, no luggage rack, tiny bedside tables & had to use floor, lack of furniture. They was space to add furniture with drawers but none. No working phone in room. They said no phone for added security!! Stupid as the reverse is true. It would have taken very little money for thrm to make the room more user friendly & convenient. I was so unhappy here that I canceled my next reservation in Edinburgh & booked elsewhere. Room is ok for overnight but not longer. Will never book Premier again;2
We were greeted about seven times before we actually were off to our room.  From the staff opening the door to your vehicle, bell staff, concierge staff, front desk staff, and staff that was just standing around, all were more than friendly to welcome you to the hotel.  While it's hard to fault this, it was a bit overwhelming and tiring.  Then we stepped into the room and we could see the hotel focuses on service instead of room quality.  The carpet in the room was worn thru to the pad in several spots.  Several dark blotches in other spots.  It just gave an impression of uncleanliness not typically found in a four diamond hotel.  No air was flowing in the west facing room which had its drapes open in the sun on a 80+ degree day.  It was hot!!!  It took 4 hours before the room;2
I didn't expect this hotel to be anything great, but I also did not expect it to be so awful. I knew there would be no room service, which was fine. Upon walking in, everything appeared ok- no obvious dirt or mold, clean towels laid out, clean bathroom. However, after sleeping there one night and seeing the blanket held up to one of the windows, I noticed there was mold growing inside the blanket, undetected until you hold it to the light! Immediately I FREAKED out and brought my own blanket to the room. Later that day I began to feel ill. I now have a terrible, awful cold and I can chalk it up to the room not being cleaned thoroughly. The location is great, right by the subway, and there were some good restaurants in the area. Unfortunately I felt so ill that I went home a day;2

Stayed at the Empire for couple nights. The location is fantastic. Great restaurants, close to subway, central park, walking distance to the theater district. More importantly, not a loud noisy place to sit down and meet people for a conversation. Very nondescript.  But now for the negatives: There was no hot water for shower on the morning on June 28th.  I had to go to business meetings without having showered. Disgusting feeling. Yikes. Plus it was hot and  humid in NYC and felt miserable all day. Also, I had to check out on the same day so had no time to wait around for them to fix the problem. When you check in make sure to ask if there is running hot water. Ask them if it was broken anytime recently.  If they answer affirmative, stay there at your own peril. Having said all;2

My friend and I had to get a room here last minute when our other accomadations fell through. It's cash only. We got a room with two single beds and a mini fridge. We are two young women and felt really uncomfortable walking though the dark building at night. There were men staring at us from one of the fire exits. We heard someone say hello to us from a dark hallway but couldn't see them and ran away. It creeped us out. The building didn't feel safe. We pushed the mini fridge up against the door before we went to sleep and wouldnt go to the bathroom alone. We tried to use kitchens on two different floors. Both were dark when we walked in and as we turned on the lights we saw cockroaches scurry away. The unisex bathroom on our floor had 3 stalls and none had toilet paper. The;2

The location of this property is great and that is what you are paying for.   We arrived at approximately 6 pm and checked in. The room we reserved was not what we got and were told there were no other rooms.  Ok fine when we went up to the room the room had not even been cleaned from the previous night.   Once that was taken care of we found old expired items in the mini bar / refrigerator which we had to move just to put our own water in.   Had to call for extra towels no big deal but it took over an hour to get them.   When I complained at check out that I wasn't happy with not getting the room I paid for I was basically told too bad. A follow up email to corporate resulted in nothing.   An I'm sorry would have been nice.   Rooms are very small even for NYC.;2
Our room was quite run-down and the air conditioning was so loud we couldn't talk over it, let alone sleep. However, once we notified the front desk they did fix it. The hotel wasn't cheap by my standards but I guess in NY this was a low-end stay. The bathroom was so tiny and cramped. On top of that, the shuttle service they offer to get me to the airport caused me to miss my flight. They recommended an hour and a half travel time so I doubled that and reserved a shuttle that left three hours before my flight and the shuttle driver was a disaster.

Travelling from UK and arriving at 5pm for a two night stay, we were told that only one of the adjoining rooms we had pre booked was ready. The other could be ready soemtime upto 11pm. SInce we were tired, needed to relax and had a child with us, this was not a option we could consider! We we not offered a solution and had to ask for other options of other close by rooms. We were eventually put on another floor with rooms around the corner. No milk in room for tea or coffee and was requested twice, but it never appeared. Really loud air con, which could be turned down, but since the workings were inside a concealed part at the end, I didn't discover that until the second night.

Our room (539) at the Empire was small as many NYC Hotels rooms are and was clean and updated.  The hotel's forte is its convenience to Lincoln Center.  Unfortunately there is a HVAC chase or large hot water pipe behind the wall in the corner of the room that transfers such a great amount of heat to the room, even thought I had the room air conditioner on full blast all night, the   room still stayed at what seemed to be over 80 degrees - much too hot for a good nights sleep.

Glad we only stayed one night in the hotel - it was horrible! The room was barely big enough for the double bed and it was dingy and dark. No free wifi in the room but if you are desperate you can perch on the stairs and get free wifi in the lobby. The bed was comfortable enough and it was clean but absolutely nothing to redeem it - no tea and coffee making facilities and miles from any decent cafes or restaurants. The air-conditioning unit was as noisy as all hell and not terribly efficient.  Never again..;2

For starters the clerk on site the day of our arrival was super rude, unhelpful and definitely not willing to work with us, his name PASQUALLE!  Thank God for the girl working along with him, sorry her name escapes me, she helped us with our check-in process and we were able to go to our room after a very long day.  However, when we got to the room, it was extremely hot for which I tried to turn on the A/C, but it was super old and not working. Also, the roof top which is their landmark, was closed, and the girl attending was also very rude and snooty. Bottom line not a very nice experience. Hopefully you'll improve the bed-side manners of your staff.;2
The New Yorker is perfectly situated for those arriving or departing out of Penn Station as it is a short block away. It is also conveniently located to Times Square and other major sites. The hotel staff is professional, polite, and helpful. You can tell they do their utmost best to make an aging property like this one shine. Unfortunately, once you get past the lovely lobby, the hotel is a scary mess. Hallways are straight out of a horror movie. Rooms are tiny (though this is typical in NYC) and rather dingy and dark. Won't be booking here again.;2

Location is a strong point with this hotel. Otherwise I would go somewhere else. Beware the taxi scam. (see below)  I think I stayed here about 10 years ago and absolutely nothing appears to have changed. Same 15 year old TV in the room, same knackered discount decor in the restaurant and bar. Same carpets. Not sure if the place has even been painted in the last 10 years.  We got off on a bad footing. Having booked months ago as non-smokers we got a smoking room which they couldn't change until the next day. The smoking room was foul. Stinky bedding, smelly sheets. Poor quality shower. No minibar in the room.  This is not a cheap hotel remember.   Buffet meals are reasonable quality but have that slightly metallic taste common to mass prepared food in cheaper hotels.  Our second;2
We picked the hotel partly due to its location.  The hotel is located within walking distance to Vermont/Sunset metro stations, which was very convenient since we didn't want to have drive every day. The parking fee, at $25 dollars a day for self-parking, while high, seemed reasonable compared to other LA hotels.   As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we noticed they were undergoing renovations. The front desk assured us it wouldn't be a problem. However, when we got to our room, we noticed that it was practically in the middle of the renovations. The room itself was bigger than we expected, but the amenities were quite lacking. The A/C was very loud and some appliances in the room didn't work.  We also had a lot of trouble sleeping. The fact that the walls to the rooms are paper;2

I've stayed at several boutique hotels in NYC, some with rooms smaller than these.  The lobby lounge was quite nice and chic, but never, until this hotel have I ever had the feeling that I couldn't wait to leave the room 10 seconds after entering..  Dark, dingy rooms.  Very unfriendly staff.  Disfunctional elevators. The rooftop was actually quite nice, even with the tiny pool, but food and drinks were an issue there.  No food (wouldnt make food, wouldn't  allow room service nor food to be brought in, after advertising about having food avail up there) and then being charged $80 for 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine (which you might expect in a much more upscale place) we decided to cut our losses and leave for a happier place a few hours after we arrived.

- There was a smoky smell in the room. They need to start telling people this is a non-smoking facility when they check-in (they didn't say anything to me).  - The room was way hot during the day. There's no way to adjust the room temperature manually other than opening the window or turning on the fan.    - People next door tend to leave their TV on until 4 or 5 in the morning. You absolutely need ear plugs to be able to sleep.   - There is no hair dryer in the room. Only shared bathrooms have hair-dryers. Other hotels with shared bathrooms include a hair-dryer in every room.  - There is no sink in the room. You have to go brush your teeth in the shared bathroom. Again, other places with shared bathrooms do have sink in the rooms.  - The elevator doesn't work.;2
"Fortunately we had read the negative reviews on this property so we were well prepared for it.  Because of meetings in the Lincoln Centre area and the fact that we were in NY for one night only, we were determined to tough it out.   Room wasn't ready in spite of early check in request.  Supposedly a ""double upgraded"" room when it was finally ready.  Tiny, poorly designed, a desk/bar with various over priced drinks and snacks. Not a glass to be found, not even in the impossibly tiny bathroom.  Reaching anyone on the phone, whether room service or the front desk or the operator is a test of your patience as no-one seems to be there.   When I finally reached someone and requested 2 glasses, I was told it was hotel policy not to provide glasses as they are a ""safety hazard""!";2
The Hilton really!! We paid more than $400 AUD to stay in this hotel but the brand, it appears, has fallen apart.  We originally were checked into a room next to the laundry. We complained about the loud humming noise and banging at 10.15pm, a maintenance guy came and said to wait till 11pm....we were tired and waited till 11.10pm. The humming sound had stopped but the banging continued. We called guest services again and they apologised for the noise of the lift, we must have been under the lift shaft. We were relocated and pulled out the sofa bed for our 11 year old son, but it was a thin old wire mattress, when you laid on it you could feel the wire spirals. We were moved again to proper beds but not what we booked. They gave us a free breakfast for our troubles, don't get;2
"Stayed her for an event in London with some friends. Upon arrival in the room, we noticed an awful smell that was like something decomposing in the room, causing us to get out spray to make it some what bearable. The first night was bad, we were accused of being loud ten mins before we were going to bed, only for the accuser to be loud and the night receptionist to bang on every door down the hall as well; not mention he was creepy which for female travellers is unsettling. The second night wasn't any better, as the room to the left of us, 333, I believe were loud, with banging on god knows what. Would have reported this but the receptionist didn't appear to understand us when we asked basic questions about amenities such as wifi; by the way they charge Â£1 per hour of usage.";2
Huge lobby that tends to be over crowded due to the immense amount of people that the hotel can host. We stayed in a double bedroom, on the 21st floor, very very small without fridge, cold due to bad windows that can't keep the wind out and as a result it becomes cold over night. As we got in to the room we noticed it is not properly cleaned, it is dusty and not hoovered. The airco works fine but is loud. The shower drips constantly which can be irritating over night when one wants to sleep. Plastic glasses and no bottle opener, no fridge too but there is no place for it as room is too small. Decoration is out dated and dark, maybe to prevent from seeing how dirty it can get. Housekeeping is not very efficient. Room had a safe, it's own ironing board and iron, which i could say;2
Basic room was not bad size for NY for a couple. Small but enough to move about in. Condition of the decor in the room - curtains, blinds, furniture, lamps, bed surrounds was appalling. It looked like it had been moved from a room that was being done up and was covered in bits of paint or was ripped, worn out, or had chunks missing out of it. I know people say you're only sleeping in a hotel, but frankly, I was embarrassed to leave my parents in the state of the room, and at more than $250 a night I'd expect the room to be properly cleaned. Check in with the person on the front desk was the most ignorant experience I've ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world. Poor experience on the whole which is a shame as the location, and promise of the decor/style of the hotel promise so;2

"My family and I stayed at Empire Hotel October 19 and 20.  Four of us were put in a room that felt like we were in the basement with two double beds.  A/C was not functioning properly and humid in the room.  Cons: Dirty, old and tiny. Pros: Good Location  Everything is extra at this hotel.  No free wifi.  The beds are double beds not queen size.  The bathroom had zero counter space and not enough room to set clothes on a clean dry surface to change clothes.  Lots of mold around the shower.  And we got the ""Courtyard view"" Lol!  My kids begged Never again.  I'm from NY so I realize things are small and old, but this hotel room was gross and falling apart.";2
This hotel was expensive and was more like a dirty hostel than a hotel with very small rooms.  The location was good right in the heart of Chinatown and close to the subway and the bed was comfortable, but the hotel was dirty, we had a lightbulb burned out that management couldn't fix for days, the tv hardly got any channels and no HBO which they claimed they had.  The tv remote didn't work, but mgmt. was able to give us batteries, so at least that problem got solved.  The room had a lot of noise from the street and we kept smelling smoke, probably also coming from the street.  The Wifi either didn't work at all or was a weak undependable signal.  The hotel manager or whatever he was, pretended not to understand us anytime we complained or asked for help.  We overall feel we;2
I booked my room using the Hyatt app, and a few days later, when I checked my booking on the app, I was offered an upgrade to a suite room with one king bed and a living room. I took the upgrade thinking I would have the same experience as the Grand Hyatt SFO airport location. But to my dismay. It was not a great experience. Check-in at the Front desk was good. I was offered bottled water. After we were given our keys, we went to our room on the 12th floor. Room 1237 is close to the elevator. When I opened the door, it smelled like someone was smoking inside the room, and it didn't smell nice. It seemed that the hotel room was not been thoroughly cleaned for a while. The room had a musty odor too. The amenities inside the upgraded room compared to the upgraded room I had at the;2
Room was spacious, quiet and clean (although infamous towel stains showed up). Breakfasts always had good selection - staff was generably reasonable but was like pulling teeth after some clothes were left behind by accident. 2 HUGE negatives were the price of parking and the brutally expensive and horrible internet service. There is so much selection in LA - miss this one;2
If you have booked here to stay or are going to book to stay here, then cancel/look elsewhere! The only good thing about this place is how close it is to the subway (to get around). The rooms are terrible, tv reception doesn't work (I know your not there to watch tv, but it's good to watch to fall asleep) the service is horrible. Air con keeps you up all night. Elevators are the most painful part. So slow. Often waited 10+mins to go up 6 floors!!  My partner and I have stayed here near on 2 weeks. I asked if the day we leave if we could stay an extra 2 hours past check out. The reception lady said no because we will charge you a full night. I totally understand that at some times it is impossible. But we stayed here for 2 weeks! And was only asking for another 2 hours.;2
There were pros and cons to this hotel. The pros were it's proximity to Universal Studios. It's a 5 min walk so even though there's a shuttle bus provided, after the first day we found it was just as quick to walk. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy. And there's a small Starbucks in the hotel.   The cons were that the check in staff didn't give a very warm welcome, and I felt like we received worse service because we were obviously tourists and not business customers. It also took a long time to check in and it was a long walk from the car park to the desk and rooms. The hotel is mostly carpented in public areas and it was really difficult to wheel our luggage across the thick carpet. Parking costs 25 dollars per night which soon adds up.  The room was clean enough;2
Well, if you are a rude traveler, this hotel could seems an acceptable place to you. If you are such a person that only books 4 or upper stars hotels, this one could means a terrible experience to you. Points in favor: It's near from everywhere in Manhattan island It's the cheapest hotel in the island You have shared bathroom, maybe as accident you can know such a beauty girl with few clothes. Points against: It smells from the main door to anywhere inside. It's not a vomit smells, but means that it has not a good cleaning and ventilation. As Argentinean, I could say that it's extremely expensive. In Argentina, with 100 bucks you can book a real good hotel, maybe 5 stars. But considering that it's in Manhattan maybe riverside studios worth it. Shared bathroom, there's not to;2

"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights; 3 of the hottest nights in NYC so far this summer.  The A/C is old and did not work! Room was humid and musty-smelling. Upon checking in, hotel computer was ""down"" and it was 3 hours before we could check in. Hotel outdated, dark decor and dirty. Room carpets are filthy, pubic hair on bathroom floor and sheets on bed dirty.  Apparently, prior to our checking into our room, the wall was painted. No one bothered to put a ""wet paint"" sign anywhere, and my fiancÃ© got paint on two of his slacks! Although the management did give us two drink vouchers and breakfast buffet vouchers, I didn't feel that was enough to compensate for ruining two pairs of slacks. Rooftop pool very small, and rooftop bar loud and a very young crowd. If you're young and";2

That statement is on the hotel placard. However it means you can see the Lincon Center on  a cable TV channel. Our room faced a building a meter away.  Good point its very close to Lincoln Center.  Unfortunately there are more weak points. Room was very small (common in NY), but public areas weren't the cleanest. Rooms really need remodel (peeling wallpaper, stained carpet, sluggish drainage from shower & sink).  Fitness center had nice equipment, but had papertowels instead of real towels to dry off.  Main emphasis of hotel appears to be the social scene ( rooftop bar and lounge bar). If that's not your focus, you'll probably be disappointed.;2

Nothing extra is included with your $300/night room. The experience was similar to flying American Airlines economy class, in that everything cost money. You are paying to be close to Universal Studios.  *You will pay $28/day for self parking. *If you have an SUV, it's $50/day for parking (too tall for garage) *No breakfast is included for normal rooms.  *The breakfast is $20/person/day which is very limited (fruit, breads). *$30/person/day if you want eggs and bacon.  *A family of 5 would pay $150/day to eat a Denny's equivalent breakfast . *Want a rollaway bed? $35/night *Want to watch PBS kids?

Me & my partner stayed for 3 nights in the New Yorker. Basic hotel. Lovely building in its heyday. The decor could definitely do with updating. Staff mediocre.  Bedroom was small, but done the job. It was clean which was the most important thing for us. The rooms on floor 32 where we were, are located quite close together so be prepared to hear other guests talking, opening & closing doors. The street noise wasnât too bad, the odd siren here and there, but youâd expect that in NYC. The $29 a day charge is ridiculous and non negotiable. The location is fantastic and for that Iâd stay here again. I would completely avoid the yellow taxis outside the hotel and in New York generally.. Uber all the way. Clean, friendly, courteous & nice cars, as opposed to the shoddy, dented,;2
Great location but that all this place has going for it - that and friendly staff. The rooms had little or no insulation and so you hear all the traffic all through the night. The rooms were poorly equipped and all the furniture was chipped and tired looking. The bed was uncomfortable and the room tiny. The free wifi was poor and often it was easier / more reliable to connect to free on street wifi.;2
Great location and great deli restaurants in the lobby. However, the hotel is OLD, dirty (as in ragged carpet, scuffs on all the walls, etc) and loud. Once they give this place a face lift it will be fantastic - and expensive. There were a few floors on my side of the hotel that were school dorms - weird. I think some of those kids were on my floor as well because it was LOUD. If you get a good price and really don't care about your hotel then stay here for the food and location. If you are the least bit of a hotel snob, then stay somewhere else!;2
Perfect location,  lovely staff,  clean, BUT shower was  at best poor and the $190 charge for facilities fee for a week  is a complete con !! We didn't use any of the facilities that they charge for. You have to pay it regardless. Unless you're up at daft o'clock you'll struggle to get in elevators,  in mornings especially. We had breakfast in tick tock every morning and it was adequate enough and friendly. Struggled to understand receptionist when we checked in as her English was poor.

We booked a accommodation at this hotel several months ago paying $ that would secure a good room at a 5 star hotel.  We are also Hilton Honors members.  The room we were allocated was on the 2nd (basement) floor with a view of an access road.  We asked for quiet and were put next to the lifts and the ice machine.  The room itself was ok but with an old combined bath shower with a shower curtain from the 80âs and restricted hot water.  We enquired about other options and were told in no uncertain terms that the hotel was full.  My issue is that rooms on the 2nd basement floor (below the lobby) should not be the same price as rooms with views on higher floors. Breakfast in the restaurant was average, a long time for my order to be taken and a long wait for the food.  On a;2

Words cannot express how disappointed I was with the Jane. Itâs clear that the Jane trades on its quirky vibe, however this is to the detriment of the guests that stay in the hotel. On check in, there was a private party gift bagging stand, making it difficult to actually make your way through drunk partygoers (taking selfies) to actually get to the check in desk. The overpriced rooms are cramped, hot and smell like they need a good airing. If you have a room facing the main road, itâs also quite noisy. The one good thing about the Jane is the bathroom, really nice and well laid out. My main annoyance was that we couldnât get onto the roof for drinks (every night was closed for a private party) and also when we tried to get into the lobby bar, again there was a private party.

"As we were desperately looking for a low budget hotel in New York for September 2009, a New York friend told us about The Jane. It sounded too good to be true; a fair price hotel in the West Village, recently opened and nice looking but small rooms.   We were able to book a âcabinâ for two persons for 2 weeks.  Arriving at the hotel and seeing our home / cabin for the next two weeks we had the attitude of the positive, still. Okay, it was a very small room with a view on a blind wall and that airco outside was making a lot of noise, but, hey we were in New York. The first night we were completely wasted from the flight from Amsterdam to New York and slept quite early. We woke up in the middle of the night because of the noise coming out of the bar of the hotel downstairs: music,";2

This hotel is not great, but it is in an excellent location.  The room was fine, very dated and old, and in serious need of a remodel.  Amenities, not really, but it does have wifi and a tv.  The attraction to this location is proximity to the 1, 2, 3 trains.  You basically walk out the door and you're there.  And this is on the UWS so you have a ton of great dining and drink options.  Try Tal's for a great bagel.  Don't stay here if you are trying to impress a date on a romantic weekend.  Do stay here if you plan to be out of the room except to sleep and want to spend your money on activities, dining, and shows.  You can find this hotel for under a hundred bucks on many sites.  Spend a little more to get something better?  Maybe, but this was a good enough, dated, no-frill;2
The only reason we stayed at this hotel was because of the location, and availability. The room and bathroom were the smallest I've ever seen ,especially in a US hotel. Not only does the hotel need updating, but the carpet  is so worn in the lobby  and the bathroom needs painting and caulking.  The hotel did seem to be clean ,and the front desk and doorman were very friendly, and accommodating.  I had read the reviews on trip advisor ,but didn't have much choice ,again because of availability in the city ,and soaring costs due to many events.;2
The room was worse for wear but worse of all I was unable to sleep due to the noise caused by some air con or ventilation units outside the window. The noise was there day and night, but at night was unbearable. Ear plugs were provided in the room that some what drown out the sound but not enough to get a good nights sleep. I would not stay here again.;2
"On arrival at the hotel everything seemed great...got to our room after a 5 hour drive to find we'd been put in a room at the front of the hotel which we was a bit unsure about as the traffic was heavy and very loud, neon lighting from businesses across the road and the occasional sirens and loud car coming past made us ask for another room. Even though we requested a nice room for our honeymoon...this was totally disregarded. We asked and they couldn't change us as the hotel was ""full"". Next morning we could change so we stuck it out. Our night in the room wasn't great the traffic didn't die down till 1-2am and even then it was constant. The fan in the bathroom was really loud like it was from the Stone Age. The room was small.

For the price you pay of almost $300 a night, you don't get much of a room. I originally booked a room with 2 double beds and it said it was 400 square feet. But when the Bon Jovi concert was postponed for a week, and it was Easter weekend,  they had no large rooms left so for almost the same price we got a room with only one bed and a foot of space on each side of the bed. They did not hide the fact that it was only 100 square feet. The bathroom is very small with a small sink that you cannot put anything on. There were 2 small tables with a small TV on the wall. No chair and no refrigerator. But if all you need is a bed and a shower you will be fine.  The people there were nice enough and security was good as you have to show your key to get on the elevators.  Just not worth;2

"Stayed here for 4 nights. Started out bad when I asked about the facility fee ($100.96) and what is was for. They explained it included use of the following: Business center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. Fitness center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. National and international calls, which we had no use for and said we didn't want to use. ""Premium"" WiFi, which when you went to to WiFi portal page said it was free and also shouldn't even be included under this charge as the facility fee is taxed and the PITFA (Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act) bans all taxation on internet and email services. So by proxy the internet service has been taxed.  When I said we didn't want to pay it as we were not going to use any of the";2
Our room was literally the size of a closet, and we did not have space to even lie two suitcases down flat. Although the location is great, I am surprised that the rooms pass muster for a hotel given how small they are, and there is no turndown service.

Nice location beside central park. Beautiful lobby but our room was small and in need of an update. Crazy prices for anything in the mini bar. $7.50 for a small bottle of water!

This was my second stay at the hotel. The location is good, opposite the Lincoln Centre, however it is not good value for money. There is only free wi fi in the lobby which is appalling in this day & age & for the rates paid. The lobby was full of people catching up on wifi. I stayed in room 933. The bathroom was dreadful. Grout in the tiles missing, rust stains along the shower screen, peeling paint on the door. Admittedly it was clean but so shabby I went to the lobby to complain. The receptionist apologised & said she would change the room for me. She then said that it was actually a refurbished room so there would be no change & that was that! I suggested that a manager check the bad state of the bathroom but I heard nothing more, no feedback, no room change, no discount.;2

Days Inn is next door to Hotel Newton - the differences are great.  If not full, the Newton is first, second, third choice.

Hotel was underwhelming and is currently surrounded by construction. There are some things the hotel needs to work on. I stood in line for almost 25 minutes just to get checked in. Clearly the front desk was not on their game. They were friendly but incredibly slow. The elevators also took much longer than needed. In the room, I'm sure the shower head had never been cleaned. There was so much mineral buildup, the few streams of water that managed to come out sprayed all over the place. The coffee maker was also on its last leg. I had to turn it on and off 3x to get it to sputter out a few drops.  On the positive side, probably the most comfortable bed and pillow! I slept like a baby.;2
We had a room on the second floor at the end of the hall.  We just needed a place to sleep.  We arrived at night and left in the morning.  The room itself was a tad rundown and basically outdated and there were various sloppy patches here and there on the walls.  There was a large tear in the carpet.  It was a small room with a TV that got a few channels.  We could only find one outlet on one of the walls. There was no TV remote when we got to the room. There was a single chair in the corner.  Onto this chair we simply piled our bags, since it was the only open floor space in the room. The hotel is located way up at 106th street right on the park, but the room was quiet enough.  The beds were comfy, but one had a slight sag in the middle. Oddly, the bathroom was updated and was;2

"My trip started with a very unpleasant situation. I arrived a bit earlier than the check-in time and wanted to left my luggage first and go out. After arriving the man at the reception told me that ""there was a problem with my reservation, the first night's stay"". As I had read on this portal a story of a man who had been told his reservation had been cancelled and he had been recommended  another hotel, a more expensive and worse one, I immediately told the guy that I disagree to make any changes to my reservation for the first night (especially as I had plans for the day and was in a hurry so it was impossible for me to find time for looking for another place to sleep). The guy then told me ""OK, I will sort this out"" and refused to speak to me anymore and tell me what it was";2

Very dissatisfied. Hotel was dirty, hot, and staff was unaccommodating. The AC in the room did not work. It was reported upon arrival and not addressed/fixed and by the time they gave up on fixing it there were no other rooms available until the following afternoon. Staff member at front desk was very impolite while handling the situation. At check-out time the staff would only credit back $99 when most of the stay was spent in a room w/o AC. I had to leave the hotel to find refuge from the heat. When asked to speak with a manager on two occasions, I waited for over 30 min and was told one was not available. Will not stay there again.;2

The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is outdated and desperately needs renovation. Rooms are pretty small, showers are from 1930. Very authentic, but not in a good way. Way too expensive for what you get.;2
The hotel looks amazing, the lobby is impressive, nice bar area and the roof terrace sounded great, however the rooms are tiny, lack basic amentiies, like a mirror and lighting, nothing is complimentary, the plug points were even useless and the staff were a mix of helpful to rude. I won't be back.;2

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially when there are so many great choices available for accommodations in NYC. We stayed here for 6 days and it felt like an eternity. The first room we were placed in was extremely musty and the decor was very dated. I felt as though we had been placed in a room that hadn't been used in a while or something... There was a thin layer of grime on the bathroom floor that made me wish I had brought a pair of shower shoes with me. We eventually asked to be placed in a different room, and the room they moved us to was probably half the size of our original room, but I will say that it wasn't as dusty. The decor in general throughout the hotel needs to be redone, I'm guessing it's all probably 20 years old or something. The only;2

"I am currently staying here; came for my birthday weekend to go to universal studios w/a friend. I'll admit it's quiet and seems clean, but the beds are extremely uncomfortable and springy, making loud noises when you move. They left a note in the room explaining they are renovating, but we clearly got an old room. I asked for 2 extra foam pillows and got one, and the showers are the worst. I understand the drought, but the water is cold no matter what you do, with zero pressure. It also doesn't drain so you're standing in cold water while making a futile attempt to rinse shampoo out of your hair. The Hilton name means something and I'm paying to stay at a nice hotel, not a cheap motel. Hilton has the money for hot water, especially after what they charge for breakfast. You're";2
The building is old and stuffy. Some staff members were very unfriendly. The room was filthy when I arrived and was badly cleaned after I requested service (they didnât even empty the trash can). We had 2 days with NO hot water and staff was very unhelpful about that.  Location is amazing;2
My mother and I travelled from 30-Oct to 02-Nov - The woman who checked us in was very unfriendly, and rude. However, the two other staff members were much better to deal with. When we first checked in, we were given a room that was located in the fire escape hallway (like, not in the actual building - the room door was located on the landing of a narrow stairway). I went down and requested a room located INSIDE the building - and was immediately accommodated. I was given the choice of two other rooms. The hotel is VERY old, and dÃ©cor is extremely outdated - however, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and we didn't spend too much time at the hotel to find anything to complain about (Why would you spend your time in NYC in the hotel room anyways?!) We were happy to have;2
The room we had wasnât too small as some other reviewers have commented but it was in need of some serious updating. My sister arrived a couple of nights after us and her room was updated but on the second night there was water leaking from upstairs coming through a light. They had nowhere to move them too!  Only about half of the elevators actually work and for a period of time the side that goes to the higher floors was broken and we were on the 27th floor. Staff is as rude as everyone else in NYC. Lots of homeless people right outside the hotel. Convenient location to get to get around. Not that we went to NYC to watch TV but their DirectTV service went out one evening during a storm for an extended period and most of the time a lot of the channels were fuzzy. I wouldnât stay;2
Westayed her for a week over xmas holidays.On arrival hotel looked great, staff were nice. We got in to our room which was nice at first sight but as our holiday went through the week we were noticing floors with the place, the bathroom was tiny, the caulkng was coming off the toilet and sink making them wobbly when In use, the shower had no shower door so the floor would get pretty wet when showering. The heating in the place was uncontrollable (far to hot) we rang down a couple times to get help with it but couldnt really help us with it. to cool the room down we pretty much took the glass outta the window frame as it wouldnt stay open by itself and had to leave it out all night, moving to my next point, the noise! With the said window out you could barely get sleep with the;2

Made a 2 night reservation at a discount rate.  Called the day before arrival to make sure all was in order.  They told us our reservation was canceled, but they could reinstate it at a rate nearly double the reserved amount.  After much argument on the phone with rude, unprofessional staff, the original deal was honored.  I suspect this is a ploy they pull at the last minute when people are stuck and have no alternative.  Also, check-in time is 4:00 pm.  You can drop off your bags earlier but that's it.  Absurd.  Stayed on the 19th floor.  Awesome views.  Clean, well appointed room though the carpeting was worn and needed replacement.  Nice clean king sized bed with perfect white sheets.  Ate at the Sierra Room Buffet.

This hotel was a real disappointment for a number of reasons. 1) to make a cup of coffee in your room it costs $3, so $3 for a little coffee pod, into a paper cup. 2) fitness center is terrible -- tiny, no air, old equipment, and the basement smells terrible. 3) bathroom has no room to put anything at all. 4) product is run-down, chips and such throughout the room. 5) bar menu is terrible, nothing you would want to eat. 6) no room service after 10pm.  Would never recommend or stay again.;2

Whatever your thoughts on The Jane Hotel, you are bound to remember it.  And actually, there is much to recommend the hotel.  But still, it may not be for youâgiven tiny rooms and shared baths.  The location is central, convenient, and wonderful on many levelsâJane Street near the Hudson Riverâas it puts guests in the heart of the West Village, and near the parks that line the river.  The now-trendy Meatpacking District is just a few blocks away, the south entrance of the High Line park is close at hand, and the tree-lined residential streets in this part of the Village surround the hotel.  The streets appear to be as safe as any in NYC--expensive cars are parked outside, and people stroll at all hours.  We were in town for NYC Pride, and Christopher Street is about 10 minutes;2

The location is great. Having said that the hotel itself is in need of help. The rooms are terrible and gross. Forget about taking a shower and if you do you still wont feel clean. The bathroom is so small and you cant even wash your hands in the sink without getting water all over you. The shower is disgusting with mold and dirt. The bathroom door has peeling paint and is cracked. The carpeting in the room is disgusting, worn and smells. The airconditioning unit is so filthy you don't want to touch it. There is only one garbage can in the room. The outlet is coming out of the wall and if you want to plug something in then you have to unplug a lamp. The rooms are dark as well as the hallways and lobby. Like I said the location is fantastic but that's about it.;2

I have stayed at the Empire Hotel at least 12-15 times over the last 6 years and generally the experience has been pleasant and positive.  This trip however was awful.  In short, a combination of issues with the reservation team (prior to arrival), the In-Room Dining staff upon arrival and the Night manager on duty during the stay culminated in a poor stay overall.    Longer version: 1.  Prior to arrival the reservation team I had to call 3 times as they had lost the reservation.  *John the GM did call me and take care of this and that was greatly appreciated.    2.  Once we checked in in the evening I called to order Room Service at approx 9:50pm and was told they closed at 10pm and therefore we unwilling to provide in-room dining.  Had I called after 10pm I could understand;2

This hotel put a dampener on our LA trip. I would NOT recommend it.

There were also 10 different cereals to choose from so it looked like there would a great breakfast.   However, the customer service was poor. We had one significant issue and a several minor problems, all were dealt with a take it or leave it attitude.   One day after being at a theme park all day we came back to find our room door open.

The hotel is beautiful and much of the staff is helpful and kind. We had quite a few road bumps that might have been outliers, but its hard to say.

(It started to become clear that it had been a good idea that I brought my own pillow). Although the room was prepaid, he insisted that I sign a form advising me that if the key was not returned there was a $150 charge.  He gave us room 304, but looked at me like I was from another planet when I asked for a second key for my travel companion.  The elevator was clean and brightly lit, but small.

Just returned from a week at The New Yorker. I cant fault the position of the hotel but it is certainly not 4 star! Advertised as re modernised definitely not ! We booked a metro room which was supposedly modernised! Old sink and bath fittings decoration looking shabby and a TV which was supposedly flat screen which came out of the ark! The room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel, only feet away.  They have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise. When you book on arrival they then sting you for a $40 a night facility fee ontop of your original booking . This is for the business centre , Gym and something else quite random and even if you dont want to use;2

Stayed last week but given the choice you have in NYC i wouldnt stay again.        it was a little  way out from the main tourist attractions. True it was very clean with a nice bathroom, cant moan about that but we wew on the second floor at the front over the reception. it was noisy you could hear the people, the roar from the subway underground. The walls were thin, you could here next door and one night the big bathroom pipe clanked loud for over an hr..      i also found the parts of the hotel a bit shabby.       So all in all. Pay a few more dollars and get a bit better than this place.;2
We spend 100-130 nights a year, every year (regardless of virus outbreaks), in properties under the Hyatt umbrella and our expectations are established from that baseline.   The rant below may seem over the top and I would suggest if you stay 100+ nights a year at one hotel chain and you fly exhausting international itineraries frequently, you'll understand :-)  We booked the top-level multi-room suite here.  Checked in on the app twelve hours before arrival indicating need for 1:30PM check-in. Hyatt profile shows we expect two robes, slippers and extra bath towels along with 4 bottles of water in the room.    Arrive 1:45 and room not ready and front desk rep, while telling me in words they would try to ready it shortly, his face and delivery said it wasn't happening. Seen that;2

All that is good about this hotel is that it is very convenient to most places: underground, Times Square, Empire State Building etc.  The only down side as other reviews have pointed out are the size of most of the rooms.  Our original room on arrival was so small you didn't even have a side table and I had to crawl over my hubby to get into bed.  The shower had been skewed out and was totally defunct and had been that way for a long time.  We asked if it could be fixed on the 1st day, 1st evening 2nd day, 2nd evening, getting the picture!  In the end on returning at 10:30pm one evening we went again to one of the 2 desks (no one tells you if it is the right one), just keep telling you they will deal with it, and one of the managers where there and moved us straight away.;2
See previous comments about room 101 weekend of September 23-25.  No coffee condiments either morning.  No top sheet on bed second night. Bathroom sink drain needs repair. Washcloths weren't replenished.  Prepaid room was adjacent to elevator.  Rooftop bar was not available and that fact was not disclosed on website.;2
I stayed for 5-days in december. Convenient place walking distance to metro mc donalds nd KFC,but hotel rooms are in poor standard One cant even make a coffee or tea, since kitchen had nothing to warm or cook. Fridge in the room.Good wifi.but not worth for money.;2
It was terrible air control quality. There is no water given and youâre charged for extra toilet paper. Room smelt of mold and was the size of a shoe closet. $150 refundable deposit on room in case of any damages when everything in the room is worth less than stuff youâd find in a dollar store.;2
I know it's New York but really miserable front desk staff in this age are unacceptable. No attempt at conversation, a greeting or even eye contact. Upon arrival to getting to my room the only person who smiled was the security member before the elevators. Check out was no better sadly. The room was ok, large with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. This is an old hotel so expect draughts from the windows, however everything in the room functioned correctly and the bed was comfortable. No tea and coffee maker in the room was another let down, so I went across the road to the French cafe, only to find this had closed down. McDonald's was next door and saved the day!

hotel located near the Broadway Street, subway and Central Park. Quiet and safe neighborhood. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, towels changed every day. The bed was a little narrow. The bed had plastic cover under a sheet, which made it very noisy. Air conditioning was old and did not really cold down the room.;2
The room was fine, the location near the train station so that was a plus. We left though feeling ripped off. We asked them to store our luggage for a couple hours after we checked out. We wanted to walk around a bit before our flight. They charge you $5 per bag, even if the bag is a briefcase and a camera case! They wouldn't let us consolidate our bags. I think they charge enough for the room, storing your luggage for a couple hours should be gratuitous.;2

"First, the hotel is really old but so convenient. The room was very small but adequate for most of our needs.We just made sure we didn't make any sudden movements. We were provided the room by our tour operator, Road Scholars. Since we were going to be in NYC after the tour ended, we extended our stay but in a corner suite on a much higher level. This room had many windows/views, but interestingly it had a ""patio"" that was almost walled in, so one had to stand to see over the edge. Should we ever consider staying here again, we think we'd choose one floor down so we didn't have a totally useful patio blocking some of our view. While convenient to the subway, Penn Station was right next door, we regretted not going back to an earlier hotel that we loved. That was the WestHouse";2
"One example of the all around mediocre level of the hotel is the ""business room"" where the for pay computers and internet are slower then the free wifi on a Jet Blue plane.  Oh yeah, the free wifi only works half the time and only if you call the desk to reboot it.  To give credit where it is due, the help is friendly and helpful.  The decor is extremely tired, but is clean at least.  The in window air conditioners were up to the task although a bit on the noisy side. Almost forgot, about 1/2 hour after I checked in another guest that checked in later entered my room (1109) having been mistakenly checked into the same room!  That was a first!";2

The picutres look very nice and fanncy, its in a horrible area.   The pool was a mess, the sauna's did not work, the TV's did not work.   We had someone come in to fix our TV, and they barely spoke English, all they did was tap the removte a few times, make it turn on and left.

"On first impression, a very nice hotel, well situated and with welcoming staff and a great foyer. However, interior rooms (the cheaper ones) have little to no natural light, and the roar from the outside air-conditioning units that keep the place cool is deafening at all times of the day and night. The windows did not seem to shut properly.  Also the wifi throughout the hotel is patchy at best and non-existent at worst. Could not cope with what must be an overloaded system.   Outdoor rooftop pool is little bigger than a bathtub and dirty, but the view is great. 2 out of 4 lifts not working for most of the week, causing huge queues.  Finally, their website says ""all rooms have a great view of New York"" but this is a blatant lie. All the interior rooms have no view at all. I tried";2

You can't get a better location than this if you're planning to go to Universal Studios/City Walk.  It's perfect - quick walk!   Like any other hotel, the food is ridiculously expensive - $100+ for a family of 4 to eat breakfast.  My greatest frustration was our room.  It was your average hotel room, which is fine and was clean looking, but it REEKED of cigarette smoke - overwhelmingly so and the hotel did very little (next to nothing) to make our stay more comfortable.  :(  Very disappointing.;2

"The staff is excellent; however, the rooms are extremely small and in bad need of upgrades!  There is only one floor in the entire hotel that has updated rooms, and even those are in bad need of upgrades.

I had 2 rooms; one of the rooms was so small that when you open the door it hits the bed.

We stayed in this centrally located hotel in October 2011 for 4 nights. I am aware that finding good hotels in New York is difficult but when paying Â£250 (pounds not dollars) per night you expect something decent. The hotel itself wasnât bad - just medicore. However if you want some sleep do not stay here. The rooms are not very well sound proofed at all and there is a bar downstairs playing loud music until 4am. We complained about the noise from the bar (located inside the hotel) only to be told that there was nothing they could do because they had no jurisdiction over the bar - this was at 3.30am. I could here the conversation the people in the rooms next door were having often word for word.   Even in the city that apparently never sleeps, the tourists that visit it do want;2

I booked a room with the morningside inn through agoda. I received a confirmation email but when I emailed the inn asking a question they had no record of my reservation. I was already in route when I get the email from morningside alerting me that they did not have my reservation and thus had no room for me. The clerk at morningside was somewhat helpful but I was forced to find a new room on my own from LaGuardia airport. I strongly recommend not booking a room through agoda, but if you do confirm with the actual hotel. Agoda has terrible customer service and if your reservation falls through you are on your own.;2
When we arrived the room was not yet ready even though we were checking in past 4:00 PM. We were told we would get a call in about 30 min when room was ready and we did not receive any call. We had to go stand in line again to see if room was available yet. When we reached the counter, they said yes it was ready a while ago. The.ln why did we not receive a call! On our way to our room right away I knew it was not the room I payed for, for it was on the 2nd floor when I requested a city view room. And of course our view was of a back alley. I go back to check in and stand in line for the third time and when I am helped the clerk says that since I did not book directly with them that's the highest floor they had available. What does that even matter! I paid for the city view! If;2
As soon as we walked in to the Astor we knew it was not ging to be good.Our twin room was so small and very basic.There was no where to sit apart from the bed and the beds were so close together that one had to put there feet up while the other got past.The room was dark because we had to keep the broken blind shut as we wre overlooked by the rooms opposite.It was also very noisey,when the people next door were having a shower it sounded like you were in the with them.There were no safety deposit boxes facilities available at the hotel, so we had to carry our valuables around with us.The room itself was clean and the beds were comfortable,the bathroom was a good size.;2

I chose this hotel because my mother stayed there 2 years ago, she told me the hotel was great and fine regarding the price... I booked a standard room for 2 nights for 300 dollars per night, expensive for me but why not, after all we are in Manhattan, in a nice district.  We travelled from very far, we checked in with a man so rude (short guy, no hair, glasses), I unfortunately donât have his name. I have been surprised (in a bad way) because, the check in is the first impression of the establishment. I am working also in hospitality industry, if someone welcomes our guests like that in our hotel, I will say to this guy: do you really understand your job or what ? You are supposed to welcome the guests and not to make them uncomfortable !  Anyway, the receptionist told us we;2

We arrived at âThe Hollywood Hotelâ just after midnight. I waited at the front desk for a time and when the hotel receptionist finally came around the corner he was dismissive and impatient. Our reservation was made through Expedia.com, so he was unaware of our request for a larger room and roll away cot. This seemed to annoy him. We headed upstairs to find that the card keys to our room did not work. We waited in the hall instead of going back to the front desk, because he said he would bring the roll-away bed. When asking for new card keys he gave me a look of disdain and then proceeded to try all four of the card keys, which as previously stated did not open the door. He used his manager key to let us in our room and told us we had to push the bed into the room and set it up;2

I hate to say it, but I have been in worse.  The Abercorn is a bit of a dump.  However, and this is important.  It is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest hostel in London, when booking for more than a week.  Yes, some of the other visitors smoke in the corridors. Yes, toilets can be dirty, but when I get up at 6am to go to work, everything has been disinfected and cleaned.  At the end of the day, it is cheap and convienently located.  If you want expensive, go somewhere else.;2

The Shining anyone? Seriously! The lobby and check in are beautiful. We are no strangers to Art Deco as Miami/South Beach and Beverly Hills are also great destinations with similar style hotels and rooms. The problem here is very old carpets/walls, dimly lit hallways, etc. then to get to the room. We reserved a larger space and received a 150ish square foot closet with an uncomfortable bed that viewed a wall. I called to inquire and offered to pay an upgrade fee for a better room and was told that the hotel was fully booked for that night. Pretty funny that I could check online and reserve a number of rooms there for the same evening. We were traveling on a prepaid voucher so Iâm sure thatâs why they didnât want to upgrade. When I called Wyndham reservations FROM THE ROOM, they;2
On a recent stay, housekeeping never visited my room during the stay. But I did not receive an evaluation. I also did not receive an email copy of my bill!  On this stay,housekeeping was good.

"I can deal with small rooms. I can deal with rickety elevators. Even the understaffing didn't bother me. I don't bother to write many reviews because I don't let most things get to me.

But when I'm checking into my room, giving you my money, maybe don't be abrupt, dismissive and hostile. All i wanted was to get my room key. But at every stage of the interaction, the front desk agent who was ""helping"" me just got more and more agitated. I mean, snarky comments. Eye-rolling. Excuse me? All i was trying to do was give you my cc and get my room key. Normally a half undone tie isn't something that bothers me, but I";2
I read a number of reviews about the Hollywood Hotel prior to my arrival and the number one complaint was the noise from the road (Vermont.) I emailed the hotel and requested a room away from the road. Upon my arrival I checked in â walked up to my room (very, very small room) and as I was opening the door I could hear the traffic and sirens. I went in, called the front desk asked if it was possible to switch rooms. They told me that was the only room available.    I had been up since 4:00 a.m. that morning and wanted to get a quick nap in prior to meeting with my colleagues for dinner â that wasnât happening. As if the traffic and sirens werenât enough the construction coming from across the hall made me feel like I was in the middle of a construction site.  After my;2
"The price for the hotel/night is awesome.  We got a steal for only $54/night.  The BIG catch is, the $35 PER night PER pet charge.  Imagine staying for 5 days with 2 small dogs and having to pay that pet fee charge.  We computed the charges, and with the rate we are required to pay for the pet fees, we might as well booked our hotel at a 4 star hotel that doesn't charge anything for pet fees.  And so after staying one night, we cancelled the rest of our reservation and booked into a ""nicer"" hotel.  This time, no pet fees.";2

Hotel was cheap so didnt expect much. It was clean and basic but slightly further out that I would have liked.  Main problem was that after the room had been cleaned each day the bathroom absolutely stank of fish.

"When I decided to stay at the Hilton near Universal Studios, I thought I had hit a jackpot. It was within walking distance to the park so after spending a long and tiring day, I could quickly return to my hotel for some much needed rest. What I didn't know is that their ""Halloween Horror Nights"", which is a huge annual event every year, was opening that night. The issue here is that traffic is a nightmare going to and from the hotel with no special accommodations for guests who rent cars and are NOT attending the evening event. Streets surrounding the hotel are blocked for buses who are transporting the THOUSANDS of people parking in surrounding areas. For a drive that should have taken 10 minutes,  took me over an hour.

The New Yorker hotel is set in a great  location and exhibits beautiful Art Deco architecture which reminds of us of New Yorkâs past Again on entrance you see glimpses of the hotelâs art deco past looking rather tired in a very busy lobby .

"Positives: Location is excellent; WiFi was very good; Jeff the doorman was outstanding. Jeff was very welcoming,   friendly and helpful. He advised us on tourist attractions and helped us organise airport transfers. Thank you Jeff!   Negatives: Poor quality overall condition of our room. Shower leaked water all over the floor due to poor design and we were constantly mopping up water with towels. Door handle on bathroom was falling off. Noisy outside, think due to air vents outside at the back of the building. Air conditioning was very loud and rattely. Stains on the walls, perhaps  from water leaks/damp from the rooms above us.  Paid quite a lot for this room, which I appreciate is mainly due to the central location but basics in the overall condition of the room could easily";2
Even on the 20th floor, I could hear every shout on the street, every horn, every siren, all the construction, every door slam in the hallway, every conversation in the neighboring rooms.

Depending on whatever you might be given a room on the cheap side. Rooms are super small. Elevators were so slow    Just awful for the money. Bathrooms are tiny. No mat and the sink is so contemporary that you can't wash your hands without your hands soaking in the dirty water.  Tv did not get all stations clearly.;2
I suppose you need to know your own limits:  saving money and an interesting location might make up for a sadly worn property, saved from being truly terrible by an accommodating and good-natured staff.  It is clean:  your bed will be comfortable.  But the heating may go, the cable TV is likely to be out, and if you are past your youth hostel days you may find the level of discomfort not worth the savings.  If your young and buoyant and have a reason to be on the Upper West Side, by all means try your luck.;2
I was looking forward to staying here but i soon realised the endorsement for Gossip Girl clearly cost the hotel too much, exceptionally loud aircon units which clearly need replacing , wallpaper peeling off walls, bathroom mould developing, fusty towels and nowhere near clean enough for UK standards. I was very happy to leave and not sure why this hotel was recommended to us ( and i am not a fussy person and neither is my partner) For the money i paid i was not impressed.;2

The Empire is an average hotel that charges a lot and delivers very little. For $500/night, you'll get a tiny room and be charged extra for everything from WiFi to in-room coffee. For the price, you can find better with another boutique hotel or a big chain.;2
"Have stayed here before - like the location. Booked a premier room as a special occasion. Checked in, went to theatre. Slept OK. Next morning shower didn't work at all. Reported to manager when got to reception. Tried to fob us off with ""why didn't you check it when you arrived"" ! Only response was to give a us a customer (non) services number - engaged. Email response was 25% refund, repeated by the supervisor. Just forget their ""guarantee"" of a good night  - never again.";2
This review is for Le Gitane restaurant, the bistro which is part of The Jane hotel in Manhattan.  We booked a table for 10 on a Friday night and were escorted to a table that could hardly fit 8. As it was obvious there was no alternative, we decided to move in a give it a go. The service was unbelievably bad with an ignorant waitress who clearly did not feel like working that night. if you like bread, Le Gitane is the place to be. I don't think we came across a single starter that did not come with bread or was a version of a bread dish.  We tasted a Pinot Girs, but did not like it, so the waitress took the bottle away and presented us with a second one. This tasted very different and it turned out that she had decided that maybe a Bordeaux would be a better choice (how about;2
1st in line for check-in. Took over 20 minutes. 2 front desk clerks were on the phone, checked in other customers who walked up not in line, and generally didn't seem to care how quickly they performed their job.  Restaurant in the lobby - same as above. We were seated at 2:00 with only 2 other tables. Our food took 45 minutes to come out for a table of 5 (3 adults and 2 kids). Food was ok at best. Found a hair in a taco and when we showed our server she told us she'd have to ask her manager what she could do for us. She comped the dish... but after she put it on the bill first so the tax was added in before comping the meal without the tax.  Annoying.  Not likely to return or recommend.;2

"The rooms were superb in terms of its utilities, nice beds, good food. Wifi though was a bit erratic. Free for an hour at the lobby. Otherwise it is $7.95 per day.  At the conference, several attendees lost their ipads and macs  even the speakers lost their macs so some had to just do oral lectures. It does not seem that they have an active CCTV working in the conference room. The hotel staff even blamed the organizers ""not asking for additional security"". Is this not routine? It is a big conference after all.  The staff did not seem to care whether or not you lose something within the hotel's premises.  Some of the staff in the concierge and outside were very helpful regarding directions as to which cabs or places to go to for shopping. We highly appreciated their help. Super";2
A recent stay at the New Yorker was a huge disappointment.  No any think like the pictures on their website.  I expected the room to be small as many hotel rooms in NYC are on the small side.  This room looks like the last time it was renovated was just after WW II. The room was out dated and not even a comfortable chair to sit and read not that there was room for one.  It is a convenient location within walking distance of much of the city but not a very comfy or welcoming room to stay in.  Also for a hotel this size there were very few seats in the lobby.  More often then not all the couches and seats were full.  Sixty dollars at night to park.  WOW.;2

It was really disappointing. I booked two rooms for three nights and immediately want to check out after walking into the room. It was too late to cancel and I felt bad because I took my family here. 1. I was told at the front desk that there is 39 resort fee per night. When I ask what they offer out of the resort fee, they said it was actually facility fee they charge everyone including wifi and business center, fitness center etc...It felt like a random additional charge, PLUS the keys they gave me didnât even work for the gym! (Later I have to go ask them to add it) . 2. The room was very small and old. AC was loud with some random noise if you keep it open. No coffee machine, fridge, face tissues, which you would expect from a normal hotel room. Considering this is a;2

Room 233 was tiny, delapidated with unpleasant odour and smelly bathroom.  There were no other rooms available.  Reception was always busy or no-one was there.  We were there for our 55th wedding anniversary and a 78th birthday so were very, very disappointed.  Room 233 bore no resemblance whatsoever to the photographs nor to other rooms we have stayed in at Premier Inns.  I have written a letter to the Manager and also sent an email to the Manager but so far no reply.   The hotel is so well situated which is why we chose it but the stay was completely spoilt by this horrid little room.;2

There are air conditions in the windows. You share an old bathroom with other people on your hallway. The fan in the room had no string for the light you have to unscrew the light manually to keep the fan on at night. It needs renovating. The elevator is not big enough to get in with your luggage for one trip up. Not for families with children. Maybe  single couples would be fine with here.;2
We reserved a queen bed room and arrived early. We checked in and were told we would get a call when the room was ready. We never received a call. When we went to check in hours later, we were told there were no queen beds available and we were being UPGRADED to double beds. This is not an upgrade for a couple on a NY vacation. Bad enough to not have our room, but ridiculous to call it an upgrade. No explanation was given for why we were never called and why the room we reserved was not reserved for us when we had checked in hours prior to normal check in time. We were told there were no queen bed rooms left, we would have to take the double beds and see if anything opened up the next night or go to another hotel. We asked to talk to the manager and was told she would come out.;2
We stayed in the New Yorker over Christmas. Our room was extremely dated as was the rest of the hotel. We expected a small room but perhaps not as small as we got. We couldnât even open our suitcases on the floor.   I arenât sure if the rooms get nicer as you go up but we were first given a room on the 19th floor but before we went up we asked if there was any any lower down. We were given one on the 13th floor. If this is the case, it would have been nice for the receptionist to say yes there is but the room isnât the same quality.  The staff who stood at the bottom of the lifts to ensure that you could only get in with a room key never said hello\good morning.   The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights of New York.;2

I booked this hotel as one of the few which catered for single travellers in New York with the added bonus of it being in the West Village.    Location was great, few minutes to subway and lots of evening options close by. It is however on the side of the main road running alongside the Hudson.  This  made for lots of traffic noise constantly. Better Windows would easily rectify this problem. I was relieved that the noise from the bar/club was not an issue for me and I had read lots of reviews that it could be very loud.  The room was fine, as expected it was tiny but enough for what I needed. Wifi was available in the room and although a bit slow, it was fine for what I needed. The bathroom also was fine, clean and with really good showers.   My main bugbear was the fact that;2
We booked this hotel to stay closer to Central Park and away from the time square crush, whilst visiting NYC for a week. Excellent location as subway was little over 5 mins walk away.   We had a junior suite and as staying a week free wifi. Room was freshly decorated and of a good size especially for a NYC hotel.  Bathroom looked slightly tired but clean and decent amounts of hot water.  Staff were friendly and until the total power failure in the early hours of Saturday 24th June, we had really enjoyed our stay.   What happened was beyond the control of the staff, so no point it getting irate. On check out our contact details were taken with a promise to contact me with a refund for the last night and a statement of account.  Alas 2 emails and 4 days later, I have heard nothing;2
I wound up at Wyndham New Yorker using Priceline name your own price for second time in just over a year and am astounded that they are afforded four stars in the hotel rankings. The rooms and bathrooms are so small (even by New York standards), the furniture so clumsy and outdated, it just doesn't make sense to me, and I have stayed in numerous NYC hotels of that ranking.  The location is very good (directly across from Penn Station) and I have no problem with the service or the people who work there.   Because I feared getting a postage-stamp room, I called a day before check-in and talked with an extremely pleasant manager, requesting a paid or complimentary upgrade to a larger room. I was told the hotel was sold out but they would do what they could. At check-in the;2

The hotel is well located, the lobby is cozy and the staff friendly and helpful. We had 2 problems. 1. We were not able to sleep because of the street noise.

I just stayed at the Jane for four nights when I was in NYC for the marathon.  First of all, my room was $325 a night, not including tax, which seemed very steep, even for NYC.  My room was tiny, with about 2 1/2 feet of space between the bed and the walls.  The bathroom was a nice size, however.  The hotel staff was generally very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel is located on the west side highway, so I can only imagine how loud the rooms are on this side of the hotel.  When I checked in I asked for a quiet room and was told that my room faced Jane Street, so it would probably be not be too loud.  What the front desk attendant didn't mention was the super loud club that operates in the hotel seven nights a week.  I was in room 215 and it was so loud as to be unpleasant and I'm;2

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July 2015. The rooms were fine although in need of refurbishment. However, on the morning of our departure one of our bags went missing from the hotel lobby. We only noticed when we reached our next destination - we called the hotel several times and had conversations with different members of staff, but no one was particularly keen to help. They eventually checked the lobby area and our rooms and declared that the bag was nowhere to be found. They would not check their CCTV to see if they could spot anyone leaving with our bag, and when we asked whether they had had any other bags stolen from the hotel, they put the phone down on us. They advertised that they had a pool but it was never open while we were there. They also advertised a gym;2

Upon arrival, our reservations were wrong and the price was higher than advertised.

Tip: Double bed with a bathroom means 1 bed 1 bath, not 2 beds with a bathroom.

Tip: Save up for a real hotel because this one wasnt worth the money.;2
Lovely staff and good cleaning staff BUT the place was old tatty and very dirty!  The roof top bar was a nice touch but also felt tired and run down.

Our stay worked out at â¬135 per night including tax or about Â£110.   This does not include breakfast. This is one of the cheapest hotels in this part of new york.

It wasn't until a lady for the afternoon shift asked if we were checking in and found our reservation (while the manager was behind her).  The manager did not applogise for the delay nor offer us any compensation for the long wait. We also had to book our own airport transfer, the staff provided a number.

This place is just terrible, terrible, terrible.  The bathroom was full of rust, mold, and some weird green gunk leaking out of the toilet handle.  The pics somehow make this place look decent, which is a stretch in and of itself.  The bathroom was seriously gross.   There is no refrigerator in the room and barely room to lay down your things.  The AC had a mind of its own, just decided to go on and off as it pleased.  The housekeeping would keep coming in the room even though I left the note on the door to not be disturbed.  I would not recommend my worst enemy stay at this dump.   Yes the location is in midtown which is convenient, but hey this is New York, almost everywhere is convenient.;2

We got our room through priceline.  A week before our journey began we decided to take our three year old with us along with our nanny.  I called the hotel to see if we can upgrade our priceline reservations.  The front desk agent said that they can upgrade us to a one bedroom suite with two doubles in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living area.  She said she can do this for an extra $150 a night plus taxes.  I told her to please book it and asked if she would like our credit card and she said that payment would be made when we check out.  When we got there, the agent at the front desk said that whoever talked to us only put the rate in the computer and did not actually reserve the suite.  She continued by saying that the hotel is sold out.  I got a little miffed and asked;2

If you want a budget hotel in a great location, you could do worse... I think. You are right in the middle of everything. Rooms are sub par. Dated fixtures, furniture and bathrooms. Rooms are small, even by NYC standards. Better value hotels nearby.;2
Terrible room stains all over the carpet and furniture was all damaged.   Lamp shade fell off as I turned on the lamp was broke and left resting.   Overall very run down.

Reserved a junior suite and was simply told not available when I arrived.  I was given a deluxe room instead.  Later the hotel agreed to upgrade to a suite after a long conversation with the front desk.  The suite did not have a robe and slippers, the newspaper was not delivered in the morning, there was no order form for in room breakfast, and the bathrooms in the suite were small and cramped.;2
Stayed here for 5 nights in  Feb I am at a loss to why my review is so far adrift from others on here that find the place great. Firstly the lobby is fine but thatâs it once you get in the lift and enter the corridors oh my so depressing and needs some TLC I canât remember  the number of the first room but it was awful really awful after travelling for over 20hrs I just wanted to go to sleep but off I went to reception to ask for a different room so was very happy to be told we were getting a newly refurbished one well it was better nice basin lol and tv (not bothered when in New York about TV) the workmanship in these rooms is awful therefore everything looks tatty I definitely would not recommend this hotel.

My friend booked this hotel for a 3 night stay in New York. I agree with the comments regarding location - the location of the hotel was excellent for what we wanted to do. It's really near Columbus Circle and Central Park and Times Square is about a 20 minute walk. It cost us $51 in a taxi from the airport and the journey took about 30 minutes. We tended to walk to most places that we wanted to visit during our stay.  When we arrived we were told that they did not have the twin room that we had booked available for us. They did offer us an upgraded room but with a double bed. I complained vigorously to member of staff who checked us in, who later turned out to be the manager. He kept repeating an apology and said that they would have a twin room ready for us the following day;2
I just stayed at this hotel and I think they must have done a little remodeling because the other reviews are from 2005.  It was not the best place to stay but I did not want to spend twice that amount just for a place to hang my head for two days.  I did not see any bugs and the bathroom was clean enough.  The tap water did not seem to work in the room but the refrigerator was nice to put take out food in.  The bed was clean and the room itself had no stains and no holes.  The door lock was good.  I took the elevator and it was always reliable.  There is a winding corridor but you get used to going in the right direction. Because it is an old building, there is a mildew smell when you get on the elevator but I did not notice a smell in my room.  The air conditioner was pretty;2

"The closeness to the theme park is great; however, when we went (early Jan. 2017) the lobby was under renovation and the elevator wait time was comicalâ¦5-10min. at times.  (And when one finally showed it was crowded to the point you couldn't get on sometimes.)  We went to breakfast our last day and came back around 9:30am and our key cards didn't work.  (Checkout is 11am.)  We would have went down to get the key cards rescanned but...you know...the elevators.  We waited 10min. for someone to come let us in.  Our parking key card (for self-parking) didn't work one day...which wasn't too big of a deal but we had to stop by the front desk...again.  You have to pay for parking each day.

I won't recommend the New Yorker, mainly due to the horrible, no good, very bad attitude of the people working in the reception area, beside other stuff. Here's my list of grievances:  1- Noise levels: the noise from the street is not blocked by the windows. Horns, police, ambulances and fire engines can be heard at the 28th floor at the same level as if you were on the street. The windows are not sound proof at all. 2- The building is old. But there are charming old and just old. The rooms at the New Yorker are the second type. Awkward floor plans, subcompact bathrooms and a strange closet are the norm. If someone is using the bathroom in the room besides yours, you can hear the pipes making strange and ghastly sound on your room. 3- The people at the reception: this is the;2
Stayed for three nights in May 2018.   Reception was nice, although had no record of our Hilton Honors (arranged through Virgin Australia Velocity program).   The layout of our room was ok, but was was dirty (see pictures).   Other staff, particularly bell services were incredibly rude and unhelpful.   Overall, not worth it.;2

We stayed at this hotel in Jan and on arrival we were allocated a room (on the 9th floor) that was in a very poor condition, with obvious signs of wear and tear and with a terrible shower that would not work properly- temperature of the water could not be controlled and we struggled to turn the thing on and off. However upon request to reception they changed our room without question to one on the fifth floor and we were plesantly surprized! The room was clean and had obviously been updated. The bathroom facilities were modern, all worked really well (including the shower and hair-dryer) and the room was clean with adequate heating. Overall a budget hotel, in a great location- very near the subway, with a McDonalds close by and a 24 hour pharmacy on the corner. Great-considering;2
A broken boiler does not qualify as a natural disaster, yet the hotel treated it like once it happen they were no longer responsible for the comfort of their guests. After 2 days w/o hot water, in chilly fall weather I was told I could shower at the gym down the street. This was another logistics nightmare that could have been avoided had the hotel walked thru the process as if they were a guest of the hotel. Mass confusion and a waste of a morning.  One morning I used hot water from the Keurig coffee maker to at least have a hot wash cloth - that's when I felt like I was camping. I stayed a total of 7 days over a period of 10 days. First room internet connection was good. 2nd room it was terrible - if you're traveling on business you'd go out of your mind trying to send and;2

We stayed at the Wyndham for one day do to the fact that we decided to go to NYC a day early and our other hotel had no availability. For starters they canceled our reservation out of error and when I called to correct the situation I happen to be online and noticed a lower rate. When I mentioned it to the front desk she simply told me she couldn't give me the rate online and if I wanted it to book it myself. No apology nothing. The hallway on our floor was extremely dark and smelled of urine. Our room was clean but extremely dark and out dated, not to mention the front desk told us the room had two queen beds and it actually had two full beds. I personally would not recommend this hotel.;2

We paid too much for this hotel and I know we could have done better for the price we paid. If you can find a 100 dollars a night rate or bellow it is a good deal, otherwise try to find something closer to downtown and a bit more luxurious.This is not the kind of hotel that you go to to relax but just to sleep. As a matter of fact , there is no view from the room, it is very dark and you have to twist your neck to see the sky and if the sun is there. The room was very  small and very basic but extremely clean, the bathroom was adequate and also very clean, great powerful shower with plenty hot water.

"Got this on Priceline, but it wasn't ""cheap"" even for Priceline.  The people working the front desk are very rude and condescending.  When we checked in we asked for two double beds and were told we had to pay $50 extra per night to have that.  Since we have to have 2 beds, we reluctantly agreed.  By this time we were almost at full price of the room anyway.  The room smelled like smoke even though it was on a non smoking floor.  When we called they said they were fully booked and couldn't move us.  The room is about 10 by 12, the bathroom is about 6 by 6.  Decor is horrible and cheap.  Beds are lumpy.  The top drawer of the dresser doesn't stay closed, it mysteriously opens at will and blocks the way to the bathroom.  The ""closet"" has room for about three shirts.  Also, there";2
Did a pre check in, waited for room to become available, then came back and had to wait in a long, slow line to get keys. Asked for Bellman to pickup luggage from car, he didnât show up after waiting 20 more minutes, and ended up having to move luggage myself. Nobody tells you where elevators are or how to get to Universal Studios... be prepared to figure everything out yourself and moving your own luggage after waiting in long slow moving lines.;2
First off, when we arrived at the hotel there were not any available rooms so we had to wait in the very small lobby. When we got to our room, it was not bad for the money we paid. However, they do not use fitted sheets. When you wake up in the morning be prepared to find the mattress. The only other problem we had with the room was the water. If you want to make sure that you will have water, take your shower at night or early in the morning. Anytime between 9:00 and 11:00 in the morning you will not have ANY water.  Our other problems were with the people who were running the front desk. The bellhop was very nice and the security was nice, but the front desk people are very rude. They will take people in line out of order, so it does not really matter if you were there first;2

This hotel charges an extra $35 dollars a day for wifi, gym, business center. I had my service charge removed but I bet most people pay it without complaining. This charge was never listed on the Wyndham reservation website.  Itâs an extra charge this hotel adds on to the bill to rip you off.  Very shady !;2
The lobby staff was terribly unorganized, not very patient with guests and at some times just rude. When management was questioned about why things were such a mess and disorganized blame was placed on others, no one would take responsibility for anything.;2

Recently stayed at Wyndham New Yorker, the bedroom was extremely small and because there was a heavy desk against the window, the curtain would only pull halfway across.  The view seemed to be of other rooms which I could see into when the lights were on so I had to move the desk in order to block their view into my room.  The bed was very comfortable although the room itself was small and extremely cold at night.  I did ask for another blanket which was supplied immediately on request.  The bathroom was very cramped and dated. Luckily I was the sole occupant as I doubt you could get two into the room at the same time.  Location was good, the staff were friendly and the TickTock restaurant was excellent.  Sometimes there was a queue for breakfast but the food and service was;2
We stayed here a few weeks ago and were really disappointed with the hotel. It's location is very close to Central Park, but other than that, there is not much around this area. The whole west side seems to be undergoing major roadworks, and most of the buildings are heavily cladded with scaffolding -including the entrance to the hotel. One morning I awoke and opened my blinds, to 5 workmen peering through -from the building opposite- and we were on a higher floor!! The reception area is dark and dismal with no natural lighting, and the decor in the corridors is bold ,dark and a bit overbearing! We upgraded to a suite- but even it was fairly basic-e.g.  we had a curtain over an inset for a wardrobe ! The room was also dark.The worst part however was the shower which the hotel;2
Hotel faces Lincoln center and is minutes from Central park and Columbus circle, the room was small with peeling paint. The shower knob broke one morning and my keys deactivated twice during my 3-night stay. No free internet in the room which was very surprising.  Overall not a great stay.;2
Great and friendly staff, but for 100usd a night the Wifi is not included, not even a bottle of water or a toothbrush kit in the tiny room. No bin, nothing. A bed, a bathroom, and thats it. The heater was on impossible to turn it off so I had to use the aircon to balance.. the 5th and 7th floor buttons on the lift dont show the light I tough were not working. 18usd for a basic breakfast. Good location tho to be quiet and very nice staff, ok for a night, not for a week in my opinion!;2
It seemed a lot of people like us had paid for internet and free phone calls which is extra and you have to pay it. but until you moaned several times the hotel didnt fix it. The rooms need updating and the windows are very old so you can hear a lot of noise from the city that never sleeps. Cleaners were fantastic and very helpful. I wouldnt stay at the hotel again.;2

"This was the first taste of California I got, and it was gross. The hotel was dark, needed a vacuum, and the staff was very distant.  The room was very small ( not worth the $119 a nite).  We THINK there was ""chocolate"" on the curtain... the sliding door to go outside would not open, the shower didn't work, there were ants, and the ""fountain"" outside is powered by a garden hose.  The only good thing was there was a free continental breakfast with cold juice and fresh waffles.  When we checked out the man behind us said the picture above the wall fell on him as he was sleeping.... find somewhere else to stay for your money!!";2
The first star is for the Nespresso coffee.  The next is for proximity to times Square.  The bad things? Oh man, where do I start!  The room walls are flimsy. You can hear everything and everyone whispering in the corridor, or banging someone upstairs, or just laughing.  The bathrooms have no locks! You can't lock from inside.  Plus the bathrooms have no ventilation. So all the smells waft gently into the main room. The thermostat was built in 1930s and  has stayed that way since then.  Too hit, or too cold and zero air circulation.  No coffee machine jn room.  No water spouts on the corridor and they want us to drink tap water from a smelly bathroom.  Too small toilets.  The elevator creaks all the way up and down.  The room carpets are carried over from 30s. The only claim to;2
Only stay here if you work for Virgin Airlines or if location is a must.     The rooms are small and dated.  Only those with a view feel comfortable. If you have a standard room you will be disappointed as your view will be of the buildings brickwork. Some views are spectacular but others will allow you to see directly into New York apartments.  Not exactly what I want to be charged upto $300 per night for.   We arrived at 1730 (five and half hours after the prescribed checkout time) and two of the three rooms were not available.  This was all after our long flight with three elderly parents who needed to rest.  We received one complimentary breakfast each, as compensation for the delay to our rooms.  Our rooms were not ready as they had allowed incoming Virgin Airlines flight;2
"The only good thing to be said about this hotel is its location.  If you are looking for a hotel in the Upper West Side, then the location is perfect.  Very close to the subway, relatively quiet, just great. Beyond that this hotel has nothing going for it. I paid a total of $333 a night (including all the taxes) for a dingy, shabby very miserable hotel, awful room, terrible service and attitude of front desk staff.  Things promised on the booking confirmation did not exist and there was a ""couldn't care less"" attitude of all staff i encountered. I would never go back there. At that price you can do MUCH better.";2
We stayed for two nights in April and paid about $300/night. We were happy with the excellent location and rooms were clean - the only reason for 2 stars vs. 1. For the price, you would expect basic niceties such as free WiFi, free parking and perhaps even included breakfast. However Hilton charges for basic WiFi in their hotel which is ridiculous especially when room rates are already high. Parking is $28/day. Then there was breakfast. Average offering/quality at extortionate prices. A tea/filter coffee is $7, continental breakfast $20/person, cooked breakfast $30/person. Tables were messy and the atmosphere chaotic. The rooms, while clean, were stuffy, humid and damp. The air conditioning unit was loud and didnât work properly. Finally, as a HiltonHonours member I was denied;2

What made this hotel appealing was the history behind the building- built in 1907 with great architectural detailing & accommodated the Titanic survivors in 1912, etc. I knew that the hotel rooms were small and I was interested in the design of each room - using a train cabin as inspiration. I feel, however, that the execution of this concept was poor. The rooms were musty, had bad temperature control and didn't appear to be the cleanest. Perhaps they were using colors/patterns typical to what was used and popular in 1907, but I think they could have made these fabrics a bit brighter to add liveliness to the rooms. This historical building also has small windows, so the designer should have kept this in mind when selecting the fabrics, colors and lighting techniques. The;2

What have could have been great experience ended up in a big disapointment. The whole style and website has a very positive spirit. And coming into the hotels is also very nice with the dressed employees. But the room......closet where you sleep in is very disapinting. It is a little more than 1,5 by 2,0 m with only a bed of 80 cm by 190 cm, The lounch bar will make this good. But the toilet on my floor was too dirty to sit on. Ok you can go to another place as man to the toilet. Because the lounge was very nice and there would be a DJ playing from 23PM I decided to come with my friends to the hotel. The bad thing was that we where rejected. Rekection is not a problem but how they treat you with rejecting you while you are a client in the building is really disapointing,;2
I loved the Hotel of Hollywood the first time I stayed here (April of 2011). But it seems like things are going downhill. The vending machines are not even close to being full and ate my money. I was woken up twice before 8 AM during my stay by the sound of construction and hammering by workers on my floor. (Front desk did not inform us of this upon checking in). The free breakfast was once perfect, however they changed things and now most of your time is spent waiting in line for an omelete to be made behind 15 other guests. The surrounding area is also not very good. I wouldn't reccomend walking around alone at night.;2
We arrived around 8:00 PM on May 26th. I went to check in while my husband waited in the car. Apparently during this time a valet had asked him if we were valet parking and my husband wasn't sure what I was going to pay for. So a manager came over and informed my husband that he believed self parking was full due to three wedding receptions being held at that time so to go ahead and pay for self parking, then if the lot was full, we could valet park for a cheaper price. Well, inside I was checking in with the front desk supervisor. She was very helpful and upgraded my room for free. We booked a 2 bed room, but when she found out it was only because the website wouldn't let us book a King room due to my son being 3. She moved us to a corner King room because it had more space.;2

I have stayed in many places in Manhattan (low/medium/high priced) and this was by far the most awful hotel experience I've had. Dirty rooms, an awful bathroom with peeling paint & a shower floor that made me wish I had my gym shower shoes,  totally overpriced and overrun by Fashion Week BS (parties, drunken nonsense, insane crowds). The maid service barely came (in fact, in the 4 nights/5 days I stayed my coffee/minibar service wasn't tended to at all).  You have to wait for an elevator for roughly 5-8 minutes.  There are so many other hotel options within an 8 block radius for equal prices. I will never stay at this hotel again.;2
The hotel is overpriced. The first room I received smelled was as if people were smoking inside at that very moment. I tried to call the front  desk to request a room change, but the in room phone did not work. I went back downstairs to the front desk, smelling like smoke, and asked for a different room. I was told that I would have to get a room on the business floor which was an additional fee. I had to except that, because it was no way I could spend another second in that smoky room. The location of the hotel was great, places to eat and the subway nearby. The people at the front desk were quite pleasant and helpful. Overall, the room and the bathroom needed an update and a thorough cleaning.;2
My friend and I stayed for 5 nights at this hotel .    We were disappointed because the room was very small and crowded.  It was said to have been recently renovated but the room was dark and shabby.  The furniture was of poor quality and the wardrobe was damaged.  The television was unwatchable because of poor reception.  There were no facilities to make tea or coffee and nowhere else to get a hot drink.  We did ask to be moved to another room which the hotel staff agreed to, and the alternative was a bit brighter and the tv worked.  The floor however had an interesting gradient, sloping up from one side to the other!  On the plus side, the standard of cleanliness was good and we always had fresh towels.  The hotel also claims to offer park views but I think the number of rooms;2

First time coming to new York and I loved the city. I'm very disappointed by the hotel bc it smelled like smoke. The pictures were nothing like the actual hotel. The elevator was very small and had a long wait. We couldn't find the stairs. They didn't even have flat screen tv. They didn't have central air, just the air conditioner that is in the window. We spent most of our time out of the hotel because it sucked. No housekeeping. They didn't have a parking deck. We looked at a brick wall when looking out the window.;2

I booked this hotel last minute. I read the reviews and thought Iâd take a chance for myself. Anyone waiting my review donât waste your money. The room was cold, you could not control your own temperature, the television was so old that it look like it was snowing on the few channels it had, and there was no extra blankets or pillows to be had because at  9 oâclock at night they were doing the laundry. The front desk people were nice but it wasnât enough to make up for the terrible old rooms that this hotel has.;2

They had a power failure the night before which extended well into the next booking day.  They could have notified us that there was a problem, rather than telling us that we couldn't check in for hours after arrival.  Once they finally allowed us to check in, they gave us the wrong room.  We had waited for hours to get in, so we just took our lumps and didn't complain until the next day.;2

The best thing about this property was the location to our friends who live locally. Room was quiet.  The front desk person was not friendly nor welcoming.  Elevators sometimes worked and if they did they took forever to get to your floor.  When we walked into our room we had one towel - one hand towel.  Shower could not maintain a specific temperature.  Carpet was ripped and needs replacement.  Wouldn't go back.;2

I travel to NYC monthly and stay at differrnt hotels.  First time staying at the empire.  As you come in its got a nice decorative lobby with a nice bar area and seating.  It's warm and cozy and nice.  Folks at the front desk are nice as well.  I won't speak for all rooms there but my queen room was tiny tiny as often many can be in NYC.  That would have been find but the AC which worked could not keep he room cool and they must know it as it was on full blast when I entered the room.  Nothing worse that sweating at night when you sleep.  The bed (mattress) was a brick it was so hard.  I might as well have slept on the floor.  Two of the four elevators were broken so the wait was very long.  The pool was closed and I heard from the cleaning people it was all summer.  its a nice;2

From outside, this hotel on New York's Upper West Side looks every bit the modern, sleek place you might expect from the highly respectable and very clean neighbourhood.  However inside you are greeted with extremely tired decor and service, which puts you more in mind of a Soviet prison, than of a New York hotel.  The building does not appear to have been designed as a hotel - in fact it does not seem to have been designed at all.  The corridors are tight and claustrophobic with stained white walls which look like an Okhrana execution chamber.  The elevator is old fashioned, slow and noisy, with a door you have to push.  Then we come to the room.  I am pleased to say that the sheets had definitely been changed and cleaned, which is good as they were the only part of the room;2
We had booked this hotel based on the reviews here. We were let down from the start as there was no driver to meet us at the airport as we had arranged and booked with the Riad. We tried to telephone them using our mobiles but there was no answer, we then had to find a taxi to take us to Riad Keheirredine, we had no dirhams and the taxi said it was no problem to take us there for 30 euros.  We had no clue and paid him cash, only to find out we were overcharged. The taxi driver obviously had no clue where to go, and after driving and asking people he dropped us which seemed in the middleof nowhere and pointed down a dark alley. We took out our suitcases and were obvioulsy at a loss what to do. We wondered around when some children approached us and offered to show us the way,;2

The Hollywood Hotel is nothing like the pictures they have posted on Priceline or their own website.  The only thing that looked the same was the fountain, but that was a disappointment because you can't even see the fountain from the front.  The fountain is actually located in the back of the hotel, in the parking lot.  I booked the hotel for a total of four people.  When I checked in, I was told they were going to charge me $30 for the extra two people because when I booked the room through Priceline, I supposedly only reserved the room for 2.  The man checking me in told me that it was okay that I had four people but then only two of us would be able to have breakfast the next morning.  So anyway since the breakfast was already included in the room price, two out of the four;2

The entrance is unique and really nice, however when enter the room it feels like you gone to jail. The rooms are very small and not up to an acceptable standard at all. The best part of this hotel is the location. I won't come back!;2
The customer service was fantastic! But that was about it. The rooms need a lot of help. The pillows felt like it was filled with cotton balls, the towels were scratchy and The shower handle was very difficult to turn on. My husband had to do it as it was stuck. The room was also very dated. Walls were yellow, wallpaper was peeling and parts of the ceiling were falling apart. The bathroom tile looked like it was painted to make it look clean. The site says itâs a 4 star hotel but I would only give it a 2. The staff was fantastic though. They did a great job. Needless to say I will not be returning.;2
Staff was friendly, helpful, best thing about the place. The pictures are misleading.  Remodeling going on, not all rooms created equal.  Gaps in tile/tub area allowing infestation ants, forcing me to live out of suitcase all week (they were in my drawers). Suggested solution was to spray insecticide. Beds were rock hard, and way too high off the floor--falling out of bed would be painful. No carpet or rugs, which makes for cleaner than carpet, but uncomfortable on bare feet. In older rooms, lots of outlets on lamp bases making recharging phones and laptops easy. Ticket box for parking area too recessed and close to gate to make it very difficult to use--a driver in front of us actually fell out of her car getting a ticket. Hall carpeting worn and stained. Elevator;2
This was by far one of my worst hotel experiences - from the moment of arriving to the moment of leaving. I booked my room through booking.com and got possibly the worst room in the hotel. The room was shabby, smelly, the size of a sardine can and looked on to a concrete wall. Luckily, the one kind and empathetic staff member, Michael at the Front Desk, heard my pain when I complained that I couldn't fold out my suitcase because the room was so tiny, so he moved me to a slightly larger, renovated room. There seems to be a two track system whereby a reservation through booking.com doesn't get you a renovated room. In addition, as I was checking in at 12:30pm, I was asked if I wanted my room (which was ready) right away. However, that came with a $50 price tag (before tax), which;2
My family and I have always stayed at this hotel due to the location. However, they have terrible customer service. They do not go above and beyond for their customers and I'm a Hilton Honors Platinum member for many years. The rooms are not as clean also, it looks run down. There were also carpet stains in the room and the shower was small. No spa services or kids activities also. We originally booked with my AAA discount and realized that it would make more sense to use the Kaiser rate w/ the continental breakfast included, and parking at a discounted rate.  We stayed for a Kaiser event at Universal Studios and also to celebrate Mother's Day. There was an error in my sister's booking in the room and they refused to help my sister out or to work something out with her. The;2

The pool is located in the car park  I will say it was clean   The bed squeaked so defo donât go on a honeymoon!  I would say this hotel is good for 1 night stay if just passing through, defo not somewhere to stay on vacation/holiday !;2
Stayed here for work last week and could not wait to leave.  While the hotel lobby is nice and buzzing (the bar was probably the best part of the hotel), the rooms leave a great deal to be desired. This hotel is in great deal of refurbishment.  Walls were scuffed and showed signs of dirt.  While I was given an upgrade to a very nicely sized room upon arrival, there was more surface area in need of attention.  Bathrooms are tiny and lacking light and surface storage space.  Closets do not have doors, and like the bathrooms, the storage access is probably high for people of smaller stature.  Doors should be given dampeners as they close quite loudly.    Location is ideal for Lincoln Center, but something a subway stop away at these rates would have been better worth it for me.;2
The room was nice, a bit on the small side, but that is to be expected in Manhattan. I could sit on the toilet, shower and wash my hands at the same time: the bathroom is that small.  The pros: wonderful location, right across from Lincoln Center and a few blocks from Central Park. It is also very accessible to public transit: the subway is 2 blocks away and there are several bus stops within a 3 block radius.  The cons: spotty internet that you have to pay for. Loud noises at ungodly hours (and this is not counting the city traffic noises like honking and sirens since Broadway is right there). Unreliable water from the shower. We didn't even have water on the last day of our stay and that is just unacceptable.;2
Soul-less hotel, a good location but that is all. We had to queue for check-in (despite there being two desks, only 1 was manned). Our room was large but had the smallest window, meaning we had to have the light on in the day. We were woken multiple times during the night by outside noise.  Breakfast was chaotic and quantity over quality.  We were double charged at the bar for drinks (staff members mistake) and despite the transactions showing on our account (on our bankâs app) we were told to return the next day to prove that we had actually been charged! Weâve stayed at many Premier Inns over the years and always found them very good but next time we return to London, weâll stay anywhere but the Premier Inn County Hall!;2
Nice rooms, poor customer service. Several instances of unavailable items expected from a regular hotel such as umbrellas, bottle opener, utensils and needing to go down to retrieve them ourselves. Bathroom cup and towel was dirty. Nice club lounge.;2
My room 140 is really niozy. Outside air conditioning machine runs all night. It is stressful and I can't Sleep well. Out side noize comes inside easily. No bath tub. That is reason for I said too expensive  to stay. The cost is $500 for two night.;2
"I picked this hotel because of all the positive reviews noted already on Trip Advisor.   I just did'nt feel the positive reviews were all that justified.  First of all when our driver tried to find the building we were able to locate the street address but the building said nothing about ""Your Stay - Central Park"".  Instead it just said ""Tempo"".  I went in and the desk clerk confirmed we were in the right place.  The Hotel is NOT located on Central Park as the name implies but is really about 4 blocks west of Central Park.  Not a huge deal but still a little misleading.  The room was REALLY SMALL!  Only 1 person could pass by the small sofa to get to the main area from the entrance.  The COMMODE had a plumbers helper beside it.  I later learned why as it did indeed get backed";2
We chose this hotel because we were flying out of LAX the next day so we only stayed here for one night. Our first room was disgusting with stains all over the carpet, couch, and counters. We called and they said the hotel was sold out for the night, but somehow were still able to move us to a new room (not really sure how that works). The new room was better, but the counters were still dirty with coffee stains and other marks. It just seemed like they came in to switch the sheets (hopefully) and that was it for cleaning. It seemed like the rooms were updated recently but get a lot of use and housekeeping isn't able to keep up. We would definitely pick a new hotel if in the area again.  Pros: close to airport, 24/7 shuttle, Starbucks coffee in room, big TV  Cons:  very dirty;2

No thermostats in the rooms. Just a fan to set on either HI or LOW. Rooms were musty smelling. Bellman/Doorman almost got in a fight with the limo driver who came to pick us up. Our driver had to ask other cars to move out of the way. When he asked the bellman why THEy weren't doing it, they got defensive and confrontational. They acted in an extremely unprofessional manor.;2

This hotel unfortunately didnât do justice to the 4 stars it holds. The only positive aspect was the location. The room was way too small and the bed felt small for two people. Also the bathroom is super old with an old bathtub. Also thereâs no tea/coffee or even minibar in the room. Super unhappy.;2

I can see now why there are mixed review s. Originally I stayed on the executive level.   I had paid for a regular.  That was pleasant.  The tv and wifi wasn't working. But at least everything seemed cleaned and comfortable and what I would expect of a 3 star hotel.  But then they moved my room which is basically any room below the 12th floor.  My bed is a double when they say it's a queen.  The wallpaper is molded and coming off.  My bed sheets barely fit and are ripped. The carpet smells like smoke even though apparently this is non smoking.  And the air conditioning takes up the whole window which makes this room seem even smaller.  Plus the wifi and tv are STILl not working.  Thank goodness I'm out of here tomorrow.  It cannot come soon enough. The thing is if the concierge;2
we were very apprehensive about staying at the Days Inn after reading the reviews on this website so we prepared for the worst.  Upon arriving the reception staff to our surprise were not rude at all and in fact were very helpful. We were apparently given a refurbished room ( I hate to think what it looked like prior to refurbishment) which was better than expected.  We did have an alarm clock and the sheets were clean but we were a bit unsure about the top blankets.  The bath was ok but could have been cleaner and the floor definately looked like it could have done with a clean.  One word of advice is not to take your best white towel as once it has been taken by the cleaners along with all the other towels, you will not be able to get it back.   Also be careful with the lady;2

I would not recommend staying here, however as a base just to explore the city it is fine, staff are friendly and the central park is right opposite! However if is out the centre of the city, I'd I returnes I would splash out a bit more cash on a hotel, especially in the summer months as a roof top pool that we went to was really welcomed! (Gandavault) the rooms are very small but are clean! If you on a budget, it's not a bad choice, but I would recommend investing in better!;2

We stayed 5 nights at the Empire Hotel and on our first night our room was right next to the elevator which was quite noisy. The room was also shaped in a triangle and it was not only very, very small but because of the room shape we could barely open our suitcases. The next morning, we asked reception if we could move to another room mainly due to the elevator noise. Reception advised they did not have another room however when we pushed the matter they eventually found us another room to move to. We were moved to another room which was also very small but at least in a square shape and not next door to the elevator! The hotel is in a very good location however the reception staff are not very friendly and as described the rooms are exceptionally small. We are normally not very;2

"I one time read a post from a hotel in Costa Rica I was considering. It stated that in Costa Rica 4 star hotels are different and can be considerably more rustic than 4 star hotels in other part of the world. I am now a few days removed from my stay at the Wyndham New Yorker and am still pondering if the Wyndham New Yorker considers itself on the same spectrum as Costa Rican hotels. Let me begin by stating that this hotel charges a $22 fee upon check in, in addition to what you pay to spend the night, for honestly no reason. They state it is for wifi and gym, etc, but frankly charging for wifi is very 2008 and not conducive to what modern hotels should provide its guest. The most appalling thing about this $22 ""hotel fee"" is that upon check out, if you would like to walk around";2

I stayed at this hotel which at the time was listed as 3 star, I would say it is probably a 1 or 2 star. Although it was clean, that's pretty much all I could say for it. The noisy pipes kept me up ALL night, I seriously have not slept so badly in all my life and I live in Central London so I am used to noise, but repetitive banging that ranges in tempo and times is like being in a torture chamber. The room size is small but that didn't bother me, but it got really hot, there is an air conditioning unit, but it is very noisy and level with my side of the bed, as soon as you turned it off it was boiling hot again. The staff weren't particuarly friendly or un-friendly, they were mostly indifferent. When I complained about the noise, they said they couldn't do anything about it. I;2
Well, it was our first time in NY, a business trip and we took out kids (infant and 7y.) Not used to this type of buildings... We booked a suite, to our surprise a very tight room, very small bathrooms not modern, more like public restrooms. A friend in another room saw a rat in his room. Not the best place... Small lobby. It has a nice burgers restaurant we went. The building has its history and a small museum. The place is noisy but I guess its the city... The thing we most liked was the view, the Empire State right in front!;2

I stayed in a Junior Suite between July12-15 and wanted to let you know about our stay. First I would love to say I loved the Hotel and location, but there were some major issues I think need to be addressed for a 4 star Hotel that we paid a premium price to stay at.  We arrived around 10pm the first night and was drilled by one of the bar door staff as why we were there. I looked at him and asked him why would we be carrying luggage into a hotel and he again asked why we were there. After telling him we were Hotel Guests arriving after a very long trip we pushed by him and went to the front desk.  We arrived in our room after speaking with the very friendly counter staff and requested sheets and pillows for the pull out bed. I had to call housekeeping again an hour later;2

We stayed here for 6 nights, we arrived at 1am and were made to wait 10 - 15 minutes to check in which the reception staff pretended we weren't there. The door man had to go look for her twice before she came out to help us.  We had requested a King Room when we booked, only to find that we had been given a double bed, which the girl at reception insisted was a Queen and the they do not even offer King Rooms to people who had booked through the company we had booked through. Our room key hardly ever worked, which meant we had to run down from the 11th floor two to three times a day to have a new card reissued.   The hotel did not provide a fridge in the room, instead you have to pay $25 to have the privilege.  The only thing going for it was the washing room on the second floor,;2

We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days in December. Our room was tiny, the size of a walk-in closet. The first night, we woke up at 6:30 am to two employees bickering loudly next door. The second day, we returned to the hotel at around 11:30 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes (as if someone has smoked in our room). On our last day, as I was brushing my teeth, the water from the sink came out BROWN. This is the most disgusting experience Iâve ever had at a hotel. I am very surprised this happened at a 4-star hotel.   Putting all of this aside, the room smelled bad in general, the bathroom was dirty, and the TV didnât work properly. Safe to say I will never stay at this hotel again.;2

We were very disappointed with the way this hotel nickeled and dimed us because we have never found that to be the case with NYC hotels. We reserved one room at the regular price and when we called ahead to request that the room have 2 double beds rather than 1 king, we were told that there would be an additional $70 fee for the double beds! I have to say that was a first for me as we always request 2 double beds when staying at hotels and have never been charged more for it since the room is the same size.  The in-room coffee maker was another example because in order to make 1 small cup of coffee in the room it costs you $3.00.  Again, every hotel I stay at allows you to use the in-room coffee maker as a courtesy. The location is very good, but the unexpected extra charges,;2

I chose this hotel because it was close to LAX, and they had a shuttle. Lesson learned Hyatt Regency. The room wasnât ready... I check in at around 11pm. The room was dirty (food and stains) and the toiletries were half empty or used... no one answered the phone after trying to call down four times... I couldnât get out of here fast enough... the bed sucks too!;2
"Pretentious and commercialized, I didn't get the impression they cared about their guests. Arrived about 45 minutes early and were made to come back later to check in. The room had damaged walls in the bathroom, a broken patio door and ants crawling along the floor. We don't tend to complain about these trifling things. However, be careful if you stay here because they make you sign away all your rights to sue them if anything goes wrong. The pool was nice, but there is a sign above it saying they use cancer-causing chemicals in the water. They take an unannounced $100 ""security deposit"" which they say you might not get back for up to 5 days after you leave. There's a note at reception saying if this causes you to incur overdraft fees then they will not be liable. If you are";2

I was really excited to stay at The Jane after looking at the website and seeing the vintage style and art deco decor.  Me & my friend were on the second leg of a trip to Toronto and New York and had been travelling for 12 hours on a Greyhound and just wanted to dump our bags, get a shower and get back out to see the sights.    When we got there the hotel staff were really friendly, helpful and speedy.  We got up to our floor and got a bit lost with the layout.  The number of the room was not on the key so it got a bit confusing when we got the room number wrong.    We got to the room and could not believe how small it was!  There was the two bunk beds and then about a foot of space in between the beds and the wall/mirror.  Therefore we couldn't get dressed at the same time.;2

Although we were very tired from the drive, me & my husband went to universal studio and start our 2 day pass.  At around 2pm, we decided to go back to the hotel to check in and also to refresh ourselves.  Unfortunately, they didnt check us in until 4 pm (passed the check in time which is 3pm).

The check-in easy, The rooms are small, they include to drawers one with the safe in and a storage for a case at one side under the bed and a ledge over the bed. The room as a Tv, dvd, and a fan + air con. There are hook around the room but you would need to take your own coat hangers to hang your clothes up. The bed was ok for what you pay.  The Noise from the main road near the Hudson, i could hear from about 6.30 in the morning until around 10.00 at night. At the weekends you could hear people from the club till about 2.00 am. So not great for sleeping. I found the front desk hit or miss depending which staff were on. On the good side the Door staff friendly and helpful with tips on the area, The Room and the shower and toilet areas always clean. The cleaning and door staff;2
We have used this hotel on a number of occasions before and always found it good. However having just spent two nights there I doubt that we will ever return.  The hotel is in the mid-price range for NYC but its great advantage is its position which is very near Central Park,  next door to the Lincoln Centre  and close to major shops and Columbus Circle.  This time the standard of service had declined very significantly and to get anything took such an effort.  For example four phone calls and a four hour wait to get bed linen for the sofa bed, broken air con which was repaired but only after two phone calls, delays in check in which meant we could only get access to our room after waiting for over an hour beyond the stated stated check-in time.  The standard of maintenance in;2

Book this hotel if you're looking for a good location in Manhattan, it's a close walk from Times Square and Broadway shows... And that's about it. If you book through Expedia be prepared to pay an extra $30 per person per night the moment you arrive as a 'facilities fee', which gives you access to the wifi, business center and gym. You have to pay it even if you're not gonna use any of these. The staff look disinterested and never seem to be wanting to help. I asked for very simple things like getting an extra set of bedsheets (they never arrived to the room), wanted to pick up a package that arrived in the mail (mail room was closed) and wanted a receipt for the $300 I paid for the facility fee (never happened). To finish it up, they charge you $2 per piece for looking after;2

Hostel was clean and tidy. TV room and Garden were nice. I was staying in a private room with a bathroom and the bathroom showers were great. The rooms had a fridge and crockery. Plus plenty of wall sockets. Excellent location near Hammersmith tube station and shops.  On arrival I stood waiting to be served, there were two men on the check in desk. One was serving the other appeared busy. The first man then finished serving but did not serve me but put his head down. I waited but they did not serve me for several minutes. If they were busy with would have been polite for them to acknowledge me and say they would be a moment.

Not a great experience. Pretty much a below average experience. Much of the staff acted like they were doing you a favor by being there. The room we had was large but, the carpet was filthy. WAY overpriced for what you get. I realize its a Hilton and they are expensive but, this is pretty much out of line, especially if you have kids. If I did this again, I'd get a place a few miles away and save a few $$$$.;2
"The hotel is tired and needs updating. It's not up to the standard of modern hotels and it feels like it's stuck in the 70s / 80s.

There are much better New York hotels for the same price.";2

The room was described Standard 200sq feet  but we felt it much more smaller. Okay it is NY. But they had some in-room facility problems:  1. the heater was not adjustable and very old that it is too noisy and powerful to dry everything out (we had to hang wet towels around the room). 2. One part of the shower booth door was not there. and It seemed like as if they have intentionally left the hand-held shower not working in order for guests to use the other shower from the ceiling only : not to have too much water splashed in the bathroom.  3. They charge you  12.5 dollar/day  for the room wi-fi, and;2

My husband and I stayed here last May, had a great view from our room.  The 'art deco' bathroom was very small and basic.

We visited NY between Xmas and New Year 2005 and as it was a last minute thing we didn't have much choice of hotels in our price range. Astor on the Park is a boutique style hotel, a bit far out which could be expensive if you don't use the subway and use Taxi's instead. I found it small but clean. The heating system was VERY noisy and I woke up at 4.30 each morning to clanking. We did have a bizarre experience the first night. We went to bed and woke to find water pouring through the ceiling. We immediately called reception and they changed us to a different room but after just travelling for nearly 24 hours door to door it wasn't what we needed. The next day I complained and they tried to tell me that if I had any issues I had to go through our agent (Lastminute) which seemed;2

Booked on Hotels.com - pay at property.  Used a card to hold the reservation as required and assured that I could use any payment at the hotel.  The day before check-in the original card was charged.  I immediately called and said I want to use a different card for payment, was assured that I could.  When I got to the hotel the friendly front desk person issued a refund and charged the correct card.  I was assured that the refund will take 2-3 days.  Three days later, still no refund.  Called the front desk again today and was told that the refund would not take 7-10 days.  So the hotel has $646.00 for a $323.00 stay.  I will think twice about booking with Hotels.com and using my credit cards at hotels.;2
I was told the hotel has a policy to not turn on the heat until November 1st.  Our visit was the first weekend of October when it was rainy, windy and cold (50 degrees) so the room was uncomfortably cold.  In addition, the window was not a secure fit so the wind whistled through the window all the night.  I would recommend against staying there in the fall because on a cold, damp day it is going to be an unpleasant experience.;2
Just checked in here tonight for five nights and wishing we hadn't paid ahead. The main attraction for my teenage daughter I'm travelling with was the very cool looking rooftop pool and hang out area that is plastered all over the promotional material. But it's closed for the season - despite it being 80 deg forecast for the next two days! Go figure that one! We booked the junior suite thinking it would be spacious but the pokey bathroom has a shower with no closing screen, so the bathroom floor is a pool of water and the toilet and toilet paper get soaked. And the view is of a brick wall opposite. All round pretty unimpressed.;2
We just came back from NYC after spending a night at the Empire, for christmas. I've been wanting to stay at this hotel for awhile, but the service was so disappointing. We went up to our room, and i immediately noticed it was very cold inside, we tried to turn on the heater, but it just kept blowing cold air. A called the front desk and a woman said someone will be up shortly to fix it. Oh and the tv wasn't working, and there were no glasses or cups to brew a coffee... so half an hour later still no one showed up to fix the heater. We went down to reception, to speed up the process. Didn't help, so next time we went to the reception i was ready to just check out and get another hotel, i was so upset. Instead of enjoying the city, on a christmas eve we were stuck at the cold;2
I have done extensive traveling. Rarely have I paid 500 bucks a night for a hotel room except at Farimount properties. I know that NYC is not priced to most standards but 500 bucks should still carry with it an expectation of well-above-average standards. The only good thing about it was the location. As soon as I walked in I got a bad vibe. The decor was dark, heavily draped and dingy. The deluxe premium room was small, had one chair and again the decor was brown/black. There was a full shower with half of a shower door so water went everywhere. There was a sink but it was 2 inches deep so water went everywhere. there was no counter space and the whole thing annoyed me.The street noise was typical but the hotel patrons were beyond noisy! For 500 bucks a night I expected a;2

First, let me say the rate for the West Village is reasonable. However, I had booked this for an early fall trip to the city.  The one feature that made me select this hotel was the rooftop bar with the view.  Unfortunately, upon arrival I was greeted with scaffolding at the front entrance and was told the rooftop bar would not be open until Thurs & Friday.  I had arrived on a Wed.  OK, so that's fine.  I even told the front desk that if we experienced some noise from our captains cabin, it would be no problem.  On Thursday, I was told it was closed for a private event and Friday I was told it was closed for the season.  There is no mention of this on their website.  So no rooftop view for me.  On the other hand, the accomodations were very satisfactory for the most part.  The;2
Stayed in room 112, noticed right away that the bathroom needed some work. Attempted unsuccessfully to cancel our reservation. A closer inspection revealed very small ANTS in the bathroom! Because the lights in the bathroom were bright you could easily see them, that was not the case in the rest of the room. I have no idea if they were anywhere else. The bathroom was in need of repair. The bottom of the door was rotting, tiling, grouting and caulking needed to be done. Even the TV connection was poor.  We stayed the night and requested a room change in the morning. The staff was very accommodating, and didn't charge us for parking for our 2 nights. The next room, 123, looked much better. The TV worked properly, the bathroom looked better. Unfortunately, if you spent any time in;2

This hotel has notoriously bad elevators.  I get there, push the button and wait for 12 minutes.  Nothing.  I walk to the front desk, they radio ""its happening again"" to someone and instruct me to go back.  There is a person actually running the elevators that greets me in the elevator lobby.

We recently stayed at the Hilton to be close to Universal Studios. They have a shuttle service that picks up about every 10 minutes to take you to Universal Studios/City Walk which was very nice. The hotel has a nice lobby, but the rooms could just use a little bit of updating.  Our first problem was the early check in at 3:00p.m.  It did not happen-we had to sit around for 1 hour before our room was ready. This was hard with 3 kids. We were tired and just wanted to relax in our room. The front desk clerks never seemed happy-but the valets were always cheerful.  The other problem we had  was staying on the Executive Level. Our room and elevator keys never worked, leaving us to have to go to the front desk 6 times to have our room/elevator keys reactivated.  Every time we went to;2
I get it...most NYC hotels are a revolving door, literally & figuratively and it's difficult for hotels to be refurbished. The room my daughter & I checked into was dreary, extremely noisy from the street especially at night. So noisy that I bought a fan from the store to cover the noise and lackluster A/C performance.The bathroom was moldy and the shower leaked all over the floor and lacked an exhaust fan. I was willing to overlook all of this and just write off our selection of this hotel as a mistake until my daughter experienced a severe medical emergency while in the hotel. She was having an allergic reaction to a baked good purchased elsewhere & was in the hotel lobby waiting for the ambulance when her boyfriend needed to administer her EpiPen. Because she was at risk for;2

They did not come. I requested again 2107. Jared replied 2215 and said they would send them up. They did not come. I had to wait 10 minutes in the lobby to request them the next morning. Later, a polite gentleman with zero command of English brought towels to the room. We had to use pictures to figure out what I was asking for. He then brought back robes... the most absurdly scratchy, cheap robes I have ever felt.   The room rate;2

BE AWARE: The street in front of the hotel is under major construction and will be for a while.  It will be your alarm clock at 6 am...it is relentless. This time was the worst.

My partner and I stayed here four nights in early July, with immediate regrets in booking. The plus points are close to Hammersmith Underground, pubs, restaurants and shops, located on a quieter street off busy Hammersmith Road but that's about it. Our room was generally clean and equipped with a fridge, small freezer, bowls, plates and cutlery. There were a few kitchen facilities on the first floor but no pots or pans to cook with on the hobs. Separate shower rooms are passable but shared by both sexes. And now for the downsides... bad customer service at reception, dark and dour landings and corridors, noisy doors and no sound proofing between rooms, wifi has to be bought at crazy rates, we were asked to keep our door closed on Saturday evening by what we assume was a member;2

The bathroom was very small and the shower was very difficult to turn on, off and get the temperature right.  The worst part...there was a clanging noise off and on all of the time.

Water - 6 bucks, a mini bar full off liquor and soda at ridiculous prices - which looks like a fridge, a testy of snacks on the desk, and 3 bucks each for keurig cup. Oh wifi is extra too. For 349 a night there should have been at least free coffee! Never staying here again.;2
This hotel loves to nickel and dime you. Rooms are okay, but the 2 doubles are just small enough to be a pain if you are trying to double up. The breakfast that they say is included if you are a Hilton Gold member changes from morning to morning depending on who serves you. One day it was free, the next day they charged me $40. Very frustrating and of course happened the morning we were trying to get into the park. If all you want is a place to walk to and from the park, it works great. Itâs a lot of money for a nightâs stay. I would recommend stay the night before you go to the park. Get the express passes, see the park in one day and stay somewhere else that treats their customers better. We stayed 2 nights too many...;2

Hotel looks fines but has so many short fallings. Good clean room no A/c  . beautiful patio  that could cool room, but filled with smokers so I couldn't have the door open. Good breakfast.

"Spent few nights here on Sep 2006 with my wife. Hotel is very basic with only minimal services (no restaurant, minibar or wi-fi). Room was very small but clean without much storage space. Air-conditioning unit was very loud and we had to turn it off for the night. The toilet got also clogged once, but was fixed quite quickly. Staff was friendly and gave good advice on local restaurants etc.   The location of the hotel is a bit far away from the ""tourist area"" of NYC but also quite quiet and peaceful with the Central Park right opposite the entrance. Nearest subway station is about 5 mins walk from the hotel.  OK for few nights, but wouldn't recommend for a longer visit.";2
The room was badly in need for a update. Bathroom is really small. Bathroom door was broken. Tables and furniture were badly worn. Wallpaper was peeling. I just plain out expected more. Hope there is a revamp soon.;2
Just got back from this hotel yesterday. This was my 3rd visit to New York and probably my last. Previously stayed near grand central and on 42nd street/Times Square.  Chose this hotel for the location and it was part of a virgin holidays deal with lounge access at Heathrow.  Arrived at JFK (what a joke immigration is!) and got the air train and LIRR straight to Penn station in half an hour.  Reception allowed us to check in early for no fee into our queen metro room ( did ask about upgrading but for $65+ tax per night didnât bother). Corridors to the room looked like something from American horror story (the hotel one) and the room was very small. It was clean enough but very tatty and rough around the edges but we were told the other side of the hotel had been upgraded and;2
We booked the New Yorker and werenât greeted when we arrived. We were confronted to stand and take a photo for a temperature check without any explanation or at least a âWelcome to the New Yorker, please stand here for your temper check.â The staff in general were dismissive, dry, and it felt like we were intruding on their space. We booked a stay at Arlo Soho for the remainder of our trip because we refuse to pay for services that are subpar. The best part of the NewYorker was exiting with our luggage in hand and 3 staff members watching us leave without even saying thank you for coming. Weâve never experienced hotel service as such. We just checked in to Arlo Soho and the experience was night and day, as it should be. However, I appreciate the clean room and hot shower.;2

The hotel is very misleading. When I got there and checked in itâs a very small room and smelled like cigarettes and a panel was off from wall for one of the lights. Was given another room. Beds are very hard and definitely need to updated. This hotel needs to do some serious upgrades. Itâs nice they were paining as I was there at least. New remotes would be good as well and Iâd suggest keeping the actual backings and not taping them down. Nice staff and thatâs the highlight of the hotel. It could be so much better.;2

"After a not so comfortable flight and a stressful experience at JFK, we were looking forward to getting to the hotel that promised top notch service, beautiful rooms and fabulous views.  Well....  We were checked in by Lynn who I donât think could have cared less about us if she tried. There were 4 of us in total; two couples and my friend had crutches. There was no âhello. Welcome. How are you? How was your journey?â or anything of the sort. She was incredibly rude right from the off when answering the simplest of queries and it seemed like everything was a real chore for her. There was another guest next to us who was making a complaint to a different receptionist and I saw her and Lynn exchange signs of exasperation and rolling their eyes between each other. I have never";2
The hotel staff are are charming and helpful, friendly and efficient.  The location is near perfect.  The rooms though are tiny, but the most important things is that they are run-dawn.  In my latest stay, the curtains were stained, the flooring was filthy at corners and seams, the window ledge is truly disgusting.  The furniture is cracked, and nicked and in need of replacement.  Bed is comfortable but whole gestalt makes one worry about cleanliness,  Overall, you are paying for the location and the rooms themselves pretty awful-- in need of repair and complete renovation.  On top of that they charge for the in-room coffee.;2
I stayed here last week. I got the email for upgrading my room for extra few bucks. THE EMAIL CLEARLY STATES that the upgraded room will be having Stunning NYC views of the Empire State Building or the Hudson River.    After i paid extra bucks for the upgrade..I got the room on 27th floor. But the room has no view of Empire state building nor of Hudson river..I could have stayed in the ordinary room without any view. The view I got from my room was just of an apartment building..In fact we got the room facing opposite to Empire state building..No way we can get the view of it from my room...Was very disappointing..Wasted my money on a upgrade which was no where an upgrade..My family was totally disappointed with the room.

Whilst our stay in New York was fantastic, our experience with Astor on the Park was less than desirable.  The rooms were tiny and the smoking rooms were unbearable to spend even one minute in. We are smokers and even we couldn't cope with the smell. There was no window that could be opened so we asked for a non smoking room and did our smoking outside.   The phones in the rooms (in the whole hotel) were down for three days and no attempt was made by management to recify the problem. I was told that I could purchase a phone card if I wanted to. Family at home were upset because they were ringing and unable to contact us. I had to have a heated disageement with reception staff before they would agree to provide us with phone cards at their expense.  The drink machine was out of;2
I stayed at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City the week of November 17, 2008 for a business trip.  My initial impression of the hotel was favorable, as the staff were very courteous, the room was spacious and I received a complimentary fruit basket on my first night there.  However, upon waking up the first morning, I found bed bugs in my bed.  This was a horrifying and unwelcome surprise at 5:30 AM.  I immediately called the front desk and was put on hold for 10 minutes, after which I explained the situation to the night supervisor and requested to be given another room immediately.  During this conversation with the night supervisor, at no time did she apologize, although she did agree to provide another room by 6:30 AM.  Upon moving to my new room, I inspected the bed;2
OK, it is quite difficult to find a hotel in NYC that is somehow affordable and provides a room that has an adequate size. New Yorker Wyndham charged me USD 460 incl. tax and fees per night - and all I got was a broom closet. Impossible to place your suitcase or even backpack somewhere, the room was immediately no longer walkable. Windows were drafty, so I had to position the extra pillows in front of the window to avoid Nanga Parbat temperatures. Location is good, staff is more or less friendly but the entire facility urgently needs a refurbishment. After checkout I wanted to leave my 2 bags with the concierge for a couple of hours and after having paid USD 1.380 for my three nights the hotel charged me an additional 10 USD for the storage. As a frequent traveller I never;2
Doorman, Jeff and clerk Mathew were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast at the hotel had pastries at least a day old and hardly edible. The room, was small and the mattress was too small for the base and one could easily damage a foot getting around it as there was very little room between the bed and the wall. These need replacing to fit the mattresses. There should be a restaurant in a hotel of this size but it seems the owners have no wish to spend any money on the hotel.;2

I would say that the whole place needs a face-lift. The elevators are ancient.  Only two of them were operational. Rest two were out of order. It would take you 15 minutes to reach the lobby from the 11th floor. You can hear the bathroom taps running. The rooms are shabby too. The view leaves a lot to be desired.The positive thing about the hotel is its good location. Staff is extremely helpful. Nearness to the subway is another merit.

Our bed had strained sheets and cover. We asked it to be changed and left a hand written note but it was not done. There was rubbish from the previous guests behind the bin and the service down in the restaurant at breakfast was disgusting.  We were also woken up in the middle of the night by someone from the front desk with the wrong room, we received no apology! We would not recommend this hotel.;2
We paid  more than our usual for a three night visit and got the suite overlooking the Hudson.   They didn't tell us our two windows would be totally blocked with scaffolding,  broom, tarps, cement debris. My husband waited in line at the front desk to try and change our room.   They kept putting him off to come back later.   We came back after a tour the second day and everyone in the hotel was out on the side walk due to a elevator fire.   The security was very good.  You had to show your room key to get to the elevators.  The suite was nice, full dining room table, couch and chairs,  two tvs,  a wet bar.  But the bathroom was very tiny and cramped.  They never changed our room after all the waiting in line.  They finally gave us $20 off per night and took off the facility;2

The hotel itself was quite nice , clean and had large rooms but the location is terrible. I was genuinely afraid to step out of the place after sunset , during the night there was constant sirens of police cars passing by and I felt like I was in the ghettos.I would never stay here again.;2
Although the city was incredible, unfortunately the hotel was not. The hotel sign was not even fully working, and then we got to our room. The bathroom door was a mess, the shower appeared to be missing a door and the blinds were stained. No member of staff we spoke to introduced their names throughout our whole stay and some werenât very helpful either. Upon initially entering the reception, I was very excited as this is an interesting environment that I was excited to experience however our room was extremely disappointing. The only saving grace for the hotel is that we were able to spend every second possible away from our room and the city is the most spectacular I have ever seen!;2

From the location point of view, yes, it is great however for a Hilton, our experience was poor.  First of all if they give you a room on the second floor, go back and ask for a change of room straigh away. There is come sort of heavy machinery or a massive laundry area working 24/7 and you wont be able to sleep.  When we got there they changed our room so not very happy about it. No free bottle of water in the room get your own or be ready to pay for them.     The service when you go to the restaurant for breakfast is poor and they believe that is ok to treat people with disrespect so we had to make a point there.

I tried to like this place, as I like to give all establishments I visit a fair chance. I usually do not comment on hospitality service, as I like to think of myself as someone who's not very demanding-- I'm usually and easily pleased, and I don't ask for much, if at all. I only note when I feel that there has been an indelible deficiency. Perhaps they're overworked or understaffed that particular night (11 January), but I felt that the staff at the front desk at the time that I checked in (around 9.30pm on a busy evening) did not provide me with a particularly warm welcome, as they seemed impatient. They were certainly not impolite (and neither was I), but I felt uncomfortably rushed for no reason, as if I was a nuisance instead of a guest.   My room was rather roomy and;2

This hotel is in a nice location and has a pretty lobby.  The room was small but typical for New York City. It has contemporary decor in the room which at first glance looked fine.  But our room had an extremely noisy inconsistent heater. It had a broken keurig machine and no cups to use with it. We stopped at the front desk and they said they would send cups up. After waiting awhile I called down to the desk and they told me housekeeping didnât have any. There was no hairdryer in the room. Our friends in another room had a hairdryer which did not work.

"Stayed at the two person bunkbed room in Sep/Oct '15.  Having stayed in numerous cheaper rooms in NYC before, including both bunkbed and shared bathroom options, I must say that these rooms were just too small for my liking.   Approximately 4-5 square meters, no private sink, and with no possibility to put suitcases beneath the bed.   For the 6 nights we stayed the room was cleaned only once.   Not a huge problem, perhaps, but at least having the thrashcan emptied more often would have been OK.  It was quite humid a few days in NYC this time, and that definitely did not add to the attractiveness of a tiny room.    On the positive side; Location, very friendly employees, price!  And no problems with the the shared bathrooms, usually no lines.";2
Rooms are the size  of a shoebox no safety box no mini bar. The bathtub and bathroom walls had hair stuck in them, I complained but still were left there after they did the room. Every employee except for the security people I dealt with were unfriendly. Walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors.  Also I must have called the operator on 5 different occasions,  and there was no answer.  I asked for directions at the  information desk and was treated pretty rudely. Checkout was unfriendly also. The hotel was not cheap  , I was expecting at least a 2 star place. Wyndham seriously needs to review  this property  and better train employees.;2
Horrible neighborhood, outdated NOISY room. I stayed here two nights because there was nothing in downtown LA. It was terrible. Both nights I was woken up by loud people - I think they were even staff. The place needs some work. Alot of it. And I think I paid over $200/night. Awful. I also asked them to call me a cab and I got some shady character who wouldn't take a credit card because he claimed he was in a hurry.;2
The Jane is quirky and bohemian-- just like many parts of the surrounding neighborhood-- and that's fun. But it's also pretty tired-- from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms. And it's cramped. And dark. We stayed in a Captain's Cabin with double bed-- smaller than a queen size bed but not too small-- and a private bathroom. There was one small window-- really small because a good chunk of it was given over to the air conditioning unit.  If you really want the bohemian feeling this may be the place for you. Given the expense-- and what you get for it-- we'll stay elsewhere.;2
Impressive structure and very clean hotel.   -) LOCATION: nothing is better compared it, if you want to catch your flight  -) SERVICE: The check-in and -out process is outstanding. I reserved for the wrong day, and they fixed it in a second.  -) ROOM: Unfortunately, it did not maintain the expectations of a 4 stars hotel: large but with very tiny bathroom, TV not smart, and window a bit antiquated.  -) BREAKFAST: continental but limited for a titanic hotel as this. Would it be covid the reason?! I want to think soâ¦;2
the internet was not working at all and the rooms are not clean, carpet is frankly disgusting and I wouldn't walk on it without shoes but it's cheap and they do offer smoking rooms and the staff is pleasant. it's better than the Hotel Pennsylvania but that place is a total nightmare.;2
"I was there June 2014, and had a lot of troubles: I had a problem with the booking, and the staff (except one) was ridiculously unhelpful in several situations. The room was tidy but there was a strong smell of polish. There was mold in the shower and in my room at the windows. The mattress was saggy. The room was very loud (at least until midnight). I give 2 instead of 1 points, because there are a few ""pro""s: -> The area (Hammersmith) is quite okay (e.g. not dangerous at night) -> There were no real bad things like theft etc. -> I could get a room ~ 1 week before arrival";2
"We had a room facing into the inner courtyard and at around 6am there was a lot of noise coming from here. Men shouting, banging and crashing (could hear beer kegs being moved around). This woke us up and I use ear plugs. As we checked out we said this to the reception staff and they were very dismissive and said it was nothing to do with them. We asked about the good night's sleep guarantee and she said as it wasn't their fault and it was the morning (d therefore not the night) the guarantee doesn't apply. She was very defensive and borderline aggressive. The one thing she said was ""you should have asked for a quiet room when you checked in, we have some quiet rooms"". We are not the sort of people to complain and have never left a negative review of a hotel but we feel we have";2
The hotel definitely isn't situated in the best part of town but it was not scary/dangerous as other reviews make it seem. Would I stay with young kids? Probably not, but as a mother-daughter, adult duo we felt okay.   Despite requesting a quiet room at booking, we were placed on the noisier side and had the hassle of moving after the first night. Across the board the customer service was not great - a general lack of courtesy/desire to help. Our second room was much nicer and quieter. We did not have any issues with cleanliness in either room.   The breakfast was very nice. The hotel was <5 minute walk to the subway and close to downtown Hollywood. We sensed some sketchiness with the positive reviews online and still doubt the authenticity of some so beware as the hotel is not;2

We stayed for a weekend me and my two girlfriends for a fun girls trip. Booking with three of us we were given a room with one queen size bed and told there was nothing they could do to accommodate us. The older lady at the front desk wanted nothing to do with us and was very, very mean to us. Our room was not cleaned the entire time and room service does NOT answer. Also when we first arrived our rooms were not ready so feeling like we needed to refresh and change after our flight we got ready in the bathroom downstairs of the hotel. Another rude worker came in and said âgirls youâre scaring away the guests from using the bathroomsâ first of all what does that even mean?! How RUDE!! We are the guests!! Ugh.

The reason for the poor review only has to be due to what I can only describe as a dangerous event. On our first evening at 0130hrs we were spoken to a strong smell of cannabis so much we were sick. The corridor outside our room was dense smoke like there was a fire! I went to reception who did not seem phased and move us to another floor! No attempt was made to locate the offender all be it there was no doubt it was coming from the room next to ours! The rest of the stay 6 days was uneventful until we checked out! We made sure there was not any transaction on our credit card which you are required to leave at booking in, we were told there was not however when return to the Uk we discovered Â£1078 had been taken from both parties credit cards!

"There isn't much to choose from in this area, so this was the one we did choose.  We needed the room for one night in order to visit the nearby hospital in the morning.  The room was clean, and parking was easy.  However, the elevator did not work, and there was a sign in it telling people not to panic if the doors didn't open.  Luckily, we managed to get a ground-floor room.  The lounge wasn't open because, as the obviously bored desk clerk told us, ""the bartender isn't here.""  No other explanation was offered and she made no attempt to apologize or to offer alternatives.  Someone was cooking garlic in the basement (where a restaurant is, apparently, that you can't get to by elevator) and the smell was overpowering.

The location of the hotel is great, subway is easy to get to. However the hotel itself wasn't so great. The pool was closed- this was the only reason we booked this hotel. Rooms aren't very big, wifi is $10 a day. The room didn't have any of the things you'd expect like a pen and paper, a guide to the hotel/city, air con control (it's either really cold or nothing) and there was a coffee maker and no milk. When we first arrived we tried to phone reception/concierge and never got an answer.  The reception area and bar and very opulent and beautiful and the rooftop bar is great to view the city. But they don't make up for what the hotel is lacking!;2
This past Thanksgiving I had a problem adjusting the heat (it was too hot).  I was okay turning the air conditioner on for a while to adjust the temperature.  At 9pm the room's smoke detector sounded approximately 8 times.  The battery was replaced.  At 4:15am the detector again sounded numerous times, waking me up from my sleep.  The staff removed the detector from the room, which concerned me in the event a fire were to occur.  I was told to e-mail the Front Desk Manager, who would compensate me for my loss of sleep.  Several weeks later they responded saying the MAY be able to give me a DISCOUNT on a future stay.  My reason for my overnight stay was to have a good night's sleep, and I'm disappointed in the hotel's response.  Though I have liked staying at the hotel in the;2
Cool historic elements in the lobby, ballroom bar and restaurant. Friendly, helpful but overworked-looking staff. Loud pounding music from the âballroomâ bar/club on the 1rst floor can be easily heard several floors away until the wee hours. Someone was smoking in one of the rooms and it stank up the entire dark, narrow and slightly creepy hallway. Standard rooms are tiny (you can stand in the space and easily touch opposite walls). A tall person would have a hard time. Windows are also small and look out onto other windows/rooms so the space can be quite dark and the air doesnât circulate well unless you turn on a very loud window air conditioning unit. A big drawback is that there is no place to sit and wait for friends or hang out (esp when itâs freezing outside). The;2

I travel a lot for work and pleasure and used to live in NYC. I stayed here for a night in Feb 2018. It wasn't awful, per say, but I wouldn't do it again.   The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. What really threw me is that there's no free wifi in the rooms... it's 2018... also I had to run the shower for 10 mins to get hot water and open the window (below freezing outside) because the heater had no temperature control. Not even an off switch. To top it off, a cockroach ran out from under my bath mat in the morning. Weeeeee  The location is nice, but honestly you can find better for less $.;2
My husband and I stayed at the Universal City Hilton for 4 night in early June 2005.  This was our first visit to LA, and we were basically interested in sightseeing, as well as Universal Studios.  I agree with everyone else that this hotel is perfect for a family visiting Universal...you can't get any closer.  However, if you plan to go anywhere else (Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Disney, etc) then you should stay somewhere else.  This hotel is not convienent to any other attractions but Universal, and for the price it is not an exceptionally nice hotel.    Cons:   --Seafood Buffet almost constantly.  If you love seafood, this is great.  If the smell of seafood turns your stomach, you'd better walk all the way around the outside of the hotel to go back and forth between Universal;2
I booked the hotel because it's known famously because of Gossip Girl, great for celeb spotting and the rooftop bar/club but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. I'm never one to complain or make a fuss but we experienced so many little and big problems during our 1 week stay that I felt I had to share it with fellow travellers.  Positives: -great location, right next to Lincoln Centre, Columbus Circle, Central Park (south), and all tourist attractions such as Times Square and the Empire State Building are about 20 minutes walk.  -the hotel lobby is stunning, great for photos, drinks and free WIFI (lobby area only) Negatives: -charge for WIFI per device in your room, in one of the major cities in the world and nearing 2016, this is just unacceptable for a 4*;2

"When there are thousands of other options in LA there is little reason to bother with this place. After staying for six nights I told the front desk that I would like to extend my stay after the weekend.   No problem and at the same rate according to the first person I spoke to. Just come by on Sunday and we will sort it out. Sure enough, show up on the Sunday and the surly hotel (!) manager called Roman says, sure you can stay for $20 more than the rate you've been paying.   Now, if the rates have gone up in a week, sure, but as someone who had already stayed a week, and handed over close to $1000 and been told there was no problem with an extra night, I want a better attitude and a better rate when I want to extend by a night.

I stayed at this hotel and really wanted to like it as I am a Hyatt Globalist and love Hyatt brand.  Generally the Hyatt hotels are exceptional and the people are extremely friendly and helpful.    This first concern I had when I entered the lobby iwas there were a lot of Southwest Airlines crew staying at the hotel.  I am always concerned when I see an airline known for being cheap staying at the same hotel I am staying.    I approached the check in desk at 3:15 and the lady checking me in abruptly said âthe room we have reserved for you isnât ready, giving you another roomâ.  I had selected online check in and a 2 pm arrival.  With flight delays I arrived at 3 and the room still wasnât ready?    The desk clerk handed me my keys and offered no additional information.

My girlfriends and I booked a room around this same time last year and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

I remember the gymnastics routine it took when more than two of us wanted to walk around the room, or one of us wanted to be in the bathroom.  I remember scoffing at the in house dining and drink options and prices.  I remember being slightly bothered there was no sheet on the bed, only a duvet.  But none of that matteredâ¦what I remember heads and shoulders above all else was the delightful staff.  From the moment we arrived on site and the bellmen greeted us to the smooth check in;2

I took no issue with the rate since I knew where we were staying and it was a full service Hilton.  I was pretty disappointed.

We arrived around 11pm on a Saturday night and we weren't sure that we had the right address as there was a queue going around the block to the entrance.  It turns out we were there in fashion week and as such the ballroom had been hired every night of our stay for parties, as was the rooftop bar. We knew the rooms would be small, but not to be able to open a suitcase anywhere but on the bottom bunk was crazy.  There was so little space that I had to leave the room and wait in the lobby whilst my husband got ready each morning. When we arrived the aircon hadn't been on in the room so it was absolutely boiling, but as it was so loud we couldn't keep it on overnight. We frequently had to queue for the shared shower, toilet and sink facilities, despite being on 'UK time' still. Our;2

My one week stay at the Jane Hotel was okay. In short, I would stay here again only if I couldnât afford anything else. And I would not recommend staying here with children or if you have a several tobacco smoke allergy. At times I felt uncomfortable, bordering on unsafe. I felt there was a disconnect between the care taken for the bar/nightclub patrons and hotel guests.  The price was affordable, and the staff were generally polite, professional, and friendly. They stored my luggage upon arrival and upon check-out.  A short time before leaving on vacation I read about problems with smokers at The Jane.

During breakfast, we asked if we could take out something for our 2 years old daughter, first response that we got was a rude NO. In the end server gave us a take-out bag but with couple of senseless comments that it wasnt allowed.  There were 2 tables for breakfast in the same area, one for the complimentary coupons and other one was paid.

I got bitten by bedbugs in room 511, but luckily it happened on the last day we were staying there so I got them poisoned in next hotel. Or at least I hope so.   I sent an email to the hotel but didnt receive any response regarding this matter.   BAGS LOST My bags were lost during the trip to NYC and were delivered to the hotel. However nobody said that they had arrived and when questioning they said nothing has come. On the second last day I asked after having called to airport luggage department, the lady at the desk found the goods. They were behind the door she was sitting. At the very same corridor she has to go through to get his office? Actually I dont know did I lose something, but if I did it was maximum of 200 USD, since I am not completely sure how much money did I;2
Its old and dated , stayed there last week for 10 days. the facilities are poor. Looks Grand but its still in the 30s. Maybe thats where it wants to be.  The beds were comfortable and clean.  But watch your Credit card they swipe at the front desk. mine was charged twice I caught it on the second day and after some discussion with the desk staff it was  removed from my account. They don't take it it just stays pending but then that limits your card. No restaurant per say just an expensive dinner tagged on to the  front Lobby of the hotel . Fine if you want to spend $50 dollars plus tips for 2 for breakfast>>>>>> . No water or mini bar fridges in the room as you normally expect. I travel all over the world and this must be one of the most basic hotels I have stayed in a long;2
Room was very small and the red chair in the room was old, dirty and had a white stain on it (gross). The bathroom was very tiny. The shower door only covers 1/2 the shower area so the water runs right out and goes all over the bathroom floor. Soaked a entire towel. Then I realized when I was showering there was no shampoo / body soap but I did have 3 conditioners.  I will say we did enjoyed the rooftop bar area and the Front desk during check in/check out was fast with very nice staff;2

We stayed at the Hilton while visiting Universal City. The hotel is right across the street, but they do a poor job of accommodating the visitors who walk there. You have to walk down the main hotel drive next to cars. There's a partial sidewalk on one side, but you'd think a hotel that advertises its proximity to the park would actually build a safer path to get there.  It was also confusing just getting to the driveway. The front desk folks told us to walk inside past the ballrooms and go out those doors. But there were weddings going on both nights that I guess we crashed walking through. No one said anything so I guess we didn't offend anyone. Congratulations and Mazel to the bride and groom!  We made our reservations in February and confirmed them before arriving. We;2
"Read the fine print! We didn't! Additional $45-$55 per night for parking. Though we checked in with valet at 1 a.m. apparently their clocks don't start a ""new day"" until 4 am so we were charged an additional $55 for 3 hours of parking!!!ð¥µ.  Also the advertised ""CITY VIEW"" is really just a view of the airport through a scratched up window, which isn't exactly bad it IS misleading.";2
Dark hallways, strong smells, very slow elevators (we had to take the stairs),little room, no view, intense noise outside, need to pay for wifi and wifi not working well, tiny bathroom, tiny sink, no fan, no control of  room temperature,room heater very noisy, dryness of the eyes, dirty walls and curtains, carton cups, maids disturbing two times while late checkout.;2
I arrived at the hotel after 5 hours of flying and all I wanted to do was to receive a nice welcome. But what I got was a non-impressive space to stay the night. The bathroom was quite small and the door didn't close well. The room as well was really small and for four people staying in one room it was a nightmare. The food from the restaurant was good though and some people at the hotel speak Spanish which was good because I'm Mexican and my family doesn't know a lot of English so that helped a lot. But still they can achieve greater things to live up to the expectations that they themselves set.;2
I expect more from Hyatt than say, Motel 6.  The check in lines were very long and one clerk went out of her way to ignore me when she saw me approaching her to ask a question.  She literally ran away from me.  Then, as I stood in line with about 12-15 other people, that same clerk allowed two people that were NOT in line to cut in front and SHE CHECKED THEM IN/OUT right in front of all of us.  It was pathetic. The room service and parking were ridiculously overpriced.;2

Stayed here on 2 alternate nights, both times I experienced noisy guests talking and the banging of doors all night. There was vomit in the sink in the shared bathroom on the first night and the carpets were disgusting. To be honest I couldn't wait to check out, this place isn't clean at all, which is a shame as the rooms are really unique. I thought the experience was going to be good but I was disappointed.;2
The condition of the building where I stayed was so poor it felt like a very low-end Holiday Inn or even a Motel 6. The Hilton Family finally has a bigger problem, something skeazier and more embarrassing, than Paris.;2

I was looking for a quirky hotel for a business trip and booked one of the Jane's high end rooms (Captain's Quarters I think they're called). The room was about $295/night without tax. My first room was on a low floor and close to the nightclub below which I could hear pretty clearly until 3am on a midweek night. After complaining, I was moved to a higher room with a tiny window and very noisy AC. So basically, I couldn't get a good night's sleep. The hotel is quirky, but in my opinion very shabby/dirty, the staff are fine, but well below par for NYC. For the same money, and a little haggling, you can stay at the Soho Grand, which is a treat.;2
Summary: Overall, poor customer service, dirty room, tiny rooms, no parking, and expensive price. The one plus is that the location is excellent for commuting around the city. My wife and I were moving to NYC and booked the cheapest place we could using Priceline and ended up with this 1 star hotel. I was pleased since I was familair with the brand (but still surprised at the high price). Anyway, when we arrived parking was a problem. There was no parking on the street and the associated lot ($32) was full so we drove 5 blocks away and paid the same amount and walked back. At check-in I was greeted in the rudest manner ever at any of my hotel stays. The lobby was small but clean and neat. After checking in I took the only functioning elevator (very small) up to my floor. The;2

I was due to stay at The Jane for 9 nights and checked out after 2. As other reviewers have highlighted, there is a bed bug problem (a Google search revealed several complaints about this at this hotel over several years. I woke at 4am on a Saturday morning to bites all over and found and killed two bugs in the sheets. All my possessions were taken to be heat-treated and I had to shower and move to a room on the fifth floor. The staff were very considerate and refunded me the cost of the night - no complaints about their service.  Unfortunately, more bugs were found in the new room and I chose to leave rather than continue my stay. I understand there is a bed bug problem in New York generally, but they really need to get on top of this.  I found the staff very pleasant and;2

As they say very convenient, room bedding towels all clean, room kitted out by Ikea, then you have the communual facilities sharing is fine if you share the same standards as other guests who treat it like a hotel and obviously expect someone running around after them clearing up their mess! Also makes for a noisy night life people in and out of rooms assume to use the facilities.  Why I wouldn't return, we had a fridge in the room that was great and handy, only issue on returning from a evening out was putting on the lights exposed our other room mates roaches who'd infested the nice warm damp dark part at the back of the fridge!  As stated you get what you pay for so dont expect too much won't be geading back in a hurry if at all.;2
Small rooms . Old old old building with rooms not very modern at all. Only redeeming factor was that it was very close to Madison square garden which I was attending a concert also room was clean as well.;2
Hotel is in a great location, but needs help. The elevators are very slow. The internet is even slower. I've stayed at this property twice and my first stay was okay with the exception of waiting ten minutes for the elevator each time. Hilton needs to invest major $$ in this property.;2
Hotel was OK,  room very small,  shower door wouldn't shut,  carpet in lobby and mezzanine very worn,  very outdated,  needs refurbishment,  when we were leaving they kept moving us as they were getting ready for new years eve,  not nice as we were waiting to get picked up  for airport so had 5 hrs to wait from checkout at noon,  concierge very helpful.  Definitely not a 4 star;2
Unfriendly staff, room location not provided as requested, quality of room is not up to the standard. The only best part is the hotel location is in convenient location close to Hollywood studio. The quality of room does not meet the hilton experience.;2
And just that.  I am no stranger to the cost of living/staying in New York, so I understood that for less than $200/night, this wasn't going to be The Ritz-Carlton.  However, I did expect a bit more than this hotel delivered.  Upon arrival, there was a long line for check in with two employees moving roughly at the speed of molasses.  I had requested a fridge for my room (not included in the room price, but available for $25) and was assured that it would be sent up shortly.  The elevator was very small (my suitcases had to be sent up in another elevator because the elevator was not big enough for 2 suitcases and 3 people) and moved very slowly.  I had booked a queen room for my 3 year old son, infant daughter and me.  It was TINY - barely enough room to navigate between the bed;2
My husband & I stayed at the hotel to attend a wedding in N Y C. After requesting an early check in because I was recovering from an injury we waited in a line of over 20 guests trying to check in. When we finally were given the room key I was shocked to find the room was already occupied & I had awakened a sleeping baby opening the door. We went back to the reservation desk & had to wait in the line once again before we could talk to anyone . Finally. we were given a key to a second room. It was not occupied which was a plus but there was a dresser wihich you had to circumvent to get to the bed. The dresserâs drawers unfortunately would not stay closed and there was no way I could navigate. There also was no coffee for the Keurig. An employee was sent up to rectify the;2

The receptionist was courteous and friendly. Although we did not have the 2 rooms nearby, she assured us that the rooms are beautiful. Indeed, the rooms were spacious and one of the room has a balcony that oversee the courtyard. I was impressed.   There is a huge gated carpark right beside the hotel but chargeable at $24 per day. There was sauna but restricted to aged 15 and above. There was laundry but much more expensive than elsewhere( $3.50 to wash and $3.50 to dry)   The breakfast was just so-so. The chef at the omelette station was rude and refused the egg orders for my kids. He insisted that I had to pay for breakfast for my kids as each room only cover breakfast for 2 adults, but when we checked with the reception after our breakfast, the receptionist told us that kids;2
Ok, so it's New York. Everything is expensive, as is this hotel.  But firstly, the check in desk, should people really have to wait 30 mins plus just to get to the reception desk. And then be told it was too early to check in, so 75 bucks or else. Not prepared to wait another 30 mins later in the day, I stump up, looking forward to the room with the view of the Hudson River, or the Empire State Building that I paid for.  I get scaffold and the building next door. So, later on I go down an complain, apparently it has been the bain of their life this year, people being promised such rooms.

2nd time to NYC.  This time was for our honeymoon.  We did get an upgrade which was a nice offer.  Room we got had an ok view facing Lincoln centre.  Room was a bit beat up considering the cost per night.  Shower had no water pressure, and they don't offer any complimentary amenities like bottles of water in room ? Nope that would be $7.50! Steep.  Roof top was ok, pool was the size of a bathtub.  The simple thing that bothered us the most was not being able to get your own ice.. Which would be fine if we didn't have to wait over an hour twice to get ice to the room!!!  We ended up going down to the bar with paper cups.  To top it they don't even leave glasses in the room for you to have a drink..just paper cups.  For the price I would not recommend it.  Nice area though.;2

I was in NY to visit a sick family member. Her husband and brother rented a room in this hotel (7th floor)   Due to the late hour, I stayed a few hours to rest before heading home. The first thing I'm going to say, is room was very run down. The WORST THING is THE  HALLS , and OUR ROOM reeked of Marijuana. It was horrible!!!  Almost uncomfortable to stay, but because of circumstances, the room already paid, and it being after midnight, it was unreasonable to leave.

Of all of the hotels in NYC, I would stay somewhere else. The room we were in was very small. The ceiling in the hallway is maybe 7' tall, but seemed lower and, the hallway to our room was narrow with a lot of turns.    Valet was quick. The location is ok, depending on what you are in the area for and where you need to go. Walking to Times Square for example, is approximately a  20 minute walk.   The restaurant downstairs of the hotel is great and very busy, at least when I was there.;2
This is my 4th visit to New York but first time in this hotel, In a good location, Just a few things put me off to a point I wonât be returning. We were being checked in by Mohammed who asked us to leave him a review, then said heâd waived all the fees of an early check and room with a view (we didnât ask for either) he must have asked us to leave him a review about 7/8 times. We then got into our room with the phone ringing - its Mohammed reminding us to leave him a review (No joke!) itâs not want you want or need after a 12hr travel day. The rooms are quite small but considering youâre only sleeping in them itâs not a big deal however they do need a deep clean. The curtains/nets were covered in thick dust and fluff. The lifts are very slow so make sure you donât need to rush;2

"Had a forgettable one night stay earlier this week. I selected the hotel for its proximity to Penn Station and its price. The location is ideal. The hotel itself is dated - the lobby area is very nice but the halls were dreary and tired-looking. My room (a std. queen) was tiny and very basic. I did not try either restaurant and did not use the meeting/ event space.  Two reasons for my ""poor"" rating. First, the hotel tacks on a $29/night facility fee that is not in the advertised rate, supposedly to cover wifi, the business center and fitness center - amenities that are free in many places and should be free everywhere. Second, the only amenity that I actually wanted to use was the business center, to print airline boarding passes - unfortunately the internet was 'down' that";2
The service in the Cafe Sierra was below standard, the wrong order was taken and then not rectified on  repeated complaints about the meat.  The server was poorly trained and obviously did not know one cut of meat from another.   The  Invoice details  were not available even 6 hours after check out. We only found out that the wrong and more expensive menu item had been entered after we received a faxed copy at our office.    The bathroom still had old soap from previous guests in the shower soap dish.  The air conditioning unit did not provide hot air on a very cold day even if set on 80 - the fan still blew too  hard on low setting.;2
"A big watch out for everyone. Both the website and when I called reservations state a "" Multi-million dollar renovation, etc..."". This is completely disingineous.  This hotel has not been touched in many years. Feels old, dated, and worn.   I cannot believe how the advertise themselves as renovated and contemporary.  Just beware. This is no 4-star or 4-diamond property. Maybe was at some point, not now.   You may still want to stay here. Good location for Universal Studios, service is pretty good, and the rate could be good.";2

"I stayed at this hotel because it is where my review course was held. The Hotel is nice, the bed was comfortable, it is close to Universal Studios and City Walk... but, everything else was not so nice.

Washing machines would be great.  School trip split over three floors, would prefer to have had all the children on one level to supervise more effectively.  Assigned a room under the gym â the noise physically shook the fittings in the room from 5am making it impossible to sleep. We were unable to get another room on that floor however couldnât change floors as it would have left children without adults nearby.  Breakfast buffet had a great selection, however our room rate only included the continental option. This did include a better than typical continental variety.  Easy stroll to citywalk.;2

The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is location. Love that it was near high line and so convienent to walk the Village too. The room itself of course is small, which was fine. I stay d two nites and no towel change at all. Annoying.    Decided to take stairs down, I was on the 5th, and I don't think stairwell had been swept in maybe a year. Dead coachroachs  were a sight to behold.    The bellman where I had my key held, had attitude plus, as I assume it was annoying to him for me to pick up my key.   I will not stay here again.;2

Booked this hotel on recommendation by travel agent! Won't be taking their advice again!!!! So glad I read reviews for this hotel before I arrived!! I think it could've ruined my stay if I hadn't been pre-warned!! On the whole the reviews were very honest. The rooms are tiny! We were in a 'superior grade room', thank goodness because I would hate to think how small a standard room would be - a broom closet???? The room was tired and dated and not very clean! Couldn't access the roof at all! Everything very expensive!The service wasn't the best some reception staff were particularly unfriendly, unhelpful and quite condescending!! The hotel is on 63rd St and quite a distance from everything you would want to see in NYC. Not a particularly memorable experience and I really don't;2
Arrived for three night, party of five with 3 children.  Male on front desk very helpful  so was the concierge.  After that though females on front desk. Our room smelt of sick we didn't notice on first day as we were out of the room the whole day  only noticed when we got back and our clothes stank.  I spoke to the ladies on front desk not reality  interested  apart from having a go that we hadn't  noticed on our first day.  Cleaner was sent but it still didn't  go away.  All in all poor customer service. Breakfast no complaint. Very good choice. I wouldn't  recommend  to stay if you have children.  Doesn't  feel the safest of areas and as we were on the ground floor, I felt like I was always listening out in the night.;2

BEWARE AND CHECK YOUR CARD TRANSACTIONS We visited this hotel in December and as other hotels gave our credit card as room deposit. Upon returning to England and the arrival of our credit card bill it was noted that the empire hotel had debited our card with $52.26 . We had not used any room facilities or drinks, we paid cash. After two attempts of contacting the hotel we had an apology as an oversight on their side and our card credited. Unfortunately due to exchange rates we are still short from the original amount.

Pass on this one. The rooms & hallways smelled like stale carpet masked by years of air freshener. The guest rooms were dark and in need of a deep clean (or at least some air circulation). Their website photos suggest a very different environment. The hotel makes an attempt to be trendy but falls short on feeling clean.    There was one super friendly concierge man. He was the one bright spot of our stay.;2
"On arrival (with colleagues) they didn't have a room reserved for me and all our bookings were done by 1 person as we are running an event here this week. They found me a room and told me the breakfast vouchers would be sorted out the following day (which they were), in the late AFTERNOON and after I hit up the reception twice.  Overall the staff don't seem happy, ""switched on"" or greet guests.  The Gym has a great view over the runways but for the rest it's much more down than up in my view.";2
I stayed here in September 2011 having read good reviews on here. I have to say, I was disappointed, The rooms are tiny, with a small bed (not good for tall people), and whilst the bathrooms are clean with decent facilities, they are shared between quite a few people. This hotel does, however have some redeeming features, such as the efficiency and helpfulness of the staff, the cleanlyness of the place and the history associated with it. However for the money you pay, you can do a lot better elsewhere. On a side issue (and not directly related to the hotel) whilst the West Village/Chelsea is great to visit, I would not advise staying there for too long as the 'poncyness' of the whole place will get to you. For something a bit more genuine and relaxed try the lower East side,;2

Well now I can't go back to sleep because cleaning service decided to knock on my door a little before 7am this morning! I usually already get annoyed when they knock at 8 am (yes that was yesterday's morning knock) but this time I have my ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on!

Stayed here as part of our honeymoon. Staff on check in were not friendly and did not give us any information about the hotel. Stayed on the 25th floor. Room was extremely small and basic. Bed, tv and wardrobe. Would have liked water or kettle or even fridge. Bathroom was also very small, shower was poor and there was no fan. Room was very small and looked onto an office building. Had to que for lifts each day. Security in place in the building so felt very safe.  Maybe standard for New York but did find it disappointing and would not recommend for any honeymoon couples.;2

I stayed 6 nights. I ended up staying in two rooms due to issues. I stayed in a room with double beds and one with a king bed. Different floors...different views. The room facing 63rd had great views but also had street noise. The room facing inside walls was quiet but drab.   The rooms weren't too bad other than the rotting bathroom door and the spots on the mirrors (bathroom and sleeping area). I was concerned about the cleanliness of the towels after picking one up that smelled of body odor--private parts. Both rooms air conditioner barely worked. I tried calling the front desk and the phone just rang. I tried 3 more times before anyone answered. (I wasn't calling during check-in or check-out times either).

"I thought reading reviews would give me a better idea of what to expect than the website, but I feel tricked!  I looked at photos to confirm we were talking about the same place.

So in 100 sq ft, twin bed and 18 inches of walking space. The bigger opportunity is total lack of traveler useable space...no hangers or closet, just some hooks by door. The toilet has no seat top.

It is a cheap hotel, at least it was for us. We paid about $150 per night.let me start of with the check in, the line was nearly out the door. After you make that insanely long line good luck waiting for the elevator which can take up to 10-15 minutes. When you finally arrive to your room you'll notice a bathroom that is so old the paint is chipping of the tub and all over. The mattress feels 30 years old, hard and uncomfortable. And the pillows hard and small. Wifi might as well be non existent because it is so slow.   On the brighter side, the location is perfect. A block away from the train station and a few blocks away from Macy's. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning the room. They also have a great diner downstairs that has a delicious breakfast.

I have just spent 4 nights in this hotel with my husband and two children. We have been to New York before and stayed in a different (and lovely) hotel (which actually was cheaper) but, despite some of the dubious reviews I read, we went with the New Yorker - we spend minimal time in our hotel room after all. I was so disappointed though.   We checked in and were charged a daily 'service fee' of $22 per night - it's purely a money making tool, for using services like the gym etc and making international phone calls. I mean, like I'm going to sit in my room making phone calls when I'm in New York City! At check in, they also kept our credit card details for a security deposit style holding payment. This was obviously in case we damaged the room, but once we got to our room door,;2

My husband has stayed at this hotel a few times so I thought I would give it a try on my trip tp LA.   Let me start by saying that my nightly rate was UD$ 350/night - not cheap for an airport hotel.  The room I was given was directly across the drink vending and ice machines. I was surprised that the machines were in the hallway but assumed that management would have mitigated the noise by sealing the bedroom doors better for sound proofing - wrong!  Right beside the vending machines is the service room - where housekeeping stores all their equipment. I know this because I can hear them chatting while dragging their carts in and out of the room.  There was a convention during my stay and the attendees were noisy past midnight and as early as 6am. Despite repeated calls to the;2

I did not check reviews before I booked this hotel and that was a mistake. A lot of the negative reviews I read, I experienced.  The room was abnormally small and did have a bad smell to it.

The family rooms have double beds which are very small for sharing with a child. The hotel is a bit dated and the rooms are just average. We did require fumigation services as there were flies in the bathroom and even reached out to the engineers to fix the airconditiioner system couple times. The hotel is very close to universal studiois offering complimentary shuttle services. Overall my family had a very disappointing experience at the hotel and doesn't classify as a 'value for money' hotel at all.;2

I booked a short stay at this hotel for myself and a friend since I had to be in NYC to do an interview for a visa. Our trouble started as soon as we booked the trip online. While I wrote my name and e-mail into the form, when the booking went through the confirmation page booked it under my dad's name (since he signed in under his name, I guess). Okay, fine. I'll just call in and change the name on the reservation. You wouldn't believe the run-around I had just to make a simple first-name change. After speaking to different people for 30+ minutes who have NO CLUE and constantly transferred me to other people, someone magically knew how to help me after I started yelling at them.   Fast forward to the week of the stay. I call to warn that the credit card owner will not be;2

The room was somewhat shabby but generally clean. This would not have justified the poor rating alone given the price. The problem was that one side of the bed was damp!

On unpacking it transpired that the AC did not work properly and the safe did not work either.  I immediately reported this to the front desk.  Shortly afterwards a member of staff attended the room and agreed that safe did not work and would need to be replaced and that the AC was not working properly.  I again asked to be moved, but was told that the hotel was completely full and this would not be possible for that night.

The hotel is in a quiet location of the Upper West Side. One block from Riverside Park. When we got there, the room was small and appeared clean.  When we woke up the next morning, we had bed bugs crawling on the covers. Wasn't sure because it was the first time. We told the staff and changed rooms but by then it was too late.  Three days later we had red, itchy spots all over from bed bug bites. The service was really crappy and when we left our luggage for the day when switching hotels, our suitcases were just left out all day in the lobby and not even locked up for security. Even though there is 24 hour desk service, the doors are left unlocked so anyone could come into the building.  Our room door didn't even shut properly when unlocked. Nobody cared that our room was;2
We were extremely disappointed with the lack of sound proofing. Doors were opening and closing all night, people hanging out in the hallways and you could hear our neighbor when they would move the hangers in their closet. You could hear every toilet flush all around us. We heard every bit of ice that was dispensed in the ice maker in the hallway. We did call the front desk about the noise in the hallway and they sent security. But it was two nights of no sleep. We actually got accustomed to fire trucks and police sirens outside.;2

This is an old hotel that is in need of an update. Bathroom smelled musty, nightstand drawer would not stay shut and pool on rooftop is a very small lap pool.

NOT a glass enclosed shower as stated on website, filthy bathroom door, mold on curtains....you have been forewarned.;2
This hotel was recommended to me when I booked my vacation package through JetBlue. Everyone was nice including Cynthia from the front desk, Fanny and Hugo. Everything was going well until my 11 year old asked Elvira to fry her 3 eggs extra hard. We advised her to break the yolks to ensure that the eggs were cooked hard. She got upset after she fried the eggs for awhile and the yolks were still runny and my daughter refused to eat them. I asked her a second time to break the yolks and cook them a bit longer. She got upset handed us to Hugo and walked away from the omelette and waffle station. It was so embarrassing we sacrificed a free breakfast and went out for breakfast the next morning. We went back for breakfast today before we left for the airport we were so uncomfortable;2
I have been going to Empire Hotel for many years. I was extremely disappointed that we got the worst room in the hotel. I don't think I should have to ask for a room away from elevator or on a higher floor.;2

The housekeeper removed the bar of soap that had been used only that morning.  I discovered that there was no ""housekeeping"" selection on my room phone.  I called the front desk and got NO ANSWER.

GENERAL - I made this reservation because of the look of the hotel - kind of old world classy picture - and the location to where my sister lived.  THE ONLY nice person I encountered was the woman who initially made the reservation.  From the time I got there to the minute I checked out it was NOT A GOOD STAY.  Because I was there for a family issue, I had to extend my stay and because I was working and beng there I stayed two days longer because it was easier than rerouting my work for the two days.  I WOULD NOT STAY AGAIN EMERGENT OR NOT.    When I made the reservation I was given one price, but it was almost 200.00 more when I checked in.  I should have KNOWN something was wrong when I came to see about checking in.  I have traveled quite a bit over the last frew years and;2

NO WASH CLOTHES, NOTHING, but 3 bath towels,  for 4 people. When the kids got ready for bed, they found a note from the last occupants of the room tucked in between the headboard and mattress of one of the beds.  Finally, there was NO SHOWER DOOR.  NO BATH MAT.  The whole TINY bathroom was soaked.  Yet we still had NO towels.  This hotel was not nice, and not worth the price.  Many others are better.;2
We went for a wedding during fashion week. We traveled for both business, and pleasure/family. They were not very helpful when we had internet issues because they were too busy with the models. When we could finally connect to the internet, the connection sucked!! The elevators also had issues, took forever. They actually had signs suggesting to use the stairs. With a stroller that's impossible. I heard from other guests that people were getting stuck in the elevator! The rooms were alright, pretty clean, large for NYC. There's a bar/club there so it gets packed and noisy. But that didn't bother us much.;2
The Empire is in a great location right next to Central Park, the Lincoln Centre and 10 minutes walk from Times Square, but that must be offset by the fact that the rooms are very tired and the whole hotel is in real need of a facelift.  We stayed for three nights in late August, having arrived from Boston and then going on to a cruise to Bermuda. We chose the Empire as our both our girls loved the âGossip Girlâ connection, and the rooftop terrace and pool were an attraction.  The entrance lobby and stairs are fine and the staff are great, but it all goes down hill when you get to the rooms.  We had two inter-connecting rooms and couldnât believe what a shabby state they were in. Apart from being quite small, both bathrooms had tiles hanging off, doors didnât open, air-con units;2
Lobby is being remodeled and it feels disjointed to the eye and not welcoming. My colleagues and I had appetizers and food  (menu is substantive but food is substandard) in the bar area downstairs where it was cold and we were all feeling quite uncomfortable. Waiter advised that the restaurant, where we decided to move was worse in terms of temperature. Quite unpleasant to say the least.  Two more days here.. not looking forward to it, in particular when I opened my bed tonight and the sheets were not perfectly clean. Room is ok, but dated and nothing special. Never again.;2
"This shabby over-priced dreary hotel's sole attribute is that it is close to Lincoln Center.  If you are willing to put up with an undermanned/unhelpful registration desk, a problematic  ""complementary"" WiFi that keeps wanting you to subscribe to a pay-for version,  a tawdry room with a unexpectedly good bed then book at your peril.

I asked for an early check in and a room with a view prior to my arrival. At 1:30 I was told my room was not ready and had to go to the pool bar  because the rooftop bar was closed. The main reason I booked this hotel was for the rooftop. After three trips to the front desk with the same story about the room not being ready I was given a room with a view of the building next door at 4pm.   I stay in New York several times a year and this by far was my worst experience.  This hotel was not cheap and in my opinion there are far better hotels on the upper west side.;2

"We booked 4 rooms (for 8 people) for 7 nights, specifically requesting non-smoking and Superior Rooms and somehow ended up with 3 tiny rooms (obviously Standard Rooms) on the smoking floor on our first night with unsightly views of the buildings directly opposite, and only 1 Superior Room on a non-smoking floor. Like others before me have mentioned, there was no room for suitcases, let alone ourselves in these rooms. The lingering stench of stale cigarette smoke greeted us the moment the lift doors opened. Incredibly disappointing after 24hrs of flying from Australia. After complaining the following morning, the 3 tiny rooms were ""upgraded"" to the 11th floor. Admittedly these rooms were much larger, however, they were directly underneath the nightclub. We were lucky to get a few";2
We have stayed in the Empire again in nov 2014 and jan 2015. We tend to go back(we have stayed six times here) because of the location and the frequent presence of the property in the Priceline website deals. But exactly there, lies the problem: if you get there with a Priceline booking they will always send you to a matchbox room that cannott fit two human beings by any chance and that is really very far from any 4 star hotel standards. We fight it everytime, and it always is a pain to have to deal with bad attitude reception desk people and a having to talk to a condescending manager before getting a regular room.

"The hotel is well located, and the staff was friendly. Despite this, the hotel generally was unprofessional. The rooms (we had a suite) lacked any suitable place to put one's clothes; the wifi was inconsistent; the elevators were broken and unreliable, and the lobby felt more lack Grand Central than a hotel. The Hotel, unfortunately, is trading more off its rooftop bar, than it is off the basic services of being a hotel. If one is looking for a well run professional hotel- avoid.

I checked into the hotel knowing that I shouldn't be expecting much. I had gotten a great deal on the standard guest room ($240 for two nights) and already had in mine that it wasn't going to be up to par as other New York City hotels. When I got to the room, I didn't even want to take my shoes off to walk around. The carpet smelled of dank mildew and cigarette smoke. It was highly noticeable that the wood on the entertainment center, cupboards, and desk was chipping off. The shower would flip from being extremely hot to extremely cold at a moments notice. I was missing a remote for my TV, and called downstairs. They sent up a repairman with a broken remote, and within 5 minutes he sat down on my bed while making a personal phone call. So unprofessional. The service was;2

"We're currently staying at the Empire Hotel until 9/16/13, and I'll say it has even disappointing. I planned this trip to NYC for the last month and although the reviews of this hotel were just above average, I decided to book here anyway due to the location and decor of the rooms- and was excited and looking forward to our stay. Ugh...what a waste! 1st- we checked in on Friday, 9/13 around 4pm and was given a standard room with a ""pretty decent veiw"" over looking g Lincoln center. The room was very small as I suspected as tge reviews warned me about this but hey, it's NY but so no big deal breaker. The too was very worn with shower caulking issues, a hole in the wall near the closet and badly stained lamp shades but still not a total desk breaker! As I was not given a receipt";2
My wife and I booked New York for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  We booked the New Yorker hotel as it's somewhere my wife had always wanted to stay and with it being an iconic hotel in New York and it's skyline.  Upon arrival to the hotel, at the check in desk we were met by a very rude lady who told us that in addition to the resort / facility fee of $32 a night, we also needed to hand over a credit card for them to hold a further $400 to be held as a security deposit in case of damage to the room. When we said that all of our money is in cash, they said that if we wanted to pay this in cash they would charge up to $900?!? We advised that this was our spending money so they agreed to reduce this to $475 which was a massive chunk of our spending money. Excellent service (NOT).;2
I am extremely unsatisfied as to how things were conducted at this hotel as far as parking. I was not made aware of the $60 a day parking fee before I arrived. Then, after checkout when reviewing my credit card bill, I noticed I was charged twice for parking. When I called to question the double charge on my bill, I was informed that since I had my car parked at 10:30 am on the day of my arrival but did not pick my car up til 11:30 the following morning (even though check out time is noon) that I was charged for an addition day of parking. $60 for one addition hour, especially when I was not made aware of these charges til after  the fact? I think this is an absolute load of crap and am very displeased with the whole situation.;2

"So we get there and they immediately start to run us around about fee's and where they'll be placing us. We get up into the room and it's like 50 degrees. We turn the thermostat up to about 75, and it manages to get colder.. Call the desk , their response ""Oh you just have to turn it off"" So the central AC was either ON or off. The thermostat was for show. So they where doing some work on the floor we where staying on. But they worked until 10:30 at night with sanders and hammers, and started back up again around 7am.

Good if you are barely using your room. Very outdated. Needs a lot of work. Beautiful when you first walk in though.  Rooms are tiny. Had to switch rooms at check in because the deadbolt was busted off.;2
Close to all amenities [ bus pick up points, times square, shops ]. Rooms were a bit small & you can hear water running in rooms next door. After a long day at Niagara Falls the next morning we were woken up by a hammer drill outside our room. Maintance was going on right outside our room windows. We gave it 30mins but then had enough. Rang reception & they said they would do a room swap today [ but we still needed to leave today & a room would be ready later ]. When we returned [3pm ] NO room was ready & at this point my wife lost it. She made a scene at reception & they gave us one room to look at [so small you couldn't fit your suitcase [opened] around the bed. They then gave us a twin double bed room [beds small so we sleeped in separate beds] & we then had to pack up again;2
There were so many positive reviews for this hotel that it seemed like a safe bet. Boy was I wrong. Let me start with the positives, and the only reasons Iâm not giving one star. The location is convenient. Itâs one block from Penn Station and MSG. Itâs also relatively close to Time Square- about 15 blocks, so definitely walkable. When you walk into the lobby, itâs very opulent and beautiful. Nice tile floors and pretty chandeliers. There is a door man and the staff greets you when you walk in. This gave me a good feeling about the rooms. The feeling didnât last long. As I walked to the elevators, I was aggressively stopped by the âelevator guardsâ demanding to see my key.  While I understand this sort of âcheckâ may be necessary in a big city, the approach was a little severe;2

The room is so small itâs barely maneuvable.

The next morning, no regular coffee pod. I called and they did fix some things. They told me to put more towels down for the shower. Thatâs just how it is. The next day, a roach. That shower is the worst and the beds werenât even comfortable. It was a $1000 for 3 nights, and that was a conference rate. What?! Horrible. Do NOT stay here.;2

Hostel? This is not a hostel... come on! The have 3 or 4 kitchens but no utensils. Wanna cook? No pans, no dishes, no forks, knives. They do not have anything!!! Be aware! They have microwave and brand new stoves (I'm not impressed, given that they do not provide anything nobody uses them). If you are planning to hang out with other people or cook a nice dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever, run away from this place. Internet is also expensive. Finally the blankets were covered with hair, disgusting as hell.;2
This is an 'ok' hotel, rooms are clean but 'tired' looking, could do with updating. The lift down to breakfast takes ages! Breakfast is unimpressive...you'd bebetter off going else where- it is basic srcambled eggs, sausages, toast and cereals everyday! Service was again ok. You don't get a lot for you money but thats the same all over LA, but it is a good location and the hotel is bearable- the rooms are clean.;2
The Empire is well  located but on this second stay once again found service only fair to indifferent and sometimes rude, rooms in need of paint, constant loud irritating lobby music. This will be our last stay here.;2
Where do I start with this property? Well first I really liked the location. It worked out great for us to walk the city and be removed enough from the touristy spots. Easy access to subways and Central Park was a plus.  Room was decent sized and small hd tv was sufficient. Nice looking lobby and inside bar area but like many others have said, the rooftop bar and pool area is typically closed even in beautiful weather.  Now I'll list off my frustrations in no specific order and let you choose if this is the right hotel for you: there is no control of the air in the room which generally meant you will be uncomfortable, a dealbreaker for most. Even on days where the high was 70 it would be over 80 in the room, the building is very old. The windows are very thin, plan to hear;2

It was more my emotion to stay at the gossip girl hotel than what is the hotel. The prices are excessive for the size of the room. They sell you up bottles of water, the price of wifi is excessive. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to any place you want to visit in NY.  The staff very friendly and the cleaning also perfect. A day earlier I stayed in a much cheaper hotel and it was much better than the empire hotel.;2

This hotel is very well situated, the staff are very friendly and the price is ok for New York. Some basic things didn't work when we were there though. These included hot water, Wi-Fi and the TV. The rooms are quite clean, if a little dingy, the furniture chipped and old looking, like it was rescued from a thrift shop and the bed is a bit soft. The heating system hisses loudly, which the staff explained, is normal in New York. In short, good for a cheap one-nighter, but not longer.;2
Stayed in an 8th floor suite and thank goodness we were up 8 floors.  First night must have been trash day and we heard trash trucks going up and down neighboring streets followed by road construction near Fordham University.  Second night, more road construction, grinding of pavement and the beep beep beep of trucks backing up went on and on for hours during the night.  Just when the construction seemed to be winding down, the trash truck came to empty the dumpster at 4:30 am. I realize that road construction would be crippling during the day, but losing two nights sleep on a very short visit is awful too.  Perhaps being on a higher floor would have helped or on the other side of the building?  We did receive a small refund from the hotel for the inconvenience.    The second;2

We got complimentary water and welcome box of chocolates in the room.  At breakfast at 9am the restaurant was very crowdy. They ran out of food in main food stations ( bacon stripes, scrumbled eggs) and did not refil it in 30 minutes while we had our breakfast; they ran out of fresh orange juice from avtomatic juicer too and nobody from the restaurant staff brought fresh oranges and put them into this juicer despite getting reminder from several guests.

This was my first trip to NY and so I knew that I wasn't going to stay in my hotel very much except to sleep.  I have stayed in other countries in all sorts of types of hotels and don't think I have unrealistic expectations at all.  All I wanted was a clean room with a bed, my own bathroom with plenty of hot water , and somewhere to sleep so that I could get up and go out each day.  I checked in to the hotel and was given room 312 which had a view of an internal part of the hotel which had no apparent use except to provide a bit of dreary day light.  This was fine, I wasn't wanting to sit and stare out of the window, so I didn't mind.  The bathroom was relatively clean, the main room had chipped paint on the floor but the room although small, was adequate for what I wanted.  I;2
Chose this hotel due to location and price was reasonable. I stayed in an suite, room was clean and ok size for 4 people. Bathroom really needed an upgrade.  However, the front desk and management really let down my stay. We arrived from a very long flight to the front desk telling us our room had been cancelled and really that was it! Asked to speak to management and they said no its not cancelled but the payment was declined even thought I prepaid! After a very long discussion I gave them another card until I could call my bank and see what happened. Hotel offered us a better room but in fact it was the room I booked.  I have been contacting the hotel on this since I got back and they have not got back to me once. I booked via booking.com and they have been contacting/email;2
I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt. We stayed for 3 nights and it's basic, cheap and has the feel of a hostel about it.  The rooms are small clean and sparse.   The thing that really turned me cold was the constant door banging and screaming and shouting.  On the final night at 6.40am some woman screamed like she'd walked in on a murder scene.   I've heard screams in horror movies but this was really frightening.  That kinda put the final gloss on things.   Oh the single ply Toilet paper in the on suite was a nice touch.;2

Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, everything went wrong from the moment we walked through the door. We ordered a twin room, only to find out that we had one double bed. We complained and so the manager found us a twin room even though the receptionist said there wasn't any. We moved rooms at just after midnight, only to enter an icy cold room and damp bed linen. We just got in bed as we were exhausted from a 12 hour train journey. We woke up the next morning still freezing and the curtains were blowing as the windows were not properly sealed. We tried turning the heater up but nothing happened. We phone down and asked someone to come up and fix it but no one ever came. Would not recommend it to anyone.;2
Check in was extremely slow, @30 minutes, there is no fridge in the room. We were offered a fridge at $US 25, per day or an upgrade of $US40 per day for a suite. We opted for the suite. The room had not been cleaned from the last guest, the room smelled from rubbish in the bin and the bed had not been stripped. I requested the room be cleaned and Aileen who assured me she would get housekeeping to clean the room. We went out at 5pm and returned at 12 midnight the room had not been cleaned!! I had to request new bed linen and I made up the bed myself. This is appalling service, very dissatisfied. Not value for money, although Aileen attempted to be helpful, our basic needs were not met,;2
The following amenities were broken: telephone, television remote, heating unit, shower. I had to turn the heater off and on multiple times to get hot air. It made loud clicking noises that woke me up throughout the night.;2
The room maintenance was poor. The coffee supplies were never replaced. The shower design wets or damps the bathroom floor. The plumbing was defective: the toilet got clogged twice and we NEVER threw anything but toilet paper in it. The furniture was poor. There wasn't a proper closet or wardrobe. When you are charged more than four hundred dollars a day, you expect something at least REGULAR!  The best of the hotel is its location. The room was under average if furniture is considered.  Besides amenities and supply of coffee and sugar were poor or inexistent. The doormen are very friendly, I think the best personnel in this hotel. The internet connection is a rip off. You cannot charge your clients ten dollars a day per device when most of hotels are offering free high quality;2

The walls are thin in the rooms...I could literally hear every conversation the people in the room next to me had. The wait staff at our team dinner that was hosted outside on the patio were rude.

The hotel is located in Chinatown, very close to Grand St subway station. This make it perfect to visit both downtown and midtown either on foot or using public transport. However, it is indeed located in Chinatown and you have to prepare yourself to suburbs atmosphere, bad odours and sometimes not-english speaking people. The room is small, yet it has private bathroom and they're both clean to acceptable levels (some ageing stains and rust here and there). Price/Quality ratio acceptable to be Manhattan.;2

The two main things you should know is this is in an incredible location. It's right by Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Javits Center, and Macy's Herald Square. That's a huge draw for travelers. It's also a gorgeous hotel, especially in the art deco lobby. That said, there are huge problems with this hotel. Housekeeping was very subpar and they once left someone's food in my room. There were chunks of tile and ceramic missing from the shower/tub. I paid for a room with a view and got a room with a fantastic view...of the room across from it. I have stayed at plenty of hotels and am used to hearing noise in the rooms next to me, but this had the thinnest walls I've ever heard. I had a good experience here as a kid, but I will never stay here again. The front of house staff;2

My biggest complaint was that there was no AC.  They explained - One central air system it's set to heat.  If we set it to Air it gets to cold at night and customers complain.  Open your window!  Huh? this room doesn't have a window .. and I wasn't about about to leave the ajoined balcony open all night!  We had to have the maintenance guy bring us a fan! The hotel looks nothing like the pictures you see adverstised.  What you see is the back of the hotel, in the gated parking lot.  I didn't think it was the same place when we drove up.  You have to pay $22 per night for parking, but there is a guard in the lot all night.

This hotel unfortunately didnât do justice to the 4 stars it holds. The only positive aspect was the location. The room was way too small and the bed felt small for two people.

The Empire Hotel is located 5 min walk from central park and about 10-15 min walk from Times Square, it has good transport links all around it. These are the only positive things I have to say about this hotel.  Between the lack of hot water, slamming doors and rude staff, I will not be staying here again.   We arrived on Sunday night and after check in we headed straight out to explore, we didnt get back until late.  The next morning we got up late to shower and there was no hot water. When we called room service they advised us that the boiler was being fixed and it would be about an hour before we would have not water.  It was St. Patricks Day and we were in NYC so we had a cold shower and went out to see the city, we didnt get back to the hotel until around 2am. Again we;2

This hotel has old units that they give to people that use 3rd parties to pay . It's like they purposely save the outdated , smaller rooms for  customers they feel shouldn't get a good deal on their rooms. The Tv's are even smaller. And when I asked to be in an updated room they said they did t have any available. However, my sister. Hdckrx I. After me and she was given an updated room, probably  because she agreed to take a timeshare tour. They begin harassing  you as soon as you enter into the lobby of the hotel.

When we arrived, we checked in with a pleasant staff, and she told us about the refundable deposit fee that they needed our credit card for. About $40 per night deposit, however you get it back at the time of check-in. Which was fine. We arrived to our room to find that even though we booked a queen we received a full size bed. The room was so small that there was maybe a foot between one side of the bed and the wall, and a foot between the chair of the tiny sized desk and the other side of the bed. There was a TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed that you had to duck under to walk around the bed. The bathroom was so tiny, if you sat on the toilet your legs blocked the door, and one shoulder touched the wall while the other touched the sink. There was no storage in;2
"By far, location is this hotel's best quality; but unfortunately, it's not enough to overcome some of its bad qualities and horrible customer service. I stayed there with my family for 1 night during their 5 days stay at the Empire. Here's just some of their fatal flaws: - The shower has no door! Well, it has half a door. So when you take a shower, expect water to be all over the bathroom (which, thank God, does have a door). - I expect a hotel room in Manhattan to be small, but hotels usually compensate that with comfortable beds. I found the bed at the Empire to be too hard, and the pillows to be way too flat. - The room is bombarded with stuff for you to purchase. All kinds of snacks, liquor, coffee, tea, water, chargers and other crap you don't need. It's too obvious how";2
"We travel regulary to New York and used to rent an apartment. Unfortunately this is not possible anymore due to new legal rules.  We therefore chose the Empire Hotel as the rooms looked nice and it was located central close to Central Park.  But we was very disappointed. The room was very small and dark - we got a ""view"" to a dark backyard - see picture.  We'll probably not re-visit New York for some years - we await the possibility to rent an apartment.";2
The front desk said that there was a power outage since 2am of 5/16/21 in LAX area, though the airport and other hotals were running normally.  The hotel backup generator did not start the A/C.  So the room is hot and humid.  Could not sleep since then.;2

Stayed at Hilton with family - and booked 2 rooms.  Requested roll away beds so kids didn't have to sleep with a parent.  Houskeeking and front desk were RUDE and denied request for roll away - BUT would supply an extra pillow - so child couls sleep on the floor!!!!!  How much work could it have taken to bring a roll away bed to room???  I will not use this hotel again - as I have much better luck with Marriott . Also - to get to lobby - you have to walk trhough a buffett line . Never again.;2
Me and my partner visited this hotel Dec 2019 was the most perfect holiday and perfect location and hotel was ok! Never had problems when I was there...however, when I arrived on check inn I was told I had to pay $150 which was Â£121.59 English money for a security deposit (if I broke anything or smoked in the room etc) which I didnât and on check out I was told the money had been refunded back into my account and I would get it within 5-10 days. Which was fine!! Until it gets to March 2020 and I still havenât received my money. First I contacted my bank in the middle of January, they told me to contact the hotel so they put me through to the head office at the New Yorker hotels. After being on the phone for 40 minutes and no luck I was told the only way to contact the employees;2
We started our trip in las vegas,Traveled through San Diego and then finished in LA hollywood. We wanted to stay in the hilton for a quality stay at the end of our vacation. It SUCKED. it was very expensive no wifi, a bottle of water costed four bucks in the room and if you want a nice lunch in a buffet it costs 37 dollars per person plus taxes. :/ COMFORT INN in San Diego was much much better. excellent service! My advice is to find a different hotel. For that money you wont have a problem to find excellent service at a different hotel. Strongly recommend the VIP tour at warner brothers!!!;2

I write this review as I have been woken up for the third night running by party-goers returning rowdily to their rooms at 3.30am.  This is a huge hotel with 40 floors and the single rooms are small and uninspiring. The beds have a very thin quilt and for two nights I used my coat as a blanket before housekeeping picked up my call and I requested a second quilt.  The taps in the bathroom are stiff and I cannot open the cold tap but as no one picks up my calls to the front desk I have had to make do.  The feel of this place is like a giant youth hostel or budget guest house. The low price for the central location is its only advantage. And here come some more yelling and giggling party goers at 4am.;2
The bed was clean, the A/C worked, there was hot water, the parking lot was only two blocks away, and Central Park is only three blocks away.  But...the mattress was heavily covered to conceal the springs pushing out the sides, the CRT television did not carry ABC or CBS, there are no easy-to-reach outlets to recharge electronics, the carpeting covered several depressions in the floor, and the bathroom light switch was taped together!  This is an old building, and a relatively for New York cheaper in cost hotel.  There are few options in the area, and it's a shame the place wasn't fully renovated.  Next time in NYC I will stay in an area where there are more options.  One tip:  If you happen to stay there and need to go further uptown, walk to 96th Street before catching and;2
Great location, specially if you wants to stay in the west side, 96th subway station is literally just on the corner.  Besides that, hotel facilities are pretty old and the rooms in a quite bad conditions. Elevators mal-functioning, dirty appearance in the lobby, mattress had a kind of low area.   Team seems to be understaffed as well, specially Front Office.  Suggest you look for something else if you have time to look to search!   (Apparently higher floors are a bit newer, if you book ask for a room 12th floor up);2

My wife and I stayed at Astor on the Park for 4 nights in early October 2007. After trawling through all the reviews we thought we were selecting a medium range hotel for the cost of Â£477.00. We were bitterly disappointed. Upon arriving at the hotel we were shown to our room which measured eight foot by eight foot. We asked to be moved but were met with such a negative attitude that it was obvious that the staff could not be bothered. As we had pre-paid for this hotel we were trapped. The room was delapidated, shoddy but just about clean enough to sleep in. The TV did not work the wardrobe door was hanging off. There are no facilities at this hotel other than a vending machine in the basement, which was always empty, which to get to I had to clamber over dirty laundry. The hotel;2

We got in late and the room reserved for us was the last remaining one.  Unfortunately they had messed up the reservation and it was a room with one bed not two.  Shower was tiny.  Room overlooked the patio and was incredibly noisy.  Had to leave windows open as it was HOT. I now know much more about 2 drunken men's love lives than I could ever wish  Just generally loud and awkward.;2
Not the best hotel I've stayed in. We new that New York was expensive so we had to choose a cheaper hotel.  Beds were VERY comfortable! BUT our sheets on our bed didn't fit, there was no fitted sheet and the sheet didn't go to the end of the bed so our feet were on the bare mattress. The maids didn't ever vacuum cause we left something little on the floor to see if it would get vacuumed up! One day we got 4 towels, a bath mat and a hand towel, another day we got two towels and no bath mat. Bit inconsistent.;2
We are actually local here in NYC but I booked the hotel over Valentine's Day Weekend in 2014 to celebrate with my girlfriend. Boy, should I have gone elsewhere! First of all, I made my reservation through Jetsetter.com, which was a third-party hotel site that usually featured amazing hotels around the world. But obviously, including the Empire Hotel was a mistake on Jetsetter's part, and both of their customer services were horrible or nonexistent. I would never book through Jetsetter again or stay at the Empire Hotel.   I checked in on Friday Valentine's Day and was greeted by a long, disorderly, and unwelcoming line at the front desk. Front desk appeared understaffed, unfriendly, and expressed no desire in anyway to make our wait anymore tolerable. I learned throughout the;2
"The hotel was ""fine"" at best and most definitely not worth what we paid for it. First of all, upon checking in, the person behind the desk felt the need to confirm that 1 queen bed was fine for my husband and I. Two men sharing a bed is super confusing, I guess. The room was small but fine. The problem in the room was that there wasn't a fitted sheet on the bed. This doesn't hugely impact your sleep, but feeling the mattress creep in under your feet by the morning isn't exactly great. We figured they would deal with it when they made up the room the next day...but they never made up the room the next day. When I mentioned all of this at checkout, I was told they would look into why our room wasn't made up and we were sent on our way. So I'm out 550 bucks and left with 2 nights";2

First of all, ask for a renovated room. It will still have an old rug from the 80s but it WONT have is... peeling wallpaper, a dirty window with broken blinds, duck tape strips to hold the rug down, chunks of wood to hold the radiator in place and wads of tissue to hold the condensation dripping and an old bed. Wait for the hot water to kick in...after 10 minutes but hurry because it will get scalding ...hot/cold taps...who needs working taps?! Staff was somewhat friendly. One lady wasn't surprised when we asked to upgrade our room. Enough said... The perk is that it's a safe area and GREAT location 1 minute walk from subway station 1-2-3. Sorry, I don't have a great review for this hotel. We got what we paid for...New York is pricey and this was affordable for us.;2
"Pro's;  -Good location.  -Bath with hot water (although bath needed some attention!)   Cons; - Very tired- the room and hotel really needs some money spent to improve.

Bath plug looked like it was from when the building was first built and the actual bath fixture let the water drain out.

There was no hot water to take a shower in my room. They need to upgrade their soundproofing as well. The noise from outside (firetrucks and police cars) comes right through the window at 10pm. Wi-fi in the room is a separate charge for $12.95. Courtyard Marriott just opened a few blocks south from this hotel. I might have to change my regular routine and stay there.;2
small rooms and upon looking over the room a huge cockroach flew out of the bathroom. I didn't want to go downstairs empty handed so I attempted to find it by looking under the curtains and saw a previous guests toothbrush. Went back downstairs and was given another room. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night and left very early the next morning. They're currently checking the temperature of all visitors to before entering. This is known useless, I wouldn't be surprised if some higher-ups cousin sold them those things. I suppose they may turn away 1 or 2 people over the pandemic, but a temperature check doesn't catch the people who are asymptomatic or are building up. I guess it's pandemic theater and thank you for wasting my time waiting in line EVERY TIME I went back;2

"This is the nastiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It is in a wonderful location, but that's all it has going for it. The carpet is awful and the floor beneath it felt spongy. I wouldn't put my bare foot on it. The building was a converted apartment house and I shudder to think anyone ever lived in an apt this small. The furniture was scratched and looked like it had been purchased at a yard sale or thrift store. No comfortable chair to sit on and the desk/make up table had no light!

I returned at 4PM and now I had to wait behind about 10 people waiting to check in. When I got to the front of the line I was told that my room still wasn't ready, but it was my lucky day---they would upgrade me. Really? No apology? Did they think that an upgrade is a cause for celebration? Not for me.  The room looked like the room I had booked. I saw no difference.

"Our family spent four nights at the Empire Hotel. Overall conclusion: hardware is good, software not so much. In addition, there is a nightclub above the 11th floor, which makes it unbelievably noisy on the 11th floor where we stayed. The complementary earplugs should have warned us, but no earplug can help you against the thumping noice of the nightclub above. The rooftop terrace is a nice, and a very pleasant place to sit. The pool does not deserve the name; it is small and cold. The location of the hotel is excellent. With the exception of two very helpful guys at the frontdesk the staff is not very welcoming either. Most of them radiate that they are there for the paycheck, and not because their hearts are in their jobs. If you are in a hospitality job that is not good. We";2

After reading so many good reviews, and the location is close to where I live in West Village. I booked the hotel for 6 nights for my mom's visit. Checking-in was fabulous with the front desk Kevin, who was very pleasant and helped to choose a room with a view of the Hudson River. 2nd night, she woke up with freezing cold feet and realized there was no heat in the room. She contacted the front desk, the front desk (2 am) was room and only offered a blanket. She had to put on extra socks and fleece to keep warm ... until the day light.  I called the hotel around 8 am, a friendly Jose went to my mom's room (#301) with space heater, and checked on the radiator and said they were closed!!!!  Then the room was either too cold or too hot the next few days/nights. I don't think anyone;2
Lobby and staff were the only nice thing. Website pictures are very deceiving. The room was incredibly small, bathroom I could barely turn around in.

We were warmly welcomed, our beds were very comfortable, and we slept well after a long and tiring journey. The location is also great. However, our positive experience ended there.  Firstly, checking in before 3pm entails an additional fee of USD 100. Secondly, no breakfast is served due to the covid situation. Since bottled water is freely offered, a box containing the basics (for e.g, 1 yoghurt, 1 fruit, and 1 juice) would suffice if covid is a concern. Paradoxically, none of the staff wear masks. Moreover, the delivery company they have partnered with takes 3 hours to deliver food (thankfully there are other options nearby). Thirdly, upon check-in, we were required to provide a physical card that would solely serve the purpose of securing a USD 100 deposit. We were assured;2
I stayed at the Empire on a business trip, the overall hotel and staff were rather good until I checked out, the computer system was down so I was told I would be e-mailed my invoice- when it arrived I had either been charged 3x for my solo breakfast or what appeared to be someones bar tab added to my bill. Hotel took my call but never called back with resolution;2

Had higher expectations for this hotel as we had just stayed at one of the same name in orlando that was a lovely stay. However, this hotel is very dated and in need of some repair.  Just in our room: TV did not work properly Air con was very loud that it woke us up more than once through the night The free wifi did not work  The bed was small - our feet hung off the edge The bed was not very comfy Lots of masking tap around the room holding bits together No light in the wardrobe/room with safe Carpet was dirty The door didn't seem to close properly  Furniture looked like it had seen better days All of this didnt give good first impressions!   we were on the third floor, only one set of elevators were working which would take a long time to arrive if they were at the top and;2

Stayed here on business - booked by a work associate due to the extraordinary low price. The inside was fine - the room was small, bedding new, overall clean. There is no wi-fi - and a pricey charge for connecting to the internet.    This is not a great neighborhood.   The breakfast wasn't too great.   There are no decent restaurants in the immediate vicinity and because this isn't the best neighborhood you don't want to walk outside after dark.  There are a lot better hotels in the Hollywood/Beverly Hills area.;2

I was really looking forward to staying here but unfortunately I was disappointed. Hotel needs a renovation, itâs tired. Pictures of pool are misleading itâs small. Expect long waits for anything at reception, no room service, no breakfast included. Staff are friendly and cleaning staff excellent but overall this was overpriced and a disappointment in terms of quality, accuracy and service.;2
Booked through travel agent. Will suggest they recommend somewhere else. Only recommendation for this hotel is the location, Room tatty, and too small for 3 adults. Nowhere to unpack luggage. No drinks supplied. Breakfast for a dollar offered every time we logged onto free wifi, but not honoured.;2
Orrendo! Room smallest then a 500 fiat car, avoid it. I was here for business and paid a stop in Manhattan for rest. There is no place to put a suitcase and no chear in the room a useless sink outside the bathrom that was without it.;2
Our stay did not go well.  I spoke with the night manager on 10-20-17.  He said he would speak with the Day manager at 7:30am and that I would receive a phone call about the problem I'll describe below.  As of 3:30pm, no one had called me.  The only way I got a response was for me to proactively reach out via email to the Guest Experience manager.  When we left our room morning of the day before, I made sure the Do Not Disturb sign was in place and correctly displayed.  When we returned last night, the sign was gone.  Not inside the room, gone.  Housekeeping had entered our room against my direction.  The housekeeper:  1) moved toiletries around on the countertop to place a washcloth under them, yet left obvious trash in place on the countertop.  2) removed/replaced towels that;2
Rooms and hotel are clean, and well kept. Some of the decor is out dated. Not having a working room phone, and lamp was annoying. The front desk workers did not want to help, and seemed annoyed with our requests to fix the phone. The location at night is a bit shady, many drunk homeless outside that proceeded to cat call us. However, it is a 5 min walk to the metro, which is a quick way of getting around to some of the main tourist spots.;2

Helpful and diligent staff, and convenient to Penn Station.  But that's where it ends.  Rooms and furnishings are minimal at best.  Handle falling off the tiny metal locker (not closet).

Of cause it is understandable that hotels in capitals or cultural centers of the world are tremendously expensive and thus when we look for accommodation we try to fit price, location and quality in some reasonable margin. This is exactly what I did sometime back when I first time traveled to USA. I picked New Yorker first for its location - which is convenient but for active travellers, who can walk through NY city center in 6 hours as I did, the location wasnât that drastically important after all. The price,  I remember, was average, buy when I arrived they took quite big deposit and almost the same amount at the cost of my 7 days stay. This didnât help me in budgeting my stay for next week, thanks god I did have some funds additionally to not starve there to death. It was;2
Unfortunately the negative elements of my stay at the Empire outweighed the positive. For that reason, I wonât be returning and wouldnât recommend this hotel.  The location is great, just off Broadway and close to Central Park and the Lincoln Centre. The hotel staff were very courteous and the check-in experience fairly efficient. The rooftop bar is a really cool place to hang out, good food and drinks, great views, not cheap but as you would expect for Manhattan. That is where the positives end.  The rooms are small, old and tired. In fairness the bed was comfortable enough however the aircon so noisy I had to switch it off to sleep and the (free) broadband dropped out so frequently it was impossible to work. I am so pleased I had booked a Superior King Room because anything;2
I personally viewed the hostel before booking. It is a short walk from the Hammersmith station. I was taken by elevator to the room (4 bunk in a room).  The room was clean, had a mini frig.  There was a closet for clothes, but it was a large one and did not have a locking system (if this room was shared with others not in your party).  The facility was clean as they are remodeling.  The room had large tiled floors.  The kitchen was small and clean, however, there was not any items to use (pots, pans, etc).  There was a microwave.  In the room, there was a p setting of 4 plate, cup, utensils, and 4 rolls of toilet tissue.  A towel was provided for the length of your stay and sheets for the bed as well.  Then we arrived for our stay with some changes.  Upon asking, the staff did;2

The definite pro of this hotel is it's location. The proximity (5 minute walk, if that) to Central Park was a huge bonus...and 15 minute walk to Times Square. The location is fantastic.  Now....onto the cons. We were checking in earlier than usual - we had a morning flight into the city. We've done some pretty extensive traveling - my husband is the VP of a flight company. However, checking into the Empire Hotel was not easy. Yes, we were early arriving and I'm ok with storing my luggage and exploring the city, but I've NEVER heard of a hotel that didn't have rooms open prior to 3 pm. (?? makes no sense) Then, when we returned at 3:30 to the hotel, it was overrun by 'models' and fashion designers (fashion week) - we could barely get into the hotel...let alone find someone to;2

I have stayed in motels for  $75.00 a night that were many times nicer than this one. The room is tiny, there is no closet space, the bathroom is designed for undersized humans and they charge $10.00 a day for internet access. There is nothing good to say about this hotel. The only thing going for it is location. It is across the street from Lincoln Center. My advice, just find somewhere else to stay.;2

Me and my partner visited this hotel Dec 2019 was the most perfect holiday and perfect location and hotel was ok! Never had problems when I was there...however, when I arrived on check inn I was told I had to pay $150 which was Â£121.59 English money for a security deposit (if I broke anything or smoked in the room etc) which I didnât and on check out I was told the money had been refunded back into my account and I would get it within 5-10 days. Which was fine!! Until it gets to March 2020 and I still havenât received my money. First I contacted my bank in the middle of January, they told me to contact the hotel so they put me through to the head office at the New Yorker hotels. After being on the phone for 40 minutes and no luck I was told the only way to contact the employees;2
The location is the only advantage to staying at this property. The room did not have a safe in the room to lock money and it certainly felt like you should... anyone could have picked the lock . The elevator was suitable for 2 people only and there was only one. It reminded me of a hostel! Coffee in the morning was far and difficult to find.;2

This hotel should be a 2 star at the most. The facilities are in tel bad shape, the BAR was under renovation , the breakfast room is in the basement which is reached thru  adark and ugly hall. There is no restaurant and no minibar even though it does have a fridge.  The bathroom was ok but run down. Maid service was terrible never replenished toiletries. The neighborhood is not sage to walk at night and there are only raunchy places nearby. The only good thing is the friendly staff.

Hotel looked nice online. When you arrive, lobby, reception and even lifts are all clean and look nice. When you get into the rooms though, wallpaper coming off, door lock in the bathroom was broken, and generally a bit shabby. They don't provide Internet in the rooms, which is a bit misleading, as online it says they do. When you get there you find out it's only available for free in the lobby, and you need to pay if it's in the room. Not stated online + very annoying when trying to plan a trip. It was also very expensive to buy anything in the hotel. Drinks were 15 dollars+, with tip and tax. In the room they're offering water for 8 dollars. Feel like they are trying to rip you off whilst charging you for it. Made sure I stayed out the hotel for a good 15 hours during the day.;2
Not a bad location for a hotel, however these days I am not sure it is pardonable not to have wifi thrown into the package. That definitely takes away two stars in my opinion. I guess you can add the price of wifi to the bill as a strategy, but asking guests to pay for wifi usage in the rooms is kind of outdated. Stayed here for two days. Good thing about the location is the convenience store nearby and a Starbucks at the street corner too.;2
Got this hotel on Priceline because I tried to go with a 3 star. I'd had good luck with Holiday Inn Express hotels so I thought this category that mentioned chain hotels too would be fine, but not so much.  Very dated rooms.  Felt gross.  Especially the bed and bedding.  Regretted it. Wouldn't stay again even if it was for under $50!;2

The Hotel is 2 steps from Penn Station, wich is great to visit to city. The staff at the front desk are very nice. The only problem is, they did not seem to know a lot about the area. We asked for breakfast recommendations twice, and it was always disapointing, knowing NYC has so many restaurants and things to offer. Whenever we asked any questions, we never felt their answer was  helping us. Management should maybe train their staff a little more about attractions and restaurants. The bed is VERY hard, and from our room we could hear everything in the street and the hallway. Again, staff was always smilling and very nice, did their best to help.;2

Over all the hotel was beautiful inside and out. Including the room I was given and the people that worked at the hotel. The thing that was terrible was that with the value payed there was no air conditioning in the room when it was about 90 degrees outside it felt like 95 inside the room.;2
"The room was nice, after a shower though the water wouldn't shut off completely.  Pool was wonderful, warm and clean; pool bar too.  During our stay the elevators were having major issues.  The wait for an elevator at times was 15 minutes, one elevator I was going down to the pool level from the lobby and it ended up being a ride from Willy Wonka movie; went up to the 24 floor, didn't open, then went back down to the Lobby where I promptly got off since the doors finally opened.  Most of the staff was very friendly and nice, there was one front desk attendant who wasn't very friendly.   Wi-Fi is only free to Hilton Honors guests and is $7.95 per 24 hour period.";2

My previous review stated this is one of the best places to stay in NYC, but upon my second stay I now understand that there is a significant difference between the rooms that have been renovated and the rooms that have not been renovated.  My most recent stay was in a room that had not been renovated, and I was very disappointed in how dilapidated the room was after talking it up to the rest of my traveling party who were rightly skeptical at my reservation.  Unless you can ensure a renovated room, this hotel is not even close to being worth the money!  I must also warn you the elevator is scarier to ride in than most, and if the front desk employees engage in a conversation, you can be assured they will not assist you until their discussion is complete, no matter how hard you;2

Not very clean. Good value for LA I suppose but would spend more money next time.  Well-located for studio tour - not far from Burbank. Really noisy room - stayed two nights and first night nobody slept!  No heat in room - had to cart out an oil-heater from the closet and plug it in (hard to find a plug) and leave it on all night.  Very awkward.  Poorly-designed/appointed room with mini fridge with microwave on top of it just plugged in and left almost in middle of a blank wall.  Horrible to look at - mould in bathroom, dirty carpet. Photo of hotel misleading - not front door but entrance from parking lot!;2
The customer service was below average and the bathroom had a broken shower. My experience was not good like I would have expected. When I checked out and shared my dissatisfied experience the gentleman that checked me out was not very sympathetic;2

The hostel itself is conveniently placed 2 minutes from Hammersmith underground and bus station, it's newly refurbished and clean but the pros end here. The staff were very rude and not helpful at all. For the money we paid we didn't get a good value - the room did have a fridge but no table where you could actually eat. The kitchens are fully fitted but there are no pots or pans. What's more the wifi isn't free, it costs Â£1 per hour (sic!). All over, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. are f;2
Staff is kind and courteous.  The hotel itself has some problems. 1)  There is no shower door.  So the bathroom floor got soaked every time I showered. I assumed this was a mistake, but the front desk said that none of the rooms had shower doors.  2)  There isn't a full size ironing board available, they only have the mini ones so it made ironing my suit for my interview problematic. 3) The room is very small, which is not unusual for city hotels, but other small places have shelves and other things that give you places to put things.  4) The bed was hard as a rock.  I recommended to the university that they stopped putting up their guests here.  If you have interviewing of giving a lecture, you need a good nights sleep and a way to look your best. I would only stay at this;2
People at the desk were supportive, even if they were not so friendly at the phone. It was rather a hostel than a hotel. The single room wasn't small but it was in quite bad conditions with very poor furniture. No bugs in the bed, but the synthetic nature of mattress and pillow, combined with sheets and pillow case, caused the bed to be squeaky, sweaty and sticky, not comfortable anyway. I stayed in the hotel just the time to sleep and shower. A clean fridge was available for my use in the room. Toilets and showers were available in the corridor and they were cleaned rather often. The location was fantastic, 1 block away from the subway (5min walk, line 1-2-3) in a quiet and safe residential area. Upper West is the best to visit Manhattan. Good low-budget, sleep-and-go;2

Positive: The hotel is kinda close to the subway and it's near some good bars, restaurants, supermarkets and drugstores. Negative: We booked a double bed room with a shared bathroom. Our room was super tiny, we weren't even able to walk on the floor with our 2 suitcases! We also had this tiny TV but it didnt even work. (I mean we payed a lot for the tiny room and we were so unhappy in this hotel, so we just wanted a TV that works - even tho we didn't even watched TV) They promised to send a TV guy for fixing it, but no one ever came! After 3! days of complaining about that broken TV, they gave us another room. Now we stayed at a bigger room with a bigger TV and an own bathroom. Thanks to the broken TV! The only negative thing was that they didnt put sheets on the pillows. All in;2
Luckily I only stayed here for two nights. The bathroom was dirty and had a used face cloth in my bathroom. The next night I didn't have hot water because their furnace was not working so I couldn't take a shower. I stayed here out of the other options because of the roof top bar. Unfortunately, it is only open during summer hours or for private parties. It is also very loud which is a given in NYC, so you if you are looking for a good night rest I would not stay on a busy street.;2

Simply put: you get what you pay for. I'm used to hostels and I didnt mind the place, but my friends are used to hotels and thought it was a nightmare. Upper West side, which is a nice neighborhood, close to Central Park, with plenty of bars, diners, restaurants and coffee shops around, which was great. Subway stations are within walking distance, but hotel itself is on a quiet street, which is definitely a plus. Rooms are very outdated and simply practical (no decorations or anything added), but clean. Clean towels are provided and beds were made everyday, which was a nice surprise. Reception is 24 hours, although you shouldn't expect anything from the staff: i have never met a staff as disinterested as at the Morning Side Inn. Only thing that was a massive inconvenience was;2

I saw random signs that then hotel was under construction but it wasnât until 9am on a Thursday morning where we couldnât hear our own voices when a jack hammer was hammering up against our adjoining  wall.  We saw the yellow tape on the door right next to ours but didnât think anything of it. I went down that morning and requested to move rooms stating we wanted to sleep in the next morning since we wouldnât be attending Universal Studios and was told the hotel was sold out and all they could do was put our name on a list. I asked if a manager could call me and when we got back to our room there as a general form letter explaining their construction from the hotel manager.  The same letter posted downstairs.

When booking a Hotel in New York unless you are prepared to spend BIG bucks (more than $600 a night) you have to make some compromises. For the price of a 5* hotel in most other cities in America/Europe, you get, at best, a 3* hotel.   I'll start with the good points: The Beds are comfortable. It's very well located for the upper west side.  Now the bad points:  We had decided to splash out and book a Junior Suite. Number one point: NO CLOSET. There was a hole in the wall covered by a curtain within which was also the safe and the minibar. This meant that jackets could not hang straight down. There were also only two small drawers to keep all your clothes in. Also we had no daylight - the room overlooked an interior space - you had to crane your neck to see the sky.  The Air;2

Disappointed. Luckily we stayed only for one night on our way to Washington DC by train. The location was good near Penn Station though. But like often near stations you can expect smell of weed everywhere.  Very crowded and fuzzy in the lobby since there was some kind of youth happening nearby. The room was outdated to say the least, and very small. You could almost hit the toilet seat closing the door. The bed was not very comfortable. The window was small and the view was the opposite brick wall. Sorry, but cannot recommend this hotel.;2
The location was great but the room was very small. It was one of the cheaper options when we booked but if I was to go again I would do more research and find an alternative.  Pro's: - Great location, very busy even late at night so never felt unsafe. We could see Penn Station from the room window which was very handy for airport and subway. - Wifi worked really well and was really fast - Bed was mostly comfortable - Affordable - Friendly staff  Con's: - The room was extremely basic, no wardrobe/desk or any space to put things bar about 6 hooks. After the first couple of days we got used to living out of the suitcase but it was still unpleasent.  - Sirens were at all hours and incredibly loud, I recommend ear plugs. - It never felt very clean - No elevator and we were on the;2

The room was fine, the wall of the room was hin though. the bathrooms were clean. The location is good, too. But the most of the receptionists were really not friendly.  I got sick early in the morning on the day of departure and even called an ambulance. As the doctor said, I should rest and not fly on that day, I decided to stay there for another night. I called them and the room was available. But they made me to go down to reception immediately and pay, saying otherwise they give the room away. I barely could move at that time. When I was finally at the reception to pay, they told me they donât accept credit cards. They made me to go back to my room, get cash and come back. They could have been nicer and more flexible.;2

The only good thing about this Hotel is the location! The room as small and dated they arenât clean the hotel stinks of week as does the whole of NYC . We was 3 adults sharing a room we had to upgrade to a suite just to be able to move this is where the issues started we read the review before. about the Hotel over charging guest and yes they over charged us by over 200 dollars I now have to get my bank to get my money back the staff really donât have a clue itâs ruined out Holiday;2
I didn't see any mice. The room was clean, but the door seemed likely to fly open if anyone leaned on it from the outside. No noise problem, the neighbourhood seemed ok, good eating nearby, fairly close to the subway. I found the staff very helpful and courteous. For $65 a night I guess you are going to be lucky to get better, but next time I will be happy to spend more to be in a better place.;2
I proceeded to book this hotel having seen many positive reviews, and giving it the benefit of the doubt.   During our stay the Westminster Kennel Club dog show meant that the hotel was packed full of dogs - whilst that was no problem for us, it might have been somewhat different with allergies.   The hotel lobby gives an impression of the grandeur that once was - unfortunately, the luxury ends there.   As mentioned in other reviews, the lift situation is awful - although they are supposed to be replaced next month, we found we needed to leave an extra ten minutes when we left our room to ensure we werenât late. Only two of the eight lifts for the hotel floors were operational during our stay.   The room itself was fine but extremely dated - this is particularly noticeable in;2

My room is fine. I read online that the single cabins were 50 square feet, so I wasn't surprised. I am very disappointed to find that Cafe Gitane has closed. Not only that, but I have gone down to the reception every morning to inquire about coffee. I am always told that it's not ready yet. Really? No cafe is one thing. No coffee at all?

Dirty overall, room stiffing hot with no way to adjust. Noisy, hotel room didn't lock from the inside properly, didn't feel safe being on the first floor. Very tiny rooms. Booked a king room on the same day of arrival, but when I showed up, they didn't have it and gave me a double but wouldn't reduce my room rate. Would never recommend.;2
Stayed on the first floor with inward facing room. The noise from the industrial ventilation system which was outside our windows was completely unacceptable. Exit to roof top bar needs a bit of a refresh. Staff were very friendly.;2
These reviews are absolutely correct, the website pictures do not reflect what this hotel and the rooms actually look like.  This place is very run down and not kept up well.  The owner should be ashamed of himself/herself! The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  Even when they were dealing with angry guests complaining about the conditions of this place, they handled it professionally and graciously.  At over $250 per night for our stay we were first given a room that was so run down and smelled so bad that we asked for a new room (which is not typically for me to do).  Then the WiFi is slow and/or unreliable! The elevators are slow and tiny! The televisions only have about half of the channels that the hotel guide claims to have.  The hotel was incredibly disappointing,;2

An Instagram v reality hotel - looks great on the outside & in the lobby, but beyond that it is in need of some serious TLC. The rooms are dated & we had to call reception at 2am for assistance to get some air into the room as it was too hot & the rickety unit was shut off. The view from the room window would have been great if it was clean and the wifi was the worst Iâve used on my travels for years, making the âresort feeâ all the more laughable. Furthermore, unlike any other hotel Iâve travelled to across the world, the reception at check out didnât remind/inform me that I had to pay that âresort feeâ, so Iâve just seen it pop up on my credit card bill (that card was holding card for incidentals rather than the one I would pay with given I also incurred a nice non-Sterling;2

"This was the designated hotel for a conference (held elsewhere) that I attended.  First impression of hotel was soured by division of duties / labour between people ""greeting "" you outside front door and bellman - apparently there's a difference in responsibilities and the former can't help arrange luggage to room. I was corrected by the former and dont really need a insincere 'have a good day"" afterwards  Room was large and comfortable, although rather dated decor. No complaints about quality of the bed though as I slept soundly.  Good choices at buffet for breakfast. Evening meal was less successful with slow, surly service - if my drink had been ""placed"" any harder on the table, I think the glass would have broken  Fitness centre is a depressing, dingy joke - looks as its";2
"The location was perfect for our conference at the New York Society for Ethical Culture.  It has a lovely lobby, the front desk staff was good and the concierge was fantastic.  I'm not sure how it's rated 4 star.  My room was like a sauna and the roof top bar and outside noise were unbearable.  When I called the front desk at 4:00am to let them know my air unit was on cool (and off), yet it was still blowing out hot air, I was told, ""You know your windows open.  It's usually hot on your floor.""  The second evening was better as I learned to adjust the air by my window openings.  However, the windows being open made the road noise intolerable.  Luckily, they provided ear plugs... for no charge.  There was a charge for EVERYTHING else.  Even the Keurig coffee, $3.00.  The rooms";2
Paid $2400 for a room with a view for 7 nights and although I got a nice view the room was not clean and it was old. Dust everywhere, filthy towels and dated room. And only one small window 1 meter. It felt like a dungeon. Small room, not big enough for a family of four. Beds are almost singles (130-140).  Half of elevators not working so it takes around 15 min to get down to lobby in the morning.   Cons -not fresh room -small beds (those are not double beds, the size was 140cm)  -not fresh bathroom and super small. Hardly fit 1 person inside. The toilet is next to the door and the door opens inside. -shady area, unfortunately the area has a lot of junkies, homeless and mental ill people. Not recommended for families. -the elevator sounded all night (our room was next to it);2
Although in a great location, this hotel leaves much to be desired.  It could do with a complete makeover or failing that, a good clean.  The rooms, the bathrooms and the closets are all way too small (nowhere to hang an overcoat).  The free WiFi is only available in the lobby lounge where there are never any seats.  WiFi in your room will cost you 12 dollars per device per 24hours.  Would not recommend.;2

Initially I was going to give this hotel a good rating, but due to the horrible service...2Stars.  It was THAT bad I did it.  Rude beyond belief.  I never get mad, but they treat you so rudely and horribly that one can't help but need to stand outside and take a breather.  And how often do you need to talk to the service?  More than you'd think.  Breakfast? Just skip it because those women cooking are so above you and you could only be so lucky to eat here.  They think everyone there is a bum and was off the top rude to me that I didn't even eat breakfast, instead I went upstairs to complain, where I ran into another rude rude rude woman.    Ahhhhhhhhhhh!  ahhhhhhhh!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Okay, much better.;2
Just plain horrible Is all I can say about our experience here. Showed up having rented 4 rooms and understood that we might be able to get early check-in so we arrived at noon.  Didnât expect to get early check in since it was a busy weekend but guaranteed check in is at 3 PM. We finally got our rooms at 5:30 PM with an apology and nothing else offered.  Had to insist on compensation and was given reluctantly a one drink coupon insisted again that they give me more than one so that I can have a drink with one of our guests who had to deal with two children while he waited over five hours for his room.

Spent two weeks at Empire - girls holiday away from usual hassles as we were staying 2 weeks we booked a junior suite as thought the extra room would be useful. Very disappointed - room very dark, no central light in room, just lamps, queen beds x 2 very comfortable, lounge area non existent and if one had sat on lounge it would take you a day to get out of it as was low and so spongy! No writing desk, on whole very inadequate room. One of the reasons I wanted to stay at Empire was the rooftop bar, which of course was closed over the cooler months, but there was no information on website (that I read) that stated this. Will compliment the cleaning staff but front desk very disappointing.;2
"I'll start with the positives. First, the location is brilliant ... right opposite the Lincoln Centre and easy to get to everywhere else. The staff are helpful and there is a great bar area in the lobby. The bed in our Junior Suite was also exceptionally comfortable.   And then the negatives. First and foremost, and the reason why this hotel will never get another cent of my money, is the lack of free internet. It's free in the lobby but you then have to pay for it in the rooms. In this day and age this is totally unacceptable. In the 1950s you were charged extra to have a hot bath. Times have changed and you would not dream of charging people extra for hot baths in a hotel of this type in New York today. And the world of communication has also changed; internet access (like hot";2
The rooms are passable but do not expect decent or anything close to really nice. They need upgrading with paint peeling off the roof, door arches that have water marks. Basic old room with upgraded furniture. There are cracks on the tiles and the mirror is showing wear and tear. Only stay here if its just needed to sleep and not spend anytime in the room. The outside patio is upgraded and relaxing with natural light. I enjoyed this area of the hotel.

"I don't feel the cost of the room meets the value received. My check in process was average but felt it could have been more efficient (notification when room is ready). The room was small with no closet and an outdated air conditioning unit. The housekeeping was poor. I called for an iron, they asked if I looked in the closet (I did not have) and was told one would be brought up. Waited an hour, had to call back same request.

If youâre a tourist and want to experience old NY and stay in one of the noisiest, busiest, dirtiest parts of the city this is for you. The building is historic and you can see how it would have been in its heyday in the 1950s. But itâs now  dirty, old, walls are water damaged and plaster is peeling. Itâs noisy (I was on the 29th floor) and I wish I could have seen it âway back thenâ....because the heavy doors, marble trim on the walls, Art Deco artifacts by the elevators all look charming. But Iâd never spend the $ i did here again. It needs a major overhaul. Convenient to the train stations though!;2
With two children in college in the NY/ Conn. area over the past six years, I have spent a lot of time in NYC hotels. I had stayed at The Empire at least two times prior to this trip and was pleased with the accommodations and the responsiveness of the staff. This time my trip to NY was for my daughter's college graduation. We (my mother and I) had reservations for May 15th-19th. My mother accompanied me on this trip so one can only imagine that two women staying in NY for five days would have a fair amount of clothing. Among ours were long formal gowns and several dress suits which we brought along for the many celebratory events we had planned.  Our check-in went smoothly but it was all downhill from there. We were given room number 935. The first thing my mother and I noticed;2

Upon arrival I requested a room on a higher floor and was told the hotel was sold out which was a lie.Upon entering the room I immediately noticed some small stains and hair on the sheets.  My husband called to inform the front desk and we were quickly moved to a different room which was tiny my husband and myself couldnât fit in the bathroom together as we needed to get ready for our dinner. we requested a different room because the new room was just to small. The third room was better but the bathroom outlet didnât work so I had to do my hair in the bedroom. We stay in the city almost every weekend and expect to enjoy our room and hotel amenities. this was a disappointing experience and we will definitely not return for a stay. The manager was also rude he came upstairs to;2

At first glance The Empire Hotel seems like a luxury hotel exactly as it is advertised, 4 stars. However once you actually start looking at things more closely you'll realize the luxury appearance is just that, appearance. The decor is A+ but the upkeep on it is an F. Nice wallpaper buts it peeling. Nice door but it's cracking. Nice sink but it's broken. Nice shower but the shower head leaks. Room is nicely cooled by a loud rattling a/c. Elevators constantly skip your floor so after waiting for 20 minutes you just take the stairs and run into other people who've given up on the elevators. Now my absolute biggest complaint, luxury hotel that nickel and dimes you? Ugh. Final nail on the coffin. $7.50 for a small bottle of water, you have to pay for expensive wifi (I can't even;2
"I won't write a lengthy review, but simply say this is a sort of place to rest for the evening if your sightseeing NYC, but for folks that need a nice hotel and nice room, look elsewhere.

The rooms here need gutting but because the location is desirable, patrons will likely put up with it to save a buck.

We didn't read the reviews about this hotel before we booked, if we had, this wouldn't have been the hotel of our choice.  I want to make my review as accurate as possible and after all, this hotel was cheaper than many others, you get what you pay for. One of the previous reviews said The Astor on the Park was like an upmarket hostel and I think that sums it up.   We booked 2 rooms and specifically asked for rooms with a view of the park with one room to have twin beds. The rooms we got looked across a small yard right in to the bedrooms on the other side, the window blinds had to be closed all the time or people in the rooms opposite could see right in. Whose fault this mix up was is still up for discussion so maybe not the hotels fault.  One of the rooms wasn't too bad but;2

We had 5 rooms, the keys were just given out and our parents did not get the large room the requested, instead it was given to one of our guests and they didnt want to be rude so they kept the smaller room. The air was not on in the room and our thermostat read 90 degrees, it took hours for it to cool down. My bf sat on the bed and the bead was broken, the box spring was split in half. we called the front desk and they said they could put us on another floor which we did not want to do b/c we were already unpacked and had booked our rooms next to one another. They said they would send someone up to exchange it, never happend. So we just slept on it. One of guests went to get into the bed and a nasty bottle of lotion was in the sheets- obviosly the sheets were not changed. she;2
"My expectations were not high after reading the reviews, but still, I was disappointed when I saw the room. The room was really small - even smaller than rooms in Europe hotels - looked sad and needed some maintenance. Moreover, the bedclothes were stained. However, the hotel is close from 2 subway stations and from Central Park. The floor was quiet and there was always hot water. It was clean and  looked bugs free. So overall, it was alright. You just have to realize the hotel is like a ""private bedroom and bathroom"" hostel. Hotel in NYC are super expensive, so Morningside Inn is still a reasonnably good option.";2
We enjoy staying at Wyndhams typically and after years of staying other places in Times Square, this time I went for a place close to Penn station since we are in and out after 1 night. What a disappointment. For over $300 you would think the room would be big enough for you to keep your suitcase open. We found one spot where we could open it up but it was in the middle of the walkway so it had to be opened and closed each time you needed something. I know itâs NYC and rooms are small but Iâve never had one this small.   I donât know how much you have to pay for the views the others talked about, ours did not get us a view (see picture).

We arrived from Texas on 12/31/05 for the Rose Bowl Game.  Our check-in was fine but the next day we went shopping and upon our arrival, we had been locked out of our hotel room.  (our reservation was for 6 nights using our Hilton Honor Points and the final night paying by credit card for $180.00).  We were very worried as our Rose Bowl Tickets were locked in the safe inside.  The girl working the desk reprogramed our cards and we were able to get back in. But, it appears that the manager, Phillipe, chose to refuse the Hilton Honors points and I spent over 6 hours trying to straighten it out.  The manager tried to bill us for New Years Eve (4 times the regular cost) since it was the most expensive night of the year instead of our final night.  It was only after much complaining;2

Empire Hotel is memorable because of it's strangeness and art deco ugly.  It's dark and there are wall paper is filled with faceless frames.  What's up with that.  Besides being dark and the room size super small, 191 square feet.  It's cheap and so you get what you pay for.  Overall the hotel is dark, including the Lobby Check-In and bar lounge next to it. The bathroom is so small, it's hard to move around in.  The shower head connected to the 9 foot ceiling was too high for me a short person at 5 feet and couldn't get a decent shower.  It's summer time and the pool is closed.  The rooftop bar is beautiful but always busy and to access it, you must leave the hotel and take an elevator just inside the foyer.  Strange.;2

The title really sums it up. As two friends travelling to New York on a budget for long days of sightseeing, we just wanted to somewhere to get some sleep late at night before getting up early the next morning. This wouldn't be a place you'd go for a romantic weekend.  We stayed for almost a week and the hotel is in a fantastic location on the Upper West Side. The Subway is outside the front door, Central Park is a 10 minute walk away and there's loads of great bars and food places around.  When we checked in, NYC was going through a bit of a heatwave with temperatures getting up to 34 degrees (Celsius) and our room had no air conditioning. The sheets were ripped and the room was fairly dusty with dirty carpets. Thankfully, some air conditioning was installed after the second;2
After reading that short term renting is a thing of the past I find myself with conflicting feelings.  I stayed there many years ago the summer after 9-11.  The place was a dive but all I did was sleep and store my stuff.  I did several loads of washing in the basement and talked with several residents about the building and living in NY.  It was great.  Being so close to Lincoln Center and Central Park and the Subway was great.  But I guess it will never happen again.  Real Mixed feelings.;2
My business partner and I stayed at this hotel in April this year and it is a DUMP! The rooms are OLD and TIRED as are the beds as well. The bathrooms are too small and I wouldn't walk on the carpet in my bare feet as it is disgusting. Also, I was concerned about how secure the hotel is because anyone off the streel could jump to the balcony at my room. This hotel also has a club in the basement and has loud music playing late. I personally witnessed a pimp and a lady of the night trying to solicit business in the parking lot, a parking lot that they charge $10 a day for (not worth it). There is a free breakfast, but it is very average. The only thing good about this hotel is it in close proximity to the 101 highway.;2

When we checked in we were given a room on the 34th floor, it was the smallest room I've ever seen, not even enough room to manoeuvre a suitcase across the room. The entire room is in desperate need of an update. We complained at the front desk and they gave us a new room on the 19th floor. This room was bigger but still had the same dated furniture. The bathroom was terrible, there was no room to put any toiletries and the shower was poor. Not worth the money;2
We had a suite, so the room size was good, and location is ok, but based on the following issues, I would not recommend this hotel: - Heater - the first night one of our heaters was broken, so they came to fix it.  However, the other heater made such a horribly loud noise that it kept us up all night, which with a 2 year old was a nightmare.  We asked for it to be fixed, and they said that is just the way the old steam heaters work, so we ended up sleeping without heat the next 2 nights.  It was better to be freezing that not sleep due to the horrid noise. - Check in - room was not ready until 30 min after check out time.  Would not have been a huge deal, but in combination with everything else, it was just one more negative - Bathroom - Felt dingy, and there was a rusty;2

Upon arriving, you have to pay the end of the deposit before being allowed into the room (which is fair). However, there is no easy access lift, and we were not directed to one. We had made our booking over a month in advance (two twin rooms), and had asked them to put a mattress in one of the rooms two weeks before our trip for a new depend coming with us. Upon arrival, we were informed that they had messed up our booking and gave us two double-bed rooms. They entirely forgot about the mattress, and told us that one of us could just sleep on blankets. When we protested, they agreed to bring up the mattress by six. We ended up waiting in the room until half eight before the mattress arrived. We also had medication for a disabled friend that needed to be refrigerated. The fridge;2
"I booked the HH without knowing a thing about it. It was supposed to be a 3 Star Hotel.  The room i was given (323) was the smallest room i have ever stayed in. I could touch the bed and every wall simultaneously. I didnt need the remote as I could change channels etc w/o leaving the bed. The TV itself was definitely 19"" or smaller- I think it was 15"". The inroom coffee was a 'one cupper'. There was a small micro and fridge in the room, usually a sign of a ""resident hotel"" for the locals but i considered it a plus where there were very few.   The door to my room was maybe 4 feet from the bed and had a big gap between door and floor so for sound purposes, i might have just as well been trying to sleep in the hall.

"THE GOOD: Nicely located near Lincoln Center and lower Central Park. Friendly staff. Clean. No bugs. Safe feeling environment. THE BAD: The room (queen bed) was incredibly small. Tiny bath with peeling paint.  All amenities (Wi-Fi, in room coffee maker, etc.) are billed extra. The entire property seems an example of faded glory and substandard maintenance. All told, equivalent to a $75 Super 8 in most parts of the country but without Wi-Fi and breakfast. THE UGLY: Seventy-five percent of the flat (storage) space in our tiny room was crowded with ""for sale amenities"" (i.e. wine, coffee, $8 bottled water and even a $35 umbrella!) Me thinks a room should include room for the guest!";2
The ONLY two good things about this hotel were the price and the friendliness of the staff. The rooms and the overall facility are really uncomfortable. The hotel felt like they had not cleaned up after room remodeling. The rooms are TINY. Our room was constantly too hot, there was no thermostat to adjust the temperature, the wireless was slow, the bed occupied so much of the room that you had no place to put more than small luggage. The bathroom was so small that you could not sit on the toilet without knocking the toilet paper off the wall. There were no flat surfaces in the bathroom to set out any cosmetics unless you used the top of the toilet. No iron in the room, no coffee maker, no hair dryer, or any of the typical amenities you get from the average Holiday Inn in;2
Proximity to the airport is why I booked this hotel and the free shuttle made it a good choice in terms of getting there quickly. Hotel was so-so, staff not helpful. Watched me struggle with my bags to the lifts. Reception staff not helpful and didn't check notes on booking. Was charged 2 times, hoping 1 will be reversed. Room was good size though carpets could not with a clean and the chairs. Had a coffee machine but no water to fill it and no room service. Bed was comfortable, though I got down the blanket as I was cold and it was really frayed. The room was quiet except for the hallway noice. I think next time I would rather book a hotel further out which is better.;2
The great location is about the only positive point. Brusque service except from the door staff. Don't risk taking a standard room. Ours faced inwards to the area where the AC machinery was located, creating constant noise. It was like trying to sleep in a train! Our room was dingy and very hot. Wifi charged at 12$ per day , no wonder the local Starbucks and Lincoln Centre cafe were always busy. Even the in-room tea and coffee were charged for!;2
The location was good but the rooms were very noisy - between room HVAC and street noise with less than sound proof windows. The front desk were slow on check in and check out and very unhelpful when asked questions or help. The lobby bar is nice with fast and friendly waitstaff.The room funiture is tired and the beds only has a bottom sheet - no top sheet, just comforter. We found the bedding to be too warm given the second rate AC unit in the room;2

Just spent 8 nights in NYC. Checked into the Empire Hotel for its location and to be close to a Conference I was attending.   We booked a Queen room for our stay. When we got to the room we found there wasnât enough room around the bed to even open a large suitcase. We decided to upgrade to a larger room so we actually had some extra space to move. Cost an extra US$60 plus tax per night.   Upgraded Room was on the 2nd floor. It had no mini bar (not an issue for us) but also didnât have coffee making facilities. Rang down to reception to ask for a coffee machine to be told that they donât supply coffee making in the rooms below the 3rd floor. It was âhotel policyâ.  Effectively a room that ended up being nearly AUD $450/night didnât come with a kettle!   Door and household staff;2
"The rooms were nice, but I left a jacket in the closet and immediately reported it. It still ""has not been found."" When asked to level with me, the lost items manager opened up that it is likely not going to be recovered.  So, housekeeping might have some issues at the moment. Bummer.";2

Been putting this off...First trip to the States ever...booked a twin city trip through Ocean Florida/Holidays for a special anniversary...arrived at the Empire and were promptly placed into a 'courtyard' room on the second floor  directly overlooking the air con fans and building work...not good.   This room was so small we could not get our luggage in and it had no wardrobe....just a hole in the wall with a curtain across it and a tiny set of drawers. Ouch!  We decided this was not good enough for what we paid and certainly not 4 star with paper peeling off the walls and tacky shelves... and went to the desk to complain. They told us we would have to stay in that room as the firm that booked it (tritonrooms.com) always book the cheapest smallest rooms and we would have to pay;2
"A friend from work and I went to NYC for a get away. The booked the Woogo Tempo because it was close to the park and I like the Upper West Side.

Well presented foyer and warm welcome. The room is basic with just the minimal amenities I would describe the room as stuffy and uncomfortable with minimal amenities which require repair. There is access to NYC attractions- however I would not go back.;2
"stayed for one night with 3 teenagers.  staff was very nice and accommodating. they even kept our bags for us after we checked out. no parking at the hotel but they give directions to park about 1/2 block away.  rooms were very small.  private bathroom.  granddaughter went to flush toilet and the handle fell off.  maintenance was sent up immediately to fix it.  no coffee in the hotel but they do offer tea.  and there is a deli right across the street that had the best coffee for $1 a cup.  close to subway.  dirty area.  two parks across the street. we saw several large rats walking right down the sidewalk into the sewer system. you get what you pay for.  i probably would not stay here again;";2
It is tiny, but no rats. Good value, but expect a snooty attitude from the staff.  Just got hassled by the doorman as I entered the place, and was refused service earlier for something that was supposed to be included, for no good reason. Weird. Almost thinks its cooler than it is.  Can't open window for smell of pee.;2
It was clean with nice staff, big enough rooms and located in short distance to Times square and Central Park. But it was too mediocre. I expected more from a hotel in Manhattan near Broadway. You are charged for EVERYTHING Exactly. Even a very small bottle of water was $7.5 and placed in a hand distance to your bed! I think it is very cheap for a hotel to do such tricky things, although its price is not so different in comparison to better hotels.;2
I will start by saying that Brian at the front desk was SUPER accommodating and helpful. He helped find me a room when I had accidentally booked the wrong dates. He recommended a great dinner spot and was just generally awesome. The hotel on the other hand, was a different story. My room was quaint and cute and fulfilled my need but the rest of the hotel was dark and dirty and weird. My shower kept just randomly running at anytime. There was nothing to wipe any of the equipment down in the gym - no paper towels or spray. I let the very nice girl at the desk know and I told her the hand sanitizer was empty. She looked like she scribbled something down on a piece of paper but the next day it was still empty and no paper towels or spray. Iâm not a germaphobe but thatâs nasty. My;2

The bed wasn't comfortable and the AC is a wall unit in your room that is very loud and runs 24/7 and you don't have the option of turning it off. The room, at least the one I was in needed a lot of improving. I know The Empire is a cheap place to stay but there are better places in the neighborhood that are a lot more comfortable. Oh, and I got mosquito bites while drinking at the bar... so, my trip was a real bust.;2
Looks nice on the surface but the hotel is dated, housekeeping is questionable at best (donât take a black light to the bed) and room service doesnât answer the phone in the evening. Stay somewhere else.;2

Knowing that you get what you pay for, the rates and reviews donât tell the story. We chose this hotel because we literally planned to be out all day.  BUT, there were a few surprises you need to know. 1. The queen bed is up against the wall. No nightstand on either side. It is necessary to crawl in and out on that side. 2. TV is mounted on wall to the left of the bed and it does not turn toward the bed. 3. While there is a hairdryer, there is no outlet in the bathroom (next to mirror). The only outlet is in the room where no mirror exists. 4. No elevator. 5. Glass shower enclosure requires you to get in to turn on the shower. Itâs a bit scary as water can be too hot or too cold. On the bright side, staff is very friendly and helpful. So if you want a bargain, just reserve with;2
I booked my room and paid in full online, all fees included according to the contract, but was charged an additional resort fee.

Stayed in many 4* hotels and this is by far the worst, and the first time I have left a less than positive review. I will start by saying the location is great, right next to Penn station.  Reception staff were nice, however only dealt with them upon check in and check out.  Beds were comfortable and the room was generally clean.  Small, cramped and outdated rooms. Tiny bathroom. For the price and also the photos online - not worth it.  The walls were also so thin we could hear everything next door.   Waiting for the lifts took forever despite there being so many of them and there was always a queue. I hated the thought of returning to the hotel to use them.  Also, one night every single lift was filled with the smell of fish, and everyone was gagging. Still no idea what it was.;2

Just checked out today after two nights.  Had gone there about five years ago a couple of times and enjoyed it.  Now, forget about it!  Pros:  Rooftop area and lobby nice, good location, comfortable bed..  Cons:  Picture of pool is deceiving  Rooms are decorated horribly.  Towels are worn out.  Given one tiny bar of soap.  Toilet clogged, had to call maintenance.  Sink didn't hold water.  Shade wouldn't pull down or up.  No drawers to put clothes.  Armoire where you hang clothes had shelf so clothes couldn't hang properly. No room in bathroom for anything.   It has potential if someone would manage it and fix everything!!!  Would not go back.;2

location is good, onestep to the central park, near the metroway  and about 15 mins to the fifth avenue. there is also a supermarket nextdoor. but the room is too small. and the reservation system is very disappointing.;2
First off, all the basics were there - the bed was comfortable, we had plenty of hot water and the room was cleaned every day.  Free wifi also a bonus. However, this was not a great hotel.  If you are used to very basic hostel-type accommodation then this would be fine.  The hotel is very tired looking and the layout is strange.  The lifts didn't feel safe.  The bed itself wasn't 100% clean and the TV doesn't work.   If the place was given a thorough facelift then I am sure it would be fine.  Didn't affect our holiday which was great!;2

"Great lovation but an average hotel behind fancy decoration  We got two rooms just above air conditioner condensers which kept going like aircraft engines which kept breaking my sleep as I am very sensitive to noise. I tried to talk to reception about it but they were busy and the person who asked to help me told me rudly ""I am a concierge. Is there anything about concierge"" and walked off, instead of saying ""I am sorry this is not my area but my colleagues wil take care of you"". I come from the U. K.  We are used to kind talking but in the USA customers are not treated with kindness I found.  Also among about 100 hotels I stayed through out my life I have never came across rooms over air condition condensers or they were not this noisy. In America they do not seem to be caring";2
My Complaint: I booked two rooms at this hotel via Hotwire over a month before our trip ($108 per room, including taxes & fees). My husband and I were traveling with another couple and only planned to stay one night in Hollywood before heading south for a wedding. Our plane from Honolulu arrived at LAX about 6pm and we drove around the area exploring for awhile before checking into the hotel at 8pm. The front desk clerk informed me that he only showed a reservation for one room (and didnât care at all that I had a print-out of my confirmation with Hotwire showing two PREPAID rooms). He said they were sold out for the evening and the four of us could share one room or we could try the Travelodge down the street. He also said he didnât see our reservation as being prepaid. No;2

Front door staff and bar staff are the only high quality elements to this hotel. Don't be fooled by the plush lobby, the rooms are stuck in the 70s. Whilst the rooms are passable for the money you pay there seems to be a distinct lack of care shown to the rooms, dusting, general maintenance etc. There is no free wifi which in this day and age is pretty poor. The beds are extremely uncomfortable and the air con has no settings, it's either freezing or off.   The roof terrace is excellent as are the bar staff but don't think you'll be getting any swimming done.   I had asked reception staff 3 times prior to arrival to sort and upgrade out for me and my girlfriend for our room given I was proposing, sadly this never transpired.

"I travel to New York frequently and while I have my favorites, I like to check out different hotels. Having stayed in the super hip meatpacking district before (the Standard) I thought I'd try this place.  I like the ""Old New York"" vibe, i.e. the Bowery, so this looked like it would be cool.  First the pluses:  Even though it's not really in the meatpacking district, you're just a couple blocks walk so you might as well be.  The staff was very nice and really seemed to be trying hard, which had to be tough given what they have to work with.  The food at the cafe was also very good.  The rooms were generally very clean (save a few stray hairs in the shower).  Now on to the minuses:  Being more or less ON the West Side Highway, this is a very, very LOUD hotel.  Regardless of";2
This hotel was very clean and the staff were quite helpful.  When we initially checked we asked if they could give us a room that would be quiet, as my wife has trouble sleeping.  Well guess what they gave us a room that was facing a busy road, and all night we heard sirens going off, car alarms being set off by the noisy trucks that went by. The next morning we asked them to change the room but they offered us one that would have been even noisier.  So we suffered for five nights. The breakfast was excellent every morning and the rooms were cleaned up to par. The location was easily accessible to catch the metro. I would recommend this hotel if you can sleep through anything.;2
I read a lot of the reviews and they are all accurate but from different viewpoints.  The key is your expectations.    The hotel is clean, but for the first couple of days, I had bugs (not bed bugs)  -- my guess is that if the building has bugs, the cleanest room will have bugs too.  The room I stayed in was drab but clean -- meaning that the floor and counters were all wiped down.  That said, the paint was peeling and the walls clearly had not been painted in years and the carpet was very old.  On the other hand, I paid 60-70 a night which is two hundered dollars less than many hotels in the area.  The location is great.  It took me a couple of nights to get comfortable but I never once saw anything on the bed and the sheets were changed daily.  Recommendations: If you just;2
