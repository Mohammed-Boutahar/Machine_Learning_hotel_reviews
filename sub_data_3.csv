i have stayed at this hotel several times for business the rooms have always been spacious but ever since staying here first in 2006 the common areas have needed updating its outdated in general the hotel is situated up on the hill by universal studios and in terms of sites and restaurants is only accessible by foot to city walk that area in general is very touristy if you want to park a car and drive to see sites each day id say the hotel is very well located its a pretty quiet area if you have a highup room the view is also pretty good depending on the side you are on the rooms are large with big windows and the bathrooms are very spacious and mostly marble and stone the rooms are clean and wellmaintained although the bathroom sink was clogged;3
the good part about the hotel is it is on the park and they provide basic facilities clean bedding towels hot water for a low price the staff was very friendly and helpful that said the room was too small for two people we did not have any place to move around after putting our luggage the carpet seemed like it had not been cleaned for quite some time dont try to put anything in the cupboard it may come off given that we were out most of the day it did not bother us much and it was good enough to get some good sleep its not for experience the deli down the road is good with very friendly staff;3
the location is pretty good with a subway line not far away at columbus circle and central park is a very short walk julliard and lincoln center are very close lincoln is just across the street the view from the room was up broadway and columbus and from the higher floors quite nice the bathroom was incredibly small the showers dont have doors which means a very wet floor the room was also small but thats not unexpected in nyc the bed was comfortable wifi was fairly expensive better to find local cell service if you can;3
front desk staff were friendly and helpful the guy who checked me in didnt give me the wifi code included in our corp rate room was fine good view tv too small for the distance its away from the bed bathroom was large shower was a bit weak elevators were slow at times but not really too much of a hassle as i said didnt get wifi password and the phone didnt work when i got my room was fixed promptly when i brought it to their attention silly to have a text sent asking about your stay when you get different information from the desk not going into it but it was evident whoever read my text didnt understand it at a hilton their should be certain things included such as wifi eight bucks a day parking 2000 a day corp rate continental breakfast;3
im sorry but i would not recommend staying here rooms are okaynothing too glamorous staff was nice self park is my biggest pet peve you can either valetwhich is expensive but it is the customers choice or self parkwhich costs 20 a day if youre a hotel guest this should be a free amenity as a hotel guest they do it at vegas resorts why not here the answer because its lahollywood nothing is freewhich is really sad when youre paying those rates a night just because it has the name hilton attached to it also the elevators need to be have maintenance work done to them youll stand sometimes up to 56 mins waiting around for one and you have to walk a ways from the hotel lobby to the garage elevators which also need to have maintenance work done to;3
i read some really horrible reviews about this hotel prior to my trip but i chose to brave the negative comments and stay there anyway i knew going into it that i wasnt staying at the sheraton or omni so my expectations were not very high the hotel is under renovations at present so things look really shabby i have to admit the elevators terrified me but i got through it ok the room was actually decent and comfortable the lobby and corridors were nothing to look at but once we got to our room we were ok i work in the hotel industry and am very critical of pretty much everything but i lower my standards when i choose to stay at a cheaper place the sheets were clean and so was the bathroom the carpet needed replaced but still wasnt completely horrible and;3
the janes location can not be beat the front staff is friendly and helpful there is lots of character in both the guests and the hotel a trendy club is in the same building along with a french style cafe the rooms were to be expected all i was looking for was a rack to crash on and a shower to freshen up the room i had did have an interesting smell this was fixed by opening the window yes it was winter time but i did not know how to control the heat so it all worked out well overall if you are looking for a cheap place to crash in a trendy area this cannot be beat points off for the smell and that this is not a place for luxury;3
hey people woogo central park is an apartment building not a hotelwhy do people out there think why will get hotel like service from an apartment buildingthats the reason why this place is cheaper than a hotelyou get a doorman very helpfull guys and reception desk in the foyer and thats it the apartment i had was very small but clean and functional and everything worked so i was happy with it all its basic in all aspects but i just needed a bed and shower and it delivered its 1 block from the 72 st subway station and plenty of eating options close bywould happily stay againcheers all;3
my suite had a musty smell to it the throw pillows on the bed and sofa sleeper stinks tried to take a picture of the city from my room but the windows were filthy the room needed a lot of dusting i had to buy air freshner the size of my suite was awesome and my bellman eugene was great;3
good location we had an event at msg staff was helpful and did a nice job the rooms are small but everything was clean was nice there is a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel i would recommend this hotel for a midtown stay;3
our room was directly next to the elevatorswhich we heard day and night others talked of hearing the sirens of emergency vehicles day and night on 20th floor and above as well as lower;3
stayed here over the weekend and while i stayed here over 20 years ago as well the hotel is showing its age still decent hotel but will need remodeling soon hotel is very convenient to penn station and thatâs good if flying from newark and taking train into the city;3
we stayed here for three nights while my kids went to summer camp nearby upon checkin we were told we had been upgraded to a larger suite so we were really happy however that was probably the last happy thing about the hotel pros 1 room is very large by nyc standards we had two double beds a sitting area and ample space to store stuff 2 bathroom spacious 3 lobby area very nice 4 housekeeping staff and doormen accommodating and helpful 5 location is just great 6 reasonable price cons 1 room smells like pee when you just get in later nasal fatigue sets in and you dont notice it 2 worst problem for us door stopped working at first i thought it was a key card problem so i stopped by the front desk to get a new one went upstairs didnt work went;3
loved the location great restaurants and lincoln center across the street hopefully you arent planning on spending much time in your roomsmall good service cool lobby nice doormen everything in the room costs including the coffee but epicerie boulud is across the street and has excellent coffee and french pastries;3
the location of the hotel is great opposite msgpenn st station and just a few minutes from times square and the empire state it is a perfect base to explore new york from basic rooms are small for a family and you may or may not be lucky with the view our first room had no view but the second room on a corner had great views the hotel is a bit worn but the rooms are clean and the showers were excellent there are plenty of places to eat nearby we used the skyline diner just 5 minutes away 3 times whilst we were there probably only real criticism is the checkin process the queues were long and disorganised i think it was as stressful for the staff as it was for the guests oh and beware you will be stung for 20 per night for wifi and phone calls even if;3
rooms are small but i guess you wont be in them long the bathrooms are pretty good and plenty of shower gel etc and hairdryers staff are nice i would say it is still pretty expensive given that the rooms are tiny location is excellent close to gay scene hudson for running highline whitney in fact you can walk anywhere lots of good eating options near by;3
my wife and i went to the hotel for and over night trip the heater didnt work in the room and they had to bring in a portable one i requested a king seize bed and was put in a room with two full seize bed;3
from the outside this hotel looks amazing the lobby is quite beautiful and designed in a distinct art deco style reminiscent of the 1920s the location of the hotel is ideal for anyone visiting the city it is literally right next to the empire state building and penn station subway which grants you access to all of manhattan however it should be noted that the rooms are very basic our double room was quite small and despite being 32 floors up the distinct sounds of sirens and traffic horns could still be heard the air conditioning was effective but loud during the night which if a light sleeper could be irritating security staff beside the lifts also lacked good customer service always asking quite abruptly to see our room key to prove we were staying at the;3
no hot water from shower old furnishings indifferent staff not worth the high room rate the room elevators looked like they would break down any moment the location to universal studios and local businesses is good but otherwise try to avoid;3
abercorn house is conveniently located within the city center of london it is proximal to the hammersmith and city london undergound line as well as the circle line from the stations the place is about a mere 35 minute walk away there isnât much to be seen in that area by comparison to soho or lambeth but there are still some decent bars pubs and restaurants within the vicinity the accommodation does not come with free wifi and one would need to pay a couple of sterling or something to avail of the service the room we stayed in is a double bedroom with no bathroom inside however there are bathrooms that are gender specific which i would gladly say are clean and well kept i advise travelers to checkin in spite of being at the latter part of the city center;3
the location is very good its walking distance to universal studios and city walk wide selection of restaurants and located right off the 101 the hotel is fairly updated the beds are very comfortable and have high quality high thread count and crisp sheets the bathroom is modern and clean on the negative side and the reason i rated this hotel as only average is that the room could use a good dusting and the carpets were quite dirty its actually quite surprising that the management does not hire a firm to come in and steam clean them seems like a simple fix to greatly improve the guest experience;3
this place is greatly located near times square but i think that means it attracts a certain group of people the very touristy bunch or maybe first timers to new york the internet here is not very stable therefore frustrating for business travellers the downside to me is the location because of its nature it is too hectic therefore attracting random crowd you dont get to experience good restaurants or quirky cafes of new york around the hotel area just a couple of international food chain restaurants which you dont need to come all the way for stay somewhere else if you have the choice nyc is too fun to be stuck at this place;3
first off i really want to give this hotel 5 stars because the staff was very friendly and helpful but our room was not the cleanest it wasnât horrible but there was a huge curl of hair left on the carpet i donât just mean one hair i mean someone cut a whole section of a curl off their head and left it on the floor maybe they had a hair cut in the hotel room apparently the cleaning service didnât notice and left it on the floor it made me gag our bathroom didnât have working vents which is a huge pet peeve of mine it just takes forever for the steam to leave the bathroom they bedding was very nice and comfortable but the mattress itself wasnât super comfortable other then that i will say the staff was great the pool was wonderful and the location to universal;3
my husband daughter and i spent one night here for a concert at the hollywood bowl we got a great rate on the room and after staying there i can see why when my daughter went to take a bath towel out of the rack the rack came out of the wall the headboards in the room were at least queen size but we had doublesized beds not very comfortable for three people as a wheelchair user the carpeting in the lobby and hallways outside the room made it difficult to wheel around also the hallways themselves were on the dark side with odd jogs and turns and i didnt like that either the employees were all very nice but i dont want to stay here again;3
we stayed here for 3 nights in august 2009 the hotel is not in the best part of hollywood but we were close to hollywood sign the walk of fame paramount studios and universal studios we went to a super restaurant called dresdens the writeup given by the hotel was awful but the restaurant was brilliant our room was clean the air conditioning worked and wi fi was free as was tea and coffee the breakfast was adequate was do you expect for free the view from the room was dreadful but who cares we were out all day and most of the evening the worst bit of this hotel is the appaling reception staff they are totally uninterested in you and of no help whatsoever if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel for a few nights close to many of the;3
hotel is nice and clean in a perfect location restaurant is very good i specifically asked for a quiet room for the marathon it is horribly loud i phoned to ask why so loud and front desk was quite rude weâve not gotten much sleep since weâve been here because of the very loud noise if youâre a light sleeper be aware the first morning we all had a cold shower due to no hot water second night there was bad wifi and spent a long time getting it to work with the third parties help again front desk was not friendly we are still here and i would go talk to them about the troubles but the last two times on the phone they were too rude and they tried to put me to a manager that never did phone me back or answer again itâs a nice room with comfy beds but with the rude;3
we had a good stay overall but were disappointed with the size of the room which was quite small and the bed which had a sag in the middle the real kicker was the large roach we found in the shower on our last day definitely disappointing i informed the front desk as we checked out and was told they would have the room treated;3
its a hilton its nice but its outrageous not to provide at least basic free wifi in the rooms we paid 2500 dollars for 2 rooms 4 nights i think that entities us to free wifi great views over universal studios;3
i had a few days of business very close to times square and ended up booking the new yorker simply as it was cheaper than other options on paper this hotel is really cool its a landmark building with significant history it has impressive architecture and its super central location is perfect for tourists visiting nyc for the first time however for me as someone whos already sick and tired of new york coming on business and wanting to get out as soon as possible this wasnt ideal though im not sure any other hotels in this area would be the good cool historical landmark building pleasant staff that stays patient despite pretty tough working conditions rooms are clean and reasonably well kept and of acceptable size for new york wifi was ok location ideal for;3
we picked the empire because of its location and we anticipated after long days out seeing the sites we would relax with a drink on the roof top bar the weather was great but the roof top bar wasnt open for our entire stay really disappointing;3
stayed at the newyorker for four nights we enjoyed the spectacular view frm our room the hotel also provided us with comfortable beds the hotel was also centrally located with convenience stores cafes and retail shops close by the newyorker also has a comprehensive gym in the basement which is a big plus service was good the reception desk and security people were friendly however the hotel is quite old the furnitures and bathrooms were not not up to a four star standards;3
overall the service room restaurants and location were great i only give the hotel an average rating due to the beds my wife and i received a room with 2 twin beds no problem the problem was that not one but both beds had mattresses that were totally broken down making sleeping uncomfortable both mattresses seems to have a metal band going around the perimeter but as soon as you sat on the bed you almost sunk to the floor fortunately we only stayed 2 nights but those were some long nights not what i normally expect from a wyndam propertythe rooms are also small but we did not spend too much time in the room so that did not matter to us;3
first the posotives this is a beautiful hotel within walking distance to universal studios our room was very nice clean and had a nice view we stayed on the executive floor and i have no idea why we paid extra for this the first night we had a small plate left in our room with a couple of pieces of small fruit and a chocolate otherwise there didnt seem to be any amenity associated with our room check in was a nightmare we waited at least 30 minutes in line to check in and then it took the staff 20 minutes to handle the check in process the associate was nice but just seemed to make the process much harder and longer than necessary this was happening to everyone hence the 30 minute wait our reservations had been made in advance and reconfirmed the previous;3
i expected a lot from this hotel because this was the hotel in the gossip girl serie when we arrived i was very impressed by the reception good service and the lobby look and feel but when we arrived in our room we found out that it was very small it is a perfect place if you only come here to sleep it is not really a room where you stay a little bit longer in order to relax although the room was small the room and the bathroom are clean the hotel is a rowdy hotel so if you are looking for a quiet hotel i dont recommend this hotel positive thing about this hotel is the location this hotel is perfectly located you reach central park within 5 minutes and time square in approx 10 minutes disadvantages of this hotel is the wifi it is quite expensive approx 70;3
im handling this review gingerly because i knew what i was signing up for a place to sleep i was pleasantly surprised this room did its job the exterior is a bit intimidating but once inside this place is fine i booked just a single twin my room was clean warm and in satisfactory condition the shower was hot with thick quality towels the tv had plenty of channels and there was an ipod speaker nice only thing i could have used was a full body mirror but the room was small and cozy enough for me to get some shut eye a fair warning this is right by penn station and this room is not sound proofsuper busy so you will hear taxisangry drivers outside but after while i acclimated to the sounds hey its new york and the value was reasonable at least;3
a quiet decent hotel nestled in a semi commercial area the hotel though a bit old and obviously needing some updating gives good value especially for those who are visiting new york for the first time within a few dozen meters one can get into the fabled new york subway system surrounding the place between what looked like apartment blocks are stores coffee shops and eating places showing various cuisines beware of the fruit stand and grocer across broadway barzinis totally pwd unfriendly strolling on either side of broadway could get you to central park or to hudson river park it did not make claims as a luxurious place but the service for the kind of price paid was really good nice friendly staff willing to help in several small ways dispensing advice;3
when reading the other reviews i was very worried about staying at the hotel however much to my delight the majority of the bad reviews turned out to be wrong the rooms are spacious and clean as well as the bathroom the shower did take a while to heat up i tended to be the first one in though our tv worked the basic news channels however other people in our groups didnt we however never watched it and if youre going to new york to watch tv you should reevaluate why you are there the rooms were really cosy and warm and never felt cold once the beds were changed daily and wifi worked well in the lobby we were on floor 9 and had trouble getting wifi on the first night however for the rest of our duration it worked fine in our room overall the hotel accommodated;3
ive learned not to expect a lot from nyc hotels unless i want to spend a fortune my husband and i were going to a concert at the beacon and needed a room to accommodate 4 on the upper west side that didnt cost a fortune this fit the bill the staff was courteous and helpful and the place was relatively clean it could use an update and a better tv but then theyd charge more also it was the slowest elevator ever otherwise ok;3
first of all i think it is a very dark place not enough light too dark for me i will never go backthe air condition did not work the first night and the second night we were evacuated because there was a power outraged they took a long time tomlet people know about it hotel was not well prepared for this not emergency lights in the exit stairs simply crazy the room size was ok but bathroom horrible it was tiny no it is very expensive for what it isventilation it was like a sauna;3
manhattan west is a frillfree hotel on the corner of eighth avenue and west 3oth in midtown west about two blocks from penn station and madison square garden the room was rather small with a hardwood floor and a comy bed no room service or coffee even but the price makes it worthwhile you can step outside and get anything anyway the tv offers little in the way of entertainment unless you speak spanish or enjoy some obscure stations grit tv metv the bathroom was small but provided the usual toiletries the shower was a tiled phone booth without a place to hold the soap be warned still a pleasant place in a great midtown location;3
decent hilton nothing over the top special but super close to universal studios if thats your plan had two great nights here hotel is a traditional 90s feeling hilton thats been well updated had a very nice room with view on ninth floor fitness center was a bit strange good precor equipment spread over two rooms with an absolutely ridiculously horrible view out the back of the hotel not appealing restaurant was decent bar has reasonable selection of corporate craft beers nothing creative wonderful yogurt with fresh fruit for just 8 that was offset with the most expensive cup of tea 7 ive ever encountered really bad form decent stay very friendly staff;3
i stayed here with two friends last week for a long weekend in new york the hotel is a great location on the upper west side very near to 96th street station a 1 2 3 subway line which takes you straight into midtown downtown and beyond quickly and easily the hotel itself was pretty dated and not the cleanest it also smelt quite strongly of smoke in our hallway and the lift the room was a good size bed was huge however the heatingair con system was noisy as was the street outside bring earplugs and youll be fine though the staff were friendly and helpful theres free wifi and the corner cafe across the road does a good range of breakfast things as well all in all it is a good hotel if youre not going to be spending much time in the room just sleeping;3
this hotel was recommended by the travel agent as a four star hotel which it isnt ð you have to pay for everything in the room eg coffee pods tea bags etc there is a well stocked minibar but prices are expensive buy your own snacks and drinks the first room we were allocated was on the tenth floor the air conditioning was very loud the shower not working properly and the wallpaper was coming away at the joins we asked to change rooms the staff were very good and showed me two rooms on the first floor i chose one room and we moved our belongings we then found that there was no safe and the air conditioning was not working as we were very tired we reported this to reception the next morning and went out for the day on our return the jobs had been done;3
we took a trip with our two little ones ages 5 and 7 to see the sights wanted to make things as simple as possible so we stayed at wyndham due to its proximity to penn station long story short we were sent to our room which was on floor 18 the door wouldnt open with either room key went back down and a rude front desk woman said my cell phone must have been too close to it we knew otherwise because the door seemed brokenloose we were sent back up again carrying all of our bags and our tired kids wouldnt open again everyone was tired of walking but went back down and was told to go security security told us to go back up and wait for someone to help we went back up exhausted carrying all of our bags still and sat on the floor and waited nobody came the;3
this hotel is a very historical property going back to 1919 the lobby has been updated and theyve done a good job to make it friendly and presentable however once you go into the ballroom or event rooms or even the elevators you realize that this is a real estate fixer upper carpets are old rooms smell musty molding and wallpapers look worn and dated wyndham should invest in this gem shame they are letting it fall apart its only redeeming quality is that it is a block away from madison square garden dont eat the food absolutely disgisting;3
hotel location was great for access to lincoln center the bathroom situation caused considerable distress particularly the failure to correct a major defect with the shower until the the very last day despite numerous notices overall the service was very good and we only wish that our experience had been betteer;3
it was my 4th stay at the jane and this might be the last unfortunately the level of service seems to have declined i was particularly disappointed by the rude attitude of one of the concierge reception desk clerk a young bearded man who never made eye contact while speaking to us never answered our hello never said thank you while we were giving him our key nor wished us a pleasant stay or a good day i hope this is not his standard behavior otherwise i suggest that he starts looking for a new job in a different kind of industry than service iâd like to add that the room was awfully warm again we had to open the window put the airco on cold mode in february to reach a bearable room temperature this seemed to us very unecological in these days of;3
perfect location if you want to be in the centre of manhatten and close to 5th avenueshopping and times square short distance to central park and close to subway which leads you up to harlemqueens or down to lower manhatten;3
the fact that this hotel markets itself as being near universal studios is a bit dubious la is a massive place where nothing seems to be close to anything else but i wouldnt count a 30 minute metro ride as close unless you have a car or are prepared to pay for taxis everywhere the first thing to do when you arrive here is to go to the santa monica metro station 3 minute walk and get a metro pass for the length of your stay this is the only affordable way to get from the hotel to anywhere interesting do not try to walk the hotel itself is clean friendly and attractive but its in an area that feels very dodgy at night we only ventured out for dinner once if i were to return to la i would pay more to stay somewhere closer to the action;3
i thought if charlie watts stayed here the hotel would be really cool but it was a bit disappointing maybe you have to be in the penthouse suite but our room was very small with absolutely no outlook we were meant to have frette linen but it was nothing like frette i have had in other hotels the bed was comfortable and free wifi in the lobby was good loved the terrace rooftop bar but didnt like how they took an extra 500 off my credit card to cover what they thought our expenditure would be over 3 days without telling us also out of 4 lifts i think only two were ever working and there was always a queue great restaurants nearby loved brunch at the chowder house and bar boulud for dinner;3
the stay was reasonable location was very good with good transport links and dining options available nearby the wardrobe space was limited with inadequate hanging length for clothing lot of noise in the room from air conditioning plant and particularly from adjacent room tv;3
stayed here for four nights on holiday with my husband first the good points room was pretty spacious and well equipped nice toiletries plenty of towels fridge microwave although this needed a clean starbucks coffee for machine complimentary breakfast with freshly made eggs omelettes scrambled fried etc and also waffles made to order wide range of bread for toast bagels and muffins fruits potatoes and sausages cheese ham preserves etc and coffee staff were pretty friendly and helpful good location near metro and the area overall was pretty decent now the bad husband accumulated over 60 insect bites by the pool one afternoon no advice on check in or warnings or the mosquito epidemic which they were aware of also no pre preventative measures taken;3
we stayed here and found it very convenient and nicely appointed the second time we requested a room by the courtyard on the second floor when we checked in she said that there were rooms around the courtyard but we couldnt have one so we asked for a room by the pool meaning in the back away from the traffic noisewhen we got to our room we were dead in front with an air conditioner pointed at the bed hence i left sick the closet is in the bathroom the one good thing i can say about it is the breakfast is good we wont be back by the way the desk clerk gave us 5100 on our way out and when we landed at home they called and wanted their money back stupidest thing i ever heard i was in the hotel business 25 years this was tragic;3
my stay at the hotel went well the staff at the hotel were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure things went well the hotel is really busy with guest from all over the world my room was really small but cozy the one con i experienced was that the chair in the room seem to have the worst smell i ever smelled in my life the rooms could use a little more cleaning overall my stay was quick and went well best lew;3
the jane is not the worst place to be you have to be aware that the room is very small barely twice the sice of a small bed and if it gets hot its pretty sultry personal was okay but my room didnt get a care over the day i left 11 oclock and came back in the night unfotunatelly there were construction under way so it was very loud in the morning locations is gread i had a view on the statue of liberty not very good but i had and you are in the middle of everything next time i will book a bigger room pay more and hope for some luck;3
this hotel was very clean and located in a nice area however we did experience a lot of issues with our rooms climate control and that was a bit of a problem i will say the front desk sent someone to repair it every time but 7 times in a two night stay is a bit upsetting i would recommend it otherwise but im not sure i would stay again unless i was assured the problems with the circuit breaker had been repaired;3
my baggage did not make it so i was left with no clothes or toiletries hotel did not have even the little basic disposable emergency toothbrush for guests cannot use electronics in your room as wifi is free only on the lobby breakfast costs 18 and really is a poor attempt at a;3
this hotel is perfectly placed for a visit to universal studios unfortunately other than that it is a pretty standard hilton the shuttle to universal is a bit hit and miss we had booked the vip tour which meant we had to be at the park gates by 915 and were told that the first shuttle came to the hotel between 9 and 920 so our best bet was to walk not a problem for us but if you had a buggy or any mobility problems it is an uphill walk with a flyover to cross the road which was just steps you couldnt do it another issue was that we had planned on eating at city walk in the evening but it closed at 8pm we didnt leave the park till closing at 6 and by the time we had got back to the hotel and showered it was closed you are not close to anything else here so it;3
the good nice clean room huge bed with lots of pillows free shuttle to universal mini fridge in the room pool view helpfull staff the bad the hotel does not have free wifi only avaliable to hilton honour guests if they booked directly at hotel website extremly bad soundproofing in the doors woke up each time someone walked past my door breakfast not included in price and very expensive i know la is expensive but for 250 a night i expect a lot more;3
location is all empire has going for it the rooms are very small bathroom very basic and cramped and acs are super loud defitnitely not great value for money the rooftop has a very cool view though;3
i was really looking forward to finishing my trip to the us with a stay at this hotel in new york city but it is fair to say that i was more than a little bit disappointed first the positives the lobby on arrival does look impressive the lobby bar at night is lively and has a good atmosphere the checkin was relatively straightforward although our room wasnt ready we were a bit early so not a criticism the pool bar at the top of the hotel is decent but lacks that touch of luxury youd expect in a 5 location is decent close to restaurants shops subway etc the downside the room a double superior was on the small side the bathroom is tiny the hot tap rarely got hot which meant shaving with cold or at best lukewarm water the room is also very noisy;3
the hotel is ideally placed for exploring manhattan and the other boroughs as the columbus circle subway station is a 3 minute walk away the hotel would benefit from a serious upgrade as it is looking a little tiredthe room i had 221 was ok but who ever designed the bathroom should be sent for retraining the shower was in the wrong place and the designer wash basin was no use at allthe staff on the front desk were excellent;3
hotel was ok apparently it had recently renovated so my expectations were high but they were wrong the lifts were scary at best the hallways stank like mold the rooms were so hot that the air con was a must but it was so loud you couldnt sleep with it on the good part it was close to the subway;3
dont be fooled by the massive pool that is shown in the hotels website they some crafty angle shots it is at max 7 feet across we watched about 20 people or so come up to the pool only to laugh at the ridiculous size and walk away in addition to it being tiny you have to walk 3 flights of stairs to get to the deck and rooftop area no elevator that is only for staff the rooms are also very small as well which tends to be the way it is for hotels in manhattan the bathroom door is also made of glass so if you are traveling with a friend or associate dont expect any privacy all that being said we thought the room was reasonably priced for the area and the blackout curtains really worked well;3
pros 1 the location is perfect only a block away from central park short walk to the main sights of the city but still in a quite area so youre away from the commotion of the city 2 the staff is wonderful the doormen and concierge are very helpful polite and friendly the front desk staff was friendly and very accommodating the staff at the pool lounge were awesome the cleaning staff always friendly when passing them in the hallways 3 even though they dont offer parking on premises they do have a parking arrangement with icon parking on 64thbroadway you get your parking ticket validated while checking out and present it to the parking attendant at icon the only downside is you must pay by card only no cash accepted 4 the rooms are very out of date but;3
the rooms are small itâs functional ok for touring ny but not somewhere youâd want to stay beyond sleeping and not to relax or chill given where it is the is fair the staff are genuinely friendly and helpful which is a real saving grace itâs a bit worn out and knackered but it suffices certainly clean enough depends how fussy you are;3
friendly service great location but very noisy to sleep the rooms are okay there are great restaurants in the area and its right across the street from lincoln center i would recommend this hotel for location amenities in the hotel and service;3
the hotel is in a great location just by central park and the lincoln centre unfortunately our room was a little bit disappointing the bathroom door looked like it had been quite badly damaged the blind didnât work my husband eventually fixed it and the ac was so noisy it stopped us sleeping well at all we didnât really use the roof terrace but the breakfast was good we had a small coffee machine in the room which was really appreciated;3
this hotel is in a brilliant location itâs close to everything however itâs very dated the rooms are tiny we stayed 3 people in one room it had two queen size beds and we couldnât even fit to open one suitcase on the floor the diner is very pricey there are better cheaper and tastier options just outside the door;3
im going to start with the good points this hotel is in a excellent location its next to universal 5 minutes from metro to key links such as hollywood one stop away and santa monica the grounds surrounding areas is lovely and the pool is nice the rooms are nice not too fancy a little old but nice and clean the doorman tim was excellent at conducting the exterior of the hotel but this is as a little as it goes we stayed here for 1 week and then came back again for 4 nights the first week we had a good impression of the place elevators were little slow but if you read reviews you would know they are going a under a renovation so suck it up after arriving back at the hotel for our second stay we were told that wifi was free and given a code we were not told this the;3
its ok but not much inhouse facilities on both nights stay the bar was shut as the barman failed to turn up for work so reception suggested that we go over to the liquor store across the road to get some drinks not on your nelly it was a bit of a rough area anyway the location was good for travelling to the la sights and the taxis were cheap the hotel could do with a lick of paint though but our car was properly secured in their car park;3
very nice hotel in the heart of manhattanthe rooms are a bit small and old but are kind of warm there are locations from where the view is great though our room looked in the side of the street the breakfast that served at the place at the lobby was really awful the overall experience was good but eat breakfast somewhere else;3
just back from 4 days at the new yorker hotelcheck in was great no probs lady at desk was great quick helpfulroom was on 36th floor with some great views over new york 6 lifts only 2 workingbeing updated soonwitch resulted in queueing long waits especially morning timeso allow more time the room was very small but adequate for time were there the bed was very comfortable clean tidy with good house keeping every day we only slept washed as out all day night we used tic tock dinner for breakfast as it was convenient but tasty with a typical new york menu or what ever you wanted coffee refillsthe hotel is old dated in need of renovation but dont let that put you off the location is wonderful if youre visiting new york city with all big attractions;3
well when we walked into reception it is beautiful looking everyone well nearly were friendly we got called to a separate desk to check in he said it was too early we knew this anyway but wanted to leave our cases to wander didnt get the mans name but he was quite rude i said have we got a view im excited about this holiday he said well obviously not because you didnt pay for one i was tired couldnt be bothered to argue came back to reception later forgot the ladys name but she was lovely she said she had given us a nice room on the 8th floor i sound ungrateful but i would of liked a high floor view of empire state but through a very dirty window slightly disappointed didnt want to feel like this on my special birthday unpacked very comfy bed and;3
stayed with my family for one week in feb 16 location is everything for this place check in smooth and lowered the 27 dollar hotel fee to 15 dollars 4 adults staying in the smallest room possible after being told at check in we had a spacious room with excellent views mmmm tic to diner is good value but there is a mcdonalds and starbucks literally across the road we walked everywhere form this hotel and although the room was dated and cramped you only need the room to rest your head after a busy day sight seeing location made it worth it;3
although the hotel is in a good location downtown for site seeing we arrived at the hotel at 1200pm and our room was not ready until 600 the reception desk kept us waiting forever we had lunch at the tick tock cafe and waited and waited and waited no one at the desk seemed to know when it would be ready so we went for a walk up to central park to get some frustration out although they told me that they would inform us when the room would be ready no one had the courtesy to even bother and inform us after i personally called they told us that we could go back and go to out room i find their attitude completely unacceptable and if i hadnt prepayed the room in advance i would have left in an instance i was so frustrated at the way they blew me off that i made a;3
couldnt believe we found a hotel at this price the room was clean and had the necessary supplies if you want a marriott experience go to the marriott this wont be for you for the money this was a bargain i look forward to returning when we visit again;3
check in went pretty smooth the rooms are a bit dated the location is kinda run downthe only good thing about the location is the metro station did not feel safe walking around the neighbour hood at night the breakfast was good but they ran out of fruit easily for why you pay it is worth it;3
lots of noise and a very small room dont expect much sleep you hear everything from water running to toilets flushing;3
i made my reservation 2 connecting rooms and a dog nice rooms great location right next to universal studios five stars for the hotel so then i signed up for the hhonors program and was frustrated over and over again the wifi is only free if you sign up for the hhonors program and you remember write down your hhonors member number they make you enter captchas constantly which didnt work ultimately had to call the help desk to link my reservation to my hhonors account i still cant login online but the iphone app is a slightly better experience than on the web i stayed this weekend and app says i have zero stays logged so far technically speaking they have no clue how to manage their online experience zero stars for the online experience waste of time;3
i really enjoy staying here and have done a few times when on a quick trip they have cute clean and affordable rooms and the bar and restaurant are very cool and hip its pretty basic but for what you pay i think its a great place check out the history of the building its very cool;3
we were four friends staying in a room on 10th floor rooms were very comfortable bathroom was clean overall stay was good but somehow wifi dint work in our room when asked they said it will be fixed we stayed there 2 nights 3 days but condition was same;3
the empire has a cool lobby vibe too bad not so much in the room we got a great 205night rate on bookitcom so cant complain too much for the super cheap price given the upper westside lincoln center locale very clean albeit worn the ac went off 3 times in 2 nights along with one bedside lamp the lighting in the room and bath are dismal no desk as its full of crap for sale the sink is a mess as the water pressure is too high the counter for stuff like a tooth brush and paste none many reviews complained about the shower but we found it great with the high water pressure and plenty hot 3 for one keurig k cupreally 8 for a small bottle of water really the staff was kind and responsive see ac above but never got the inroom safe working if;3
had been to the rooftop bar before but this was my first stay overnight the location is accessible to trains and close to upper west side attractions as well as central park and lincoln center check in was easy and i was upgraded to a street view could hear the refuse collection in the early am but otherwise i had no complaints the room was clean and adequate sized there were no glasses in the room just the hotel branded paper cups and a keurig machine with a 3 charge per kcup;3
the staff were great the room was tiny with a small window with an air conditioner in it making it feel like no windows at all and the blind was in bad shape clean bedding and good bathroom no clock or any other amenities except a flat screen tv not a room i would want to stay for more than one night kind of depressing safe neighborhood close to subway easy ride to times square and downtown;3
the location is about the only thing positive i can say about this hotel it is literally a block from universal studio and you can get there faster walking than waiting for the shuttle the hotel opened in the 1980s and obviously has not been renovated the elevators are the slowest we have ever seen in a hotel there are five of them and not all are in commission at any given time meaning you have to wait a good 510 minutes regularly housekeeping does a very poor job with room cleaning the towels are of very poor quality and look as original as the decor the reception desk has a basket of free fruit for the guests the one my daughter got was rotten to the core;3
all was going well until there was no hot water for the whole hotel for a night and the following day rooms are clean and tidy luckily the builders werent working on the scaffolding outside the windows or we would have had them peering in the window in the morning and making a racket come on premier no hot water not great is it;3
i was staying here with a friend while sightseeing in new york i was a bit concerned at first as it seemed quite a budget hotel and there doesnt seem to be a website we were told check want until 3pm when we arrived at 2pm having been awake and travelling for nearly 16 hours we couldnt get a twin room as a twobed room must be specifically booked the lift was tiny and extremely slow the room was basic and small and there isnt any breakfast however when i told reception that as friends wed prefer separate beds they did change us to a kingbed room which must have been a super king as the bed was massive and comfortable the room was clean with aircon noisy but definitely worth having the private bathroon had a shower that was powerful and hot the room was;3
the room was extremely small even though it was a standard queen and not a standard one double which is even smaller in order to go to the restroom the space between the bed and the wall was about 50 cm additionally in the room there was space only for one suitcase the second had to be placed above the first and each time we needed to take sth out we had to put the one of the top down on the floor no need to say that the closet was tiny and there was space only for a few items the breakfast which is not included as it is usual in europe was continental served in plastic dishes and cups and costed 12person fortunately just across the street we found pret a manger where we had delicious organic breakfast half the price of the hotel in order to have wifi in the;3
positives fantastic location the shower pressure is amazing considering we were on the 25th floor not a long wait for lifts hand gelsanitiser at each floor they even have a museum memorabilia collection in the basement for famous moments from the hotels history but it is not really advertised negatives definitely feels like a hasbeen hotel we stayed in the room next to the one where muhammad ali stayed which was a pleasant surprise but otherwise the hotel has definitely had its hayday the place is in need of a complete renovation new paint carpet etc whats more we stayed during storm henri and had water dripping from the cellingwall see pictures told the front desk and they said someone would come and have a look 10 minutes later front desk called;3
the day we checked in the one of our party put a bottle of water on the reception counter whilst getting out her passport the girl behind the counter waved her hand in a gesture to remove the bottle no words spoken just a swiping hand gesture i found this extremely rude the same girl was totally unapproachable during our stay to a point where if she was on reception we would avoid going until someone else was there i have to point our here that the majority of reception staff were very pleasant and helpful the hotel itself is in a good location although it is very expensive to use their services which i guess is a nyc thing i personally would not return here simply due the fact that one member of the reception team is letting the whole hotel down with her bad;3
we were very pleased with the staff at this hotel but for the three nights we were there we could never get the thermostat to work correctly it was always too cold like the heater didnt work at night woke up freezing every morning when we first entered the room one of the light bulbs was burnt out and staff replaced it shortly after we reported it it is a typically small nyc hotel room with charming dã©cor comfortable beds you can see how historic the building is by the marble trim old doors showers etc;3
i have stayed at the empire hotel three times now and have always had a great experience the staff is always helpful and try to accommodate all of my needs i have celebrated several special occasions here and they always go above and beyond and have upgraded my room as well as left champagne for us i would definitely stay here again;3
recently stayed with family staff was professional and accommodating decor is a bit worn and dated the lobby was pleasant but the hallways were claustrophobic with a slap in your face of 70s funk location is very good close to central park subway and a hop skip and a jump from the lincoln center for the performance arts;3
i usually stay at the empire for business and convenient location not for the gossip girl appeal the amount of people in the lobby is always annoying however they can usually give me an early check in which is convenient if arriving from an overnight flight the room is on the small side but of a good layout and normal for nyc the inconveniences this last stay were erratic water temperature in the shower and lack of a kettle no ability yo make a cup of tea;3
this review is a little late my boyfriend and i stayed for two weekend nights back in mid april we read a lot of negative reviews and were i admit were starting to get a little worried but heres the deal its fine its not great its not luxury its fine its a hotel a days inn in new york city for less than 200night at least thats the rate we got what do you expect ive seen some of the pics posted by other reviewers some of them are a little gross and offputting i am not denying that other travelers have had less pleasant experiences than we but i can only comment on what we ourselves experienced room was clean and and we felt safe and no we werent in one of the renovated rooms either it was dated but as i said it was clean and safethe;3
great location in midtown west across from penn station and madison square garden built in 1929 and huge hundreds of rooms staff was pleasant large lobby our room was old and tiny but clean we were up high and in the rear so the room was surprisingly quiet construction facade outside my guess is that wyndham just took it over and is planning a major renovation but is does not look like a prime high end wyndham hotel just yet our main objection was to the priceline rating at 4 stars i would say 25 perhaps 3 but we got a very good price 82 per night plus tax and fees so we were happy to be there so if you can deal with a tiny room in an older hotel for a good price the new yorker may be for you;3
this hotel is directly across from lincoln center in fact it is the closest hotel to lincoln center it is very busy all the time the bed room was very well appointed the shower was postage stamp size and had only 12 the shower area covered so water goes everywhere in the bathroom the bar is very busy also and the music is very loud the employees at the bar restaurant and entry are very pleasant the doors to the street are open most of the time and there is a very cold breeze felt in the bar and looby they charge 1295 per day for the internet there are no business programs available on the tv we had no water for about 2 hours around noon than it was brown for a whilesaturday night there was a pulsating beat from the music from the bar all the way to the 11th;3
the hotel is a great art deco hotel it has not been kept up there were bugs on the landing when getting off the elevator customer service was substandard the room was clean but the bathroom was really small homeless in front of the hotel it was an easy walk to time square and penn station i really feel it wasnt worth the cost;3
great place to crash before an early morning flightbutdont eat there rooms are clean and bed is great also view from room was greatrestaurant was so disappointingi had dinner with my son and it was bad from edamames to the ribeye even my drafted beer was bad;3
i purchased the daily wifi for 1295 from my computer when i tried to access the wifi from my iphone the receptionist said the internet access charge was per device it may have mentioned that in the small print somewhere but who would think that such an otherwise nice hotel would insist on ripping off their customers this way very disappointing and greedy the room is microscopic which is ok if you dont have much luggage but were traveling internationally with several suitcases and no place to put them the shower only has half a glass door leaving the other half exposed its a soggy bathroom after a shower as water can help but escape;3
this is quite the interesting hotel in a fantastic location near the hudson in the west village as some have mentioned this hotel is not for everyone but can be a great value and an interesting experience for the adventurous traveler it is by far the best value in manhattan especially considering it is clean and safe here are the details of my review location the location for the hotel is amazing right near the hudson in the west village the location is fantastic the hotel sits in a residential neighborhood just south of the whitney museum and just west of hudson and bleecker streets the area is quiet despite being near the west side highway rating 4 stars appearance the hotel was built in 1907 and is a pretty amazing looking building itâs in good shape and the;3
we had read that this was a nice rooftop spot for cocktails unfortunately we were greeted by a relatively hostile seeming bouncer at the door once at the top the server was very nice but the locale needed much sprucing up the martini was huge mind you and the gypsy music that was playing was excellent mixed review at best;3
allocated room 3019 for a five night stay this was an upgrade to a view up 34th street towards the empire state building booking in was simple and quick i had managed to arrange an upgrade before arriving the room was fine but not as palatial as room 2607 on my last visit but then it was not as expensive took several meals in the tick tock restaurant all fine but not out of this world also had a meal in the italian restaurant very nice meal made full use of the facility fee with calls back to the uk both landline and mobile numbers everything was great apart from the building work opposite the front of the hotel which went on into the early hours of the morning pheumatic drills were being used up to 3am the reception staff were uninterested with the comment;3
the rooms are nice bathrooms terrific beds very comfortable and the location is very convenient if youre visiting universal studios which is why we chose to stay here but in spite of our booking being made 3 months in advance we didnt receive adjoining rooms as requested there is no shuttle bus service from the airport and the elevators were being repaired while we were there which was an inconvenience for a supposedly 5 star hotel i was less than impressed;3
we had three couples traveling together one couple stayed in a king room on the first floor at 1130pm someone with a key opened their door thankfully they had the door latched we spoke to the front desk and they assured us it wasnt an employee and changed out the key and gave the couple two free breakfast buffets we think it was an employee because we noticed there were a bunch that would hang out in a break room type space nearby we think they use that room to go to the bathroom the king room was very loud with street traffic water pipes and inefficient heaterair conditioner the two queen rooms on the third floor were better and had been updated but the doors slammed when shut and there were gaps between the door and the door jamb the rooms are small which is;3
we were in nyc for the weekend and tried this place through hotwire roulette its a great location and reasonably good value our quibble with the place is that we requested and paid for a nonsmoking room with a queensized bed that particular combination was unavailable and they tried to convince us that we had requested a smoking room thus not offering a discount the standard size nonsmoking room was fine its just the principle if the thing;3
the facility fee really annoyed me maybe its just me but i dont use much wifi in the room on holiday because im rarely in the room i also wouldnt waste my time in new york in the gym or on the computers etc so for us it was just 248 extra for nothing apparently its very clear and all the hotels do it but i didnt see it in the small print so be aware the room was very small and basic so we really wanted to be out of it most of the time too which was ok because the aim of the holiday was sight seeing the main plus is the location which is excellent right in the middle of everything and ive got to say it was clean and housekeeping was good;3
hotel staff were very helpful especially sade on the front desk be aware though if offered a room 01 as our one was room 201 to 10 on any of the floors the noise from the aircon units in the shaft outside the window can be horrendus we got our room changed;3
i stayed here recently for three nights on business i chose this hotel for the location and was not disappointed its right next to lincoln center and about a couple blocks from central park i travel to ny on business a couple times every year and know enough not to expect too much from ny hotels and i would say that for this price range id say its a pretty decent hotel its quiet and clean enough and not too crowded however the rooms are tiny and i stayed on the 8th floor with no view at all i opened the window and there was a direct view of the wall of the next building the hotel itself lacks any kind of natural lighting and is generally very dark the front desk staff were not very friendly and indifferent also i am experiencing some problems with the payment;3
i was in the city for the weekend visiting some friends came by the hotel and entered the lobby bar for a drink the hotel is in a great location love the area the service was great and the beer was cold especially one employee named mor was really lovely an helpful thanks for the great experience would definitely come by again;3
i stayed 6 nights at the hilton universal city while participating in a ballroom dancing competition held at the hotel i enjoyed a large and comfortable room the facilities both in the pool area and the ballrooms were excellent the staff serving both in the restaurant and the bar were unpleasant and inefficient they seemed to have difficulty processing guests staying within the dance competition package this led to repeated unpleasant exchanges at meal times also there was plenty of food but it wasnt very tasty otherwise i really enjoyed my stay;3
stay was fine the room was good one of the concierges was very rude and unhelpful when asked a simple question overall pleasant stay but ive had better stays at the roosevelt and i liked the locale better;3
stayed dec 2018 loved everything about this hotel stayed again jan 2020 and the only thing we enjoyed was our room service was minimal at best no communication between departments made to feel like an inconvenience more than a guest sent in an email to wyndham and was basically told i would be better off contacting the hotel directly so pretty much passed the buck i figured my concerns would fall on deaf ears and i was correct;3
positives fantastic location the shower pressure is amazing considering we were on the 25th floor not a long wait for lifts hand gelsanitiser at each floor they even have a museum memorabilia collection in the basement for famous moments from the hotels history but it is not really advertised negatives definitely feels like a hasbeen hotel we stayed in the room next to the one where muhammad ali stayed which was a pleasant surprise but otherwise the hotel has definitely had its hayday the place is in need of a complete renovation new paint carpet etc whats more we stayed during storm henri and had water dripping from the cellingwall see pictures told the front desk and they said someone would come and have a look 10 minutes later front desk called;3
stayed at this hotel due to the proximity to the theme park overall the hotel is nice but it is very dated our room had a slightly odd smell to it but the layout was perfect not the best view but that really wasnt a problem the in room toiletries were lovely and more than enough towels to cater for our needs my biggest issue was that there was no free wifi on this particular trip we stayed in more inferior hotels and every one of them had free wifi and in this day and age i consider it to be a given bearing in mind that this hotel was not the cheapest i also had a loyalty card but this was not enough as we had booked through a third party the location is absolutely perfect and the pool area very nice too adequate parking was also available self park or valet we self;3
very nice older hotel building modern bathroom typical size bedroom the lobby bar offered 2 for 1 wine each evening 3 00 check in was ok with us i saw other guests waiting for their rooms i had to call for room service every day this should never happen;3
centrally located and a good base when visiting nyc staff were friendly and efficient security staff in the lobby which is good given the issues evident in nyc since cannabis was legalised room was sufficient badly needs an update stains on carpets and headboard bathroom door chipped quite badly paint work needs freshening up in room and throughout the hotel compared to european standards this is not a 4star hotel at best its 3 i would recommend this hotel as its centrally located and sufficient if youre not in your room all day if you want a little luxury look elsewhere;3
it appears that the lax hyatt has gotten into politics they have what appears to have blocked msnbc it is silly that hotels are making choices like this i could see if your the trump tower but not the hyatt;3
renovation in pool area not done well should have better walk thru set up again the hilton is loosing star rating bus to park is god and in time get in line so in ad bus is to small and will not take all people front desk personal very accommodating safe in room not working after security could not fix;3
well what can i say the first room we had was small and fairly clean it had an overbearing smell of chlorinebleach after half an hour of lying down my eyes were streaming and we had to complain about the room by phone we had a shower and the smell slightly improved but it was causing me a headache and there was no way i could have stayed in the room we went downstairs and complained to the front desk after a couple of minutes the girl on the desk swapped rooms around and we changed rooms the second was a much larger room the room was clean and the beds comfy the location is fantastic the rooftop bar great but the pool a disappointment its a plunge pool about 12 foot by 6 so im not sure if i can recommend the hotel as the first room wasnt fit for purpose but the;3
first the good things friendly staff and nice location between midtown and the upper west side particularly good if you are planning on going to a concertopera at lincoln center as it is right opposite it we were given an accessible room and the size was good which is pretty rare in new york however the furniture was dated and in some instances broken the wardrobe was tiny and the bathroom was in bad condition the shower wasnt working properly and needed patience and care to make it work there is no room service as apparently the restaurant doesnt belong to the hotel didnt try the restaurant but had a look and wasnt impressed all in all an ok experience but i expected a bit more from a 4 star hotel;3
hotel was nice lobby was spectacular rooms were just big enough location is spot on it sits in front of the ballet and across the street from the smith and a couple of restaurants staff was friendly the maid even folded my shirt i left out;3
checked in easily and early when we got to the room it was warm so i turned up the ac but the fan speed never changed after a day out we returned and the room was just as warm as before maintenance tried to fix it by said it was bc of the sun heating the room gave us a fan for over 250 a night that is not a solution went to dinner came back two hours later room was just as hot and the air felt humid called the desk and was told there were no rooms to move to went down to the desk and amazingly had a room for us and free breakfast no rate adjustment could be made since we booked through universal studios site convenient location but mechanicals need some fixing;3
i booked this hotel based on the reviews it received however when i checked in i was quite surprised at the size of the room which could barely have one queen size bed it is perhaps a good room for a business traveler but not for people who have come on a holiday the hotel staff was courteous and helpful especially jessica at the front desk was super helpful however i had to check out the next morning because for both myself and my daughter the room seemed too small the hotel has lots of things going for it an oldworld charm lovely architecture great location beautiful restaurant cum a diner and is probably value for money for people who would get a bigger room on higher floors;3
we spent 1 night at this hotel so we could arrive at universal studios by 9am we arrived after supper it was difficult to locate the check in desk after coming up from the parking garage bcause of all the construction however the employees cheerfully directed us the next morning we had breakfast from the coffee corner we noticed in the daylight that we could see universal studios from our room it was an easy walk to univrsal studios from the hotel;3
we stayed here for three nights we got into town early and were able to check in with no problem we had a bunk room with the shared bath rooms are extremely small and are for sleeping and resting only they do have a lot of hooks and drawers under the bed to store your clothes and items the lighting in the room is low and the window is small so there is not a lot of light in the rooms our air conditioner worked very well kept the room nice and cool the hallways are not air conditioned and have open windows throughout the building the bathrooms have two sinks two doors for the toilets and two shower stalls they were always kept clean and you never had to wait there isnt much privacy if you need to use the sink andor hair dryer you should bring with you a hand;3
i had read on trip advisor to see what this hotel was likewhat i read wasnât good so wasnât really sure what to expect ð³when i arrived the staff where friendly an reception was very clean an tidythe rooms are very dated but also very clean which was my main worry it could do with a total refurbishment in rooms but honestly i would go back as clean an i only needed somewhere to sleep only other problem i had before i went was thereâs no response to any calls emails or txt messages at all before you go i tried for 4 months but no joy;3
this hotel is in a great location and the staff is very helpful i was however unprepared for how ugly the room was perhaps they have better rooms but mine was on a lower floor and it was very dark the furniture was quite tasteless there was only one lamp in the room by the bed so if you wanted to work at the desk you couldnt there was a large tv but no remote control i am glad i didnt pay too much for this room it was so depressing that i decided to brave the snow storm on my checkout day rather than spending one more night in that room you may want to hire their photographer though they did a great job with the photos of the rooms;3
you get what you pay for the room is small practically all bed but its not abnormal for new york it is clean but old the carpet doesnt extend underneath the walls the tv is small and old my tv remote inexplicably disappeared never to return after my first night and the first visit from housekeeping the walls are paper thin so you will hear other people as well as a periodic rattling sound when i arrived for checkin no one was at the reception desk the doorman hamilton informed me the computer was down and the receptionist would be back once she fixed it she sauntered back 20 minutes later not at all apologetic hamilton on the other hand was wonderful he spoke several languages and remembered each guest well enough to greet them in their native language;3
no broadband in bedrooms i sa huge disadvantage some of the furniture in the bedroom was in extremely poor condition and was reported to staff but nothing was done noise levels outside by garbage staff was ridiculous at 4am;3
this place is old and no frills but it is clean and there are no bed bugs i have probably stayed here 6 times in 5 years the lobby retains some vestiges of better times the rooms a clean place to sleep a safe elevators 2 blocks from central park 15 minute brisk walk to the metropolitan museum some of the ac units are loud but youll have walked so much you will fall right to sleep anyway hotel has free wifi and reduced rate parking with a parking lot 7 blocks away directly across the street is a cafe for breakfast to go or very casual sit down as well as an indian restaurant across the intersection is a winespirits store and downstairsish is a pharmacy tons of quick eats along broadway handicap accessible i cant beat the value for the location so i;3
honestly our room smelled like a dog the carpets had been vacuumed but seemed to have taken a beating this summerhaving returned from an international vacation we found the cost and quality of the room service a limited selection and highly overpriced none of our dishes tasted very good at dinner breakfast was better but 80 for a few sides is ridiculously out of range the staff was freindly and professional;3
hotel was ok our room was quite small bathroom was clean though the taps and towel rails where poorly fitted nothing was level due to covid our room was only serviced once in 5 nights doorman was great and got us a taxi to penn station to catch our flight from newark we used the commuter train from jfk to manhattan quicker and cheaper than a taxi;3
we stayed at the empire four nights its very close to central park and a pretty quiet area the hotel has seen its best days its ok but not more the lobby looks like something from gotham city in the batman movies the staff seems to be tired of guests and gives you what you ask for which also is ok but not more than that rooms are of the smaller kind breakfast is not worth its price 26 for full breakfast i think 1015 is a reasonable price for what you get we went around the corner to starbucks which is the only breakfast place in the area there are no typical diners in a 15 min walk around the hotel the hotel is close to columbus circle and the subway the worst thing were the elevators at some occasions i waited up to 10 minutes to get the elevator;3
ive stayed here twice and both times found it good for the price it is budget accommodation and doesnt have any particularly amazing features to it but it is spotlessly clean the showers are good and it is very cheap you get a fridge in your room which is excellent and its cheap enough that if three of you are staying you can buy four beds to turn it into a private room there are lots of kitchens although we never tried to cook in one of them so not sure how good they were you are also practically on top of hammersmith tube station where there is an excellent and pretty cheap pizza place and the hammersmith apollo also only a short walk from riverside studios on the negative side both times we stayed it was far too hot and youre 3 mins walk from the bus station in;3
our family vacationed in la for five days and stayed at the hilton mainly due to its close proximity to universal studiotheme park and city walk being able to walk to the attractions in five minutes was a plus as well as drive to other popular areas in 20 minutes the highlights of the hotel are the outdoor heated swimming poolwhich the kids enjoyed just about everyday candace at the transportation and tours deskshe is a wealth of information and the vroom packagea great deal if you need a rental car while the hotelrestaurant have done a great job hiring friendly and serviceoriented employees they have missed the mark on keeping the hotel updated the rugs throughout the hotel either need to be cleaned or replaced the paintglaze on our bathtub was peeling in a;3
just spent ten nights at this hotel with my teenage daughter our room was adequate but no more it was on fourth floor at the front of the hotel so had a view of the lincoln centre lovely best feature of the hotel is the location excellent for access to subway close to amenities and central park the rooftop pool is tiny i would guess approx 4 feet by 10 feet and was full of children on the one occasion we visited all the sunloungers were occupied by people or reserved by towels not worth the trek up to the roof have not previously stayed in nyc so nothing to compare with but not a patch on london hotels;3
i stayed her for almost a week for a trade show the shower was continuously blazing hot then freezing cold i had chalked it up to me getting ready at the same time as hundreds of other peopleuntil i had to shower at 4am to catch a 7am flight same horrific shower experience never had one that was consistently the same temp also very noisy when i was in the bathroom i could hear everything from the next door neighbors also the inroom safe never worked note they accept pets it was great because i got to meet the westminster dog show winner but it was bad because i could hear the yip of the dogs on my floor well into the night overall the room was a very good size for ny standards and you can walk to javits from there but i would not stay there again;3
i recommend this hotel for the selfefficient budget minded traveler that doesnt mind the local channels on their television its an older residential building in the upper westside of manhattan so the rooms hallways and staircases are small i have to warn that the elevator is small as well i like this hotel because it is located directly across from central park and across the street from the better parts of harlem i recommend travelers to walk a few blocks up and have brunch at melbas one thing that i didnt like about this hotel was that the housecleaners never left us with the right amount of washcloths it was a two bed room i shouldnt have to constantly tell the front desk that we needed two washcloths by the way the phones didnt work so i had to;3
booked empire hotel through bookingcom upon checkout rate for second night was almost double the first hotel said thats usual would not correct unable to connect with bookingcom i disputed charge via amex;3
we are a family of 4 who stayed here in october 2019 the rooms are compact but clean and we had a partial view of the empire state we were lucky enough to have a coffee machine in the room to get us started for the day but im not sure this is in every room this hotel is in a really good location for all attractions and we would stay here again if we had another trip to the big apple the only negatives would be the extra price of the city tax which i think is high and the fact they charge you to hold your luggage per case too in a room on check out day is ridiculous never had this in any other hotel in the world;3
checked in at 1100pm using the elevator was a scary experience hallways were cramped room had the faint odor of urine and i dare not touch the ground in the room or bathroom with my bare feet in fact i dare not touch anything in the room with any part of my body with the exception of the bedsheets free wifi only in the hotel lobby yet all these things are forgivable because this place had the best rate per night in manhattan the bed was clean king sized and they had lots of fluffy pillows sleep was excellent shower was clean was out the next day by 900am call ahead of time for information on parking;3
stayed at the days hotel after a problem at another hotel during the un convention making new york incredibly expensive and almost all hotels soldout we eventually ended up paying a premium to stay here for 4 days and upon checkin we were upgraded by the friendly receptionist as we had paid a good price which we took to mean too much online we had booked an inside room via orbitz but were upgraded to the newly renovated room up on the 12th floor which was comfortable with flat screen television and newly installed shower with showergel shampoo and conditioner in the room on arrival and restocked when needed work was clearly underway on the 10th and 9th floors and on numerous occassions i shared the elevator with workmen however our room was on a clean newly;3
this is a very well located hotel generally getting old and run down in appearance and decor but value for money as la hotels are expensive pretty much a 10 ã¼ber to anywhere from this location wifi worked well service was great gym is not much at all golds hollywood is 5 away glendale galleria is 10 and worth a visit for shoppers;3
stayed for 3 nights had room facing inwards not great but its only some where to sleep the rooms were dark and bathroom was in need of refurbishment shower did not work properly and plug was missing from sink asked to be fixed alas nothing happened the font desk staff need to be more helpful and learn how to talk to there guest better the only smile we got was at checkout from young lady behind desk housekeeping staff done at wonderful job the only thing going for this place is the location;3
hotel was clean and we had a good nights sleep very central for us and doorman always gave directions if asked we did not need any more than this as we were not there to see hotelbreakfast very expensive so we never ate there;3
not the nicest hotel ive ever stayed in but certainly not the worst the hotel is close to the subway and easy to find i found the staff a little standoffish but they checked us in quickly the room was small and basic but sufficient and was cleaned every day the hotel allowed us to store our luggage on the last day in their luggage room for no fee which was much appreciated as we had a late flight booked there is a good bagel shop round the corner too;3
room was not cleaned until after 4 pm great location ate once at hotel because the food was too expensive staff was confused about the parking garage procedues twice could not exit garage because the ticket was not activated properly a 20 vale charge was added to my bill i never used the vale service then after i arrived home monday night i discovered an unexplained 44 charge to my credit card have to resolve this issue now;3
room decor is eclectic targeting an unimpressive clean and modern style while lacking in practical comfort hyatt lax lacks the feng shui peace hyatt properties have been known to embrace table and chairs not effective âpartnersâ experience in regency club disappointing food with poor and confusing selection of appetizers lobby all too proud to punish guests with cnn msnbc dogmatic talking heads at the end of a long day hotel is convenient to airport but area does not offer convenience to nearby entertainment nor quality food;3
not a bad hotel but not great rather tired and in need of refurbishment throughout definitely not 4 star more like 3 in my opinion concierge non existent and no real in room service great location though and reception staff great had to change room as first one was awful but did without any issues if you are looking for location and great rates then this the place for you however if you are looking for luxury then look elsewhere overall not to bad;3
hotel itself was ok owned by ramada group the staff sucked the lady at the front desk was kind of rude and did not even smile i was put at a quiet corner room which was ok until i found out they were renovating the stairs and painting the maintenance guy had a key card and before knocking he just barged in to my room thankfully i was just unpacking that time after that had happened i tried to call down to front desk which had a busy tone for 30 mins finally i had to go out so i went downstairs to talk to front desk this is when i found out why there was busy tones the people there were chatting and when the phone had rang they just press the busy button ive asked to switch rooms but they said they had a full house ive also asked for nobody to do room;3
we stayed here for 4 nights from the 20th april when we arrived reception was very busy and loud i had sent an email before travelling asking for a city view and explained it was to celebrate our 40th birthday and our friends first overseas visit since having major surgery and suffering with a chronic illness when we checked in the receptionist had said they hadnât allocated our rooms and couldâve get us on the same floor which was fine as it was so busy i didnât ask about our request as lots of people were waiting to check in on arrival to our room on the 29th floor was shocked how dark and tired the hallways looked as the reception area looked quite grand the door to our room was covered in dark brown peeling paint so not a good first impression our room was small;3
this hotel yes is very upscale for the san fernando valleyhollywoodi did get a very good deal from bookingcom but when i arrived i had to pay 25 a day for parking as a guest really i stood in line behind a snobby lady that was telling her life story to the bell person then finally they called out a supervisor to help out other guest checking ini should say he was an ok man but not as helpful as i would really think he should of beenthe hilton does not offer any complimentry anything it seems likeeverything is costly in this hotel nothing is free i guess you have to be at hiltons level to enjoy staying there;3
if you have an outing to lincoln center this location cannot be beat that being said our room was very small and noisy the bathroom was small and cramped we were constantly juggling our belongings throughout our stay due to the space constraints you know how most hotels have an inroom coffee maker this place actually charges for those little cups of coffee you make so beware wifi is an extra charge and our small room had an awful lot of space taken up by the minibar as well as an array of items by the coffee maker that we could buy i probably will not stay here again as there are too many other hotels in new york city;3
we spent six days at wyndham new yorker that was a very pleasant stay apparently we were told when we cheked out we got af free upgrade the room was very good very clean and nice good shower space enough for two very comfortable bed it was on the eigth floor there was some noice from the street earplugs solved that the hotel charge a service fee 29 dollars per day that cover for ex fittnescenter you have to pay even if you do not use any of the services the fee cover that is not satisfying the hotel aught to charge guests that use the services but we were informed about the fee when we booked so it did not come as a surprise the hotel is places very central on manhattan it is easy get aorund from there if you want to stay in a relative nyc is;3
the days hotel has seen better days they have signs up ask you to pardon their mess they are remodeling didnt see the remodeling but the hotel is old and tired the rooms are clean bed is comfy and the water always works they were having trouble regulating the heat and sometimes i would come in to a room with the air conditioner on to try and cool it down the elevator rarely worked right a little scary i took the stairs a great deal so get a room on a low floor i was on the 9th ugh the staff was great always friendly and helpful the location was excellent food subway stations and near the park sort of;3
the good news first the hotel is in a great location right across the street from lincoln center and just a block to the subway the king size bed in our room was very comfortable and after complaining just once to the front desk and confronting the a very noisy neighbor we had nothing but piece and quiet for our three night stay everything worked doors opened and closed drawers did too the bathroom faucet brought plenty of water both cold and hot i did have to fix the sinks drain cover so that the shallow sink wouldnt overfill after that it drained rather nicely the tv worked and after tightening the cable connection on the back of the tv the picture was acceptably clear the decor was a little dated dark and verging on dingy but the room was clean the;3
i stayed at the hilton universal for a night in a corner king room the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable a highlight was the separate vanity for makeup application on the downside this hotel is well trafficked checkin time at the front desk time can be very busy it took 20 minutes to wait in line in a very busy lobbylong line and finally checkin yuck i may return as an hhonors member i like to be loyal and the hilton family of hotels has few choices in beverly hillsla but its not at the top of my list;3
i stayed here a night going and a night returning from asia the bed is a real comfort and the rooms themselves nice enough but the shower iâm all for conserving water but to not be able to rinse the shampoo from the little bit of hair i have left is ridiculous;3
although we had to change rooms beacuse the first option was too small and the tv didnâ´t work the second room was better we had to insist on the tv as well the location is good even though is approximately 20 minutes away from central attractions there is a subway just around the corner a revamp would be good some floors are smelly we had breakfast in the spot across the street it has many options good prices;3
nothing wrong with this the hotel breakfast was more than fine and staff helped wherever possible to advise on attractions and transport which made getting around fairly simple in the end rooms are clean and comfortable a good value option;3
while the hotel is very clean and nicely decorated the room was only fine for a night or two the best part is it is across from penn station the front desk staff is not very friendly either in check in or check out the bathroom has no counter space at least in the room that have not been renovated recently again clean but nothing special;3
i had really high hopes for what sounded like a cool funky place it is funky i stayed in a captains cabin so i had my own cute bathroom the room looked good smelled old and stale i had a french door to a patio that was chained from the outside so i couldnt use it the glass panes on the door were filthy with spider webs hanging that with the heavy chain locking me in gave it a creepy feel the bar and the rooftop were closed for private events my entire stay there are bars and restaurants close but not on the street so grabbing a drink or appetizer at the end of the day wasnt easy the doormen were warm and welcoming but not so the front desk the price is good the location is ok i will try something else next time;3
i was a bit concerned when i read the reviews but the room was clean and tidy as was the bathroom plenty of hot water the bed was comfortable and clean the staff where very helpful it was very warm at night it could do with a paint and refurb this said on monday 30th nov 16 there where work men taking up tiles etc for a refurb btw not a bug in sight the subway is on the next block there is a little deli does not look great but bagels and coffee are great the area was quiet across the road is central parkwe also could leave the cases after check out which was 1200 mid day;3
this hilton has a great location if you are planning a day at universal studios a five minute walk to the front gates the customer service however is quite poor a great deal of the staff seem to be undertrained or not knowledgeable enough to perform their jobs well the valet was great though and the rooms were clean and up to date;3
i stayed at the empire hotel summer of 2012 this was another work comp stay and i was really excited it opened up since i had wanted to stay there for a few years now itâs definitely a pretty hotel however it is also pretty small i had a wonderful view of lincoln center and the century 21 beckoning me to come in and shop my first impression upon entering the room â it felt musty and âdampâ the ac was working so i knew it wasnât the humidity even my pillow had a colddamp feel though it was dryâ¦the bathroom had an eastern feel with the use of bamboolook flooring â really simple but very small the shower stall was nice and the shower head was larger than most but not the ârainingâ experience i had heard about one nice thing about the hotel is the rooftop it;3
the jane hotel is inexpensive by nyc prices quirky eccentric and different this was a very last minute nyc run in december 5 days before christmas and i was lucky to find a room at all under a kings ransomthe rooms are designed like railroad car sleepers thats all there is to themall 50 ft however i was in nyc to see my son so i just need somewhere clean to sleep and it was clean the bottle of water in the room slippers robe to go down the hall to the bathroom were a nice touch i have never stayed in a hostel before and it was a bit odd to me to leave my room with mussed hair no makeup in my pjs to hurry down the hall to bathe it reminded me a bit of my college dormitory days im a bit old for this but im sure young people wouldnt mind;3
iâd stay here again but only from sunthu in the fall or spring ie when the nightclub is closed and thereâs no need for climate control the ac was incredibly loud ineffective and impossible to turn off without shutting off power entirely i imagine winter heating is similar in all other circumstances iâm going to pay a bit more for my old standby in midtown east pros good checkin experience i arrived in the morning and dropped off my bag went to a diner recommended by the front desk then came back a few hours later to see if there was a room available my room wasnât ready yet but monique at the front desk gave me a free upgrade to a captainâs cabin charming and comfortable room slightly hard mattress fantastic pillows buttersoft sheets fast wifi in;3
this hotel is in a great location very convenient to get to many places in the city the lobby is beautiful the room was a good size had a jr suite with two beds and a sitting area the furnishings were a bit worn and some things broken the bathroom wasnt very clean especially the bathroom door which is a frosted glass that was filthy the front desk staff was less than friendly and not very welcoming just seemed bothered at any interaction not sure that i would stay again with a little effort on customer service cleanliness and updates to room furnishings;3
travelled with a group of friends there was some confusion with our booking possibly due to our travel agent the reception team were happy to assist the hotel did seem to struggle with the volume of people queuing for reception and some requests took longer than expected to action the rooms were clean and comfortable the decor is dated however and could do with some modernisation especially in the bathrooms the location was perfect considering we went to a a couple of sporting events at msg during our stay there was a dog event happening at msg there were a large number of guests with dogs staying as a result the lobby stunk pretty bad of dog a couple of the security guys in front of the lifts could also do with cheering up and take their jobs a little too;3
thought id get a better deal please help would love to go back to the empire wheni arrived they wonted to charge more monies for a five night stay however i had confirmation no with original price and co nomber so that solved problem after great battles i thought iwas going into sing sing i became very nervous thought your hotel was in great location most of your staff was excellent food fair very expnsive this is 2014 get smart 57st on 8th rooms are selling for 8000;3
the jane has an amazing location close to the highline a few blocks from the subway reasonably priced for a ny hotel and on a pretty cobblestone street in the west village lovely however if you are planning on staying in a bunk room please prepare yourself for how small they are we are usually pretty easy going but after a few nights in this tiny room we were feeling claustrophobic and annoyed for a short stay it might be ok especially if you arent the type that needs personal space we would stay again but only in a larger room having said that cafe gitane on the bottom floor was great and the 2 bars were also a nice spot to have a drink;3
i stayed at the days inn for 4 nights in november 2015 as part of a leaisure trip to new york with my girlfriend the hotel itsself is conveniently located right outside a metro stop so it is easy to get to and from it for sightseeing it is also within a couple of blocks of central park the room was clean on arrival and the bed very comfortable i would however describe the whole hotel and the room as feeling a bit worn out whilst nothing was technically wrong with the room and it was cleaned to a good standard every day it certainly wasnt anything special either it served perfectly well as a reasonably budget room from which to base ourselves the curtains were oddly completely fake and couldnt be drawn accross the windows they did however have blinds but these;3
fantastic location close to to the train station and the empire state building the hotel is an art deco building that has character but in need of a coat of paint in places the room was very small but clean the bathroom was functional and the bed comfortable this hotel is an excellent base for a short break we managed to most of the sights on foot only using the underground once to get to the statue of liberty ellis island and ground zero we had planned our holiday well as we wanted to see as much as possible in only four days but on the few occasions we needed to ask for advice we found some of the hotel staff as well as the staff at a couple of places we visited ignorant rude and unhelpful this is not something that we encountered in la or san francisco on the same;3
arriving after 36 hrs flying to find out our booking was for one night previous night only instead of the 5 it was supposed to be we were so tired and just wanted a shower but instead we had to sit on a couch in the freezing cold lobby for 20 minutes as the front door was open and a very cold breeze came in lady who served us was quite nice she eventually after me going over to the desk to find out what was going on offered us a much bigger room and free breakfast for our troubles breakfast was lovely and definitely brightened our spirits the room had a huge bed but in the case of a much bigger room i would hate to have seen the shoebox we were originally booked into housekeeping attended our room on more than one occasion one morning even while we were still in;3
i stayed here in december 2019 the hotel was a mixed bag in my opinion which led to only an average rating depending on what youre looking for the rating may be higher pros fast check in littleno wait for elevators nice bathrooms look recently updated compared to room comfy bed good location for subway lines good internet connection cons my room super noisy with street noise i could clearly hear a woman talking on her phone across the street the windows seemed very thin maybe its better on higher floors but this was a major knock for me on staying here if you want to sleep in or go to bed early this was not the place to do it room size is rather small even for nyc it was fine for just me but would be tight with two people residence fee;3
usually book hotels myself after reviewing first but this time booked through travel agent as was doing another trip tagged on to new york so i was a bit sceptical as what to expect arrived at night to be told that though a request had been put in for twin beds they hadnt been able to honour this as were fully booked wasnt too happy about this as meant sleeping in the same bed as my friend receptionist said wasnt anything she could do about it but she had allocated a king sized bed as it happened it was ok as the bed was that big we may as well of been in twins but this may have caused a problem if two men had been travelling together or a male and female friend think that if requests like that cant be honoured then the hotel should let you know so you can have;3
if you are looking for a budget place to stay in nyc go there friendly staff the rooms are simple but clean book with private bathroom close to metro 1 110th street very quiet safe neighborhood really ok for a short stay;3
rooms could be cleaned more thorough lots of dust in the windows and around the room in the corners bathroom could use a sliding door preventing shower water from spraying into the tiny bathroom also more power sockets would be useful as there was only one to charge your devices ac makes a lot of noise and definitely needs maintenance;3
we just got back from los angeles and this hotel is not in the best of areas the hotel has a wonderful breakfast the guy called hugo and the two ladies that worked at the breakfast were so nice and friendly and they made the best omelettes ever and breakfast was great but the hotel does not serve any other food and there are no good places to eat with in a walking distance from the place the staff at the front desk could not even suggest any good places to eat we were not happy about this the staff at the front desk were nice but not really helpful it was like that they did not know the area of los angeles it was our first time there and we did not know the city we needed some help and we did not get much;3
located in the perfect location just across the junction from station within 5 minutes walking distance room is tiny but clean share toilets and bathroom are also clean but bathroom should separate woman and man i opened the door and saw one guy was getting dress we need to pay for wifi and signal is quite poor;3
the hilton universal city is a bustling property that was filled to capacity at the time of our stay it was a bit maddening for my taste room needed updating and smelled of smoke despite the nosmoking policy the staff at the hotel is wonderful and do their utmost to ensure a good stay excellent variety at breakfast with an equally excellent wait staff;3
pros premier plus room as expected large very clean and comfortable with a great walk in rain shower cons arrived on the coldest day of the year and the checkin queue was down the street took around 30 minutes standing in freezing temperatures before getting into the building itself only one self check in machine open and one other staff member checking in really need more hotel up steps with no step free access so a struggle with a heavy suitcase hotel entrance lobby area and corridors very shabby and not very clean same with lifts strange smell in corridors certainly not usual level of premier inn clean very noisy during first and last nights with children running up and down on floor above at 2am eventually stopped when an adult yelled last night woken;3
i booked a 1bedroom appartment at woogo central park because we were looking for somewhere to stay with our two children didnt want to spend a week cooped up in one bedroom with them and needed somewhere reasonably priced where we could make our own breakfast and snacks and thereby keep costs down further after reading the reviews on tripadvisor i was positively scared of going but it was fine as other reviews say there is no point coming here if what you really want is a swank hotel youll just have to fork out a whole load more cash for that woogo provide an appartment not a serviced hotel room and there is no point gnashing your teeth about the lack of towel changes just take extra with you the appartments are not huge but new yorkers live in flats this;3
very basic hotel small room nothing exceptional but its a great option if you dont plan on staying in the room for long or often close to harlem and right in front of the park which was great would stay there again;3
the empire hotel has a great location in new york i booked 5 days with my daughter at the empire hotel i chose this hotel because they had a pool knowing that we where going to be there in july and i t might be hot in new york then i thought the this hotel would be the best as we could come back in the afternoon after had a long day walking in nyc little did we know that the pool deck was closed for all 5 days we where there so if the pool is a must this is not the hotel also i would like to add the 2 days out for the 5 housekeeping was not able to attend to our room;3
we stayed at the hollywood hotel after 5 nights in a luxury hotel in las vegas this was a mistake we should have reversed the holiday and started in la the hollywood hotel is certainly not what it appears to be in the brochures it is tired and dark inside however the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good the housekeeping staff do a good job and the rooms are clean it is a 20 taxi ride from downtown la the hollywood walk of fame and starline tours which offer just about every tour you could wish for and 5 minutes walk from the nearest metro station 15 minutes walk away are some very reasonable restaurants however to walk anywhere you will have to pass vagrants sleeping on many of the benches on the pavements they do not cause much;3
we stayed here for location to universal studios perfect for this all staff very friendly rooms are of good quality although one stain on carpet we ate breakfast every morning a la carte enjoyed we had 1 buffet dinner on 4th night only because of the previous night room service debacle we enjoyed the buffet dinner quality items on offer we had 3 room service on the 3rd night it became very disappointing we were advised 1 hour wait we accepted this for 2 toasted cheese sandwiches they had been kind enough to accommodate our request we ended up waiting 2hrs 45mins this was ridiculous such poor service then returned to our room room service dishes still in room very very disappointing;3
my wife and i stayed here for a few days in february 2017 its just a few hundred yards from penn station and an ideal base for seeing or shopping in new york city its a very busy hotel and reception staff are very efficient and helpful it is extremely clean but unfortunately it is in much need of a thorough makeover our room was compact to say the least decor was dark and old fashioned and no teacoffee making facilities still it served us well as a base and perhaps the best feature was the ticktock restaurant adjacent to it which was absolutely marvelous like a lot of city centre hotels the wyndham doesnt really need to try hard easy money;3
no wifi unless you pay disinterested front desk staff one elevator broken all weekend the baby bar in the lobby was never staffed when i was there location was convenient and bell staff was helpful nothing terrible but certainly nothing great;3
this is an older hotel that is clearly being renovated in some aspects the room sizes are incredibly tiny as well as the bathroom donât expect to fit 2 people in the bathroom to get ready because that isnât going to happen the room was clean and tidy however there was a lot of damage for instance broken ceramic tiles holes in curtains from previous guests that was clearly never repaired things like this do take away from the quality of the room there is no seating in the room other than the bed and one desk chair if youâre having guests come to your room to hangout with you this is very inconvenient and uncomfortable the view from our room on the 8th floor was nothing spectacular just the back side of another building looking into other peoples rooms definitely;3
i think this is a very good deal considering how expensive most nyc hotels are the location is good for public transport its right next to a subway station for access to the west side and only two short blocks away from a crosstown bus that will get you near to museum mile on the upper east side the room was comfortable and the facilities were reasonable;3
i was very disappointed when i got to the front desk and the staff was unaware of the promotional items that were listed on the website and i was even more disappointed because they did not even try to resolve the issue for you when you find a reservation online for the days inn please call the checking reservation to make sure youre getting the same promotional deal thats advertised on the website before you go to the actual hotel and is not given to you at the front desk because they have a promotional deal for a manager special that has early check in at 1pm in late check out at 1pm make sure its noted with your reservation before you get to the hotel so call a days in advance;3
after arriving for a two night stay to a lovely greeting and nice room we were disappointed with how the end of our trip was ruined by a disorganised and rude employee who forget our late check out which we paid a large sum of money for and resulted in us having to leave a paid tour early to resolve the problem the response we got from the hotel when we returned was also less than acceptable so disappointed in this end to what had been a wonderful trip around the us;3
we have been going to the new yorker regularly over the past 15 years at the same time of yearwestminster dog showvalentines day we booked through a shady siteotelcomand were a little worried something would go wrong with the reservation after reading their reviews i believe since i called the hotel directly a week in advance of the reservation to confirm all went well mohammed who checked us in was very helpful and knowledgeable we got the room type we reserved and it was nice however this time there was no refrigerator or coffee maker very inconvenient but available at a surcharge of from what im told was around 40stay there were major problems with the entrance doors being worked on huge wind tunnel going in and out dont bother doing your hair;3
location was excellent subway choices penn station we walked to theatre each time and did subway to met opera and some galleries the hotel itself is grand art deco but some of the carpets in the common areas on our floor need attention and replacing having the restaurant and tick tock diner on premises were a big plus we tried to get a taxi one day but the bell boy was rude so we didnt however the facilities fee was a rip off and con job we were told about it after travelling 24 hours we had paid up front for the room and arrived 8 pm ish to be greeted with this facilities fee was a shock we were told it was for wifi which according to booking form was included and their website says the same thing but no authorisation for faciilities fee no room and we;3
3 nites tuesday friday pretty busy with tourists weddings conferences easy walk to the park easy uber to hollywood we booked thru hotelscom but are honors members were given an accessible room on the 4th floor lobby is 3rd floor there are several conference rooms on the 4th floor and we had to deal with setup noise starting at 630a next time well eat at burbank airport as there a lot of selection the hilton is pretty limited and pretty slow for lunch;3
this hotel is in a great location its within walking distance to universal studios and city walk for that it cant be beat the lobby is very clean and spacious and the staff are very friendly all the things i would expect from a hilton property the dinner buffet though a bit pricey is fantastic and offers a wide variety of food choices though a bit spread out and somewhat disorganized there are entree items although share the same location as the desserts an pastries it just seemed a bit awkward the pool located on the 1st floor lobby on 3rd floor is a good size for a quick dip and was never really crowded it was clean and quiet two things were a little disconcerting the carpet on the room was beyond horrible it looked like it was about 20 years old and;3
fantastic location but the room was very dated 28th floor and very small we were a family of 4 and there was no room to walk around the beds there was also very little room to store clothes or toiletriesthere was a shelf in the bathroom but it was very narrow and at a slant so everything fell in the sink no tea and coffee facilities in the room but there is a mcdonalds across the road which is open 24hrs so that was great for us i wouldnt stay here again due to the small rooms and the outdatedness of it all but for location it ticks all the boxes;3
firstly i would like to emphasize the fact that the hotel is located close to everything the subway is a 5 minutes walk the park is just around the corner and sturbucks is downstairs you would expect noise but in my case it was very quietif you can overcome the very annoying humming of the aircondition everybody in the staff was really helpful and kind so no problem there the room in particular was practical and spacious considering what i have heard about all rooms in nyc the most important thing was that the cleaning lady showed up every day which made me really happy be sure however to put the do not disturb sign on the door if you dont want to be woken up every day at 8 sharp the mini bar was a big temptation but all the price tags managed to keep us;3
as far as location it doesnt get better if you are going to univesal studios the sheraton is also close but the hilton is closest its a large hotel could use some updating the restaurant and bar have decent food and room service is fast the room was clean bed was comfortable and housekeeping did a great job there was also a starbucks in the lobby my only complaint is that for the price of my room which was about 200 a night i did not expect to have to worry about wifi which they charged me another 8 a day for if i do it again i would stay at a less expensive hotel that had free free wifi you really dont need the close location just take the metro 5 day pass and then there is a free shuttle that is across the street that goes into universal studios;3
the hotel is conveniently located near universal city studios the continental breakfast was below average lunch and dinner buffets were good there is a bus station within short walking distance however you would need to drive to all los angeles attractions we liked the fitness facility;3
one of the cheapest hotels i found on a summer month in near the main manhattan nyc which usually has expensive hotels if you want a comfortable room anything much cheaper could be a shared room or shared bathroom or a backpacker type innso i settled for this one to have hotel like comfort and service rooms were quite spacious clean bathrooms we booked the premier rooms i wasnt disappointed with them the bad part of the hotel is the service no concierge would help us store our luggage and we have to carry almost a dozen bags by ourselves to the storage room reception could be better and elevators are tiny and slow location is near the central parksubway small cafes and fastfood joint;3
before you get into the building good luck finding a spot to pull off to unload or get valet parking there is a very small spot that was full the entire time i was there first thing to be aware of once you get inside is that the property has a 25night tax facilityresort fee this was a little surprising the rooms are tinytiny about 15x15 there was not enough room to have the desk chair pulled out and still open the door the smallness wasnt all bad especially considering its nyc and a very old building what was bad was the archaic plumbing in the shower there were separate hot and cold valves with no ability to pick a temperature and stick with it during a 20 minute shower the temperature would swing from scaling hot to tepid cold requiring;3
the tick tock diner is excellent lots of lifts in the hotel so you never have to wait unlike most hotels rooms are tired and the bathrooms could do with upgrading the hairdryer was awful mirrors not placed in rooms to enable you to dry your hair next to a plug charged a facilities fee to my credit card when i didnât use any facilities iâve already paid a fortune for the room and had to leave a tip i donât expect to be charged for facilities i havenât used;3
the hotel is exactly what it is a budget hotel in new york why do people pay low prices and are then surprised when their hotel isnt as luxurious and modern as some of the others our room was not an upgraded one it was worn with tatty furniture but i had come to see new york not a hotel room so for the limited amount of time we were in the room it was adequate it was cleaned every day sheets and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable customer service could be better although the maintenance man who came to open my safe was very cheery and helpful and the guy who stored our suitcases on the last day was brilliant maybe the rest of the staff could take a lead from them although to be fair noone was rude just direct with very little warmth or cheeriness the;3
it was a pretty central location for all the events we were going to during our stay which were all spread out the parking situation was great for our rental car because we could come and go as we please and not have to wait for valet and have to constantly be tipping the valet service the price along with the geo location although the neighbourhood is not the nicest and the convenience of parking is what sold this hotel even though parking was 25 a day they offer free breakfast here which is a huge savings and convenience and made everything worth it infact i was very impressed with the breakfasts there were lots of choices and the food was good staff pros and cons everyone was friendly and nice we requested extra pillows and blankets which we got took a;3
here you have to take care we had booked room in two periods both times we got a poor room at first they were changed by the serviceminded reception 1poor room was at 1 floor to the street room was worn and the noise from the street was heavy 2poor room to the yard was very worn with a lot of damages in the bath it was not cleanthe door was too little and you were able to look into the room from outside also this was changed by reception be sure to take a renovated room if you get a not renovated room you might better go to a very cheap motel;3
the most greatest part is the location very convenient and safe to walk in town room is small since its in the heart of nyc theres nothing to complain about it service was okay a bit slow but average;3
i traveled to nyc solo and i looked for the most interesting and most memorable hotel i could find after looking for awhile i came across the jane which states to have the smallest hotel rooms in all of nyc i was hooked and very excited because as a photographer i knew this place would make for a great photo op for my friends back home to see the rooms dont have their own bathroomshower so dont expect to get that instead theres a community washroom with individual bathroom and shower stalls a bit of an inconvenience but something i did not have a problem with at all after all of the photos i have taken on this trip the one that gets the most comments from my friends and family are the ones of my hotel room here at the jane hilarious hehe i paid about 99 a night;3
room was very small with very little place to keep luggage and move around did not have provisions for tea or coffee in the room queen bed was comfortable and room service was okay front desk and other services were adequate after adjustment o verbal stay was good;3
this hotel could easily rate higher by just replacing the mattresses and pillows the property is well kept the rooms were clean but the beds were the cheapest imaginable and difficult to sleep in the location is great right next to chinatown and little italy very quiet sitting right next to a small park metro entrance 100m down the street walking distance to the brooklyn bridge staff was very friendly a great bargain for nyc hotels if you can sleep on an army mattress;3
after many covid related cancelations of la trips and stays at this hotel over the last year or so we were finally able experience the offering we reserved a king room a couple weeks ago choosing to use a free night award in the world of hyatt program we checked in using the app near the beginning of the window we flew to lax from jfk and spent an hour on the tarmac awaiting a gate finally arriving at the checkin counter after midnight the agent was warm and professional recognizing our loyalty unlike most other hotels though this property does not seem to preallocate roomsupgrades for even the globalist member levelso if you like us are one of the very last reservations to present for the evening you may not receive a room upgrade our room while on the 3d;3
we stayed for 2 nights at the empire hotel while visiting family whom live in the area in a superior king sized room the hotel is in a great location at 63rd and broadway in the uws with easy access to lincoln center central park and the rest of manhattan via the close metro stop 4 blocks down at 59th and columbus circle when we first checked in we were given the wrong size room a queen which is very small likely less than 100 sq ft and contains no furniture to unpack clothes in however we walked down to the front desk and showed them our confirmation email from orbitz and they corrected the problem politely and quickly even provided free wifi for our trouble the superior king room was large enough for the two of us but would be cramped with more people while;3
i stayed at the new yorker on 8th avenue new york city when visiting to attend the aes convention at the javits center it was very convenient for this as the convention center is a short walk away from the hotel the hotel is also just a 2 minute walk from penn station and also right by the 34th street subway station making it a very accessible hotel built in 1929 it has an artdeco feel in places but the rooms are in need of a good refurbishment i stayed in room 3305 which had a nice view towards the hudson river but the room was very tired at over us300 a night for room only i really do expect better standards hence my average review rating checkin was very slow and at checkout they only had one person on the front desk there are some great restaurants a;3

we took our bride to be for a weekend in nyc the hotel itself was absolutely beautiful our room overlooked broadway and was also clean the hotel staff was friendly and prompt to our room needs however the elevators of the hotel has no ac the rooms ac temp was always too warm never below 75 the beds are very uncomfortable you may as well have slept on the floor we had wanted a relaxing time here at empire that was not the case if you ever stay on the pool deck lounge it was filled with young obnoxious 20yr olds that were not hotel guests they were all there mooching off the pool there are signs that states the pool deck lounge areas are reserved for hotel guests when we had called upon the issue to the front desk it had taken 5 calls in 2 hours for hotel;3
the hotel is pretty historic and thatâs why we booked it we prefer classic hotels over the more âtrendyâ places to stay the lobby is beautiful and the staff were fine however once we got up to the 21st floor we started getting some âhotel cecilâ vibes dark hallways small and dated rooms looks like it hasnât really been touched up since it was built that being said we enjoyed our stay and it served its purpose of being a place to sleep while we explored the city the location is pretty great especially if like us youâre looking to jump on the amtrak and visit another city after nyc the new yorker is right next to penn station overall a little creepy but it does the job;3
small but bed and shower are fine helpfull staff no free wifi in the rooms though only in the lobby breakfast is an option for 18 close to subway b and c across the street from central park heating and airco in the room;3
lame room no view clanking heater ugh not many staff to help you in and out of the hotel those front doors are heavy front desk staff had me thinking iâd get a great room and would enjoy my stay while i was checking in but nope i didnât even bother complaining one positive i do love the rooftop bar here especially in the summer other than that i wonât be back;3
i stayed in the ameritania hotel one night the location of the hotel is excellent few steps away from the heart of times square and subway station the staff was very professional and friendly the room was clean and comfortable but in needs of some updates windows rugs and chairs our room had a broadway avenue view and it was really noisy i really appreciated the complementary earplugs free wifi only available at the lobby not sure if i will comeback;3
without the location this hotel sits in and jeff the door man the hotel would be pretty terrible the price of the hotel is pretty good for new york but there are certain things i expect when i still pay over â£250 a night for a hotel room 1 room cleaning service or at least new towels every day 2 room cards that donât deactivate themselves every time you go out and come back to the hotel it is so frustrating going to your room every day and having to go back down to reception for a new key card 3 reception staff because these ones are appalling every single one of them has a bad attitude this morning i ordered uber eats and had photo confirmation that it had been left at reception when i went down to collect it it was nowhere to be seen 4 the bar isnât open 5 the;3
what we didnt like truly marked the hotel worst room service ever even when it was done only 3 times in 8 nights not clean properly at arrival and daily old smell in the rooms no room service at all by default even requesting sometimes was not done towels or even only a towel were randomly placed robes were new needed to unpack and never washed incredible trash bin not cleaned they even left the plastic bag pack maybe for us to change it the bed was never done properly they just move the main blanket and left the rest as it was after sleeping flips flops were added to the room every time so we ended with 8 pairs in a tiny room completely unprofessional service never to repeat a shame for a hotel that claims and should be much more never to repeat;3
the location was fine and there were certain amenities that were nice main lobby was very dark with no exterior windows and kept dark rooms are tiny no closet just a curtain to cover a space for hanging and the bathroom was so small and odd shaped that i couldnt even stand in front of the sink to shave i get it that nyc is tight on space but this room seemed the extreme wifi was useless and with no lte mobile service bunker i guess i was just plain out of luck bed was comfortableill certainly say that there was an hvac unit under the window that was circa 1975 and cooled like it it wasnt hot out but stuffy in the room;3
centrally located and near plenty of dinning and transportation the hotel tries very hard to be hip the roof top pool area is tiny and so is the pool which is fine but when the whole hotel is up there in the afternoon for drinks and djing it can get really crowded the beds are hard which my husband loves me not so much plenty of storage room in the bathroom which was very nice not one place to hang a bath towel after you are done;3
stayed here for 8 nights this month on a city trip as everybody here we booked the room to save some money to visit the city its expensive enough loved the clean room on arrival the quiet street between two busy ones broadway and amsterdam the fridge in the room the ac and fan the cable tv the bed was a bit small for two adults the bathroom also but not to bad overall disliked the quality of cleaning during our stay and the late check inn 4 pm and early check out 11 am even if you mail you arrive in the afternoon we did at 330 pm after traveling 14 hours and with a six hours time difference there was nothing to do about it wait till 4 pm also strange pay all 8 nights before you even are allowed to check the room in general its for nyc a pretty;3
i was very suprised when i actually arrived at the hotel as i had read bad reviews on the accomodation my experience wasnt bad at allthe hotel was everything i expect it to begood value for moneygreat locationfriendly staffgood facilitiesand the hotel room was fineno problem at alli dont know what people are fussing abouti had a great time and would consider staying at this hotel on my next arrival to new york;3
the new yorker has a great central manhattan location so perfect for a sight seeing holiday the hotel is looking rather tired especially the rooms with exterior refurbishment underway the tick tick diner is great and ideal for breakfast a more traditional usa feel than the standard starbucks watch out for the 10 per room per day facility fee surcharge for wifi helpful concierge service;3
stayed at new york wyndom for three nights some renovation work in progress room typical new york small but clean and adequate reception staff business like no friendly chit chat when checking in or out plenty of security staff on doors and lift entrance very small lobby for such a big hotel tick tock diner open 247 italian restaurant on ground floor nice clean and modern staff friendly and plenty to choose from on the menu would not go back to this hotel a bit too long a walk to times square for my liking and didnt feel comfortable in that area lots of street litter poor homeless people trying to get a sleepheat from street steam vents and begging for monies for food or cigarettes;3
good points great location for major tourist attractions close to the subway tick tock diner in the lobby had excellent food although pricey very friendly hotel security guards great views if on the right site of the hotel bed linen and towels clean and fresh convenient coffee cart downstairs for a quick snack we complained that our room was tiny couldnât lay 2 suitcases down and got moved to a bigger one bad points no coffee tea making facilities in the room no fridge needs updating a lot especially for the price paint in bathroom flaking off carpet needs changing whole place needs a refurb very noisy surrounding rooms using their water created a racket in ours we were close to the lifts which woke us up a lot some staff were abrupt to the point;3
in some ways i had no choice of where i was since this was the conference location upon observation the hotel is dated fire took place and the emergency system didnt work and i had to call the front desk to get the news to leave my room;3
the empire is in a great location but unfortunately has not been renovated properly or has that renovation been kept up the rooms are tired and well worn the staff is excellent and is very responsive to requests or complaints we stayed in a corner suite 719 which was very roomy with good light and views of broadway and columbus avenue the king bed was very comfortable the housekeeping very diligent but the bathroom was small poorly lit with shower stall basin stained and wall tiles cracked not what you expect when you stay in a corner suite;3
the hotel felt dated and tired lots of brown everywhere in a good location near madison square garden and a few blocks from times square room was ok i guess good view beware of extra charges every room is charged an additional 29 plus tax per day for use of wifi the business centre and the fitness room whether you use any of the facilities or not if this charge is not optional it definitely isnt it needs to be included in the price quoted for the room when booking we felt cheated and it would put us off returning there is a huge choice of hotels nearby;3
this hotel is good value when you remember it is a 2 star hotel the decor is tired and some things didnât work such as the wireless and toilet flush service was okay biggest disappointment was arriving at 10 pm local time where told the only room left was a small one even though we had booked 3 months earlier and told them we would be arriving late however the did let us move the next day on the positive side a great non touristy location and a great walk through central park to get down town to be a tourist;3
this hotel is in a great location however the hotel is tired and in need of a renovation the rooms lobby and elevators are worn and tired we were happy with the accessibility to all of our friends and family in the city and the proximity to the subway the hotel staff was friendly and prices were not bad however it is very dusty and scratched up inside they need to renovate;3
stayed at the ramada from apr 26 to may 4 2004 advantages the location its a hop skip and jump from the metro station and just a few stops away from universal studios hollywood boulevard and downtown la its just down the road from sunset blvd and boho enclave los feliz and is handy for buses and banks staff are courteous efficient and eager to help and the rooms are neat and clean theres a good comedy night on mondays in the bar and its got a nice swimming pool disadvantages the juice in the breakfast room tastes like its been watered down and metro trains are very infrequent in the evenings so can be a bit of a drag when you want to go out get a taxi instead air con in the rooms is quite loud but maybe this is normal id stay there again;3
everyone except the bell hop was unfriendly and very unhelpful the location is the sole reason i would stay again the hotel overall was not a good experience the room was clean and the hotel was easily accessible but the staff was terrible they told me shuttles were available but gave me conflicting information and i ended up paying for an uber;3
this was rather a mixed experience the hotel is in a great location my room was excellent and large the bed was big but not comfy there is really really good food and some lovely staff in the restaurant the breakfast is a buffet but i have a bad back and they kindly helped me i cannot praise the majority of the restaurant staff highly enough the italians were especially agreeable however some of the reception staff were very unhelpful there is a weird policy about not cleaning rooms unless you tell reception you would like this strange service which fact isnt properly advertised it isnt possible to get through to reception on the phone as i left i was blithely told that there arent any chairs in reception when i doubled over in pain and carrying a walking;3
was offered conciere service because we were members and staying for 8 nights never happened several issues with elevators would call for servicefront desk and no one would ever pick up air conditioning issues in room staff not very knoledgable about area when we went down to ask overall we had a place to sleep and at least new york did not dissapoint;3
we stayed here for 9 nights in july 2013 im not sure if i would or wouldnt recommend this place the rooms need a serious upgrade the hallway carpet never looked clean minor issue i know the lady who is supposed to help with tour information was so unhelpful and acted like we were just a nuisance asking her questions she told us a certain tour wasnt available so we called up ourselves and booked in for the exact day she had tried the lifts were the biggest nightmare of all so slow to move and open and it took us a solid 10 minutes some days to even get an elevator i would hope they actually get serviced the best thing about this place was the location right near a subway platform apart from that pretty average;3
weve just returned from a weeks stay at the ameritania hotel everything in new york is expensive so there was no quibble about price this is the sister hotel of the empire hotel so we expected similar unfortunately the amenities didnt match up at all this is a far smaller hotel with only a breakfast room and a small bar no rooftop bar attached restaurant or feeling of luxury that the empire offers there was room service to eat outside food brought in but with the whole of the times square choice of restaurants on our doorstep who would want that our room was reasonably sized but we either had to have the window open and endure the noise even during the night or have the extremely noisy air conditioning on we opted for the open window the bed was very good and;3
there is always a possibility of the ac or heaters not working and having to deal with engineeringthe hotel is otherwise good and very well located for my trips there was no coffee machine in my room and the front desk said thats the case for the first 3 floors cause the guests did not want to have themreally;3
this hotel is a very mixed bag staff is friendly and helpful requests for assistance were always answered quickly the room was immaculate incredibly clean but the hotel is very dated it is in dire need of updating however for the price given it is in nyc it is a great deal the hallways were narrow weirdly laid out and a bit dingy with stale tobacco odor but no such odor in our room rooms are actually not a bad size actually larger than several hotels in the area there is no breakfast no restaurant but given the location that is not a problem as there are plenty of great places to eat within just a few blocks on both broadway and amsterdam very convenient to the subway shower had great instant and very hot water coffee pot didnt work in the room but a new;3
great service and most helpful desk the room needs a lot of improvement i stayed in room 927 a doublebed non smoking room the room needs to be completely renewed everything worked but all the furnishings are quite old and show use marks the beds were very clean and the housekeeping services are very good the location is great three blocks from the central park one block from the subway station with a big convenience store by the corner do not forget the diner that neighbors with the convenience store concluding i enjoyed my stay here and most probably will return;3
we decided to stay here because the only attraction we were going to in la was universal studios they have a free shuttle that leaves from the hotel and goes to universal every 15 minutes or so which was extremely convenient the park is technically walking distance but with the steep hills you have to be in very good shape the hotel itself is very clean but they offer no frills at all they did away with the free continental breakfast unless you pay for a package and their breakfast buffet runs about 23 a person they also offer wifi but at 8 a day considering they charge 200 a night for a room with 2 double beds i think they can afford to provide free wifi;3
there in december 2003 for six nights and paid about 75 a night hotel is passed its glory days but room was clean comfortable great mattress and quiet heating on first night was too hot but ok for rest of stay plenty of good cheap places to eat close by subway entrance across the road staff are indifferent except for ron the porter who is world class perfect for a budget stay in new york;3
stayed here for one night most comfortable bed ive ever slept in a hotel average size room nice view of universal city and mountains very clean clean average size bathroom nothing fancy or special about this hotel but i paid 102 bucks so not bad nice staff ill be staying at the hilton cancun next month i also joined hilton honers because it has its perks oh yeah if you are staying here for a couple of days i wouldnt because parking is expensive 11 bucks per night it adds up overall good clean and comfortable hotel if you are coming to universal studios its good but otherwise stay in the la area the wyndham in sunset is better and for about the same price closer to attractions to hope this helps;3
considering we scored this hotel for 100 on the fourth of july we werenât sure what to expect the hotel was older but not dirty our room was clean but small and that didnât bother us the outlets in our room didnât work so that was weird anyway check in was slow the staff ignored you until they had to talk to you in which case they were then nice the location was decent as well safe area central park is right across the street and the subway is a short easy walk if you get the place at a great price go for it;3
my family stayed there while i was in the hospital for a few days the service staff were terrible the rooms were overpriced and mediocre the neighborhood is edgy and its name does not do it justice not recommended;3
let me preface this by saying that ive stayed at the new yorker before and had a great experience this time however i was disappointed i had two separate reservations one booked using reward points that i subsequently upgraded to ensure that my room included a view and some of the other perks that were offered my second reservation was booked through club wyndham four days and three nights in the city when i checked in the desk clerk mentioned that i did have two reservations but she was going to work backward what i ended up with was a shoebox of a room without a view coffee maker or refrigerator so my upgrade was null and void i did appreciate the security at the hotel and that guests are required to show a room key before heading to the elevators bell;3
stayed here on wyndham points over a long weekend well start with the pros great location right next to a metro station and madison square garden easy walk to many key points in midtown manhattan though countless hotels can boast this good italian restaurant and bar on site in the room shower was hot and strong wifi reliable historic exhibits about the hotels early years were nice to see the cons weve stayed in manhattan many times in recent years and this hotel had the smallest room and bathroom weve ever seen even for ny hotel standards the remodeled room was perfectly nice in design but i wish the architect had configured the bathroom to be just a bit bigger as you could barely open the closed door while inside the hotel is enormous and the foot;3
the location is quite good it is easy to find and in conventional distance from public transport the prize is good for new york but it requires some reparationsrooms are clean and small cleaned everyday but what else you need for sleepingwe had some doubts about the safety of rooms because our room door did not fit quite enough so we checked everyday whether anything miss and fortunately nothing what was the most negative feature of this hostel were toilets and bathrooms one did not work at all and one got broken during our stay otherwise i think it was a good deal for new york and we really enjoyed our stay we love new york;3
in this hotel you get what you pay for being a budget hotel in new york we werent expecting much our room was small but perfect to put your head down after a busy day in new york the hotel was clean and friendly and the room was serviced every day the location is quite far out for most attractions in new york but with only a couple of minutes walk to the nearest subway it is easily accessible;3
stayed in a standard cabin with one single bed and shared bathroom for 125 147 with taxes pros price is a major plus where in manhattan let alone the meatpacking district are you going to find a hotel room for that price decor is very cool retro train cabin feel the staff at reception bellmen doormen all wear old school train porter style uniforms the two housekeepers i saw were wearing old school french maid uniforms and the lobby is very grand although the deer heads and the stuffed peacocks were not my cup of tea nice cafe off of the lobby that serves breakfastlunchdinner but didnt dine there so i dont know if its worth the visit robe and slippers are provided in the room along with a bottle of water and a bath towel and face towel the;3
we have stayed at several hilton hotels over the years and were sadly quite disappointed with this one it just didnt have any kind of wow factor which given this is a universal hotel was a disappointment the hotel was surprisingly dull apart from the lobby area which was a bit better and it was generally too business like the staff did little to make us feel we were special or even remotely important to them we had emailed in advance to request a high floor which is much quieter than the lower level rooms they told us that they were unable to meet our request because we hadnt booked with them directly however after some discussion they finally moved us up a few floors but we were still only about half way up the building sadly there was nothing special about;3
because the hotel is well situated by pennstation and madison square garden it will continue to get guests no matter what standard it keeps unfortunately we found the incredibly tiny bathroom and old carpets to be filthy when we stayed and the amount of college students loudly being all over the place because a large chunk of the hotel is sectioned off as college dorms will keep up from staying here again the food at the adjoining diner is just okay but we did have a nice checkin experience with a lovely lady seated at the membership desk pretty large resort fee too which didnt get us much except internet if i remember correctly;3
my main issue was parking the designated parking was 3 blocks away usually full at 41 a day when you eventually get a spot good staff the rooms were a bit dated but clean no ice box it was a decent place to stay overall;3
this hotel is in a great location ideally located for central park time warner centre lincoln centre the hotel reception is impressive and staff were pleasant when checking us in the room as many reviews state is in need of refreshment the paint was peeling off the bathroom door and no plug in the sink making it difficult for my husband to shave there is a keurig coffee machine in the room which i love but we were only given 2 pods for our 5 night stay i would expect at least 2 cups per person per night instead we got one drink each for our entire stay rooftop bar was fun slightly pricey but only as expected for this location i would probably look to stay somewhere else next time we visit could find equivalent hotels for less money and less tight;3
we payed a reasonable amount for a weeks staybut no amount could make up for the continuing banging through the nightas we went in february which is cold the heating was on which makes a noise like someone in the toliet hitting the pipes with a hammerafter four nights of none sleep we had to ask for a change of roomwhich they did with no complaintsafter this our holiday beganthere is clean towels every day the rooms are reasonably cleanbeds are cleanthe subway is nearthe staff are helpfulcoffee and tea downstairs is freeyou can ask for a heater if you are coldthere is plenty hot running wateri myself have read some of the other reviews and notice people saying there is no near shops but if some people are willing to explore two blocks behind the hotel has loads of;3
i booked his hotel because it has a very good location good ratings and a reasonable price for nyc on bookingcom however the room was absolutely tiny no space to even open a suitcase as was the bathroom barely enough space to turn around and looked out onto an air shaft i guess thatâs why the room was a reasonable price for that location the room was at least clean and modern the hotel has virtually no amenities a token âfitness centreâ and a small bar off the foyer thatâs it;3
we booked the room looking for somewhere central with a bit of space payed for a larger room we were on 36th floor with a great view of empire state the room was very small without enough room to put our suitcases out of the way on top of the daily extra fee which is added to your room cost for use of internet gym and phone we paid extra again for a coffee maker and fridge the bathroom was tiny and had very limited shelving to put anything we heard a lot of noise from our neighbours including voices toilets flushing blow dryers we also had room service knocking on our door at midnight to deliver pillows and blankets wrong room and it was hard to get back to sleep on the positive side we were close to penn station tic toc was fantastic and was the bar and;3
the one thing that the new yorker hotel has going for it is location a subway stop right around the corner was ideal for us within walking distance of times square the issues room size which i believe is typical for most downtown ny city hotels it is small my spouse commented that we could fit the entire room including closet and bathroom into our master bedroom at home neutral rating expensive with a 20 aaa discount the room still ended up costing 400 a night after associated taxes and fees something that i complained about via the hotels survey was the wifi capability you will have a mandatory facilities fee which i believe covers the fitness center we did not use wifi coverage and possibly something else i work in an it shop at a;3
the hotel itself is beautiful with lots of lobby areas for siting socializing and relaxing a nice little coffee place and a bar with happy hour specials the room itself was comfortable but only average i have stayed in a number of hilton properties for both business and pleasure and this one was not quite up to snuff the allure is its proximity to universal studios if you book this hotel through universal you will get an early entry into the wizarding world of harry potter which is really nice given the size of the crowds after the general opening not sure if you get this deal when you book directly with the hotel also if you book through universal studios hilton will not give you points for your stay since you booked through a different company this odd to me;3
for location if you are visiting universal this hotel is fabulous you cannot fault that a free shuttle to take you right to the door of universal city walk with a family the pool is great and safe and has a nice bar area and hot tub jacuzzi the down side to this hotel however is the price of everything breakfast dinner laundry the shop all so very expensive 28 dollars a day to park 18 dollars each breakfast 6 dollars for a bottle of water really with the price of the rooms this place is certainly a money burner cannot fault the helpfulness of the staff they do a great job the elevators are having a lot of maintenance and took ages to get down from the 7th floor almost 20mins on one occasion i am a hilton honors customer and stay at hiltons a lot;3
stayed for one night to attend local event good parking for 45 just half a block away thats the highlight tiny tiny room view of other buildings ac about two feet from bed and very noisy bathroom too small for a waste basket im not kidding bathroom sink didnt drain shower only half protected by glass very leaky hand shower thus sprayed into the bathroom for a wet floor makeyourowncoffee for a 3 charge only 250 if you make your own tea buffet breakfast expensive with lackadaisical service right across the street from lincoln center but there are better cheaper options a few blocks away;3
showers are half enclosed and water gets on the floor wifi is expensive in the rooms according to the front desk they didnt even give us the price just said its free in the lobby and mezzanine those two places are not wellsuited for using your device coffee costs 3 per pod in the room breakfast in the restaurant is not recommended i ordered a 13 yogurt parfait with fruit the server said it was at the buffet and already mixed the yogurt parfait was a container of yogurt with one fruit choice the same container you can get in the supermarket for 1 the room size is adequate the closet is not the closet was quite small and the rod was too high for me to use living out of my suitcase for six days is not my idea of a good hotel stay the rooms have been;3
the empire is all about location columbus circle central park and a bustling hub of the city at the time warner center and while the hotel is attractively updated and pretty there is just something missing it just doesnt have that appeal as a must visit again hotel when writing about ny there is always mention of room size and the empire hotel rooms are small as are the bathrooms and while modern in design they are small however not hudson small where you have to leave your room just to think the bathroom well you will literally be screaming out loud when you bump your elbows with every turn you make whether in the shower or in front of the mirror i do have to say that the rooms are well appointed and the beds very comfortable we did have an issue with the;3
we were quite content with our stay at the jane until we woke up with bed bug bites all over i know this is something that could happen anywhere but the response from management was disappointing but the staff who helped with our luggage were very friendly and helpful rooms were clean and so were the shared bathrooms and the location of the hotel was very good had we not had the bed bugs experience we would probably have recommended this place due to good value for money;3
when this was the radison they had a fabulous restaurant and well attended bar now its barely worth looking at the menus they also have a sort of cafe take away bar which is ok but not what you would expect from an upmarket hotel so much about the lax airport and local hotels seems to be resting on the faded laurals of the local movie industry a bit run down old and characterless when you turn up on the shuttle bus there is no porter so you have to struggle the best you can to get in the door when checking out and you ask for a trolley a porter emerges with it obviously he lives in the cupboard with the trolley and only seems to want to bring luggage from your room but no to it weird;3
nothing really special here the pool is much smaller than it appears online but at least they have a pool so no complaints here first room smelled like moldmildew and they promptly changed me to a new room concierge is very helpful overall for the price i just expected more but like i said nothing really special just an average hotel with a pool i would return again but only for the pool ny doesnt have very many hotel pools;3
elevator was out of order when i arrived and the staff didnt offer to help me with my luggage as i climbed the stairs to the auxiliary elevator but to their credit they listened to my concern and offered me two comps to a continental breakfast its a nice enough hotel with cheaper room rates than their neighbors if you want a no frill clean room youll be fine here just not excited;3
the aperance of this hotel isnât lovely and the bar area is beautiful however there isnât enough seating area for the amount of guest in the hotel if you go down to the bar and there are no seats available then no one will serve you you just get ignored the main focus is the bar area i felt that the rooms are slightly more neglected the room we stayed in was average and freezing there was a draft coming through the window we had no heating control over the room we went in winter expected it to be cold but we couldnât even warm up in the room i wouldnât recommend this hotel just because of the temperature in the room you shouldnât have to wear your coat on the bedroom just to stay warm;3
hi during my stay at ameritania i had to go to the front desk to acquire ice the representative first brought me a bucket of ice water i then replied that i only wanted ice he returned with a bag of ice i next inquired about where my bucket was another representative replied that it would be brought to my room it never was the wifi also stopped working before my checkout was completed;3
waited for almost 30 minutes to be attended to receptionist very rude to the guest in front of me and very loud stayed for 2 days but no prior message to alert me that there were no room service because of the weather and not enough house keeping staff to clean the room;3
great location tiny rooms tick tock restuarant poor food and cold to tablelobby very busy and small not enough desk staff but very easy acess to subways and times squareand shopping and good places to eat;3
fortunately we used hilton points to cover the room cost as this hotel is vastly over priced the rooms are fine but no better than previous economy hotels we stayed at it the la area this hotel charge for everything 25 per day for parking breakfast is an additional cost at appox 22 plus tax and tips per head even the bottle water in the room was 350 the only thing this hotel has going for it is the close location to universal studios but on hindsight i would stay else where staybridge suites for example and pay 15 to park at universal please also note the porters claim you are not allowed to use the trolleys to move your bags health and safety rubbish and push for tips;3
the hotel has let itself go over the past few years but the roof top and the location make it worth a stay pros its right next to the subway station walking distance to many amazing locations next to central park a 24hr drugstore and a starbucks cons hotel needs some updating no hot tub and wifi and coffee in your room is an additional charge;3
right in the heart of nyc most of what we did was within easy walking distance it was fun and exciting stay for the entire family staff were attentive to our very need;3
great location very small room and bathroom with two luggages inside the room can hardly walk and theres a incidental charge upon check in higher floors has better views you can hear siren the whole night maybe its near some hospital or fire station staffs were friendly and its a great experience haha never stayed in such small hotel before and so antique feel;3
the location was convenient to penn station which meant i only had to drag my bag a couple of blocks otherwise its an avenue and a couple blocks from the 123 and an additional avenue over to the nqr which is decently convenient as well the room was definitely not anywhere youd want to hang out for an extended period of time just enough room for a bed and nightstand with a tiny sink just outside of the bathroom aka a very small close with a toilet and shower head it was perfectly fine for sleeping but overall just a very basic experience also there is no elevator but the front desk helped me get my bag up to my room;3
this hotel is so well located across the street from lincoln center even if rooms are small but the staff gets a gold star i was snowed in and they scrambled to find me a room despite a fully booked hotel thankfully there was a cancellation service like that can brighten an older property also the restaurant is terrific;3
the lobby is obviously the focus of this hotel impressive decor and obviously famous for its role in gossip girl the rooms however are standard tiny and if your one of the unlucky ones are dark and dingy due to lack of sunlight from and inward view of the hotel we were next to a generator which was constantly noisy and normally iâm not bothered and can sleep through noise but with this and the old air con unit going which is completely necessary or else itâs wayyyy too stuffy and hot i had the worst 4 night sleep in a long time the rooftop bar is cool and the location is great subways close by but we opted to walk everywhere overall i would not return here unless i got a really good deal i know visiting new york isnât all about the hotel as you hardly use it other;3
a bit pricey not noisy bring your own bottled water room water bottles are overpriced on site restaurant food is great no need to pay 33 for the buffet menu items are really good desk is not the best for working with laptop so dont expect to get much done there;3
the best thing about this property is the location and the lobby room was small 2 full beds with one tiny window that wasnt an issue however i dont think the room had been dusted in months there was dust on the walls and doors the beds were clean but not comfortable im glad we were there for only one night the staff was amazingly pleasant the art deco style was beautiful;3
we had a private room for 5 nights it was clean and comfortable with a nice bathroom the room was small and a bit hot in the summer friendly helpful staff and clean laundry area we had a nice little fridge and crockery and cutlery in the room which was very convenient very close to the tube and bus station;3
pros nice hotel clean rooms friendly staff free wifi fridge in the room great breakfast cons location the hotel is not in hollywood but in little armenia a neighboorhood that is a bit sketchy also they charge you 20night for parking ok hotel but next time ill get something within walking distance to nice reaturants etc;3
i loved the location mass transportation real close times square just seven blocks away now for the roomvery disappointing too small two beds that are too big for the room a closet that was too deep i would say this room was bare bones just one painting on the walls the television was too small the direct tv kept going out of service the photos that are shown on this website are not representative of the room i stayed in the biggest downer was the construction across the street that was going on at all hours of the night there were nights i couldnât sleep i acknowledge thatâs not the hotelâs fault but still there are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area as well as a couple 711s and cvs but i couldnât find a really nice restaurant nearby the;3
i stayed at this property about six years ago in a suite provided by a vendor overall i thought it was amazing on this trip not so much as a hilton diamond member i was upgraded to the executive floor as i rode up in the elevator i was excited about what might await me i was disappointed the executive floor room was no different from what you would find at a substantially less expensive property think holiday inn express it was a basic room with two fullsized not queen beds the bath was nice and spacious i entered the room to find a maintenance man standing on the desk spackling a ceiling hole that he said a previous guest had left he was polite apologetic and quickly cleaned up the area and left the first thing that i noted was that that toilet;3
i have nothing inherently bad to say about morningside inn very conveniently close to the subways and easy to walk up and down broadway it had great scenery in the neighborhood the hotel itself was pretty basic just a bed dresser and tv which was all i needed the bathroom and the toiletries are things that could be upgraded a bit but overall my experience wasnt bad;3
the room looked out onto another room enabling us to see and be seen directly by other customers the aircon and heating system caused me and my fiance to have a few respitory problems the location of the hotel was very good and really close to what we wanted to see good location ok execution;3
the hilton los angeles universal city is in a great location if you are going to universal studios and plan to eat all of your meals in the park or in universal city walk for that reason the hotel commands an expensive per night rate however if i am going to pay this rate i would expect better upkeep the bathroom faucet squirted all over the sink area the fold open doors to the tv cabinet kept closing while watching the tv the coffee pot kept shutting off prematurely and the most frustrating part of the experience is the elevators are extremely slow many of the indicator lights are burnt out so you do not know if the elevator is going up or down and you dont know what floor youre on unless you stick your head out and read the lettering on the side of the doors;3
we stayed here for 4 nights in september when we attended nyc fashion week not as models it was an excellent location but dont expect to find using the lifts easy as we often had to wait five minutes for a lift i know the hotel was full because of fashion week but it was pretty ridiculous and i dont mind walking downstairs so long as they are well signposted and you dont have to walk through a laundry areaservice area to get out into the lobby nothing special but a good location the bar was nice and they had no qualms about swapping a glass of champagne when i thought it was flat which was good of them;3
we stayed there only 1 night and the hotel was ok good quick reception nice room location was good for the closest proximity of airport but far from city center shuttle to airport available for 170 for 1 night 2 persons it was ok;3
stayed at the hilton check in was at 400 and we got there at 230 because we were afraid of the traffic we are hhilton members and they told us check in is not till 400 and to come back we went to universal citywalk and came back at 430 and the room was ready my husband needed the luggage rack and was told he was not allowed to have it in self parking the valet guy had to take the luggage rack down with my husband to the parking area and get the bags and then take them to our room so the first tip in the wallet was given then my daughter has allergies and wanted a snack i realized there are no microwaves in the room i took the popcorn to the front desk and asked where or who could pop the bag the front desk said nobody can but for 20 you can rent the;3
as a hyatt globalist i was disappointed with my experience worst regency club experience iâve had the female attendant was less than friendly the food offerings were a joke especially in the evening some soda was locked during the day and i had to ask several times to have the cooler unlocked to get ginger ale the restaurant bar service was a mess although the manager was trying the kitchen was failing sure hope things get better;3
stayed in the new yorker during a recent visit to new york with my daughter bedroom had new curtains and new bedstead bed was extremely comfortable and room was clean very good location bathroom was very shabby mould all around bath and soap holder very mouldy smell from water coming out of hot and cold taps in bath i have never stayed anywhere where bathwater smelled like this very unpleasant as we had to bathe and shower frequently due to temperature outside washhand basin and toilet clean and air con very effective i am giving low score due to shabby smelly and tired bathroom i did not expect this from such a well known hotel needs more upgrading you think it will be nice when you step into beautiful foyer disappointing;3
the positives excellent location 2 mins from tube station clean tidy room nice courtyard to sit out in value for money as in cheap kind of cheerful the negetatives the room was not as pictured there was no small table chairs to sit at the room was tiny just enough room for the beds fridge cupboard our room no7 was literally next door to reception and was a nightmare the luggage room was opposite so was a constant stream of people cominggoing all night therefore almost no sleep for 2 nights we heard every conversation in fact at times felt like we were in the same room so if offered either no 7 or 8 room keys just say no maybe higher floors would be better;3
were a couple who looked up prices for hotels on pricelinecom we had previously booked through them but decided to call days inn directly and ask them if they could give us a better deal we ended up saving 60 for 2 nights and we booked the night before so much for the priceline myth pertaining to having the best prices we were delightfully surprised by the free parking in the vicinity surrounding the hotel and the proximity to the subway a 2 min walk and the ride a mere 10 minutes to midtown in fact we didnt even have to circle the block to find parking we found a free spot a block away just be aware of the alternate side parking due to street sweeping some manhattan garages charge 40 dollars a day so we saved over a 100 dollars just with that the people at;3
felt like a mix between a hotel and hostel with shared bathroom and separate bedroom the bedroom environment felt like a hostel the bed was not very comfortable but the room was decent size for a hostel and small for a hotel the budgetplacescom website charges a separate fee 50 extra from what is listed on the website as the price to stay here;3
i was in nyc last week at the new yorker a wyndham hotel my credit card was asked for incidentals which i had no intention of using the other hotel facilities it was fine i was told the next day that a facility charge would come off my card i had paid for this upfront via my travel agent after speaking with two front desk staff it was confirmed that no charge was made to the card the issue was with the gentleman at the front desk he was dismissive and abrupt when i asked about this definately not good customer servise he said on a few occations next the room was generally clean but i did find hairs in the bath and sink which was disappointing the cleaning staff were polite and friendly i stayed at the the new yorker a wyndham hotel previously and found it;3
the new yorker serves as a hotel dorm meeting place and office space our daughter was staying in the dorm for the fall semester and we arrived a couple days early as i wanted to see new york decorated for the holidays we were given an executive room on the 8th floor this floor has been recently remodeled the room was very clean it was on the small side but honestly you are in new york who stays in there room the bed was supposed to be a queen but we believe it was a double it could have used some updating as we rolled towards the middle of the mattress the bathroom was modern but could use a modification of the shower the shower had a spray hand shower that was at a height of probably over 6 feet there was nowhere for it to be moved to a shorter height this made;3
there are lots of bellhops in funny hats amazingly campy decor and a calendar behind the registration desk that reads april 35 all very wes anderson but the actual details of running a hotel didnt quite interest the management had to call the front desk four times to get towels the big draw was the bar with loud thumpy music and overpriced drinks appealing to steampunk fans perhaps facing the river you also get the west side highway noise which is considerable we were in a captains room 300night so wanted service to be a little sharper;3
after an exhaustive search we found this hotel in our price range it was really affordable for the excellent location just a stones throw from central park you can also pick up a bus or subway entrance within 2 blocks there was a great coffee shop nearby as well clean white duvets pleasant lobby and staff now the downside there were absolutely no extras here no complimentary breakfast i never found a nice machine despite being given a bucket we had towels but no washcloths the carpets were filthy the ac was a small outdated window unit so the room felt hot and stuffy the bathroom was way too cramped for three guests to get in and out of there is an elevator but two people with one suitcase each will be stuffed like sardines we had to wait a long time for;3
hotel positives location comfy bed fresh linen and towels daily decent size double room air con good safe negatives the hotel is majority student accommodation so the lifts are a nightmare so busy and loud noise busy lifts shower boiling or freezing no in between really old decor broken plug on bath 300 dollar deposit for 7 day stay;3
the neighborhood is nice it has pharmacies supermarkets and cafes nearby the metro is about five minutes walking the staff is friendly it has free wifi in the lobby area the room was small and clean my only complain is the mattress it was noisy and felt like sleeping on a hammock;3
a very well located hotel clean with friendly helpful staff its starting to show its age in places and a refurb would be welcome however it is clean and housekeeping good a great location just off columbus circle and the no1 subway line we would stay again;3
this huge hotel was very busy when i checkedin on december 31st in time for new years eve 2016 times square ball drop on that same night i paid a nonrefundable standard queen room with guaranteed views of either empire state building manhattan skyline with freedom towerone world trade center or hudson river at the time i checkedin it was still early around noontime but front desk staff gave a room on the 26th floor and remind me that i can proceed around 3pm as this is the standard checkin time around 3pm i went to my room and found out that my room faced another huge building and has no view i went down and told her the situation and annoyed me by asking what view i want as she is working with hotel for more than 20 years or so and she knows what she have given me;3
this is a basic no frills hotel situated opposite central park between 106th w and 107th w street you need this precise address for the cab it is some way from times square but the pleasant and quiet neighbourhood ensured that we had a good nights sleep without the noise of traffic and wailing sirens all night long we actually woke to the twittering of birds the room was adequate with two large beds these would be 2 double beds in the uk a small tv and a good size bathroom with a large bathtub and shower the air conditioning is the typical american one clamped to the window and can be noisy if you need to keep it on all night we could not get the shower nor the wall sockets to work but this was soon put right with a demonstration by the very helpful and;3
when i booked this trip i thought the hotel was close to many tourist attractions however it was quite outoftheway and you needed a minimum of 30 min by public transit it get to main activities in hollywood etc the metro was very close subway buses which helped and getting a day or week pass was economical for the metro the hotel is outdated but clean and the staff helpful the breakfast was filling we did not use the pool fitness room or convenience store but it was nice to have them our room was small with no closet which took some adjustment complimentary wifi was available in the room which was great the room was cleaned each day i appreciated how the front desk staff printed out directions to local attractions including bus times;3
hotel is comfortable rooms are clean good tv selection near metro station but car rental service afiliated to hotel very expensive bad cars only 100miles incl also parking cost at hotel 24 usd per day this is a total rip off;3
we stayed here for the new year we had a room on the 12th floor basic room and it was so hot in there and the air conditioning sounded like a jet engine no fridge in room either the hotel has seen better days and the lifts were very dirty we were happy with the location but disappointed with the hotel;3
the hotel is in a great location and that is probably the only good thing that i would highlight about this room i was visiting new york this past winter and decided to stay at the empire hotel the hotel itself isnt very big but not small either the rooms were really cramped and very outdated the heater barely worked and i couldnt regulate the room temperature i had to have the heater on but the window open as well to get some sort of a balance the hallways were also very outdated and old all in all the hotel was in a really good location but for the price that they are charging i would not stay there again if you shop around a bit you will definitely find newer hotels for around the same price;3
we stayed here before going on a cruise we used our wyndham points to book a metro room room has 2 double beds and we normally see queen size anymore room an ok size but we did add a rollaway bathroom showed its age quite small staff friendly and two restaurants on site;3
we stayed at the new yorker end august 2017 on our first visit to new york the lobby was very modern and very busy and in a great central location we got checked in fairly quickly and upgraded to a view of the water which you could just see from the window if you squinted the room and corridors look a bit tired and could def do with a lick of paint the room itself had 2 small double beds and a small dated bathroom the hot water for shower was extremely hot you had to turn it on slightly would have benefited from a kettle had we known they were not provided would have bought one with us saying that the room was clean and our beds made every day we did have to ring down to reception one eve due to the swearing in the next room my 13 year old could hear every;3
as fans of the tv show gossip girl we decided to treat ourselves to a stay at the empire where many scenes of the show were filmed for or our first visit to new york when we arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon our room was still not ready so we sat around in the lobby for a while when we eventually got the keys to the room to our disappointment the room was small and had a few flaws the bed was made with sheets that had holes in them and the doona cover consisted of two flats sheets â one above and one below the doona the aircon barely worked one of the shower doors was missing and the fittings in the bathroom were falling out of the wall the hallways in the hotel on our floor smelt strongly of marijuana and given what we had paid for the room per night this is not;3
i recently stayed here for two nights the hotel is modern but the rooms are small and the staff is so so ac was broken and needed tone fixed and the room was never made up during the day we were compensated in no way but thankfully the ac was fixed;3
we stayed at the empire on recommendations of friends who had stayed there before the staff were very friendly and helpful and the dã©cor design of the hotel is really nice the location is also great just opposite the lincoln centre unfortunately we were on the top floor and our room was boiling hot the air conditioning unit didnt work very well and was very very noisy when we did switch it on so it couldnt be used during the night as we couldnt sleep because of the noise when we opened the window it was warm air that was coming in as no air was circulating in the small space outside our room basically overlooked other peoples rooms opposite us no view and there was a very narrow courtyard inbetween where no cool air was circulating after our 2nd night i;3
nice looking room and common areas great location for lax connections the food service in the bar was horrid slow and slower and the bar was only half full one of the burgers was completely botched requested items not delivered to room broken hand held shower;3
stayed with my wife over christmas great location could not fault it easy walk to subway stations central park and times square good sized room we were on the 12th floor street facing corner however view was undesirable looking down onto neighbouring roofs and water towers the room was always very hot even when you set the aircon to cool and the temperature all the way down one of the windows wouldnt stay open and we had to prop open with a book to try and cool the room down the hotel itself is a bit run down badly fitted windows and you can tell they have cut corners on a recent update especially in the bathrooms we had plumbing issues with the sink after use it would need 15 minutes to drain for simple tasks like washing hands the beds were comfortable;3
our flight was delayed so we arrived around midnight thoroughly exhausted to find we had been allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the one we booked on the website there were no drawers at all and only a tiny wardrobe with no shelves as we were at the beginning of a 12 day stay in nyc and new jersey we had hoped to be able to unpack we complained and the night manager said he would write a note for the morning staff in the morning we took it up with the day staff who said they would be able to let us know if there was another room about 2pm and gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers when we came back we were shown to a very pleasant room with storage facilities so we took that one and enjoyed our stay from that point on the doormen hello jeff are;3
i stayed at the days hotel for a couple of days on a business trip although the hotel looks a little oldish at first sight and could do with some renovation indeed it was actually rather quiet and comfortable rooms are spacious and clean and include standard amenities and a large safe bathroom as well old but clean enough the shower had a slight tendency to pulse hot and cold water though the neighbourhood is safe and there is a subway station 96th street conveniently located one block away there are also many restaurant to choose from for dinner in the area on the downside as mentionned in an earlier review the heating system can be a little noisy at night and their free wifi was pretty weak a real struggle to make video calls overall the hotel is quite;3
i was extremely disappointed to be charged 27 per day facilities fee yes that is true it is in the fine print of the priceline terms and conditions that there may be additional fees such as a resort fee or parking charges this hotel is not a resort and i was not planning to park the amenities provided are free local calls use of the business center and excercise room these are basic services that are included in most 3star and all 4star hotels i feel like i was deceived on the other hand the service and location are still top notch;3
nice location next to lincoln center room was noisy and hot they moved us the second night and i turned off the ac and openned a window it was a bit cooler then the breakfast was expensive and not all that good;3
great location next to madison square garden several subway lines run under the hotel macys path train station times square is less than 10 min walk amazing history of the building with stunning art deco interior however our twin room was a bit small and the double beds are short though the matress was perfectly firm for me there was no kettle in the room to make tea or coffee in the morning staff was profiessional but when i complained about the smoke smell in the bathroom and about the draught around the window they coldly apologized and that was it paying the 2900 facilites fee is a bit much if you have to pay for leaving your luggage there after check out that 200 per suitcase could be really covered from the facitilies fee;3
spent one night at this hotel in a standard king room for nyc the room was quite spacious we were both able to do our stretches at the same time room had a closet with enough hangers and there was room for our bags as well bathroom was big enough for one person to fit comfortably the walls were thick we didnt hear noise from corridor and new windows kept out most street noise we were on the 4th floor overlooking 94th street bed was comfortable and room was clean tv worked well but was an old style staff friendly and seemed eager to help had one small issue in the room and engineering came quickly and we were offered another room but stayed put coffee was good in am the elevators were very small and very busy at times we didnt try the stairs because;3

hotel is conveniently located at lax and near highway 405 rooms are large and contain all the comfort needed beds are great prices for parking are however exorbitant also the cost of a breakfast is exagerated taking into account these extras the hotel is definitively not the best value when visiting la;3
myself and the family were really disappointed with this hotel such a disappointment after taking the time to review it on trip advisor the hotel is located on the edges of universal estate and is on its own because of this we were a little taken a back by having to pay an additional 24 per night to park as there was no other option hidden charges the room was dark with little natural light it smelt of stale smoke the air con did not work making the room hot at times it was a decent size and the decor a little tired the hotel lifts were undergoing work during our visit so lengthy waits to come down were the norm the hotel buffet options were pricey and did not look appealing we arrived via las vegas where for the same price the quality was far;3
location of this hotel is great you can easily walk to most of central manhattan tourist spots concierges were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for them this is a noisy hotel but only due to new york being a noisy city we stayed on the 6th floor and werent aware of any noise other than the outside traffic etc the walls are paper thin and you do have to hope that you have considerate neighbours other reviews mention the towels shower etc housekeeping are only to happy to issue more towels and yes the shower splashes but if you use the bath mat provided you dont get a puddle on the floor if youre looking for a traditional hotel then this isnt the one for you but on the whole a good hotel for nyc;3
we stayed here in august for four nights clean comfortable rooms albeit a little on the small side breakfast was plentiful and a good variety the only real concern i had was that the area seemed a little dodgy and you did have to walk at least two or three blocks for evening dining which we didnt feel very comfortable with other than that it was pretty good;3
when we traveled here everything was great but our fridge didnât work and our kids milk turned causing her to get sick it took 30 mins for new sheets during the night it was tough because we had kids trying to sleep and had to wait we wanted to heat some food for our youngest but it was 2000 to use the microwave seems like an excessive chargeâ¦;3
this hotel is in a prime location for subway walking and some low cost alternatives like starbucks mcdonalds and famiglia pizza the restaurants at the hotel are not necessarily costly given its nyc but more costly than the average person would spend the staff are all courteous and there were people at a desk to help with information such as how to get someplace the closest place for dessert etc rooms were clean but small there is no coffee pot microwave or refrigerator but a 30 resort fee the fee and taxes totaled 60 additional per night this is common in nyc not just this hotel so buyer beware for a fee i was able to check in early check out is at noon which is a bonus we walked or took the subway everywhere penn station is right next door long;3
the beds were small in a room for 4 the pool was closed and we only knew it the day before we arrived you have to pay for the wifi while the starbucks just below has free wifi the hotel is well located very close to central park the hotel is ok but for the price we expect more at least the service for which we paid;3
im from suburbia where the hotels are expansive and paying tourists are hard to come by so i got in the room and was a little shocked at the size but it was immaculately clean had a view to a courtyard where you could see some ritzy folks pool and you could spy on superheros smoking cigarettes i did run into a guy on the way to the restroom without pants but he was clean and nice despite his lack of attire and looked more terrified than i was at our meeting bathrooms were sterile but smelled unpleasantly like bleach but better bleach than something a little more organic i got scalded by the hot water twice then learned to take shorter showers mornings i awoke to a string serenade my neighbor apparently practiced the violin 7 hours a day at least he was in tune so;3
we booked a family suite for august having received an email for an upgrade i emailed the hotel directly and had it confirmed for a family terrace suite on arrival we were told there was no terrace suites available despite showing the confirmation we were given a refund of the resort fees 150 which im still waiting for btw we stayed in the family suite in room 731 decent room and clean but the two queen beds are more like small double bedsthe pull out sofa was bigger and pretty comfy to be fair so no issues with that coffee maker fridge in the room and the coffee pods and 2 bottles of water were topped up daily were free proper steam iron in the room which was good hair dryer also provided the bathroom was very small even though the shower was a good;3

we are a family of 5 and spent 6 nights at the hollywood the staff and the amenities were great however we reserved a car with advantage cars 4 days prior to needing it to drive to vegas on the day we were supposed to get it the young man informed us he had let our car out i understand accidents happen but this young man wouldnt do anything to even try to rectify the problem and being easter sunday all local car rentals were closed so we had to catch the subway and the bus to lax to rent a car this man was extremely arrogant and rude i would have given hotel hollywood 5 stars if it wasnt for advantage;3
service is average new york style no fuss no warm smiles no small talk room is cramped elevators are tightcramped and slow one out of 4 elevator was not functioning when i was there but the bed sheets in the room are clean i didnt get any allergies as i am asthmatic toiletwashroom needs more cleaning though the lobby cushion seats are ripped and needs reupholstering i dont like the smell of their air freshener which is too musky upon entering the room location far from a lot of attractions since its at the upper west side area but subway is just 2 blocks away so if you dont mind walking or the subway should be fine there is free wifi at the lobby and free wifi in the rooms which i enjoyed everyday no breakfast but cafes are just nearby no;3
the hotel foyer is very grand but our room for three people was tiny not enough space for cases let alone walking from the beds to the bathroom very disappointed on two days the room was not cleaned i emailed the hotel with pictures of the dust on the tv screen and units but had no acknowledgement room keys had to redone by reception several times this was infuriating as the reception staff was not very helpful and rather unpleasant door men were very pleasant internet charge was a scandal and really unreliable made to pay for a service which never worked the only good thing about the hotel was the location great for getting round new york;3
pros location is very convenient to los felizecho park and good for hollywood pleasant and helpful staff breakfast is good and its open a long time decent retro atmosphere some nice nooks to read in clean cons expensive parking dated decor and one of our fixtures was cracked a few infrastructure issues tv kept cutting out a big deal for kids;3
beside the dark hallways smelly room low quality bathroom it is a good value and central location to stay walking distance to hop on hop off buses shopping food and subway employees are very helpful and courteous;3
the location close to a subway station and central park is the best thing about it more positives the bed was good and it was calm the shower worked and in the end we didnt spend much time in the room the room and at least our floor was in great need of renovation the hairdryer didnt work which i reported and i was told someone would fix it but that never happened during the week we stayed there the hotel was included in a british airways deal and therefore we had expected it to be better;3
we stayed here for 4 nights the hotel is in a lovely building in a great location right near madison square gardens and penn station we stayed at this hotel as we found a great deal on love holidays that we couldnt turn down and it did the job for what we needed it for check in was pleasant and the staff were lovely we had to pay 180 deposit which was fine and we were assured we would get that money back once we left the room in good condition we took the elevator up to the 28th floor and found our room the room was quite small smaller than expected we had booked a queen room and the bed certainly was not queen sized but it was very comfy there was general wear and tear to the room and could probably do with being fixed up a little but who really cares youre not;3
a stay at the new yorker is not a cheap experience even with a booking site it was clean but limited no in room fridgeand the room while clean is small with paper thin walls ideal for staying in nyc because of location the staff is friendly and considerate which made the stay bearable if you are looking for a centrally located space with limited amenities this is your place;3
have the front desk verify your email address â our room wasnât ready when we checked in but they said weâd get an email half hour later we checked and the room was ready but no email same with the receipt at checkout no email four days after checkout reason was they had it entered incorrectly breakfast was not worth 25 sinks in rooms are too small valet stole a bottle of wine and wine tote out of our car;3
pleasant large clean room for family of 4 with 2 teens with 2 queen beds excellent breakfast included in room price with omelet and waffle station pool area is small but charming would be a nice respite on a hot afternoon exploring los angeles cute little patio area in the center of hotel basic exercise room with a couple of cardio machines gated parking area which i would recommend paying for because the area seemed a little sketchy also would not recommend walking in the area at night our room was on the 1st floor off of the entry hall and i would not recommend staying on that level but i got a great deal on hotwire for the room and we were only there for one night so i did not complain all in all a good place to stay on a budget while youre exploring;3
this hotel was a little bit away from most of the attractions but a simple subway ride each morning made it easily accessible the room itself had a superking bed but wasnt a large room in any way but then most rooms in ny arent too big anyway we stayed here for 4 nts in dec and the only problem we had was with the bathroom almost flooding when we flushed the loo after complaining this was sorted eventually a plus point for us was the view lovely to get up in the morning and watch folks out jogging dogwalking etc and in dec there is a massive hut across the road selling christmas trees and holly wreaths which just reminds you of the wonderful time of year it is returning in the evening we either used our free pass from the hop on hop off buses or got a cab we;3
my stay at the jane hotel was for 5 nights i was near the bathroom and heard the hand dryer throughout the night which was very annoying but not enough to ask to move dont stay here if youre looking for the comforts of home because you wont find it this is a very low maintenance place the rooms are smaller than i thought with enough room to move along side a small twin bed which also isnt the most comfortable bed i thought the community bathroom was going to be a pain but i never once had to wait for a shower or toilet and there was always quit a bit of traffic i was surprised at how many people were staying there my bed was made daily but my towels were never replaced and i had to ask for a fresh set the second day in to which the staff members were very;3
the only good things about this property could be the pricing and location which is near to the train station requested a low floor room but given a high floor instead theres no lift and i have to drag my luggage all the way up to the 5th floor which was quite a hassle theres no window blinds in the bathroom and its exposed to anyone from the outside the water pressure also very low and dont really enjoy the shower breakfast was not included in the price the same goes to wifi people smokes within the property and at times i felt suffocated;3
the place and price point was great but the bed was super soft and so although i didnt get a great night sleep i would give it a second chance because it was clean convenient and service great be aware that we stayed in a room the size of a closet but that was no problem as we were hardly in it;3
the room was ridiculously small bathroom even smaller and a bit dusty however we were not in nyc for the room it served its purpose fyi snacks in room are outrageously priced and keurig coffee pods are 300 each;3
we stayed at the new yorker mid february being a family of 4 ill give an honest review im a uk travel agent so im used to reviewing and staying in many hotels i had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when i booked firstly the good the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere thats about it as far as the positive the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room this room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed with another 47 dollars a night resort fees;3
the best feature of this former sro building is its location you simply cannot get closer to lincoln center as it across the street in addition with a few decent restaurants around one could argue that this is a serious hotel to consider if you have business on the upper westside i have stayed here more than twice but i must confess that i wanted to wait until i had a better experience i cannot forget room 139 which okay was so small it was silly but there was no air or heat unit although it faced one outside that is the view if you are suffocating and cannot open anything you get a feeling that you are in a coffin albeit a pretty and designed one the use of space is so smart because if you really think about it these rooms are very very small the front desk;3
we stayed there for three nights in room 971 the rooms was dusty and had a musty smell they would not provide house keeping you had to call every day for clean towels and additional toiletries i thought i had gotten a mosquito bite while i was sleeping but after i arrived home i realized i had bed bug bitesthree raised itchy bumps right in a row on my shoulder;3
so ill start by saying the hotel has tons of potential but it feels held back because of the price you pay for the location the bathrooms are very cramped and noticed odd smells the beds are way more firm than expected and overall it was a good experience with everything except the actual room;3
pros close location for people who like to stay in hollywood area a lot of restaurants and retail around the hotel very good rates on third party websites like hotwire gated and spacious parking complimentary breakfast serving omelets cereals fruits bread cons expensive parking you can find hotels cheaper than 22day for parking no complimentary water in the room staff advice the guest not to use vending machines on site as they wont refund your money in case the machine took your money and gave you nothing house keeping did not change the bed sheets even when instructed to do so by me and by hotel staff the most important no ac the vent blow fan air it was really hot and difficult to sleep very noisy beds that keep squeaking when;3
location was great view was an awful brick wall room was tiny and a bit dingy the location for us was the highlight of the trip during the spring it allowed us to walk everywhere we went without the extra cost of cabs always a plus ð;3
i have stayed at this hotel twice not because it is particularly good but because it is across the street from lincoln center so if you are an operaballetsymphony buff its very convenient the rooms are quirky and although some things are great like the beds and linens other things are so badly designed that they almost dont functionlike the bathroom we had a junior suite and the bathroom was quite small and had no hooks or bars to hang a towelrobe except those inside the shower the shower had no door just a half wall so whenever either of us took a shower the bathroom floor inevitably got water on it no matter how careful we were the shelves in the bathroom were nice but a sink more than 4 inches deep would have been useful also the sink and fixtures;3
i stayed 4 nights at this hotel by myself and was sceptical given the reviews the concierge was pleasant at check in given it was 1am in the morning and i was given a room on the 6th floor and handed a piece of paper with details of the wifi codes i took the elevator to the floor and it was a challenge to find my room the hallway was dimly lit and the numbering was all over but eventually i found it upon entering my room the air conditioning was on full blast so it was freezing and the radio had been left on there were 2 double beds and other furniture a closet and the bathroom was tiny you tripped over the toilet to get to the bath i noticed the window blinds were broken and the curtains did not draw and were just for show i immediately called reception and asked;3
great location on broadway in the center of manhattan place to sleep and rest and go on the town;3
the rooms are really small the temperature control is dicey and the lobby is very dark however you cannot beat the location if you are going to lincoln center it is literally across the street location location location;3
my room was not just small but tiny also my view was a wall i had no real place to rest my bag without blocking my ability to get around also my suit and dress shirts did not fit in the closet the check in took for ever and i even had to wait for check out the room had one nice touch of a nespresso also the bed was comfortable for almost 400 per night i would have expected more;3
i came across morningside inn as me and a friend were visiting new york for a week and we needed somewhere fairly cheap to stay but still wanted to be in manhattan this hotelhostel isnt as close to times square as wed like but its not too far there are plenty of subways nearby which makes this place easy to travel from the hotel its self done just the job for me but i dont think some people would be impressed i wouldnt say theres anything majorly wrong with this place but the interior is a bit worn and old my worn and old i just mean small things which most likely wouldnt bother people including myself like a lot of loses screws in door latches ceiling fans towel rails ect if you touch something theres a good chance is going to move or seem like youre about;3
this hostel is on the upper west side of ny which is considered the rich part of manhattan i had the budget single room which had a fulldbl size bed mini fridge sink with no mirror small dresser small closet and tv which didnt work i paid like 80night total for three nights came to 270 and the room size was perfect for me since i traveled solo i was right next to the bathroom in the hall so that was a plus also i didnt have to walk down the hall or far from my room i had two issues with this hotel the first was that i booked this through www agodacom and when i went to confirm my reservation the day before my arrival the hotel didnt have me in the system luckily the front desk person wendy was nice and she said that they have plenty of rooms and;3
we stayed here for one night in aug 2005 katrina weekend actually the friendly front desk upgraded us to a onebedroom suite when we mentioned it was our anniversary parking is around the corner in a public lot and costs typical nyc rates our room was showing its age and the ac unit in the window dripped all night so we constantly thought it was raining the room was clean but rather old we had a pleasant stay and got a great bargain but i wouldnt rave about the place and more recent reviews sound like its gone downhill;3
the empire hotel is good for its central location close to lincoln center columbus circle and central park many starbucks and convenience stores are in the immediate vicinity as well one of the best food trucks for breakfast the rooftop bar is very nice too on the downside the standard room was on the small side the ac rattling very loudly;3
this hotel is way past its prime time and judging by our room it is in urgent need of refurbishment perhaps other floors are better there was absolutely no room to move around bathrooms need updating toiletriesbetter bring your own lifts dont work well takes forever to get into one having said that we had a great view upgraded view room staff were helpful wifi worked pretty well its decent value and the location is very central for breakfast try best beigels and coffee on 36th street one of ny best beigel shops;3
we got this property for 120night plus priceline fees if you want an upper w side property the location is excellent at checkin they suggested a room on the top floor based on previous tripadvisor reviews about the heat up there we declined and got a 5th floor inside room checkin with emanuel was quick smooth and efficient as it was an inside room there was no view and very little light from outside too there was no noise from outside which was nice there was very loud noise coming from the pipes at odd intervals it sounded a bit like someone was trying to break into our room through the floor with a cold chisel this occurred every hour or two for a little while also the bathroom plumbing would make noises at times the bathroom was tiny even by nyc;3
the location of the hotel is great close to central park 5th avenue and two subway stations the rooms however are incredibly outdated windows not closing broken shower etc ok if you are not staying in the city longer than 23 nights;3
i had stayed here previously and had an excellent experience the first time but this time was pretty dreadful the first night checkin took an hour because of a down system this also caused other problems like not being able to reenter room and not being recognized as hhonors they botched my wakeup call on my last morning which caused me problems there was pretty heavy construction in the lobby area right next to the dining area which made eating there an unpleasant experience at breakfast the second day the waiter insisted to me that they didnt carry sugar free syrup even though i had had it the day before otherwise without the problems this is a good place nice room beautiful view right next to universal studios and citywalk and a short;3
we were upgraded on arrival although we have no idea what the other rooms would be like our room was adequate the children shared a twin queen which had a depressing view onto the wall and the air conditioning units in need of some upgrading like double glazing it was charming if not overpriced good location for central park columbus circle and the lincoln center also only ten blocks away from the national history museum and the dakota for beatles fans was just round the corner long walk for central attractions would have stayed further downtown if we had known where we wanted to be or go;3
we decided to stay here as we bought early admission tickets to universal when we arrived it was way to early to check in so instead of charging us the 45 early booking fee they let us check our bags and head over to the city walk for lunch and a bit of shopping after we came back and checked in they helped us up to the room room had an amazing view we rested for a bit then headed to hollywood blvd when we returned we went to the gift shop to get drinks the girl behind the till couldnt be bothered to look up from her phone to help us we went up to the room and learned there were no vending machines on the floor so back to the gift shop i went she was still starring at her phone i took a picture as she ignored me and then went to ask the bell desk as front desk was;3
newly renovated however age still shows though old windows and old ceilings beds are average and could better a bit noise on runway side parking fee is outrageous hotel should have a deal with parking not a racket to gouge you 3040 per day second eve we didnt have water bottles in the room called service was told its not complimentary and 3 bottle so i walked to the parking vending and bought 2 for 1 each then complained to front desk who confirmed it is complimentary and credited my bill 5 nice gesture but that whole experience was unnecessary and unacceptable otherwise the stay was acceptable;3
i really struggled with this review i really like to give five stars when i can but this clearly wasnât five stars i also try to take into account how a place makes me feel iâve given three star hotels five stars based on ambiance and service and given five star hotels less for the same reason this is also for the hotel not the ballroom which iâll review separately but with similar results iâm glad i stayed here itâs historic and quirky and full of neat architecture itâs where the titanic survivors stayed after returning itâs often stated to be part of the wes anderson aesthetic you can get single rooms and bunk rooms that share bathrooms with the floor you can also get the captainâs quarters with a private bath which i did the room was neat and;3
upon arrival the lobby and bar were very nice they have done a good job of refurbishing it but they have done nothing to the bathrooms our bathroom was the size of a closet there was mold everywhere you could not stand in front of the sink because there was no room every time you took a shower the bathroom floor got flooded due to the half shower door the rain shower was useless the rooftop bar was nice but saturday night we had loud people screaming in the hallway slamming doors the location was wonderful we were across from lincoln center central park there are plenty of great restaurants within walking distance;3
despite the surly receptionist this is a reasonable hostel heating on permanently even in 25 degree heat the place is fairly clean plenty of toilets and showers and reasonable communal areas bring ear plugs as walls are thin and if youre in a shared dorm youll probably meet some interesting people;3
we saved 10 years for this trip had an amazing busy fun time in the city we got upgraded on arrival to a king size room on the 8th floor overlooking the main street it was a great sized room with a lovely comfy bed but with a small bathroom inconsistent air con the staff on reception concierge team were all really helpful friendly we received an excellent service great dining travelling tips we were surprised that wifi was not included in the room having visited alot of european cities this was unusual we were alsoshocked by the room extras empire bring your prices down people we pay it 8 for a 75cl bottle of evian really we did choose the hotel because of the roof bar pool but unfortunately after checking both out they were very out;3
this hotel is in a great location penn station is a block away and you can easily walk to many many places such as times square broadway hellâs kitchen etc its in the garment district so if you have a chance definitely take one of mikeâs walking tours anyway back to the hotel we were there for my daughterâs birthday weekend we arrived in the city at 10 am and expected to check our luggage but they had our room ready which was awesome except the bed was super small and there was zero room to walkmove the room was on the 7th floor and tight the owners desk staff was very nice and helpful in getting us switched to a more appropriate room on that floor this wound up being one that had room for a roll away since they said they had no more double beds overall the;3
stayed here for one night while visiting the city for a concert festival we had actually attended a party here in the lobby a few years back and forgot just how great the location was right next to lincoln center and blocks from central park i was able to get our room for a decent saturday night rate in other words expensive anywhere else but moderately digestible for nyc the room was fine no view but comfortable bed with a tiny but updated bath looking closer at anything revealed the wear and tear we hit up the lobby bar after our concert it is a trendy little spot we had a few glasses of wine and some snacks and really enjoyed ourselves we would return overall its a adequate hotel in a great spot;3
excellent location couldnt ask for better small rooms with outdated furniture and very uncomfortable bed that sank in the middle however all staff were very friendly and we did have a great view of broadway from our room upon request;3
the hotel is well place to get to central park and a walk to the major sites the reception is efficient and very welcoming with modern dã©cor our room was on the small size with a curtain across the alcove for the wardrobe the bathroom was again small and you really had to leave to door open to use the facilities the major gripe i had was the use of the teacoffee facilities there was a charge of 3 dollars per use we went to the local shop and purchase coffee and tea and just used the machine anyway also if you want internet in your room again you had to pay for aircon in the room was loud so had to switch it off other these three issues it was ok we didnt eat there so cant what the food was like;3
you cant simply remove the shower door and call it a roman shower there was extensive water damage in the bathroom the view of lincoln center was nice but the noise from the outdoor events was a bit much some heavier curtains would have helped dampen the noise the noise being the only thing the shower didnt dampen;3
hotel is fabulously located however even the inroom coffee is a alacarte the hvac unit in my room was old and noisy and with control buttons universally missing it took me two nights of fitful sleep in a room rendered way too warm before i ventured to putting my finger in to the slots which once housed the buttons to control the unit furthermore the unit clicked loudly every time that the heat stopped waking me up from what was already a fitful sleep hvac unit should be replaced at once;3
the hotel was clean with good beds and quite reasonable if basic facilities it is lovely to see the beautiful art deco features still in place but it needs an upgrade carpets decor and so forth it did the job for four nights but it isnt really that quiet between rooms it is very well placed on eighth avenue so its popular;3
great location the hotel itself is old and it shows it old elevators carpet window ac radiator heating and no view a bit worn around the edges but it was clean bathroom was new water pressure a bit low but water was got tv worked ac worked in room coffee pot iron and ironing board it is ok for what it is and id stay there again for the price and location;3
the hotel is not in the most desirable of areas our first night was in a room overlooking the main road it was extremely noisy and even though we were exhausted from the journey it was close to impossible to sleep the upside was that when we mentioned this the next morning we were moved to a much nicer room that overlooked the inner court the room was much cleaner too when we first arrived we wanted to sit quietly in the bar but that was closed no offer of an alternative and no food either the breakfast was good and plentiful although woe betide anyone who asks for additional scrambled eggs a firm no was the response the weather was very hot when we stayed but the swimming pool was freezing i am not shy of outside pools but this was impossible to get into the;3
the neighborhood isnt that bad and i felt safe even after coming back to my hotel very late at night the staff was friendly and helpful cannot complain there i was a little disappointed in my room but the cost was very low so you get what you pay for the room was very tiny and the bed not as comfortable the decor is usual style nothing fabulous and my balcony faced vermont street not very pretty but i didnt care if you just want a nice place to sleep and dont plan on spending all your time in your room this isnt bad if you plan on staying in your room a lot make sure you get a room by the pool;3
as others have mentioned this hotel is in an ideal mid town location but we found our room to be disappointingly small and in need of updating tired being an apt description we arrived late evening after a flight delay and the receptionist made a show of searching on his computer to find us a good sized room he gave us the impression that hed found one but when we got up there it turned out to be one of the smallest double rooms weve stayed in at the very end of a corridor on the 31st floor only one seat the desk chair and no room to swing the proverbial cat we were by then too tired to argue but quite disappointed one morning we also had the unpleasant experience of brown water coming through the bathroom taps which left the towels and flannels stained when;3
spent the weekend here i cant think of a better location than this walking distance to central park multiple subway stations and times square the service was good personnel always friendly and helpful if something needed however the rooms are missing maintenance and some basic details are very visible;3
i stayed here with my family in june 2014 it is a decent hotel good location for universal studios hollywood blvd etc the rooms were clean and adequate size no bells or whistles the elevators are slow at times but they had employees working the elevators to keep them moving which helped the front desk staff was minimally friendly they never even told us about the complimentary breakfast that others have mentioned in their reviews we saw the buffet but decided to pass we had a little trouble understanding the lady at the front desk who checked us in because she had a very heavy accent everyone else that we came into contact with was very friendly and helpful especially at the bar and lounge area where we ordered pizzas and drinks the one major issue we;3
great location to access universal studios however the walking path doesnt have any signage when i asked i was told to take the shuttle i didnt want to take the shuttle so figured it out on my own checkin wasnt great there were about 6 parties in front of me with 2 checkin stations i waited about 30 minutes to get to someone and that was only because a third station opened when i was the next in line one station had 3 people standing around it so not sure if they were training them but it was very slow i would have used digital key but when i did online checkin i was told i had to go the desk anyway so no real value in digital key no acknowledgement from valet when we drove up if it was ok to leave my car there while we checked in my daughter;3
impressive frontage and well located across the road from the lincoln centre close to columbus circle near by along with central park all within a walk room located on 12 floor was good but needs renovating but is comfortable and tight in space but the view overlooking the lincoln centre and back look down to midtown was outstanding and a highlight heating was noisy as it isolated and needed to be overhauled staff were outstanding and made up for any faults and were perhaps some of the best i came across whilst in new york;3
for central ny probably acceptable but with some care and attention it could be so much better the decor was very dated and looked drab shower didnt work very well took ages to run hot however room was a good size;3
walking into to the hotel we thought we had booked a 5 star hotel instead of a 3 star check in was very easy we got to our room so disappointed in it very poky room for 3 ladies only 2 beds we didnt mind sharing the bed but we had asked for a triple room breakfast was served next door in a diner but it was excellent and we were served by the same host every morning he was brilliant would recommend the hotel but if booking a triple room make sure it is a large room;3
the hotel was nice and well located staff were friendly and the room was clean price was relatively cheap for a nice hotel until they hit us with some bullcrap resort tax on top of the city tax and some other tax we ended up paying closer to double what the advertised price was as my wife was pregnant at the time we werent really able to make use of the resort facilities they had available which featured a business centre so resorty and a fitness centre just what i look for in a resort wyndham new yorker lose the resort tax you are not and never will be a resort cut it the f out;3
i became worried after reading some of the very negative reviews of eh but i had no bad experiences every staff member i had contact withreceptionist engineer doormenwas very pleasant and helpful my room was clean it was not tiny as it sounds like other rooms are but it was long and narrow i couldnt work there because there was no desk or work spaceonly a narrow table covered with everything except a lamp i was there for business for one night and it served my needs well enough if you need a clean and safe place to stay after long days and night out the eh would be a good option a lot of europeans were staying there the main reason why i wasnt crazy about it has to do with aesthetics it is all done in dark heavy colors bronze black and drapes;3
my 2day trip to the empire hotel was ok the room was a little small but it was ok my one beef was that we had room service breakfast one day and ordered fresh baked breakfast pastry for 20 and what we received were 4 small halfdollar size plain dinner rolls and white bread toast when i mentioned this to the lady at checkout she told me that room service was separate from the hotel and there was nothing she could do about it this experience alone might keep me from staying at this hotel in the future;3
remodeled rooms are too small older rooms are better but not always having the feel of clean canât beat location if working near penn station or midtown manhattan also hotel impresses on security;3
unlike the smart reception area the rest of the hotel had a worn out appearance and feel there is renovation work going on and i understand some rooms are freshly updated so be sure to request one of these the grouting around the tiles in the bathroom was black in places with mould our pillows were small and lumpy the breakfast was distinctly average but the omelette man produced a great omelette if thats what you wanted sadly the bar and restaurant are not open anymore which added to the feeling of neglect of what im sure was once a great hotel very pricey for what it is;3
i was dubious of the astor hotel after reading reviews however it really isnt that badwell our room wasnt amazing views of park and manhattan with balcony we were made to feel lucky we had a big room double and a bunk very decent size bathroom very clean beds and clean towells changed dailyhowever on checking in they didnt have our reservation possibly tour operators fault it was sorted within 12 an hour though the staff were fairly friendly conceirge maybe a bit too pushy with tyring to sell us trips etcand helped with luggage etc even when the lift brokebrings me on to my next bugbear the noiseive never heard such a noisy lift theres only 1 slow tempremental lift and doors on each corridor bang all night longbear in mind that young;3
hotel was nice i paid for a queen room and queen bed but the room was very small and it was a double bed location was ok right by central park bit of a walk down to macys etc no wifi too which was a pain when trying to call family;3
we stayed for 9 nights at the end of sept into early oct the hotel is very well situated opposite the lincoln centre very near the bottom of central park and near the 66th street subway or columbus circle on 59th the lobby area is very grand and in keeping with the hotels name we upgraded our room to a room with a view and were put on the 3rd floor overlooking the lincoln centre which was great you get a bigger room for the upgrade it was 300sqft which in new york is good i believe only thing lacking was a bath and the shower room was a tad small with no full screen to the shower odd and leaves the floor wet long story short3rd night noticed cockroaches in bathroom got moved foc to a lovely corner suite on 2nd floor in same part of building massive seperate;3
very reasonable room prices and a good value for your money driving through the neighborhood and pulling up may make you doubtful as the location is not in the greatest of areas that being said we felt safe walking around during the day and there is a metro station nearby you can take to hollywood blvd uber and lift cabs make traveling easy now as well daily breakfast had ample selection for a free meal small fitness center the pool is not heated it was quiet despite being on a busy street but we faced away from the road on the top floor other people on the bottom floor on the street level complained it was loud they did charge us to check in early and will charge you if you check out late overall good value for the budget minded traveler;3
i recently spent one night in this hotel the location is convenient 5 min walk from cathedral hill subway and less than 10 min walk to central park nw corner there are shops and various restaurants in the area and it is a pleasant neighbourhood the hotel building is old but clean the room i was in was small but fine the only downside was that i had to share the bathroom one positive aspect is that there is a small kitchen that one can use it is a good choice for traveling on a budget i would probably go back;3
the elevators take forever and ever and are super crowded the room was tiny but that is ok in new york the sink will get full of water and will take an hour to drain do not get the top floor or you will get noise from the nightclub above great location;3
upgraded to a larger room with two queen beds for an extra 23 per night thought it was just 23 till i checked my card had a nice view of empire state building rooms were cleaned daily bathroom was old and shower bad linen was clean and fresh no room service that i was aware of but there is a 24 hour restaurant security is good and taxis easily available to everywhere including jfk starbucks and maccas across the road conveniently good central location an hours walk to central park very noisy location mind you i think everywhere in this city would be the same;3
staff behind the desk were not particularly friendly but not rude either the music playing in the small reception area was perhaps a little loud but not too obtrusive the interior was a little tatty in places but as long as youre not expecting a luxury hotel nothing to worry about room appeared very clean and of ample size bathroom was spacious clean and well stocked with towels had to pay 100 deposit on checking in but this was fully refunded there was a small room downstairs with coffee cold drinks and snacks available from vending machines and computers which you can use to surf the net for the rather pricey sum of 020minute so dollars go rather quickly when youre looking up timesplacessubway stations etc the walk into the centre of town took;3
the location of the hotel is perfect rooms are not spacious but at least clean and comfy the staff was helpful but long checkin time is expected at weekends bottom line its not a bad place to spend a couple of nights in nyc;3
this is a perfectly nice hotel except it has terrible wifi on all of its routers it is difficult and sometimes impossible to do work on their slow internet i stayed three nights and had to use it at most times of the day and evening you get better wifi at a dayinn for gods sake in addition their bar was not open yet their sign said it was open every night in fairness it also said hours may change without notice as a result i had to take my business meeting to a local dive down the street i will not be staying here again good internet access is essential for my work;3
unfortunately this was a bad experience for me and my girlfriend the location of the place is of cores convenient and some employs are very friendly but the management of the hotel is really far from ideal breakfast is very poor no hot food only serials and milk some bread tea and coffee hotel doesnt give proper forks plate knife in the room only plastic ones this is embarrassing room cleaning service was never this annoying first day cleaning staff showed up at 430 pm and if you cant let them in at that time they wont clean your room as the working hours for cleaning are till 5 pm i guess hotel doesnt take into consideration the fact that guests not always available to jump out of the room immediately we went through a long debate with the day;3
when we made the reservation and got a good deal on aroom at central park figured it would be less than impressive its location being close to the subway clean and efficent room overlooking the park and a lovely newly remodeled bathroom made us smile we really didnt expect that though it came with no ammenities such as breakfast or coffee pot ice machine on the same floorwe slept very well and the little corner store was very new yorker for our morning coffee and warm blueberry muffin we were giddy and happy for the three nightsfour days we were in nyc it was quaint at best and perfectly fine for us;3
it is located at very busy neighborhood and so room was very noise during day and night staff was great very friendly room was clean and tight small room but fair for low price i would recommend to stay for a short period of time but wouldnt stay longer than 4 nights;3
great location but not the best hotel we had 2 rooms 1 was cleaned once in 4 days on day 3 the other was not cleaned until we complained covid was used as an excuse for the lack of cleaning on a more positive note whenever we called the reception they were very prompt at delivering towells or toiletries or dealing with a faulty safe;3
was on the 10th floor room was clean service was not to good at reception as they are very slow at checking in and out having to pay for wifi was a joke as signal would always drop out plus side it is close to universal city walk and studios and universal city is units own little world away from crazy la as a city would not recommend to anyone even after 3 visits;3
the staff was very friendly the location was perfect just across from penn stationmsg the rooms were dated and tiny but clean the walls were thin and you could hear the people around you it was perfectly fine for my fiancã© and i who were just staying for a night after the rangers game;3
hotel is a budget type hotel rooms are a bit worn but staff are fantastic location is center of the tourist area and very busy plenty of subway stations nearby and 5 minutes walk from central park;3
i read many poor and scathing reviews and i have to generally disagree location conveniently located right off of broadway on 73rd the train station is a 12 block away movies dining and duane reade are all a short walk away as well building typical of central part west very nice lobby simple and nice very clean staff friendly and reasonably welcoming room small simply furnished the room was cleaner than i expected no bugs that includes roaches and bed bugs and i looked the furniture was worn but good enough the bed was not terribly comfortable but it served its purpose for a week in nyc the tv worked as did the frig bathroom small limited space but functional it was cleaner than i expected but typical ny the important part was the;3
some issues with smell in the room near the thermostat and the gym equipment treadmills not working too much noise and incline not functioning other than that the property is close to universal studios and shuttle service was appreciated;3
the location is superb the breakfast correct but every morning asking if i wanted my bed to be made or not and despite i asked for it they did not make my bed nor hoovered the carpeti use to stay at premier inn and i am always satisfied as i know what it is basic clean good prices and good locations i will stay at premier inn holborn in august lets see if it is the same;3
located not quite in the center of the city quite a distance from main activity area small rooms and need massive renovation to optimize the room space not a helpful staff barring few individuals parking no guarantee lucky if you get nearby parking there are shops around to get your laundry etc done we two friends stayed for three days with claustrophobic feeling commute time and cost is better spent taking a somewhat higher charge rooms near time square;3
stayed at days hotel 14 to 17 april 09 inclusive allocated there by jetlinecruisescom after a six day atlantic crossing on queen mary 2 which was fabulous days hotel has probably had better days room was dark and tired however bed linen and bathroom towels were spotless located upper west side of new york had we known better would have asked for a hotel more central the extra cost of somewhere more central would have been have been covered by what we paid out in taxi fares to and from hotel for anyone on a very tight buget the hotel would probably be ok on two positive points there is a great dinner new key west just around the corner had breakfast and late dinner there both nights much cheaper than eating in central new york the quality and quantity;3
well the tittle says it all we loved this hotel good food good pool gym 10 mins to universal beautiful christmas lights good breakfast polite staff except one fool a super place be when you want to enjoy universal studios but expect that we were woken up at 3am by the front desk since their new guest was not able to enter our room yeah they gave a key to a total stranger to us to enter our room in the middle of the night because our room was unoccupied bloody hell luckily we had the double locks on i was horrified super disappointed about this fool behind the front desk and needless to say very angry about this the hotel manager handled my case well with proper apologies and i am able to forgive them but people have your double locks on without;3
the checkin was pretty smooth first room was street facing although i had asked for a courtyard room room was very small changed room to a courtyard room and besides the ventilation noise outside it was pretty quiet the room was clean as far as i could see as the carpet was black ac could not be adjusted or turned off the bed was of good quality what brings me to an average rating is the fact that everything you touch costs money eg 8usd for a bottle of water 1295 for standard internet for 1 device per day if not included in your rate prices at the bar are close to a palace one day i had to go to the gym via the employee section elevator was broken and was just shocked by the dirt and smell not a good sign internet was supposed to be included in my;3
the staff at the empire are all very professional and friendly they make the stay memorable the room are in need of remodeling peeling wall paper stained carpet and a dated feel bathrooms very small;3
great great location and very comfy bed and good wifi very very noisy and small room not provided with daily water which is charged for and when this was brought to attention at reception still did not receive it also they take a 150 euro deposit when you arrive light in room broken and little space to store clothing;3
this hotel is the perfect place to stay if youre visiting universal studios its a few hundred yards from the entrance which takes a couple of minutes in the free bus our room was spacious with a great view of north la while the decor was along the lines of other hiltons clean but a bit dated and breakfast was decent;3
i usually really like this hotel but this past weekend was like residing in the tower of terror twice we had elevator malfunctions with the elevator doors opening at random floors bouncing not opening at the lobby and then speeding back up the first time when the doors finally opened back up on the 15th floor people dashed off in terror and took the stairs another time the doors wouldnt open all the way and people had to hold the doors open so others could get off and i neer saw the two elevators across from the bank of three open all weekend weird that said the room was clean and comfy hopefully they are looking into this problem;3
spent 4 nights in the new yorker with my small family and the reaction is mixed to be honest an old style art deco hotel in a run down area in the city reception was brusque and jot too welcoming eventually our booking was found and we got room key clearly there is a need for a lot of security due to surrounding area inhabited by a disturbingly large amount of homelessness room was small as expected in ny and needs updating beds were poor bathroom very very small diner attached to hotel was welcoming friendly and food service was decent hallways and general areas of hotel needs a facelift but was still packed with peoplemainly people going to gigs in msg across the road dont think we would stay in this hotel or this area of ny again which is a shame as its;3
arrived around 10am however had to circle the block due to being unsure of where exactly valet parking was valet was very helpful completed preregistration where i was told that i would receive a call when our room was ready we were able to use the luggage check free of charge to store our bags until our room was ready although i had to wait in line a halfhour to do so they do charge to store bags if you are checking out but did not charge us because we were checking in we did some siteseeing and arrived back around 3pm to see people were being checked in after waiting in line for about 15 minutes the wyndham rewards desk called me over and after checking my preregistration confirmation told me that our room wasnt ready yet seeing as so many other people were;3
check in hotel with big lady and i have another booking connect with next day stay she so unhelpful and use impolite sentences toward to customer instead of can i see yr id please she said i need yr id or she said i cant find yr booking then i show her booking confirmation number but she wouldnt want to see it and ask what is the name after long time look on computer finally she said that the next day you need to check in again do not understand why she can work for hyatt very disappointed;3
i had a deal so i wasnt expecting much and thats what i got this is an older hotel with an acceptable upgrade but some of the polish is only on the surface i was stuck in a room in the back of the hotel with a beautiful view of the ventilation shaft and the fire escape the light from the hallway kept the room nice and bright from the space under the door requiring towels to block the light for sleeping rehearsals in the venue next door started at 9am so there was music in the morning the room was average size by new york standards but overpriced for what i got theyve installed nice flat screen tvs but only provide a limited number of standard def channels like others i was annoyed by the facility fee added to the bill mainly for the wifi this is free in most;3
please see my previous review i stay at this hotel often bc it is across the street from to lincoln center one serious concern is the hotels wifi system wifi is complimentary in the lobby but if you want wifi in your room you must type in your credit card number while using the hotels public wifi system as result my credit card number has been stolen not once but twice unfortunately the hotel does not offer the option of adding the cost of wifi to your hotel bill so while at the hotel i use only my smart phone;3
i got this hotel for an absolute steal at 75 per night so on that basis alone i would rank it positively we only use our hotel to sleep and shower and dont need luxury or a lot of amenities just somewhere clean and safe this place definitely fit the bill first the good the staff is extremely friendly and checking in and out was a breeze there was always a doorman on duty and by the second day they were greeting us by name and making friendly chitchat they also were helpful in recommending the best places to eat in the area the room itself was nothing special but it was fine on the smallish side but pretty normal by ny standards the sheets and towels were extremely clean and we had a private bathroom which was marble it looks just like the pictures i saw on;3
double bed very small no channel on tv no signal no kitchen utensils provided not every room has airconditioning no hangs on the wall location is good shops cafã©s pubs and restaurants on broadway;3
many rooms dont have a bathtub but rather only a shower stall perhaps fine for a lot of younger travelers but i want to soak in a tub before a long flight early in the morning another unfortunate event was that i have stayed here multiple times but the property doesnt keep notes on my preferences the online check in was ineffective none of my requests were noted nor responded to;3
friendly staff and good location to access central park theater and many amenities but the hotel is nothing special we was 3 people choose 2 bedroom is too small any city view courtyard is horrible just see nosing machine air conduct rust older metal just one soap for room nothing good;3
the empire hotel has an incredible location at lincoln center is a perfect base for nyc adventures however i will say that the empire is a bit rougher around the edges then other 4 star properties in manhattan just a few examples are older air conditioning units peeling wood on our bathroom vanity and loud hvac noise directly outside our window i will say there are some good things about the hotel other than the location the rooftop bar is a solid place to hang out with the usual nyc hotel bar drink prices 15ishdrink the empire tries really hard to maintain a younger euro vibe and as such there is a lot of danceelectronic music played both in the lobby and on the rooftop which depending on what you are going for could be good or bad the rooms were clean and the;3
nice historical building great location right next to the subway when we arrived to the room maintenance was unexpectedly there the sink in our bathroom was always clogged so that was most likely why reported it to reception a few times but the issue was never fixed it didnât bother us much as the pipes in the building are definitely not new but itâs an inconvenience if you need to shave great views if you get a top floor room;3
only at the hotel for one night busy lobby art deco styling lots of security check in did not take too long professional staff once my room key was issued i made my way to the elevator area where you must show your key card there are plenty of elevators so the wait is not too long although the hotel has plenty of character some parts areas look old and worn my room was on the 26th floor and what i would describe as nyc size room was clean fairly well equipped regardless of how high your room is and regardless of hotel location noise will always be an issue i still managed to sleep well great location good transport links plenty of stores restaurants nearby madison square garden just round the corner typical large busy new york hotel;3
it was a lovely hotel in a good spot rooms were clean if a little to red and over powering i did think the tin for lovers at 8 dollars added to the hookers hotel vibe but did make us laugh the breakfast on the roof top was pleasant and the views good the heating seems to be on even if you turn it off but your not in your room long with so much to see and do it is a friendly hotel and i have only stayed in this one hotel in new york would i stay again yes but iâd also look for something a little more relaxing on the wallpaper and decoration front that being said fun trip;3
this place is huge too huge and thats great if youre having a meeting with over 250 people yet in a meeting i went to today the hotel layout is exceedingly confusing there was no signage for what meetings were being held and where yes the staff told me there were small screens highlighting that however you couldnt find them remember how there used to be rosters around a hotel or a list in the elevator not here they dont want you to find anything in the meeting room i was in on the 2nd floor the room was ice cold from 8 am 2 pm the hotel staff said they were changing the temperature however it was always ice gold its 2017 air conditioning should be fixable the hotel wait staff was very good they knew what they were doing and the food was;3
very good bed but nothing special about the room although very large bathroom is fine it lacks of little attentions cups or mugs for coffee instead paper cups and bathrobe would have been nice i will not visit this hotel again adequate but nothing more;3
the hotel is nice its old school clean the customer service was great except for the people that actually make sure you are a guest they dont remember you they always make sure you have a key and if you are carting food and your hands are full they do not even bother to help you not cool they dont even offer to help you with your luggage that part sucks there unfortunately the maids are great they help you more then the people downstairs friendly the conceair service sucked not friendly no discounts it seems like they are desperate to sell tix to shows bus tours and boat tours we bought a boat tour that took us along to see the bridges and the statue of liberty it was awesome but the customer service said it was a couple blocks down the street nope it was;3
pictures look great but its actually a bit shabby we had to be moved rooms twice due to loud plumbing but we did finally get a really nice room 75 of the staff are nice the rest dont really listen to you and talk over you concierge was incredibly rude pool was closed which was disappointing as it was one of the main reasons i booked it the bar was nice but incredible expensive even for nyc prices wasnt a bad stay but it wasnt great nyc must have better options than this great location though;3
never been to a hotel without coffee pot or coffee i have now housekeeping doesnt keep coffee on the cart have to call front desk for coffee daily and ask for coffee pot all vents need cleaning badly location is great for site seeing the hotel does need upgrading with decor the door men were helpful the front desk people answered our questions but had no personality i would probably stay again but would try to get reservations somewhere else;3
i was pretty dissappointed with ym stay at the empire hotel i could have stayed at a similar quality hotel for much cheaper but i chose to stay here because of the rooftop pool at check in they informed me that they have not renewed their lisence or something so it has not and will not be open for a while this makes me pretty upset seeing as i spent the extra money on this specific imenity and they still advertise it the room was extremely hot when i got in which concerned me beacuse i had read some reviews about the ac being broken fortunately mine worked just fine once i turned it on other than that it was a decent stay not complaints really;3
we arrived after 1000 pm on a sunday night after a long drive we looked forward to settling down for a restful night but after there was no staff at the door to help us in with our luggage and security at the door scolded us for leaving our car at the curb while we carried in our bags we knew we were in for a long night the staff were more concerned with accommodating the long line outside who were there for the rooftop lounge than the hotel guests the front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful providing us with internet access as we were there to bring donations and volunteer to help with hurricane sandy victims the room was very small and the 2 of us were tripping over each other trying to get from one side of the room to the other no closet to hang our;3
this is my second visit to the new yorker i think i booked more as it held very sentimental memories of my first ever visit and this rhine i was lucky enough to bring my daughter and was excited to show her bits of fond memories the first being when i was 21 and i am now 37 nothing has changed at all the room itself was very clean and comfortable we were 4 in a room and it was tiny we had no where to hang our clothes so had to live out of our cases which was also hard as there was no where to put them didnât spoil our time as we literally only slept there location is brilliant and the pizza place across the road is amazing my issue was with the staff on reception clueless and rude come to mind iâve been charged the equivalent of â£15 for a bottle of water which i;3
our room welcomed us with meticulous cleanliness and pristine bedspreads denise did an exceptional job in making sure our accommodations were pleasing she even checked in to see our happy faces the only disappointment was reporting that our ac did not work and it was ignored our room temp was a stagnant 7778 degrees extremely uncomfortable with no compensation;3
the location is top in terms of access to amtrak subways and midtown the hotel is priced right which is why i stayed here for half a day while attending a conventional down the street at the end of the day the staff is very nice the room and furnishings are average for new york but the hallways and overall rooms are just plain old i realize its a very old building but it served its purpose well for my one day in the city;3
great location for 5 nights but first impression was not a nice area to be in easy walk to theatres and time square and empire state building recommend a hop on hop off bus tour to get orientated didnât realise you had to ask for a fridge in room until we were unpacked and canât even make a cup of tea bed was very comfortable the kicker was 5 per bag to store when checking out and the resort fees per day for nothing what a rip;3
expedia messed our reservation up and put us here instead of our original hotel i was concerned at first but the hotel seemed really nice the checkin went very smoothly and the clerk gave us some breakfast tickets because of my sons 18th birthday when we got to the room it was nice small but nice enough our room had a great view of the empire state building it was nice to work on my computer while looking at the view one night while in the bathroom i had to kill a roach i didnt worry too much about it until my wife killed another one the next evening maybe thats normal for nyc but i dont like it the internet was actually pretty good better than a lot of other places that i have stayed the mattress wasnt the best but sleepable the restaurant;3
when we checked in there was a problem with the reservation we had booked four nights and they only had two in their system only after talking with them for a while they changed our stay to what we had booked i thought the receptionist was kind of difficult at a certain point we thought we had to find another hotel for the other two nights its not professional to blame someone else bookingcom for problems and to tell your guest its not your fault professionally you should just have a look at the confirmation and solve the problem instead of waisting time on blaming another another guest checking in at the same time booked a special room through his travel agent and not being able to give him that room it was the fault of the travel agent very unprofessional we;3
good things clean good location and decent price shower has good pressure not so good things bed is terrible whole place smells like a hospital but like i said very clean service is minimal but friendlyish dont bother eating in when the kitchen wasnt out of order there is nothing to cut on cook with or serve on;3
recommended to be a midrange option not the most expensive hotel in nyc but not sketchy decent location bellmen were great and helpful esp re storing bags and arranging transportation room amenities were minimal no sheets on the bed just a mattress cover and comforter room was warm even with the ac full in air temp was not very cold and full on fan speed barely circulated the air shower has no door by design but water easily sprays out into the floor;3
me and one friend spent five days during our short vacation in the big apple we used it just as a simply bedroom so we couldnt appreciate all services the building has a good and useful reception but on the floors you can notice that the envrionment is not more young and the rooms appear not yet refreshed the position is amazing some minutes walking from central park in the corner cafã¨ on the broadway corner people are friendly good food open 24h;3
i wish the rooms were nicer my shower barely worked leather was repaired with duct tape paint is scratched and peeling in the bath overall rather sad but the hotel staff is excellent in every way from pasquale at the front desk to the wait staff if only theyd redo the rooms;3
i struggled with the overall rating to give this hotel maybe 3 12 would make me feel better first we did not arrange nor pay for this one night stay we were guests of an art seller that invited us to nyc to see a particular studio our room was not yet ready when we arrived before usual check in time so they took our phone number and promised a text when the room was ready we walked next door and had a bite for lunch and returned at usual check in time an hour later to find our room ready did not receive a text the front desk staff were polite and pleasant our room a two bed corner room was larger than expected for nyc the entire hotel is somewhat dark artdecoish which i actually liked but we needed to have both window blinds wide open during the day;3
if you are looking for a convenient location for your trip to universal and nice rooms this hotel is good and i guess these are thee reasons for the expensive price point as well to be honest i dont mind paying that as well but also expect some good service in return most of the checkin staff was running the desk in a chaotic manner their concierge was mostly rude and always in a hurry to listen to any requests on the day of our checkout they took 50 minutes just to respond to our request for a luggage trolley and finally never showed up with it when i went down to grab one myself our airport shuttle was waiting they said they dont allow guests to use one can you imagine that my wife sister and brotherinlaw dragged bags imagine 3 families traveling with;3
the morningside inn was a good place for our family to stay while seeing the ny sights near the metro a grocery store and enough room for us to get a good nights sleep not a luxery suite but very adquate for us;3
this bar on the top floor of the hotel has some wonderful views the issues are very inattentive service and appetizers of poor quality they do have happy hour pricing but getting service is clearly an issue i would return except for the very careless manner in n which it runs i am frankly surprised that this place functions at all the personal here are hired firvtge it looks snd certainly not fir brains very disappointing;3
checked into the room around midnight after a long drive ac unit had wires hanging out everywhere my husband went to swing the tv to actually see it and the tv fell off the wall onto my husband i called the front desk immediately and told them to move us this was unacceptable;3
really close walk to universal studios we spent all day and night at the park we went back to the hotel to take a nap before the horror nights adventure after all day walking at the park and another long night it was really worth it but if we werent planning on the night i would have probably stayed at a cheaper hotel and dealt with the driving this hotel is already so expensive plus they charge you 24night for self parking even if your a guest they dont even give you a complimentary bottle of water they charge almost everything we requested for our room to be cleaned at 6pm because it was never done while we were out all day but they never did so didnt have any house keeping at all for 3 days the room was also loud you can hear the doors slamming;3
regadigg this hotel the location is great just next to penn station subway just a few blocks from the empire state building once you check out you can store your luggage for a 5 us per bag this is a good option what i didnt like about this hotel is that i believe is overpriced the rooms are outdated bathrooms are really small room decoration is depressing and outdated the hidden fees be aware of it they will charge you a hidden fee for internet use even if you dont use it overall if look for location you wont spend time at the hote and you dont need amenities it is ok;3
lets start with some constructive criticism no bathrobes dont change towels in need of some renovation here and there other than that great location friendly staff and overall positive experience;3
the location of the hotel was fantastic just outside of the hustle and bustle of time square but within walking distance of all the tourist attractions and many hidden bakery and coffee shop gems i booked the hotel solely for the roof top pool feature however after my sister and i checked in and went to check it out we were alerted by a sign that the roof top pool was indefinitely closed after speaking to the front desk it turns out the roof top pool had been closed a week or longer prior to my arrival very disappointed in how management handled the situation also they advertise free wifi it is only free in the lobby if you would like wifi in your room it is an additional charge of 13 per 24 hours;3
in terms of positives the hotel is in a great location right in the heart of columbus circle very close to central park the lobby area is nice with many places to sit the drinks at the bar were good and the service there was accommodating the hotel is very clean and staff were pleasant the downsides are the rooms are very small i realize this is nyc but ive had much larger hotel rooms in the city the elevators took forever the rooftop bar seems to be a draw for locals but it was a total scene definitely do not wait in line if you are a hotel guest just ask the bouncer to let you up overall i would recommend this hotel if you need to be in that neighborhood but if you are not locked in to upper west side i would suggest checking out your options;3
we stayed here while in la our first stop of a 5 week honeymoon from australia the good we had a car so the location was fine and very close to stores and hollywood free internet was good rooms were clean albeit on the smaller side and staff were ok the bad the breakfast that was included was very average i would give it a miss next time if it drops the price of the room also even though many hotels do i dont think its right to charge close to 20 a night for parking finally the morning after our last night we asked for a wake up call in order to catch our flight luckily we also set our alarms because they only called 20 minutes later than we had asked;3
nice hotel with friendly staff rooms are small but comfortable and clean walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and attractions short walk to central park lot of street noise at night the lobby bar has a great happy hour but it was closed one the two nights we stayed because of staffing issue;3
pleasant hotel conveniently located reasonable price for new york city at checkin we requested adjoining rooms and were assured that rooms 619 and 621 were adjoining they turned out to be as far apart as two rooms on the sixth floor could possibly be loaner umbrella in the room was a nice touch staff was very friendly we skipped the 18 breakfast and found excellent alternatives right around the corner;3
we stayed one night recently to go to macys parade we paid only 99 for a double and 129 for a quad at those prices the room is fine we are budget travelers and accustomed to budget accommodations such as this the location is fine located between two subway stops 2 3 blocks either way about 30 minute subway ride to lower manhattan the area is mostly residential the nearest coffee shop or store is 2 to 3 block walk parking is challenging the room was small as is all budget accommodations in nyc it was clean comfortable beds freshly caulked shower no microwave or fridge in the room while there was an ice bucket there is no place to get ice the was one problem the room was extremely hot impossible to sleep in there is no thermostat we had;3
the hotel was clean and the breakfast was good the hotel has a gym and a pool but a little dated it is not in the safest of areas we were charged for parking even though we had paid expedia when we contact expedia by email they have not bothered to email back to us i tried calling them but no joy i suppose they took our money wont be booking with them again if you have a car it is safe but do not venture out after 9 as while we were there there was a shooting and a fire near by;3
the room was clean and kept to a good standard the doormen were very friendly and helpful tea and coffee are not included in the price and cost 200 per sachet easier to go to starbucks on the corner of the street the room was hot so had to turn the heating off there was a constant whirring sound which disturbed your sleep the hotel is in an ideal location to explore ny;3
i stayed here because of the convenience to universal studios hotel was semi clean except for the stains on the floor the bathroom was big and clean the valet could be a little nicer especially if you expect a tip tim was the nicest bell person he gave us all the information we needed as soon as we arrived i do like the fact that they have a shuttle service to universal studios;3
the hotel is top located near colombus circle and just a stonethrow away from central park they have a super nice end efficiant frontdesk and bellman staff all very friendly and helpful the rooftop too is a highlight of the empire hotel even though the pool was a bit disappointing as it looks different on the photos to lounge and have a pricey drink in their cosy lounge corner the rooftop is a mustdo when you stay there disappointing was the room definitly way too small for the buck and for a 4 star hotel glad we had only 2 luggages as it wouldnt habe been possible to keep more luggage in the room the bathroom too was far too small the room photos we saw beforehand left higher expectations kinda funny the floor works that took place while we were there the fun;3
stayed for a week with friend the room was big and clean bed was comfortable tv is big and with no noise maybe the best tv ive ever seen in hotels i lived the place was quiet and didnt feel unsafe even at night the price here was quite reasonable so instead maybe the staffs were not very friendly as i expected especially in the restaurant never saw them smile at all so if you want a good budget choose this place if you wanna have a happy trip better find somewhere else;3
the astor on the park is in a great location directly across the street from central park the customer service is fabulous and everyone i came in contact with at the front desk was kind friendly and helpful the rooms are standard with a bed and a tv what more could you want if thats all you need this hotel is perfect for you however if youre looking for a comfortable bed with upgraded amenities do not stay at the astor on the park the bed was extremely hard and the bathroom had a strong smell of bleach i do recommend staying on the first floor if you can the first floor is within range of the hotels wifi and it is complimentary if you stay above the first floor there is an additional charge of 1000 per day overall the hotel is perfect for a reasonably;3
the main reason that i am giving this hotel 3 stars instead of 4 is that the room and bed were very tiny it was barely big enough for 2 people the room itself was nice but it was small the complimentary breakfast was very good even though they are very strict about people not leaving the dining room with food the gift shop was soso it was also rather small this was my first time in california and i did not realize that hollywood was quite as rundown as it is however the hotel is very close to the vermont and santa monica station as well as it is on several buslines since we were traveling without a car this was extremely helpful we were able to go to hollywood blvd and see the sites within minutes and able to go all the way to beverly hills and santa;3
very close to penn st station this is a rather grand hotel that has seen better days we had a a sweet little room with a view my main gripe with the hotel is the rather large and unexpected facilities payment that was added to the end which was too much for the really poor wifi;3
ok but our room had no view there was no pool souvenirs disappeared great location 1 block from the hop onoff tours 2 blocks from the subway and central park right next to the lincoln center;3
stayed in one of the single rooms which was really cute and despite the size of it was really all you need i like quirky hotels and this is one quirky hotel the bad stuff the room was like a sauna because of the central heating and it felt weird having to sleep with the air con on in dec just so i wasnt sweating the foh staff were very hot and cold depending on the day time person i really couldnt tell if they wanted to help me or not bed was stiff and narrow smaller than a single size the good stuff loved the uniqueness of this hotel the bellboys were always friendly and helpful good quiet location away from the chaos that is nyc genuinely unsure if i would stay here again i think i would more so for the price rather than the hotel itself;3
room we had a standard room it was small by us standards the hotel has been around a long time so we were not surprised with the smaller size we were in nyc to sightsee so the small room was ok but letâs be clear we had very little elbow room location wonderful short walk to basically everywhere including time square also easy access to the subway active area for cabs biggest appeal of this place is the a location service busy hotel service felt a bit rushed bit the concierge was just delightful full of good tips and help on several requests price given the location the price we paid was a great deal small room sure but a good value if iâm back in nyc looking for budget lodgings iâll return but honestly for a few dollars more there are;3
its a standard nyc hotel it served its purpose with a clean room bed felt very low to ground and a nice staff for a 25 resort fee per day per room however i would expect a little more than basic hotel coffee in the lobby and hotel wifi;3
i stayed over 3 night at the jane hotel with the simple objective of a cheap place to sleep new york being the city it is friends have limited possibility to put visitors up for this objective the hotel works very well rooms are super tiny so you dont want to spend more time in there than for sleep it is a dynamic and young hotel with a busy bar i was however never disturbed by late noise but would wake up in the morning around 78 am from people in the corridor not being loud but the rooms are not very insulated when i was there it was around 30c in temperatures and the room got really hot in the morning and one couldnt open the window completely on the positive side the room and shared bathrooms were always extremely clean and there was never a need to wait for;3
stayed here for 3 nites in early may 2018 sadly i was left disappointed with this hotel it looks very glamoures from the out side inside with the 40s deco but for me thats where it ends the rooms are very basic with no fridge much needed in the new york heat or kettle so you can make a tea or coffee small room not ideal if your in a wheelchair the staff where pleasnt and the gaurd by the lifts give you that bit of reassurance that your room is safe be prepared to pay a hotel fee mine was 76 and that was based on a 3 nite stay the hotel is very close to madison square gardens and penn station and 10 minute walk to the empire state building sadly this will be my last stay here;3
we booked a room for one night via the hilton portal and spent hilton loyalty points at the check in they told us that wifi on the room is not free for us at the end it was the fridge didnât work and the water in the shower was warm not hot we spent 12000 hilton loyalty points plus usd 250 is that what you have to expect at a hilfon hotel in the us;3
i stayed there for 3 days in july the hotel is old and tiny as most hotels in ny but on the good side it is quite affordable and conveniently located if you travel to la guardia 25 bucks for a cab the hotel service is not good at all but who spends time at a hoten when in ny i would go there again;3
the hotel is just across the street from lincoln center its not luxurious but its been renovated in the past decade and the rooms while very small are completely serviceable;3
i waited 20 minutes to get into the parking lot to find out the valet parking was full they referred us to the parking lot down the street we had two walk two trunks to the hotel keep this in mind if you have issues with handling your own luggage my room key did not initially work in the elevator so i returned to the desk and it turned out it was an elevator malfunction they do have other elevators the bathroom is tight you will have to get ready separately unless one person in shower when one is at the sink view from the window is the parking lot the room is clean and quiet to sleep the hotel is close to the airport to catch your next flight although this street is full of hotels i was expecting a bit more service from a hyatt;3
itâs 0130 and i have been awake for ages with very noisy people in rooms around us the night before awake with smell of cannabis at 4am from an other nearby room bathrooms so noisy that a flush echos in other rooms windows donât shield the outside street noise iâm not a light sleeper usually but not a decent sleep here in 5 nights corridors very dingy lifts can be slow but maid showed us the service lift location the rooms are very small i have never seen double rooms so small and very dated please consider this when booking safe did not work in either room as we had 2 rooms beds comfortable showers powerful ice machine on floor 25 which was good staff pleasant and no issues at all ticktock breakfast great i wouldnât return to this hotel but the position;3
during my stay it was high season and the room costed 500 a night as metropole hotelroom prices yield so in this case i must considerer pricevalue more conciously as ever before locationlocationlocation and well cleaned furthermore the hotel is poorly maintaned and service is very unpersonal;3
i was going to stay in nyc for just one night and needed a cheap room that was near the subway line a comparable room elsewhere in the city wouldve been twice as much it was a decent place to stay the room was a bit run down and it showed worn out carpet scratched pealing furniture the bed seemed clean bathroom was also clean only bad thing was that there was no way to regulate the heat in the room and it was very very hot for a cold winter day i had to turn on the ac in order to be able to sleep comfortably;3
our experience of the wyndham new yorker was mediocre the main benefit for us was the location having a refrigerator in the room and being able to secure a queen suite the location afforded us to get around the city very easily both by walking and subwaytrain our room was a queen suite on the 40th floor with amazing views and good space our reservation came with continental breakfast which was one cup of juice one cup of coffeetea and one bagelcroissantdanish the quality was poor and the kcup coffee in the room was better than in the diner downstairs we actually chose to eat at small bagel shops around the corner instead of the hotel because of the poor food quality the service was unhelpful sparse and the amenities were at the level of a motel the cups;3
we stayed in this hotel for one night only the location is great to visit universal studies room and bathroom had a good size wifi breakfast and parking were not included in the rate but this information was not clear in the booking process there are few elevators consider the number of rooms so be prepared to wait several minutes until you get one with space you can enter there are several other options in la in the following week we stayed in beverly hills in a 5 stars hotel paying less than we paid in hilton and with breakfastwifi included i would not stay here again;3
the photo of the front is accurate it is lovely the hotel itself really needs a facelift perhaps it is getting one as much of it seems kinda â under construction â the rooms are clean most important to us was a quick drive to warner brothers studios so we could tour the sets;3
hotel is average very old bed was comfortable rooms are small perfect location though wouldnt rate it a 4 but not sure if 4 english is the same as american i would say it was a 3 also we asked to keep the room for a couple more hours and they said it was going to be 320 dollars more which is a joke also when we checked in we were told there is a 25 dollar daily charge for the fitness centre daily newspapers and for use of the telephones i did not pay it apparently its in the terms and conditions i didnt use any of the above so i didnt pay the charge the lady was nice enough and said thats fine;3
was here for just one night in early february some plusses some minuses this seems to be a rebranded ramada inn in fact the area map they gave me still had ramada on in not hollywood the place had a very 1960s vibe architecturally but without 1960s charm rooms overlooked the outdoor pool area with a rectangular slice of the sky above i liked that i could step out onto a patio from my room what minnesotans doesnt love that in february but there was no chair to sit on in order to enjoy the warm air got a great rate but the person who made my reservation didnt send me a confirmation when i called and asked them to send it a few weeks later they didnt not sure what the problem was but when i called a third time i just took the confirmation number over;3
first let me start off by saying the hotel as a whole us fine you cant beat the location as times square and central park snd great shopping are all within walking distance the hotel is old of course but clean we found the rooms are very new york small youd be hard pressed to get 2 adults and two large suitcases in one room and the room is very dark the lighting is horrible also buy water somewhere else as they charge 5 for a small bottle if you drink the water in they supply in the room you can buy it down the street for 1 i probably wouldnt stay there again just as a personal preference i think for the price you could probably find a little more upscale room but like i said the location is great and you probably wont be in it much;3
the redeeming feature of this hotel is its location right at lincoln center i love the upper west side and wish there were more hotels to chose from in that neighborhood the empire is badly in need of an overhaul our room had peeling wallpaper chipped paint loose tiles in the bathroom not what youd hope for at this price point also very limited amenities and outrageous charges for minibar items so beware if you open that bottled water on your nightstand you will be out 800 the property is older and quite interesting architecturally a nice change from a standard sterile box of a hotel i actually like quirky spaces and wouldnt mind that the dã©cor is rather dark if it was well maintained the lobby is very dramatic with a sweeping staircase a bar and nice;3
my wife and i recently stayed at this hotel in september the hotel location is very good if you want to stay in midtown close to madison square garden penn station and the theater district we found the hotel staff to be professional but not the friendliest we had issues checking in as there was error in the computer system related to the confirmation also at the time of checking in we were told that the room wasnt ready and we would get a call when its ready unfortunately we never got a call what i found annoying is that the hotel has a 5bag hold fee even for overnight guests this is the first time ive encountered this in nyc and there was only 1 person at that time working the bagcheck so we had to wait 1015 minutes because the line was long the;3
we paid 126 a night for that rate it was an ok hotel its on the older side the bathroom is just big enough to have one person standing in it at a time it had some kind of red dirt could be blood running down the door jam of the bathroom not the cleanest hotel ive ever stayed in the location i think is the biggest draw for this hotel its a great locationits central to everything i would stay again only if i had a very good rate again;3
we have just had a fabulous 5 days staying at the new yorker the reception area is beautiful the rooms are tired looking especially the bathrooms very very clean but definitely need a revamp after reading the reviews on the great coffee machine ipod docking station and sky loungebar we were alittle disappointed as our 3 rooms had neither must be in executive rooms staff were not very forthcoming about the sky lounge it took us to asking 3 members of staff where it was located apparently you need to book its only for breakfast so no night caps with a view then the lady concierge was exceptionally helpful very lovely the room tax per night seems to be at the receptionist discretion our friends paid a lot less per night for their room as we did on;3
the rooms are small but clean and comfortably adequate no frills but none were expected we got what we paid for by way of great location and a new york experience with great cafes and small grocery stores where we stocked up on fresh fruit and water to take with us on our sightseeing trips downtown;3
the location of this hotel is great close to subway stations central park and columbus circle i had high expectation for this hotel based on its high rating however i was disappointed the first night after checkingin the front desk receptionist who assisted me checkingin and changing the room to a twobed room had an almostrude manner to my request of changing rooms when we went up to the room the door was broken the same receptionist came up and looked at it and then offered to put us in a different room although previously he insisted that he only had one available room that night when we went to the second room i asked for wifi password and he emphasized and made sure i understand that usually the wifi has to be paid but he will offer it to me for free;3
the first room we were given on the 10th floor was run down unclean and did not have a tub we requested another room the only difference was it had a tub there were actual holes in the blanket and the tub had paint off and rust showing through at least 20 of surface the room needed a good vacuum and cleaning in order to see we had to turn on all the lights because all fixtures had in low wattage dull lights which did not help the experience actually added to the dingy feel;3
this hotel is completely legendary wonderful historical exhibit in the lower level showing posters for big bands gis during wwii info on the mechanical and electrical systems lobby is fantastic great location very nice diner just off the lobby is great for bkfst bed and bedding are very comfortable security is excellent you must show your room key in order to enter an elevator soundproofing f outside noise sirens honking horns etc is very good wonderful big bathtub room was small but i dont care the place is very clean however they nickel and dime you to death 25 to to check in before 4pm even if your rm is ready 5 to hold onto your luggage before checkin most outrageous 40 for facilities fee covers business center and fitness room whether you;3
the room was small but clean which was the most important thing however the walls were very thin and on our last night could hear people screaming about their belongings being stolen in the middle of the night which was quite worrying there arent any safes for valuables etc so if you are going to stay here i would suggest taking anything of value with you and not leaving in the room for a short stay it was fine;3
hotel was just that a hotel its advantage at the time was its location close to madison square garden penn station the javitz centre and a short walk to times square no call out on special service or anything nothing to rave about nor nothing to complain about rooms were smaller than expected with 2 queen beds not much space for 3 or 4 suitcases;3
this hotel could be so much better then it is the elevators dont work half the time for 2 years now the bar you have a drink is freezing they leave the doors open and all the need to do is close them;3
my partner and i went to nyc to celebrate the new year we were on a relatively tight budget and were not too fussed about the hotel as in somewhere like new york its really only somewhere to sleep in the evening there is so much to see and do that seems pretty pointless spending a huge amount of money on a hotel when you are out all day and evening one thing i would say to everyone is that every single hotel description on here says that it is very central literally all the hotels are central and new york is an absolutely enormous place this hotel says it looks on to central park and yes it does but central park is massive and we had to get the subway to get to the part of central park we wanted to be at basically no matter where you are or what hotel you decide to go;3
do not waste your time ordering food service is below average it took over 40 minutes for my order to be taken three people at the table and food came out about 2030 minutes apart manager had to be summoned about an hour later as my food had not arrived;3
comfortable mid range accommodation close to los angeles international airport the room provided all we needed for a one night stay and food as available on site though limited and moderately expensive;3
this is a decent hotel with a great location across the street from the los angeles international airport so you can literally walk to the hotel which is nice they also have a great shuttle service the staff is very friendly though we were at first put into a room that either had not been made up or was currently occupied they did take care of the issue and put us in a different room;3
i called to ask about the valet parking the front desk told me the price of 60 a day fine not a problem then come to check out i am charged a parking tax per day and additional 12 it is not about the money i paid it and would have paid it anyway if the front desk had only been honest and when i asked told me it was 72 which included tax why they chose to be dishonest and not disclose this charge is beyond me i never thought i had to pay parking tax on top of it i was asked if i had coffee in the room i was charged for the coffee which in every other hotel i have stayed in around the world makes this complementary for their guests not about the money its the principle of the dishonest and money grabbing oh did i mention the bottled water in room is 8;3
if you can get a room cheap around 100120 this place is a good value anything more and youll be unhappy ive stayed at days hotel twice now the reason i came back was because of my great experience the first time unfortunately the second time was nowhere near as good but i would still recommend the days hotel and i would probably come back and stay here again first the location is unbeatable it is nestled in the upper west side a nice neighborhood i walked around by myself at 2am and felt perfectly safe it is right next to the subway line and that is what makes it so good you can get around the entire city just by taking one step out of your hotel door there are plenty of other amenities around the corner including a little grocery store drug store;3
we stayed here nearing the end of a 3 week vacation in the us we found the hotel to be good value for the rate we paid although the general maintenance and upkeep of the property could do with improving very dated tired free wifi and free breakfast always a winner handily located just up the street to the metro just a few stops to downtown hollywood we went downstairs to the bar on one evening the atmosphere is awful and the bartender seemed too busy playing an instrument next door to care about serving us he acknowledged we were coming in said hi and then disappeared for over 10 minutes to play his instrument avoid the bar area all in all we were satisified with the hotel we were able to quickly access universal studio and hollywood downtown on the metro;3
we stayed only because of the location which is very close to the park we took advantage of the free shuttle and waited 10 minutes once 1 minute on return the room was fine and beds comfortable the large buffet was somewhat pricey 20 per person but most of the food was decent quality with the fresh squeezed oj and omelette bar as highlights the common area decor is a tacky mishmash of 80s asian and gothic renaissance dappled with bronze sculptures i would definitely stay somewhere nicer if we werent just in town for the park with the 24 parking and 150 basic aaa rate its not a great value;3
this is a basic hotel no lobby no elevator nothing except your room which can be as large or small as the bed our first room was tiny then we got an upgrade to a spacious ie normal room with a queen and a twin bed so check the size of the room first the staff is very helpful and willing to do things right the hotel opened in may 2014 so everything is new and clean the location is great close to penn station metro madison square garden macys and shops in 34th the high line etc if you want to stay out a lot this is great if you plan to spend time in your room this is not for you;3
the good reasonable and relatively quiet location in the upper west side near the subway clean and comfortable beds nice clean bathroom with a hot shower the staff tended to be nice they hold your bags free of charge so you do not have to lug them all around nyc after check out the not so good its an older hotel dirty rug heat makes noise when turning on and off my friend said that the alarm clock didnt work not so bad though as we arranged for a wake up call which worked overall if you are looking for a basic hotel in a decent location then i would recommend this hotel;3
the hotel lobby location and staff were all great however the rooms were quite small which is normal for new york city and the air conditioning was not working properly it was humid in the room making it uncomfortable to sleep one of the four elevators were always down and the other 3 were slow so i suggest getting a room on the lower floors in case you dont want to wait 1015 minutes for the elevator you can take the stairs if you are going for a weekend it is a good hotel as long as you can compromise on the few issues listed above;3
this hotel is in an excellent location in the middle of the city the price is right the lobby is ok and the restaurant is ok too our bedroom was facing the empire state building that gave it a nice view but we asked for queen bed and they gave us a double bed;3
so my friends and i got into nyc early in the amwe were told there was lockers to keep our stuff in so we could go and see some sights before we checked inwhen we got there we had to go to the b and we get there and its a room with a lock on it to keep our stuff inok i guesswhen we came back to check in we were suppose to have a private bathwe were told the room was already taken and there was no other private rooms with bathso we had to stay in a room with shared bathit wasnt that bad at all really minus the bathrooms were small and there was mold on the curtains in the showerthe bedrooms werent so bad small but not bad if your only sleeping in it which thats all we didonly time we spent in the room was to get changed between shows and go to bedstaff;3
very noisy hotel and a nightmare to park but rooms are ok bed isnt as comfortable as westin but sufficient for sleep people are nice and helpful overall clean towels were old and rough skip coffeemaker its awful get a good cup somewhere else;3
so we stayed in a junior suite for our trip to new york recently which was booked for our first anniversary on paper this is quite a premium new york city hotel just off columbus circle minutes from central park and a short walk or cab drive to broadway iâm not sure if we were a bit unfortunate because we had a huge flight delay which meant we arrived at 4am but the welcome was a bit underwhelming to say the least especially for a city that doesnât sleep apparently as there was no one to greet us at the door or help with luggage and the guy on the front desk wasnât hugely welcoming either i hardly got two words out of him on getting to the room it was freezing so we put the heater on which was the noisiest thing ever i had messaged ahead to see if they had;3
subway stops on both sides in the middle of everthing 10 minutes walk to times square 250 m away from the madison square garden what can i say the room was small and we didnt like the bathroom there was no kettle and minibar but i would probably stay again due to its location and cleanness;3
the room was a great size the beds were comfy the hotel has received some great and some poor reviews to be clear when we booked we were under the impression that breakfasts and a restaurant were available onsite when viewing the online site the reality is covid closed this option totally understandable however the site and details of the hotel needs an urgent update the details are how people decide whether to stay or not so to be fair to your customer they need to be honest and up to date the mixed reviews are right there are homeless people up the road but they were not an issue at all and certainly not the responsibility of the hotel public transport is close by bus and rail being without a car is no issue in getting around the room was a little tired;3
this hotel was well out of the way its a good hours walk down into manhattan the sights the hotel is fine in itself there is a great bicycle rental shop just around the corner central park is just a 5 minute walk east its on broadway but a long way up you are nearer to harlem than times square an average hotel with friendly helpful reception staff;3
found the location was near to some great restaurants we enjoyed rosa mexicana around the corner and an italian antipasto bar across the street the room was tiny and the maid didnt leave us any facecloths either the lobby bar had a great vibe and the view from the roof was amazing;3
seated in a good position the hotel also offers some valuable facilities roof garden with great view small swimming pool gym kind staff the only flaw was the low brightness of rooms and the common parts due to mild light and dark walls;3
tried this hotel as i wanted to stay close to central park and the met hotel was quite nice and elegant with a good atmosphere in the lobby and bar i got a upgrade to a room with a king size bed which was nice but it was also on lower level and the old window did not provide a lot barrier for the traffic noise from columbus i woke up a couple of times during the night because of sirens etc i know it is ny but i have stayed in several hotels where you do not hear the traffic as much finally there was absolutely no fringe here the self made coffee in the room was 2 and the water was 8 i moved to another hotel after this with complimentary coffee and water in the room and i think the rate is the same;3
we stayed here on halloween nightit was a bit warm and there is no ac but left the window open and it was okthe beds were terrible hard and lumpy but we got the room for 10000 with two bedsno decorations or extrasold beds and old carpetgenerally old placebutwas clean and the staff friendly enough the location is good and the neighborhood is greatand the pizza place at the end of the street is good too even though it was old and rundown i would probably go there again just because of the good neighborhood and cost we were shocked at first but when you think about how little you really are in your room it seems like a smart choice if you are on a budget we definitely felt as though we got the full flavor of new york in this hotel;3
this hotel is beautiful and an iconic building well placed for times sq activity the staff were all very polite helpful and friendly and the tick tock in house restaurant a very nice diner vibe with lovely staff and great choices for all meal types the rooms were compact but you are only there to shower and sleep so okay very clean and attended every morning by room service it is i suppose a little tired just by its age more than anything and make sure you have all you need when you go out for the day as the lifts tend to be difficultbusy and unless super fit 740 flights of stairs is not an option to many and you can waste valuable nyc time;3
hotel is close to subway rooms are ok bed comfortable bathroom was clean people are nice not fancy at all but reasonably decent only 2 elevators and they are slow so i recommend you get an upper floor so you get them empty on the way down we had floor 11 and it was fine or a very low floor and use the stairs;3
the rooms bathrooms and beds were small the keys deactivated constantly the names of all of the guests in the rooms 3 rooms total 11 guests were provided yet we still had to have the person that booked the room get a new key plastic shower curtains in a suite and plastic cups to drink out of are pretty cheap for the price you pay rooftop pool wssgreat view thats about it looks are decieving on the pool size it took 30 mins to clean off the table from the group before rooftop bar was great if you are a light sleeper do not stay on the tenth floor also pretty disappointed to find out that the aaa discount could only be applied to 2 out of 3 rooms i would not recommend this hotel i am sure there are better places to stay;3
stayed there with my boyfriend and family there were 5 of us and i had requsted a cot for the 2 double bed room i had called the hotel 2 days before our trip to confirm and there were some issues ie there are limited large rooms that will fit a cot after speaking with the manager a few times he ensured me that i will not have a problem arriving at the hotel we were there really early they allowed us free storage of our bags lobby had an old charm to it parking was 1 block away but it was close and was about 22 usd which is reasonable upon check in front desk told me that the room was prepared and that a cot should be in the room the room was large even included kitchenette area the cot wasnt there as of yet but was brought in within 30 minutes for;3
the jane was a fun adventure the room was as advertised a clean cozy room with bunk beds the shared bathroom was clean and during our stay we never had to wait to shower not a romantic getaway but a perfect base for my son and i to visit city colleges;3
november 2022 hotel in great location right next to penn station with easy access to subway and walkable to many restaurants and times square area lobby and communal areas are well kept and spacious however we booked a single queen room and were really disappointed the room was clean but both bathroom and bed area were worn and very outdated noisy overnight as well with loud guests in nearby rooms if you get a cheap price then this is fine but accommodation standards in the room we had was way below expectations for price we paid;3
on checkin found the reception staff to be a bit cold and impersonal they were having conversations amongst themselves instead of talking to the guests room was a decent size with comfy beds but bathroom was tiny and tired looking really needed renovated bathshower not great beds were clean with sheets renewed every day but overall room could have been cleaned more thoroughly very dusty light shade housekeeping staff very friendly concierge staff also very friendly but they charge 2 per item of luggage they store very disappointing after also being hit with a bill of 2395 per night for resort fees the saving grace for this hotel is the location very close to macys madison square garden and times square;3
the lobby and rooms are clean chic and lovely and we found an attentive staff who promptly delivered extra pillows ironing board and iron and gave us a free box of cashews when the ones we opened from the honor bar proved stale our only real objection was a very small room with no room for an ironing board to begin with queen not king size bed tiny closet and no place to put your luggage so it has to be opened on the floor sound transference between rooms was also a problem along with door slamming in halls on balance this was a good value bc we paid under 200 on hotwire but i would have been bummed if id paid full freight;3
i think the rooms need a lot of work to be at the level they charge for there are lots of paint chips in the shower area and doesnt look well kept up i couldnt get a steady water temperature for a shower the first room we stayed in didnt have a shelf in the bathroom or a towel rack so no where to put anything you typically would put in a bathroom the bathroom size was about the size of a european bathroom at a 23 star hotel hardly much room to even turn around in the line was long to check in and i saw this line very single day i was here the same with checking out i would not recommend this hotel in its current state;3
the location is great i found the staff at the empire to be outstanding they were knowledge and extremely helpful that was the best part of the hotel initially all looked good however the first indication that things were amiss was when only two of the four elevators were operating we were repeatedly forced to squeeze 12 people into an elevator with an 8 person capacity the room and bathroom were clean but there were no areas in which to place anything in the bathroom not even a toothbrush showering caused the bathroom to flood because one of the two glass doors had been removed by management i was told to use extra towels on the floor when i asked why the door was removed i was informed there had been an incident with a previous guest the air condition had;3
while updated this still bears the signs of being an older hotel the rooms are small with some awkward layouts halls twist with right turns at strange places no options to do your own laundry lobby gets crowded when groups arrive or depart with no good overflow space information desk was very helpful and friendly bed was comfortable bathroom was small with black gunk in some corners and the ceilings were cracked tp in an awkward location housekeeping couldnt follow the green option and replaced towels and linen daily;3
i canât say i was disappointed in this hotel because i had read the comments on tripadvisor before arrival someone else booked for me and was warned but i can say that everything negative that has been written about this hotel is true â and more i was originally given a room with an air conditioner that did not function but it was the middle of the summer the temperature outside was 35 degrees celsius 90 fahrenheit the room needed a functioning air conditioner desperately the curtains were torn and the shades were broken not good for a room full of afternoon light i complained but was told there were no other rooms i complained louder â and they relented but only when someone went up to see if i was telling the truth go figure the rest of this review is about;3
on the surface the empire is a fantastic hotel location is impossible to beat the staff is courteous and responsive the decor has been chosen extremely well and the location has the benefit of being used in gossip girl so there is pop culture appeal the beds however were hard as a rock there were also only two very small and flat pillows on each bed and no flat sheet underneath the comforter when requested the porter brought up flat sheets and extra pillows but it was a shame to have to remake the bed at 1am when we just wanted to rest the room suite 1105 a corner suite with a separate sitting room was laid out well and decorated beautifully but curtains were stained as well as the couch cushions and lounge chair which we avoided sitting on also the air;3
i did see pilots and flight crew there which is a good sign rooms are clean and the overall hotel is perfectly fine the walls are a bit thin you will hear the people talking in the next room i wouldnt bother with room service they bring up the premade sandwiches etc that you can buy the lobby;3
this is one of the more difficult reviews i have done the description which the hotel puts out to the world is completely accurate the rooms are small but the bed is comfortable and clean there is air conditioning and most amenities you would expect from a 2 star hotel the staff were helpful and professional my major gripe is the bathroom facilities there simply are not enough there are three showers for an entire floor and this is not acceptable it means queues and cold water this is a shame as the rest of the hotel is fine;3
very average hotel for the location and cost i would recommend staying somewhere else and paying half of the cost not much advantage being close to park shuttle service is the same for all hotels in the area;3
the price was moderate but the rooms were tiny and the shower didnât have a door so everytime you showered you would get water all on the floor the shower head was also from above so it was impossible to not get your hair wet there was also mold on the ceiling which was gross the rooftop was my favorite part and very cool except the pool itself was kind of a joke with how small it was overall it was okay for 2 nights but i would go somewhere else next time;3
this is an average hotel for nyc good from what i hear for days inn standards water pressure was a little low and there is no room service or restaurant on the premise but you can order take out from menus provided though;3
my wife and i have stayed at the hotel for several days the location is very good special thanks to nicole at the reception she was very kind and useful for us thank you nicole for your time and help;3
underwhelmed this hotel has amazing heritage it was a former seamanâs hostel which was used to accommodate surviving crew from the titanic despite this heritage there is no reference to this anywhere in the building the rooms are a good size for nyc but are badly lit and the air con is very poor i would imagine the rooms are unbearable in the summer itâs got a nice location on the hudson river and some nice restaurants nearby i wouldnât recommend or return ps ru paul also used to live in the penthouse apartment at the top of the hotel again no reference to this anywhere;3
it is a good hotel in a good area but the room too noisy because of air conditioner machine of building the bathroom is small and not comfortable and perhaps need a lot of maintenancethe personal is very friendly;3
i recently stayed in this hotel for three nights to attend a business meeting i ended up changing rooms three times the first room though decorated beautifully was unbelievably tiny and the second much the same in these rooms there was about 18â of floor space around the queen bed plus the desk and the room was so small that there wasnât room for a full length closet so if you had anything other than short items to hang you were out of luck the bathroom while nicely equipped and also decorated very tastefully in a very uptotheminute style was so small that the small bathmat took up 100 of the available floor space sitting on the toilet meant your knees extended into the hallway the shower had a very chic fixed ceiling mounted shower head that was a lovely;3
like i said your management style said theyre going to send him up to the room when people was smoking pot partying banging on doors 4 oclock in the morning it was my anniversary weekend and we never get away husband did something nice and we had a horrible time when it came to us being back in the room the rest of your hotel was marvelous i loved it but the way you handled the situation was not good at all;3
an old hotel with pleasant helpful staff but in room facilities need better maintenance bellboy doormen did not get taxis but left me to find them for myself even when asked the heating system in rooms is very noisy and there is no working facility to keep heat at reasonable level that is not too hot;3
we were nervous after some of the more dour reviews and had low expectations when we arrived we found the room in need of some minor repairs but clean overall the room was quiet comfortable and met our needs the staff was great and accommodating reservations check in and check out were a breeze the apartments were 12 block off the subway and within walking distance to great pizza and two great groceries for the price we paid we couldnt have asked for a nicer better situated room if you come expecting a modest city style apartment and dont need luxury then woogo central park really fits the bill thanks woogo;3
i guess its my own fault but this was the second time we tried this hotel last time i thought it was terrible this time i booked a more expensive room but it wasnt worth it the room was small dingy and the bathroom narrow the public areas seemed dirty to me the staff are great which is a saving grace and the location handy but if you can find another place that fits your budget go there;3
the doormen were all friendly and professional the restaurant eds chowder served us a bad dish of skate the room was fine but no free wifi unfortunately the room service prices were also very high with a breakfast for two people costing roughly 90 the rooftop sign is iconic and beautiful though;3
good location near to macys and times square downside is bathroom badly needed updating couldnt have a bath because enamel peeling so could only use shower walls paper thin when next door used shower at 2am it woke us up thought they in our room also bathroom shelf tiny and floor in bathroom needed replacing this aside the ticktock diner was good for breakfast and we had cocktails in italian in hotel which was nice also i paid 160 pounds for 6 nights resort fee which i think really steep would only return if better bathroom;3
check in was nice and easy the receptionist was lovely and really cheery really happy to help had no issues with checking incheck out or concierge like some of the other reviews location is great however the rooms are in the small side even for nyc they are also really noisy even for nyc the heating makes a racket and walls are paper thin we could hear our neighbour coughing all night the bathroom is tiny and run down paint was peeling off and housekeeping one day didnt give us new towels for what we needed it for the hotel was ok as we were barely there but the rooms let it down so unfortunately wouldnt stay here again no major complaints just an average stay;3
good location within walking distance of all major attractions with nearby starbucks and convenience store nice clean room but lacked storage and bathroom was a little snug disappointed that pool wasnât open would stay again;3
overall the hotel itself was nice the reception nicole at the front desk was very sweet and checked us in early the room wasnt what i was expecting the bathroom was outdated and run down but overall the room was clean and the workers cleaned my room everyday which was a plus and they were friendly breakfast was good i went to the bar downstairs and every drink i ordered i found a bug in it fruit fly maybe but the bartender was nice and always made me a new one overall the hotel and workers were nice and the hotel itself wasnt a bad experience the area itself is disgusting homeless and drug addicts everywhere garbage on the streets definitely not what i was expecting i am from new york where im supposed to be used to this but i never seen anything like this;3
the third hilton we came across in 4 days while it was nice and clean and right across from the universal park the prices were astronomical and another hilton we stayed at an hour up the road was nicer cleaner and 13 of the price for the price i expected to have a wonderful experience yet when we called for extra pillows at 9pm they never arrived the room was clean and spacious we stayed on the executive floor but i would most likely never stay here again not worth the priceexperience;3
bed were too firm and the rooftop bar doesnât allow you to bill food to your room so if you just run upstairs for a quick meal or drink be sure to bring entire wallet it was an not convenient at times;3
i am so disappointed that this property charged to hold bags after our checkout and until our pickup for our departure from the cityâ that 5 pushed me over the edge and i will be leaving negative reviews on google and trip advisor i booked a queen view roomâ there was no scenic view of ny as promised in your website the view in 3340 was of the guests in the rooms across from us we were in the armpit of the cornerâ the room size is misrepresented in the pictures on the website and the room was so cramped that i hit my knee on the heater every time i attempted to exit the bed and maneuver my way around the heat unit to the bathroom and of course there were no amenities such as complimentary coffee in the room or lobby if i were staying for more than one night i;3
you couldnt wish for a better location when walking around manhattan island the hotel is showing its age and is a little tired but perfect for the business traveller as usual with american hotels no tea or coffee making facilities are provided in the rooms with just an ice machine on alternate floors;3
the staff we encountered at the front desk was very lovely and extremely attentive at a quick glance the hotel looked extremely beautiful especially with the wonderful and unique color combinations unfortunately upon a more thorough look thatâs where the pleasantness ends there we a few large stains on the elevator landing on the 10th floor in our room there were a ton of stains on the couch hair in the bathroom and it just didnât appear the room was actually cleaned properly to top it off my boyfriend woke up with bites on his back we didnât see any bed bugs but it did make us very uncomfortable;3
hi i dont usually review hotels dont use hotels very often and im not one of those people that complain about everything this is a great hotel people are friendly and it has a bar on the top floor and it is nicely decorated at the same time i felt like it didnt offer what a normal hotel would such as free wifi free breakfast a door or shower curtain on the shower a normal coffee machine charging 3 for each packet of coffee is a little excessiveespecially when you can get starbucks downstairs it also took us 10 minutes to get an elevator one of the elevators dont work and the others take forever they decorated the elevators with these steel moldings which im sure weigh a ton they dont need those the pool is also very small wifi is 13 for a day our;3
for a night at lincoln centre this is the perfect place but be prepared for a late 60s sort of experiencerooms are very small bathroom is tiny bed are on the very very firm side and air con sounds like a tank revving its engine very new york for a quick overnight not a long stay;3
stayed at the new yorker for 4 nights itâs location is fairly central for getting around new york and all the attractions our room was always kept clean the room itself was small and basic but that wasnât really an issue for us as we were only using it to put our head down each night so it served its purpose be aware they charge a compulsory 31 a night fee for facilities i personally think this is a bit of a scam they say itâs to allow use of conference centre gym wifi and international phone calls i wasnât in new york for a conference or to use the gym and my phone provide 02 charged â£4 a day for the internet phone calls and messages which is a heck of a lot cheaper than they are charging my partner is with 3 she didnât have to pay anything with her contract this;3
being very close to central park julliard lincoln center and columbus circle the location is a nice one the subway to columbus circle is a short walk we had a nice view of lincoln center from our room the room are very small and the washroom is tiny there is no counter space at the sink so you need to put all of your toiletries on the little shelf above the toilet make sure you keep the toilet seat down or things that fall off the shelf will take a dip the shower is doorless which ensure than that floor will be a small pool when you are finished your shower there was no late checkout option available when we stayed which was disappointing since we had most of the day remaining when we checked out before our flight we were able to check our luggage with the doormen;3
recently i attended un meeting so had a chance to visit this hotel the hotel is having just very average facilities and charges wise it is very very expensive we had four days stay and paid almost us134708 the hotel is not even included the breakfast in room rent not even the water bottle the towel in the bathroom were in a very pathetic conditions the reception was just managing the show somehow but facilities wise not much to facilitate;3
checkin problems toilet very small and always wet and internet limited to 2 devices in the room everything was ok but not an amazing experience the rooftop was a nice place to hangout and the hotel was in a good location;3
very expensive for a very basic room at least the week i was there small room but not unbearably so no refrigerator or coffee maker had to request both and then had to pay for refrigerator which was put on the floor because there was nowhere else to put it although it was the typical size for a hotel room also had to keep suitcase on the bed because of lack of space only one electrical outlet accessible i expected much more for the price of the room and some renovation is needed throughout the hotel i have heard though that some rooms the expensive ones have been renovated excellent location for sightseeing but noisy neighborhood staff was very good and helpful and you have to show room key to get to elevators which is good security elevators were good;3
the new yorker is well situated especially if you are attending events at madison square garden or wanting to shop at macys its also an easy walk to the times squarebroadway area if you are reasonably fit security is good with entry to elevators monitored the staff is personable and helpful overall but be sure that you approach the information desk and not the wyndham sales desk closer to checkin where you will have to escape a fairlyhighpressured real estate pitch when first built it must have been a real toptier hotel its features reflect its age it has an elegant lobby some rooms that are quite spacious and some that are quite cramped ours was one of the latter and we could hear the guests in the next room well enough that we could probably have;3
stayed here for a family holiday good location we walked to most places and right by subway for trips further afield however decor very tired and could do with a refresh facilities also mediocre had to pay extra for a fridge no tea making facilities and had to pay to leave luggage on last day have never had to do that even in budget hotels iâve stayed in before would look elsewhere if we came to ny again;3
the best thing about the empire hotel is its proximity to lincoln center catch a concert visit central park go the timewarner center grab lunch at bouchon bakery if you cant get reservations for per se in good weather hang out at the hotels rooftop pool and deck just dont plan on spending much time in your tiny room if you just need a clean pleasant spot to sleep shower and dress while taking in the sites of midtown manhattan youve come to the right place its not cheap but it represents a good value given this location;3
i enjoyed my stay here but there were a few negative things that happened which might make me hesitate to recommend it to others my girlfriend and i arrived a few hours before check in which was supposed to be at 4pm we were told it would just be a little bit longer and could precheck in but couldnt get the roomkeys until the room was ready and if it was ready before 4 we would get a text notification ok no problem unfortunately we werent given a pass to the parking garage so we walked to get lunch at a nearby place thinking it would only be an hour or so before our room was ready 4pm rolls around and we went to check in only to learn that our room still wasnt ready by this time we were pretty fed up with sitting around the lobby and had to make a special;3
the hotel is good and well located unfortunately i left a pair of sandals after checking out and when two hours later i came back for them they were never found i was left angry as i felt betrayed by the room staff and housekeeping seriousness;3
we were two couples visiting nyc after a caribbean cruise and chose the empire because of the price point and location the hotel is suited close to lincoln center and easy access to performing arts that the met has to offer literally steps away and across the street columbus circle is just down the street and central park close by too the hotel has seen better days and although renovations are underway there are some tired looking areas we arrived ahead of registration and the hotel staff offered to store our bags until the room was ready our friends room was ready so we stored our bags in their room and headed out to explore nyc in subzero temperatures that hit the city recently after a full day of touristing we returned late to the hotel and stayed in room 1041;3
stayed at the wyndham in new york for two nights after a twelve hour train journey the hotel is in an idea location but the beds are the smallest weve ever slept in they call them queen size but beware they are only four foot wide could hardly sleep even though we were exhausted after train journey complained too reception but was told all the rooms had the same size beds which we found hard to believe the manager rung our room and gave us 50 dollars off of a meal in their restaurant wont be staying there again and we stop over in new york a lot and found much better hotels nearby;3
the rooms are clean but quite old and a bit rusty in the shower no wifi which was very unfortunate the location is next to the park but theres no real view to the park the staff is really nice though and helpfull i wouldnt go back;3
an old building spruced up but still a faded feel rooms at least mine very small with a bathroom that hardly accommodated one person service minimal they forgot to give me a package waiting for me on check in and declined to accept an airline loyalty card whats this a credit card so convenient for lincoln centre and lower west sidebut at 300 for one night not good value;3
hotel was in a great location right on broadway and only a few blocks from central park lots of cafes and restaurants etc service was very average the concierge barely smiled and just stared at people as they came and went the 4 elevators that service the building are extremely slow 1 was broken the 4 days we were there we would wait on average 34 minutes every time we wanted to use them there was an ice machine only on certain levels of which on level 5 there is no sign to show where it is so when i went back to my room again after waiting several mins for the lift i rang reception to ask where it was and they told me it was next to a room number so i wetn back to that level and then when i found it it was out of order and to use the one on another level so i;3
below is the reply i sent to management at the jane following your stay the jane sends an email asking for feedback and so heres my feedback hello jamie et al in all candor the jane is suffering a bit from neglect iâve stayed at the jane essentially since you opened and time does take a toll on things this last stay was problematic first the positive your staff remains exceptional front front desk to bellhops and tidying crew your staff is exceptional there is something about the uniform and way they interact with guests there simply isnât a greater team in a midrange hotel group in new york second the less than positive i stayed in room 353 the room next to mine must be individually;3
an interesting hotel convenient for anyone wishing to enjoy the sites and venues around that part of new york my particular interest was the proximity to the the lincoln centre especially the met and geffen hall;3
but not enough staff on during the day for the star rating but looks great the roof bar is good but a bit of a pick up joint after work pool closed when i went but had not said so on the website even on the days i was there;3
from the hotels own photos the place looks amazing so we were a little surprised when we turned up as the hotel is a lot more rundown than you would think from the photos the neighbourhood is unpleasant and far away from main tourist attractions and nice restaurants however the staff were nice and the breakfast was impressive;3
we stayed there for 5 nights in may 2011 we booked a double bedroom with private bathroom all in all it was ok for the price but very basic and not that clean be warned you must verify room before accepting it we were given room 603 at first but we refused it room was really tiny bathroom really tiny as well shower tap was dropping non stop aircon had no button to switch it on or off after refusing it we were then given room 610 which was really larger both room and bathroom and aircon was working this time positive points price the only valuable reason to stay in this hotel for 5 nights in a double bedroom with private bathroom we paid only 700 room the 2nd one was quite large including a closet a fridge a drawer tv and a big bathroom tv;3
old school ny does feel a bit like you are in the 90s the hotel could do with a refurb but for a few days it was an excellent location to get wherever i needed to i got a room with a living space sofas and 2 showers and baths so it was almost like an apartment;3
the hotel staff was very nice and friendly the room had great views facing the park and mountains the restaurant food was better than expected the best part was walking to universal studios and not worrying about parking the flaws of this hotel were dirty sheets in the sofa bed the live music in the restaurant and no offer to assist with a wheelchair when my son hurt his leg at the park that was disappointing because i just wanted to borrow a wheelchair to get him back to the hotel hes ok but still policy over practically is why this property didnt get a better rating;3
the highlight of this hotel is the really helpful and friendly staff it is conveniently located near most main attraction some area around the hotel look a bit run down but over all not bad the breakfast is great especially the made to order omelet bar with all fresh veggies the rooms and hotel infrastructure is kinda out dated and could use an upgrade over all its a very comfortable hotel for the price and location one problem was the tub didnt drain but that was repaired within 5 minutes oh and the free wifi is spotty is some areas id definitely stay here again if in the area;3
we arrived by train at 1100pm and were pleased to quickly find the hotel just over the road from the station the lobby is on a grand scale and busy around the clock as it turned out we were quickly dealt with and on our way to the room on floor 24 the only issue here was a surcharge for wifi business club etc that we didnt want but it was not optional and we will take it up with our tour operator coming out of the lift on floor 24 you are in a broad landing area with at least 4 lifts it is a bit dingy and this impression intensifies as you follow the corridor signs to your room the room is small and dated perhaps a bit worn in places and certainly dull but adequate for purpose given our short stay a little bit of corridor noise at times but we slept ok and;3
ok so maybe i was unlucky but the hotel was just not very nice it was clean enough and had most facilities but no coffee machine in usa come on quite ridiculous to be charged for one hotel fills itself with kids who board there the diner is nice enough but staff are rude but not sure if that is just new york;3
stayed here for 8 days in august 2016 good sized room for 2 adults and 2 preteens bathroom small with old fittings the overall decoration of the room was okay but hadnt been updated in a long time we booked a room with a view and we were not disappointed incredible vista from the 32nd floor staff were efficient and friendly but nothing special location is excellent very practical if very busy outside it is new york though overall i would recommend this hotel based on location views and exceptional value for money but with the proviso that the room we stayed in was in urgent need of updating;3
we recently stayed for 3 nights with 2 boys ages 6 and 7 the rooms and property were nice but i was expecting a more resort feel none of the staff were rude but they gave off a vibe where they were bothered by you i had to call down for extra towels every single night there were 4 of us and they left 3 at one point i got out the extra blanket and pillow from the closet and the blanket felt very rough and had a hole like it had melted in the dryer i bought some things from the gift shop and thought it was odd to have to buy a bag for my things parking was a bit steep 28day to self park the main entrance was under construction we purposely chose this hotel over the sheraton that was right next door because they were having construction it also does not include;3
this is my first time staying at this hotel the only thing that creeped me out was the elevator which is small and makes you feel claustrophobic however the room was clean i am glad i received one of the updates rooms which was perfect its in walking distance to stores eateries and train station i loved it i would definitely stay again;3
this hotel has a lot of pros and cons pros great location three restaurants subway entrance next to building next to penn station train station next to madison square garden amazing view of empire state building in some rooms nice water pressure each unit has own air and heat control amazing for 1000 plus room hotel good security 24 hour diner pre pandemic for new york the rooms are a decent size room service was offered but only for the diner there are some major cons though the walls are paper thin you can hear a lot of noise outside this is an old building historic and can give a creepy vibe only two elevators were working out of the ten they have and service elevators there are six of them were not offered to guests long lines to get to rooms;3
good side staff at reception desk are very helpful and responsive though they dont look warmly all the time location is very convenient for us to walk through to the lincoln centrejust across the street room is not very spacious as what weve been told but very cosy and clean got upgraded for one of the rooms that we booked which is good but the room is still not very spacious cant imagine how small the room is if not upgraded bad side bathroom is super small with toilet tied up next to the wall you can imagine how uncomfortable it is shower area is only equipped with a shower curtain which is not very convenient got charged for usd244night taxes included but dont offer free wifi and breakfast is a bit expensive not good value for money if you compare;3
this historic hotel has a beautiful lobby but long waits for check in and for luggage service we waited 10 minutes before anyone came to the luggage station despite other staff telling us it would be just a few minutes also during four different showers the water was crazy flashing between freezing and scorching makes for a very uncomfortable experience the location is great and we had a nice view;3
the room has no place for cloths and heatsystem and elevators live there on life bathroom must fresch up the locaded of the hotell is perfect for exampel 1 minutes wallk too metropolitan subway round the corner;3
stayed one night in city to visit my son booked a room on priceline big mistake we had 3 people and could only buy 1 room not knowing wed show up and get a closet spoke with rob 2 nights before and asked if we could secure a room with 2 beds was rudely informed of a 50 upgrade fee and then informed that the room i had would not allow 3 people fire hazard basically being forced to pay 50 bucks more noted on other sites that several ppl were given free room upgrades extremely small room we bought an air mattress and suffered through 1 night could barely move sheets were filthy and covered in blood pics makeup on pillow cases clearly not cleaned called for new sheets took two trips to get actual sheets bc the man was confused and kept brining mattress;3
room was small even for nyc standards stay away from any room by the elevators room 710 i heard the whizzing of the elevator all night checkin staff were nice lobby was amazing expensive for what you get compared to other nyc hotels i have stayed at you cannot turn on the shower without getting in it and getting wet;3
upon arrival we were quickly efficiently checked in as we were in new york for my 30th birthday we had a free room upgrade to a room with a view vouchers for a complimentary breakfast at the tick tock diner before arrival i was advised of a â£45 per night incidental charge but this was just held on the credit card not taken what wasnt expected was the non refundable 29 taxes per night service fee which for wifi that dropped frequently a gym we didnt have time to use we thought this was quite steep our room 2435 was a corner room on the 24th floor it was a good size with a fantastic view of the empire state building madison square gardens to the right the room was clean the bed was comfortable the curtains are blackouts keep the room really dark in the;3
this hotel is good value for money do not expect a very luxurious hotel on the side of central park do expect good service nice people the rooms are small but very clean quite near some subway stations 110th on the blue or orange line is closest just a bit far out of the centre but the price of the hotel is worth it;3
the internet didnt work the tvs were all not working throughout and if it had it was one of those old boxes the elevator feels like its about to break the staff was courteous the air conditioner worked and was noisy enough to drown out other noises great location for the parks and the mellow upper west side of manhattan the other people staying in the hotel were all polite and friendly;3
location is perfect for the restored hotel near the lincoln center easy to get in and out verse the hotels around the theater district from those logistical aspects this is a nice spot walking in the door i thought i was in a star wars bar with planets from around the universe well represented it isnt a typical business style but frankly it was just fine rooms are small but adequate and i thought the shower stall was nicely sized with a large overhead fixture i could see the city street so i did hear some sounds at night but that wasnt over the top could have used a water bottle in the room and the heatingcooling system is from a black and white movie era for a hotwire purchase it gets better than average marks;3
my hotel visitstay was for conference attendance for a weekend the hotel was not prepared for an attendance of approx 1000 attendees the restaurantbar did not have adequate staffing and the registration desk should have had more staff for arrivals;3
for a weekend at lincoln center we couldnt have had a better location we were able to walk to everything including central park the bed was comfortable and the staff could not have been more gracious the price was reasonable enough that if we are back in the area again wed probably consider returning but 1 those bathrooms what were they thinking i understand small but why isnt there a door over the entire shower stall or if theres only going to be a half door why isnt there a way to put the shower head up so it doesnt throw water over the whole floor of the bathroom the hotel must be spending a fortune laundering the towels needed to sop up the water so we can use the bathroom and replacing the soggy toilet paper rolls in addition because there;3
we arrived at 5pm and still had to wait an hour for our room booked a room with either empire state building or river didnt get it requested extra sheets and blankets we were told they were in high demand they will deliver it laternever happened bathroom very uncomfortable with one tiny shelf to put your cosmetics and toilitries rooms very clean and spacious with a walking closet;3
this hotel has potential but they need to repair the broken spare elevators the two that work are extremely small and are used by guests and staff they also need to replace the carpeting on some or all floors in the halls and rooms the queen suite i stayed in was better than average but was costly the regular rooms that i have stayed in before need renovation and this hotel could get a better than average rating should they accomplish this;3
the staff were very helpful and accomodating the room however was average to below average although the room appeared clean and tidy there was a huge stain and dampness on the rug by the air conditiionerheater the tv was also unavailable the night i stayed which was inconvenient given that i was traveling by myself;3
this was our second stay this year at this hotel the showerhead wasnt working and the bathroom sink was clogged we had to call the front desk and wait 2 hours to shower the carpet in this room is worn out in several spots the location to universal studios cant be beat;3
a bare basics typical mannhattan hotel it does the job if you want to avoid paying 270 it has serviceable rooms and basic amenities great location next to many city attractions has a great 247 restaurant downstairs with good options menu front desk is average as you get the typical hurried reception assembly line but that is expected for the price in mid manhattan this is not a upper tier hotel but if you are traveling with family or on a quick business trip this will do as most of your time will be outside the room and the hotel;3
loved the location of this hotel the lobby is pretty the rooms were small but doable and very typical for new york city oveall the staff was incredibly unfriendly the only exception was the bellman on our last day who assisted with our bags and getting a taxi front door desk clerks and bar servers all need customer service training;3
the room was extremely small for the price the closet is a tiny hole in the wall with a curtain a grown adult can barely fit in the bathroom they give no option to check in early if youre trying to get a hold of the front desk good luck i was on the phone while it was ringing for 10 minutes and still no one picked up twice the service at the rooftop bar for lunch was not good at all the waitress seated us took our order and never came back we were sitting there with no drinks and finally had to track someone down to get our bill once nice thing was complimentary bottles of water each day;3
cant describe just how hot the hotel was during our stay the rooms were even hotter the air con is old and extremely noisy so very difficult to sleep if staying on the 11th floor you will undoubtedly be woken up by the dragging of furniture at approx 430am once everyone has cleared out of the rooftop lounge for some unknown reason the staff felt that they had to rearrange furniture at this time of the morning every morning and we were there for 4 nights my friend and i were so sleep deprived during our trip we were dizzy walking around during the day the rooms are nicely decorated and have a great powerful shower but they are very small you can just about walk around the double bed and no more the staff in general were friendly and courteous although we;3
i was looking for a cheap place to stay in the centre of nyc that was convenient for seeing all the sites going clubbing and in a safe location this hotel ticked all three boxes although the place was moving with bugs there were cigarette burns in the duvet cover the walls were filthy slander was scrawled over the do not disturb door hanger scorch marks on the walls the radiator didnt work and the fan in the window was held in with duct tape but i liked it we shared a bathroom with the whole floor and the window that looked out on to an alley didnt close so everyone could see you but still i liked it it was in a great location five minutes walk from times square the neighbourhood was really nice and there was a great little eatery just down the road;3
room ok as you would expect for the cost dated hotel but place was reasonably clean ideal if you just want a place to sleep eg tv didnt work we had the smallest towels in the world was one minor negative location was great for us and staff were helpful;3
the staff were friendly pleasant and helpful however the interior when leaving the nicely presented reception soon shown an outdated appearance this hotel could do with a makeover and even the facility charge is essential to their services which i find is ridiculous that we had to pay for âfacilitiesâ we didnât even use it was a nicely situated hotel within new york the empire state building just up the street and madison square garden just opposite even central park is just a 30 minute walk away the room was small queen room i might add it was noisy with no coffee or tea making facilities room 2553 it was okay but i felt a little disappointed there is a diner attached to the hotel called tick tock which is open 247 which is accommodating and do bare in mind if;3
the empire was an excellent location for us right near the subway and great for long walks in central park going to the museums lincoln center shows the price was okay and the room was small like a european hotel room was clean and comfortable they nickel and dime you to death room coffee and water they charge you for as well and internet we just used our cell service if we were going to that area of the city again id look at other hotels;3
we stayed 3 nights with two kids 11 and 9 years old the hotel was fine clean rooms quiet nice bathroom plenty of hot water nice pool for the kids all the essentials we stayed there because i wanted to be within walking distance of universal studios and universal city walk i have no serious complaints about the hotel but convenience to universal studios is the only reason why i would stay there again the beds are small doubles not queens and ours were sagging there is no shower fan nor can any windows be opened in the room so by the time the entire family has taken a shower the room has become tropical there is no way to air out the room internet was not included with the room fee even for a hilton honors member the cost of breakfast at the hotel was;3
location is ideal for lincoln center performances but several things made it seem like less than a first class hotel elevators stark and uninviting wifi not available in room unless willing to pay 10 per day per device kerig coffee machine in room but a charge of 3 per cup on the other hand housekeeping and engineering staff very prompt and courteous in addressing a request but the lack of amenities made it feel like a second class hotel and in that location with a little effort it could be the idea choice but i will look for an alternative next time i am in town;3
we stayed here in november 2018 i honestly dont have a problem with the place just dont know how to qualify it it is definitely not a hotel as it has bunks in rooms of 4 maybe other room types too i cant confirm so if youre 2 youll still stay in a room of 4 with empty bunks the other guests we met were mostly easterneuropeans etc and kept only to themselves couldnt really chat with anyone theres a tv room but we gave it a pass we rather went to the excellent pubs nearby i cannot really complain about anything else than the softness of the bed for me it was waaaay too soft i had back pain in the morning the shared bathrooms could get busy in peak hours when people leave for work but are cleaned well regularly which is a big plus the walls are rather thin;3
the hotel was very nice however it was extremely overbooked which caused the elevators to be over crowded and frequently delayed the restaurant buffet area spills into the lobby which is both strange and a pain to line up for food since the food lines are in the direct walk way of the lobby i was treated well though for the brand and the price of the stay i would likely consider alternatives;3
i still don t know where they have the pictures from their room the hotel is very simple and they dont offer breakfast it is closed to broadway and is quiet don t take the room next to the bathroom otherwise the guests may wake you up by shivering the rooms and the beds are very old;3
we got this place through priceline for 250 a night but when we arrived they talked us into upgrading to one with 2 beds at a extra 50 the room was nice enough but extremely small absolutely no drawers to put your stuff in tiny bathroom with nowhere to put things but on the positive side the beds were very very comfortable the shower was quite nice housekeeping was reliable and thorough they charge you 1295 per day per device even cellphones or ereaders for wifi this is inexcusable in 2015 and i always take one star away when a hotel does this the location is great being right across the street from lincoln centre near the subway with several trains excellent restaurants nearby close to the park the doormen were helpful;3
the hotel has a fantastic ubication in midtown manhattan 5 minute walk to penn station and 2 minutes from the nearest subway it has very comfortable beds we slept very well what i hated is that they charged 15 per night for having wifi and it was mandatory as the receptionist told me at our arrival i didnt like either the fact that the hotel is advertised with one price and then they add so many different things that in the end becomes the double you thought they should give total amount before the booking the receptionists are unfriendly;3
a very upscale hotel with extremely nice helpful staff at checkin and checkout as well as the bellhop however it is also an extremely expensive hotel that really only is above any other hotel because of its location ask for rooms below the 10th floor and that was honored but be prepared to pay for any little thing you might need to make the visit better ie parking daily and joining rooms really it cost you extra every day to have two rooms that are joined by a door we had very expensive very salty meal in the bar wouldnt waste your money for food that is too salty to finish when you can go around the corner to the good neighbor cafã© or n and out burger our daughter said her room service was fast the rooms were comfortable but we continually had to;3
russian riverboat cabin no roomette on amtrak no cabin on a 1930s transatlantic oceanliner or perhaps the venicesimplon orient express very close west greenwich village location and a landmark building the janes website sells its river views yes it is literally directly across the westside highway from the hudson river but id estimate 90 of the rooms cannot even see the river at all built in 1908 as a hotel for sailors and lovingly restored in 2008 the jane is beautifully decorated like a 1930 oceanlinersteam pipes wrapped in rope 1930s style carpeting and woodwork some doors have nautical portholes inspired by luxury ship and train cabins from the 1920s30s but with the latest technologyindividually dash controls the ac and heat cable tv;3
i stayed here to attend a conference in the city and the rate was pretty low which is why i chose it it was an adequate room pretty small though my interactions with their staff were pleasant and they were quick to bring more coffee and water to the room when requested i dont think i would stay there again even though i really had no complaints;3
stay here only if location is at the top of your list it literally is across the street from the lincoln center if you do decide to stay here get a suite regular rooms are incredibly small we had a leaky sink and broken acheater fan and so got upgraded from a regular doubledouble to a suite huge difference in room size even with that there is little space for storing items or hanging garments the bathroom is one of the poorest designs i have ever seen the shower door only covers half of the shower entrance so water sprays all over the bathroom floor when one showers the sink is flat and only a few inches deep making it very hard to drain properly and also hard to use it was nearly impossible to wet a washcloth without it dipping into the accumulating water in the;3
we chose this hotel because its walking distance to universal studio because we decided not to rent a car as were only here for 2 days prior to our cruise i paid extra for a quiet room it was away from the elevator but they gave us a room facing the expressway and the air conditioning is a bit loud low humming sound they couldnt change our room as they were fully booked the restaurant downstairs was convenient and we went for the buffet for breakfast but it is pricey my sons little box of cereal and milk were 7 we walked to the universal walk on the second day to eat at a crepes place instead the hotel does need updating wall paper starting to peel at corners but clean;3
room was very small even for nyc air conditioner was noisy bathroom door was rusty and peeling paint in places hallways were kind of dark the location is about the only thing going for this hotel the lobby is pleasant enough but the rooms are disappointing;3
room was nice and clean big tv and the bed was comfortable hotel close to lax restaurant and sncak shop were less than average poor food choices lackluster service parking was not free anywhere very expensive worse if you wanted to leave the hotel by car no amenities within walking distance;3
having read several negative reviews on this hotel i was apprehensive making a booking after a few initial queries issues i finally got a very nice and spacious room as a solo traveller the staff is most helpful they are definitely overworked at reception i like to mention samdum the bellman who is most friendly obliging re luggage storage tv was not working and i did have a problem with having to change key card every day during my 7 night stay never got a credible answer why it was so due to renovation work windows are nailed down for security reason in the lower floors hotel rather expensive for facilities available location a1 i will be back cannot afford the trump tower;3
we stayed for one night 104 the hotel is beautiful and stylish they were late giving us our room by almost 2 hours which was really disappointing obviously this was inconvenient in a number of ways not being able to relax before rushing to change for dinner late to our reservation and simply harried until we arrived at the theater do not stay in a room on the 10th floor the nightclub is above and it is loud until very lateearly im not sure if its open all year or just when the weather permits all the staff we encountered was friendly and tried to be helpful very close to lincoln center the room was a suite an upgrade i think from the corner suite we originally booked two bathrooms would be convenient if you are staying longer with more than two people in the;3
i stayed there for 3 nights staff is very good they let me check in a bit earlier and when i complained about a noise coming from the bathroom they fixed it right away location is perfect that probably the best pro of the hotel together with the staff they charge 20 per day for hotel fee not included with an online third party reservation they say is for the bottled water in the room the wifi and the coffee in the morning at the lobby i guess thats common but for that money internet should be ultra fast and coffee should be good quality two things to criticize the carpet is old and not properly clean for people like me with allergies thats a challenge the other thing is the size of the bathroom i know its the ny special but stillas you can seemy the;3
the hotel is conveniently located to the lincoln center and there are two subway stations in relatively close proximity the rooms are probably average in size for a nyc hotel but the bathroom is very small and the lack of plug outlets for electronics is surprising compared to more modern hotels the lobby area is chic and the desk staff are friendly the bell staff was very helpful with directions to stores and restaurants in the area the ac was effective in hot conditions but the control is not digital the shower had a glass half partition and no door so care was necessary not to get water on the floor the toilet and sink area were very cramped and worse than many cruise ships;3
my original hotel was closed so i had no choice and the booking agent sent myself and my aunt to the new yorker at short notice what i will say is this hotel is in a great location a very short walk to macyâs broadway and msg and the subway is directly outside the hotel on entering the hotel it appeared very grand with lovely art deco design but i was in for a shock what is labelled 4 star on a website is no where near it 4 star for location there are plenty elevators but only one or two appeared to be working resulting in queues and cramming not ideal with covid restrictions when we exited our floors the carpets were very worn and the corridors dark and not welcoming i was initially several floors below my aunt and had to ask to be moved to same floor which they did;3
yes the red line of the subway that will take most la tourists to where they want to go is close however i would still suggest renting a car and paying for the daily parking 24day just factor that into your total from the start we talked to other guests staying at the hotel and they really wished they had rented a car because the neighborhood is not great to walk in especially at night and they wanted the freedom of driving we did use uber once during our stay and it was convenient so that could be another option for transportation pros of the room seemed clean very large space refrigerator cons of the room minimalist decor seemed cold and stark no closet door just a rod for hanging coffee pot wasnt functional because pieces were missing our balcony;3
checking in was nice quick which was what we needed after 36hrs of traveling i found the room to be basic for a 20000 per night stay have defiantly stayed in better places for less the room stank of smoke but on arrival we thought maybe it was a damp smell didnt think too much more of it due to being too tired just wanted to unpack settle in as the days went by we realised the room smelt very strongly of smoke even our clothes started to smell we didnt bother mentioning it as to be honest we couldnt be bothered packing moving room it was nice to have an hour free wifi but had to go to the lobby to access it initially for the price we paid id have thought free wifi would have been nice but hey ho we hired a car for two days had to pay for;3
is it a 4 or 5 star hotelno it is not however it is in a nice residential area and close to cvs duane read pharmacy cafe 71 starbucks subway restaurant and train grays papaya mcdonalds riverside park and broadway and a few blocks away from central park my family and i stayed for 5 nights walked everywhere and never felt unsafe it suited our needs perfectly and paid under 100 bucks a night we were in the city to sightsee and not to stay at our hotel all day we had an issue with our first room but the hotel clerk was friendly and courteous they switched us to another room right away with no problem the bathroom towels linens are clean and smell like bleachi like that if you are looking for a hotel were you can be spoiled go swimming and to the;3
it was exactly what i needed a place to lay my head get a shower dont forget shower shoes it was good and convienant to all the places i needed to be ona real quaint and quiet street for manhattan;3
the first hotel i have ever stayed where room made coffee was charged at 300 per cup unbelievable adding insult to injury on two occasions coffee milk and sugar was left in the room but not cups;3
the location of this hotel made it easy to get around to many area attractions you are close to times square theatre district the subway empire state building madison square garden just to name a few we even walked to central park although it took about 30 min the hotel staff were all very nice the lobby was beautiful and having a restaurant and bar onsite is great we found the food was very good the front desk even called us after we left our luggage to explore hours before our scheduled check in to let us know the room was ready early we didnt even request that so a pleasant surprise on the opposite end of the spectrum i paid for the metro view which was one tiny window partially blocked by a wall because we were on a corner what a waste the room was small;3
the rooms are very small bathroom is nicely done and clean but very small very friendly and accommodating front desk great location for visiting family on upper west side there are many good restaurants nearby;3
it would be fine for an overnight stay to connect flights i was there longer for a business meeting and the limited menu and lack of daily room cleaning made it a little more rocky staff was friendly;3
location and service of this hotel was great my only two complaints no free internet in the rooms only in the hotel lobby in this day of age i think its absurd not to offer free wifi to guests especially at this price point poor shower design there is no shower curtain or door and water comes streaming out of the shower onto the floor might not be bad if one person is staying in the room but we were a family of three and the bathroom floor was sopping wet;3
i like this hotel nice room design very comfortable interesting lobbybar area a great attentive doorman that said i will probably never go again the design of the bathrooms is probably the worst i have seen in an nyc hotel the is no fan the sink is shallow and the faucet so low you can barely fit hands under to wash and pet peeve of almost every american hotel the heatac system you cannot close the curtains without completely covering it how useless is that sigh;3
we stayed at this hotel for two nights because of its location opposite universal studios it is very easy to get to by metro line from downtown la at a cost of 150 per person the rooms were clean but dated we were supplied with one t bag and 2 coffe bags and 1 paper cup between 2 adults and 2 children two attempts to the front desk to request more supplies the seafood buffet is very good but expensive considering the amount of restuarants at universal studios but gave it a try freshly prepared lobster brought to your table and heaps of other choices for a 3 course meal the pool area is a real let down as the outdoor furniture is so dated though fresh clean towels were provided and the spa was heated to a beautiful temperature;3
my family and i stayed there for the survivor season finale the hotel is beautiful clean modern and has excellent service the down side was that the couch bed in our room there was dirt and crumbs on it and the blanket was nasty when they brought me new linens they handed them to me at the door and i had to change them myself other than that staff was really friendly the gift shop is wonderful and it is right across the street from the universal studios;3
ok experience and rooms this hotel is only good if youâre going for business or friends thereâs not many places to walk to around the grounds so if you need to go somewhere prepare to take an uber food was subpar check in was a nightmare as the line was beyond long;3
great location and wonderful staff rooms are so small its hard to move around in them to close curtains and such very clean internet was spotty ac sounded like something was looseloud at night for the price rooms were small;3
thought id gotten a fair price when i booked and prepaid for my room online however when i checked in i was surprised that the hotel charged an additional mandatory resort fee plus tax i found this to be deceptive be up front and include all fees in the booking price;3
i booked this holiday through expedia and as i was doing my first solo trip to new york i wanted something that was close to some of the main tourist places as well as being close to the subway and restaurants this was my 3rd trip to new york and i was looking forward to the break and just being able to have some time to myself unfortunately my transfer from jfk took longer than anticipated so by the time i got to the hotel i was tired hot and hungry it was after 9pm so when i got to the hotel i was relieved to see there wasnt a queue even more relieved when i was taken to the vip desk where there is a seat not because i was a vip i sat did the usual explained that i was so tired after a nightmare journey she seemed pleasant and just breezed me through checkin;3
hotel was right in the center with madison square gardens the room was finethe staff wasnâ´t very nice and people need to be careful because they charge lots of taxes located just accros the penn station the staff was not very nice but give you the information you need the speed and stability of the free internet was bad nice bar but continental breakfast included was very poor another thing not so positive was that when you leave if you ask to keep your bags you have to pay a fee;3
old and tired with small rooms free wifi downstairs but not in rooms the location is excellent just minutes away from the subway supermarkets and laundrette microwaves are available and there is a fridge in the room the price is the big drawcard you will not find cheaper in manhattan;3
i loved the location of the hotel but they need to upgrade the furniture and carpet in the rooms the food was really good staff were really nice i truly had a good time staying at the hotel kudos to hyatt;3
all that was good about the hotel is the location constant waiting for elevators no personal attention well i understand a huge hotel really small room i have been to many other hotels with the same room type but i have never been to such a small one room cleanliness is sufficient but for two people one vial of shampoo and soap a restaurant adjacent to the place did not give priority to hotel guests also brought in from the street as a regular luggage storage at extra charge also for hotel guests it has always been part of the hotels service but probably not here i chose this hotel because it is part of the history of new york but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations;3
its difficult to give an overall rating as this is such a quirky hotel with tiny tiny closet sized rooms with shared toilets and shared bathrooms i stayed in this type room how can i say its great excellent or poor so i said average the room i was in was the tiniest room ive ever been in a dog house of a room just for a human it was a quirky trippy room i dont find fault at all with its size it is what it is you know this going there however the walls between rooms are paper paper thin so much so that you can hear every noise breadth sneeze movement word or wind of the person on the other side of the wall next to your bed and you are right up next to on the wall when you are in your bed and the room on the other side of my wall had;3
we had an enjoyable stay here we loved the room it was comfortable and quiet the staff were polite and helpful and this is in spite of a traumatizing even that occurred with housekeeping the day we were to check out we went to breakfast early hadnt checked outit was only 8 am we took our luggage to our car but left all of our food drinks for the trip home in the room as again we hadnt checked out and it was early we went to breakfast we came back and the maids were cleaning our room and had taken all of our food and drinks for themselves since they didnt speak english they called their manager brandon we were horrified it was only 9 am at this point and we felt violated finally the floor manager jerome called and arranged a reimbursement for us;3
we stayed for 3 nights in june in a group of six hotel is fairly outdated but the staff are helpful and the limo driver is amazing it has free wifi a huge draw for us decent free breakfast and the rooms are huge they helped us hire cars get pedicures and rent a limo driver for the night and was all so cheap its not exactly within walking distance of a lot of places but it wasnt too hard to get around in a hire car overall it was exactly what we needed;3
first the good the location is ideal for lincoln center strolling over for a performance and back is magical the park is very close the 5th ave stores are walking distance the darkish brownandgold decor is smart enough to remind you youre in the city but not so chic as to make you feel a frump the shaded hall lights are as suave as the muted light they shed now the notsogood the empire charges 1295 per day per device for wifi and the complementarylooking bottles of mineral water by the bed in fact cost 8 each using the coffee maker would set you back 3 in short at every turn youll feel nickeledanddimed or should i say tennedandtwentied the covers barely reach over the sides of the queensized bed which comes with three pillows not four;3
if you need to be close to the lincoln centre this is the hotel for you as its just across the road if not give the empire a wide berth the location is fantastic but the hotel itself is terrible i have given it three stars which should have been two were it not so convenient for the met opera our small room and underpar shower had virtually no wardrobe drawer or storage space the room was clearly designed for business men by other men no thought given to women wanting to hang up long dresses for example the hotel is so gloomy not only in our room but in public areas that you have difficulty finding lift buttons my partner and i were not alone to complain about this many people remarked on it including young people in their twenties hygiene is;3
great location for sight seeing rooms as to be expected breakfast was average but good selection heating failed the first night but ok the second night beds comfortable and staff friendly would visit again due to location;3
i booked this hotel last minute because this was the best deal that i could get the area it is located in is not the worst in the world and there is enough parking around lobby quite cramped and appeared old front desk staff were slow to respond while i was checking in but were courteous and helpful hallways very small cramped elevators and the hallways were cramped too the paint was chipping off and it smelled musty and old rooms had an old musty smell to it they had old crt tvs static filled channels and all which made me feel like i was back in the 90s i wouldnt walk on the carpet barefoot looked like it was over a decade old the shower head in the bathroom came out of a hold in the wall and was quite loose overall not the best but also not the worst;3
first time in new york and i was already aware of how pricey hotels and accommodations could be around the area ultimately i picked this place simply because of price their website already had a competitive price but lurking around i found even better through a third party it was the cheapest i found right next to central park so i thought that should be good the only transportation i used even from the airport was public transportation thankfully there is a metro station right by the hotel this is a major plus for those planning to use the trainsubway the entire trip and have plenty of luggage this location is also around the corner from a dr duane reade its like a rite aid walgreens all purpose store that is open 24 hours as for the hotel itself the;3
daughter and i stayed one night there cramped and damp feeling very small rooms and very small bathroom not in the best part of town either wouldnât stay there again it was also too far from where we needed to be so i should of researched the distance a little more just did not care for it at all;3
good location rooms a bit small but decent cleaning staff was not consistent one day i would have no bathmat another i would have no face cloths another day i would be down to 1 cup i had to write al list of stuff i needed on my 3rd day;3
this hotel is located walking distance to universal studios and also has a shuttle that goes back and forth city walk every 10 mins or so if this is your main reason for staying at this hotel then it wont disappoint here is the good 1 great location walking distance to universal studios 2 pool is nice and warm 3 internet has ok speed 4 rooms are nice and clean 5 staff is friendly except for the front desk staff not so good 1 hotel elevators are slow very slow 2 the front desk staff are not very friendly and accommodating 3 parking is expensive 4 local restaurant is expensive;3
this is an older hotel that reminds you of low priced hotels from the past it is not fancy but the staff is friendly and helpful it is a bit of a rabbit warren but my husband like staying there it is close to one of our children and we are not hotel snobs ð;3
i booked this hotel after receiving nothing but good reviews i emailed the hotel prior to my arrival and i received a reply guaranteeing a room on a high floor with a view of the empire state as i was there for a celebration when i arrived we were given a basic room on the 21st floor on the opposite side of the building with no view the room was in need of refurbishment but clean as we were there to visit the sites the room was just fine for a little time we would be spending in it on check in i was also offered a bottle of winechampagne as they noted i was there for a celebration i was advised that this would be delivered to my room however we didnât receive the bottle of wine at all during the 7 days we were there i am disappointed that we were promised 2 things and;3
ok so i was panicking after i booked this hotel with a no cancellation policy and then i read the reviews well some of the things were accurate but most of the reviews were completely off i was expecting the worst sure we saw one bugbut big dealits a big city and even your own house has bugs from time to time yes the elevators were slow but the building itself was fine great value in this hotelsuper close to the subway and great diners right there id stay here again for sure;3
very nice hotel in good area very close to central park only things that let it down was charging for wifi which is bad considering what you paying for room also they leave water at side of ur bed which we assumed was free but no they charged as mini bar usage water wasnt even cold and they charged near 9 a bottle;3
stayed here three nights in november 2006 i had stayed here before and knew that for the price it was clean enough no bugs and that it was affordable for nyc location was great close to subway close to central park;3
reception clerk did not have a smile when we checked in and even we had a nice room why put a sofa where you can be sitted and food breakfast it was not so good will think of it before coming back;3
stayed here for a week in august we are a young couple who went to go and see the sights first thing is that the location is fantastic about 510 minute walk to times square 20 minutes to central park and about an hours walk to south manhattan the hotel itself is very back dated the lobby is lovely big open space the room is small but not tiny the bathroom is possibly the worst part shower would spray upwards as well as downwards the bin men at 4am every day wasnât ideal iâd take ear plugs all in all a dated hotel in a good location;3
my little brother and i stayed at the days hotel broadway in nyc for one week from july 19 2006 we stayed on the second floor and i have to say it wasnt the nicest floor the elevator missed our floor the second day we were there and we noticed the floor above it were much cleaner and more well maintained the room was not the best but heywe werent there to be in the hotel room anyway and yesit smelled a little and yesbut i did not see one insect and our room was cleaned i should be us to the ghetto being from east los angeles beds were made and everything was left extra clean and tidy by the time we got back from running around trying to get laid checking out the nyc sights and the nyc girls the locations was great the 1 2 and 3 subway station is;3
beds are very small upon arrival the doormen were extremely friendly however reception staff were a little cold paid for hotel well in advance and were left with a bill of over 100 dollars on the morning of us leaving for âservices and feesâ not satisfied with the behavior of certain staff;3
the bed was comfortable and room was nice however there is the need to improve many things 1 tv was badly placed if two people were in the room the person on the left side of the bed would not be able to properly see the tv specially with the curtains open 2 air conditioning was very loud no matter which level it was the air was just making too much noise 3 toilet seat was not attached to the floor when you sit the seat will tilt and make noise 4 windows were not very sound proof and i was on the 10th floor 5 the dressers top drawer did not close you close it and it would very slowly reopen and stay like that on the good side the bed was very good the personal health products were also good and many towels and sheets were good and except for the;3
we stayed here for 10 days i was disappointed at the lack of facilities available for guests no coffeetea facilities they wanted 25 per day for a drip filter ð no kettle no laundry service it blew out our food budget tremendously as we couldnt prepare anything in our room disappointed as a wyndham guest who is used to superior standards across the wyndham spectrum i will say the location is good and we had a good view of the empire state building not somewhere i would stay again run down;3
we stayed here last month for just under a week the location is great right next to penn station so easy to get around from there the hotel is adequate comfy beds clean linen every day and realitively quiet for a new york hotel we had great views of the city from our room the hotel is a little tired but we loved the art deco ness of it;3
the location on broadway across from lincoln center is hard to beat the staff was nice and courteous our first room was so small it was hard to get around the bed because there was not enough space to get suitcases out of the way the closet was an alcove about 18 inches wide due to a fridge and a room safe there was not enough vertical space for my wife to hang her dress without it dragging on the safe and fridge we got a larger room for 5000 per night more it had a wet bar and a little lounge area but no dresser the closet was higher and about 6 inches wider there was no dresser or shelf in the closet i asked for a dresser and was told there was a shelf in the closet i told the desk person there was no shelf she insisted there was saying she had seen;3
a very busy hotel i guess excellent for a fast moving population for tourists i guess dont expect one to one service but then i guess not much time will be spent in the hotel anyway lots to see in ny;3
the hotel is very tired and with few of the things i would expect ability to make tea but tea bags not replenished no coffee shop breakfast was poor and parking expensive there must be better options our friends locally were horrified we had booked this hotel on the plus side the room was big and the beds comfortable;3
we spent the night here before an early flight out of lax the next morning the location is right across the street from lax and the free shuttle to the airport is convenient the room was average nothing special there were visible stains on the furniture and the walls were so thin we were able to hear our neighbors throughout the night unfortunately im not sure we would stay here again;3
the room didnt have enough wardrobe and luggage space the shower didnt have a door so the water got on the floor the room lighting was poor overall my stay was average the hotel location is good;3
we stayed one night while visiting universal studios very conveniently located for visiting the park it was a 10 minute walk or they have a free shuttle that arrives every 15 minutes to the park the lobby was lovely we checked our bags with the bellmen on arrival who were polite and fast it made it easy to spend our day at universal studios the front desk was helpful on check in we activated a digital key and got 2 room keys the digital key worked great the 2 room keys did not they didnât activate them and when my husband went down to get them activated they gave him a hard time he had the manager come over who gave him a couple water bottles for the trouble the room had a note in it saying they were in the process of remodeling and i hope the room we stayed at;3
we chose this hotel because a we got a great rate at a very busy time of year and b it was close to universal which we planned to go to for one of our days although it has excellent proximity to universal and city walk and was fairly central to other things we wanted to see it was a bit of a disappointment in terms of facilities the pool was quite disappointing we went once and left within minutes water was cold and there was not a nice restaurant to sit and have a drink while the kids swam the restaurant was like a trailer the elevators which i understand are being redone were crazy slow the room was nice and fairly large for your basic two queen bed room linens were nice room was cleaned well if you are just looking for a spot to sleep while;3
staff is was very nice and room service was great it is also very convenient to madison square garden the hotel is very old and needs some major updating bathrooms were small and very outdated window in bathroom would not close but maintenance came and fixed it average hotel;3
this is great hotel if you are attending universal studios it is right behind the building otherwise it is a bit overpriced the front office folks are very nice and attentive rooms are average the one are that needs attention is the breakfast options they are overpriced and really not much of a option at 20 person;3
nice and clean hotel no bedbugs in our room and the room was cleaned every day it was close to the subway and it took only 1015 min to walk to the shopping at broadway the staff was ok one guy was really serviceminded the others were nice and polite but nothing more the area was ok we felt pretty safe but i wouldnât like to go through the park too late in the night although two problems donât sleep on the groundfloor you could hear everything at the front desk including the front door slamming we changed room after one night the second thing the taxi drivers had difficulties to finding the hotel even if we showed the hotel on map try to point out the biggest street nearby;3
the location of this hotel is fabulous with easy walking to museums great restaurants and a perfect entrance to a fun area of central park the rooms themselves small even by ny standards are nice with comfortable beds and great water pressure the empire needs to address the leaking shower which i see from other reviews is an obvious issue no matter how we tried to jerryrig it we still ended up with a giant puddle on the floor after every shower the hotel lobby and bar feel more like jersey shore than manhattan the animal prints are cringe worthy and the couches and curtains are an attempt at swanky but miss the mark and are just cheesy we came to ny on this trip with a large group of friends so we spent quite a bit of time in the lobby and lobby bar area as;3
stayed here for one night only with the dog they were dog friendly but the only drawback was the extra dog fee and also being placed on what appeared to be a floor beneath the main floor yes a basement the room and hallways felt somewhat claustrophobic being dark and windowless our room was clean enough but again i felt somewhat closed in with our narrow window opening out to hedgerows other that the service and physical plant were very good we felt comfortable staying here the place looks somewhat worn and over used i am sure this place gets a high level of tourists and they have a lot of volume thats good because visitors are not really focused on the hotel good place to stay but you wont say wow;3
room was extremely hot and right next to laundry staff did move us to another room on third night each night it reached 80 degrees with the windows open and 35 outside and it was too hot to sleep at all;3
stayed for 5 nights on our first visit to new york the hotel days inn 215 94th street was a very long way out but plenty of taxis around and cheap we walked down daily and taxied back at night the hotel is being refitted and all though very tired it was clean and lovely fresh bedding made it a pleasure for sleeping in coffee machine in room and a good tv bath and shower ok but only had hot water when heating was on usually in the mornings or after 8pm very noisey central heating system but got used to it staff ok and pleasant would recommend this hotel if you like a good walk;3
truth be told i had a great time right up until i checked out when i received a bill that included a us29 per day facilities charge i queried it because relative to my daily room rate it was an extra 15 per day which is not insignificant apparently this facilities charge was for the use of wifi and the gym whether i actually used it or not its not the amount involved that i am concerned over it is that by deliberately not including this facilities charge upfront in the published room rate i believe to be false advertising while i did have a lovely stay at this hotel this experience made me depart with a bad taste in the mouth and unlikely to return;3
i decided to stay at the jane because of the excellent locationprice and because a friend had recommended the location to me i stayed for six nights hands down its hard to find a better deal in manhattan before i stayed i called the hotel and spoke with the staff both times they were very professional and friendly the decor is vintage and cool and although some people have complained about the sroera residents i did not find any of them to be creepy or sketch during my stay they pretty much mind their own business the problem isnt so much with the hotel or its staff but really with some of the guests who stay there particularly on the weekends during the weeknights it was pretty quiet i didnt think the halls reeked of cigarettes or anything like that i;3
great location good service and staff friendly rooms r old and donât smell great but great views from 22nd floor and beds are comfy very convenient to universal stydiis shuttles were a definite plus;3
dont expect to be in your room much the perfect hotel if you just want a place to sleep between exploring new york;3
i stayed in a single cabin and as a petite female i had no issue with the size of the room but definitely do not see it being a comfortable fit for anyone larger upon checking in i was given a room on the 5th floor that had no phone reception and was a dead spot for the hotel wifi i requested another room and the staff accommodated this and told me they would bring a key to my new room up to me 20 minutes later still no key so i had to go down and get it myself not a problem but i just wished they would have asked me this in the first place instead of leaving me hanging around both the rooms i saw were clean but they were also both extremely warm and the fan in the room was loud and did very little to keep the room cool the air con definitely needs to be updated as the;3
immaculate bed linen and bathroom cleanliness but carpets and seating very badly stained very off putting and really unacceptable to offer room in that state front desk informed on check out only one night stayed;3
this is a chic little hotel right across the street from lincoln center perfect for visitors from out of town who are attending events there we went to the opera as apparently did many other guests because when we got back to the hotel there was a long wait for the elevators only two of the four were working and they still were not working the next day for what we paid i expected better otherwise the hotel is also near lots of great dining options including moore food and drink where the breakfast buffet was a bargain;3
stayed here 15th dec for 5 nights not a christmas tree in sight not festive at all glad that i hadnt booked to stay for christmas staff who we saw were friendly but when we actually wanted some advise were told to wait for the concierge waited so long got better advise from the door man we travelled with my daughter her room seemed to not be ready ie no curtains no coffee making facilities no ipod dock as advertised when spoke to reception told we dont have these facilities for every room then why advertise that you do also you have to pay for the coffee etc we have stayed in a lot lower rated hotel and had free drink making facilities across the globe would have expected better from here the rooms where exceptionally hot although the outside temp was about 5 it;3
this hotel was chosen by titan holidays not me worn out look inside the entrance lobby lifts with minds of their own worn out room with dated equipment good size and clean but as for the window absolutely filthy i doubt it has been cleaned in 2019 see sttached picture bathroom weird you need thbe strength of hercules to turn on the shower no bath and the toilet bowl set so low i felt i was a child breakfast expensive this was my first experience of this chain of hotels and i was not impressed four stars more like a uk travelodge long time since i have stayed in a hotel this poor;3
jack hammers running all day in lobby staff more combative than receptive food in restaurant good pricing on their website does not reflect the additional 30 for parking taxes and ancillary charges;3
this place has just what you need nothing else a bed that was clean you had to climb down to get in it it was very low to the ground wash cloth towel trash can tv without cable radiators with steam that comes out to heat the room tiny elevator enough for 2 people and 1 piece of luggage or 1 person and 2 pieces of small luggage the room doors have real keys but only 1 per room they said it was for security reasons i was not prepared for this experience at all we were celebrating our anniversary and just stayed over in ny for the night we just chalked it up to you get what you pay for i would not go back again;3
my friends and i booked a room here for a one night stay while visiting a friend in west hollywood it was about the closest we could get rooms were updated and breakfast was practically made to order which was awesome keep an eye on the small print when you book we booked a double bed room not thinking we would have to specify four people we figured this was common sense for two beds but ended up paying more for the mistake the conceirege would not honor us anything for the practical mistake and we paid 30 extra per person 60 more than expected on top of that we could not cancel our room based on the 100 no refund cancellation fee good luck if youd like to stay here;3
this was the past part of our trip to the east coast after staying in good hotels in orlando naples beach and miami i must admit that booking into the empire filled me with doubt due to the majority of bad reviews on trip advisor i realise that all reviews are subjective but when most are scathing i didnt have much hope for our stay however i can only speak for how we found it and it was ok the location is excellent we had already visited new york in february for a week and had stayed at the staybridge suites on w40th that place is great but we fancied being closer to central park yes the rooms are small but we were only there for 3 days and spent most of our time out and about the bathrooms are tiny and the hotel is in need of renovation everything seems tired and;3
the room had been very reasonably priced the room was fine clean and comfortable it s a very large hotel so long hallways and waits for elevators but for the price its fine except the morning of check out a bill stuffed under the door showed we had a balance of 3500 we did not buy inroom moviesbut used the freeinternet turns out all rooms are charged this 3500 charge at checkout regardless so beware the internet is really not free and even if you didnt use the free internet you will be charged so room ended up being more expensive than i had chosen to pay very sneaky;3
we chose the empire hotel for its proximity to lincoln center we booked two rooms for our party of four a king and a double and when we checked in we were given an upgrade to a second king this particular upgrade was teeny tiny and overlooked hvac equipment considering we werent there to relax we didnt make a big deal out of it but if an upgrade is offered here or if you have high expectations you should check out both rooms first the bathroom could have used some tlc missing grout and caulk leaky bathtub dirty corners and molding the other king room was much nicer it was larger and had a great view of lincoln center overall a good visit though friendly staff helpful concierge;3
we stayed here for 3 night and found it a good location away from all the hustle and bustle of downtown our room was oldish and there was mold on the bathroom walls and ceiling there were no curtains on the window just an old blind there is a nice cafe across the street for breakfast coffee and lunches the subway is at the door step as well this hotel is ok for the price the staff are helpful;3
it is average at best as far as the hotel service no one person stood out as going above or beyond their job guest rooms are average nothing special amenities are also average at best fitness center was adequate and clean but fairly small the elevators are in the process of a much needed upgrade and are very slow letters in the rooms acknowledge the issues and concerns with elevators and request guests to plan accordingly very much in need of lobby and restaurant upgrades and updates it is old and worn location is perfect for universal studios but that is about it not near much else be aware there are additional charges for everything from wifi to microwaves to self parking it is not an inexpensive hotel value for the rate paid was at best average would stay;3
it has excellent facilities and location however i want to show my indignation towards the cleanliness of it since we stayed 3 nights my friend and i and the person in charge of the cleaning did not do hisher job â¦â¦ only tended the beds and added clean towels heshe never picked up trash never cleaned the bathroom which had an unpleasant smell of urine and did not replace the consumables shampoo conditioner soap etc i have waited to put my complaint to leave because i fear reprisals on hisher part if i made the mention excellent hotel but honestly i did not want to return like that its not worth the price we paid;3
this hotel is just across columbus from lincoln center which make the location very convenient the staff is very courteous and helpful we would not stay again because we were not comfortable in the room the room was small and cluttered with items that could be purchased eg a laundry bag slippers snacks etc someone else commented about being nickel and dimed to death i now understand what they mean you dont have to buy the extras but they are in the way our biggest problem was the uncomfortable bed it was actually painful for my husband and interfered with his sleep;3
were a fairly quirky couple who have been to nyc quite a few times in our 40s and as such we thought we would start our honeymoon in a hotel that suited our aesthetic the jane exudes a wes anderson kookiness and faded glory which exactly our cup of tea the location is perfect near to all the best west village and meatpacking district bars and restaurants we booked a captains room and i called ahead when i made the booking and when we were about to arrive to double check the booking was all ok and to see if i could request a queen size bed and one of the rooms with outside space the staff were fantastic and could not have been more helpful they arranged for us to have a lovely large room on the 2nd floor the bed was enormous and super comfy the room clean and well;3
i stayed four days in the hotel the location is good and the rooms are ok the noise level can be incredibly high though i also stayed in other hotels in ny and some rooms in the empire are way noisier than the ny average especially the ones that overlook the back of the hotel and are above the ac unit if you get rooms overlooking the street the hotel is quite ok i find the fitness centre is a real joke though and doesnt deserve its name it should be rebranded as two normal rooms containing some fitness machines;3
this was very bang average the cheaper rooms still 500600 per night are very small the bathroom is rather unremarkable and small it also doesnt offer any sizeable shampoo or shower gel as well as this there is a very loud aircon that will either keep you awake or when turned off the heat will do the same for this amount of money my three night could have been better spent;3
great location front desk staff could not have been nicer room on 11th floor was small but had everything that we needed it was clean comfortable and the decor was nice view out of our window was of lincoln center if you do stay at this hotel do not stay on the 11th floor because the roof top bar is above your room and on a saturday night you get to listen to the music vibrating and the people stomping around i am sure any other floor would have been much better the bathroom was tiny and shaving or showering flooded the floor towels were in short supply as was soap so bottom line if you want or need this location stay here but not on the 11th floor;3
the hotel was clean and tidy the checkin staff were polite and efficient we arrived a little late for breakfast so were sent to the burgersandwich bar where things fell apart there were no signs to tell us when the breakfast bar closed lots of staff but no one wanted to assist the order took forever to arrive and then just after opening to begin one of the staff came up to say the order was wrong how can you get a single order wrong after such a long time my recommendations are to sleep there and eat somewhere else;3
located in the heart of manhattan nyc this hotel is 25 blocks from central park and 13 blocks away from the subway depending on what line you need plenty to eat around the hotel easy access to anything the rooms were kinda small no mini fridge and rooms could use some updating and dont expect a continental breakfast but those are small gripes to me given where youre located and how easy it is to get everywhere you want to parking is best taken care of in one of the nearby garages as there is no on site parking its manhattan and its to be expected the staff is friendly and fast if you need help or extras like more towels and such i recommend anyone to stay here as long as youre not expecting the newest and fanciest amenities id really give this place a 355;3
the hotel is easily accessible from the subway station and location is good however it needs renovation desperately ac is old and beds are not comfortable our room had an iron rod protruding out of the bed stand which hurt one of us badly theyâve a daily mandatory charge of around 15 which is not clearly explained to the customers do ensure that you request for housekeeping each day as the daily charge includes housekeeping water bottles etc we were informed that housekeeping is chargeable when we asked at the desk and hence we decided to opt for alternate days which was a mistake on our part also we were told that water bottles snack bars are complementary but actually the daily charge included all this lifts were smelly will not recommend this hotel;3
as handicapped travelers attending an opera performance we wished to minimize the hassle associated our activities and therefore chose the empire hotel based primarily on it unsurpassed location directly across columbus avenue from lincoln center surrounded by good restaurants we were familiar with the hotel from previous stays it is an older hotel which has been updated to some extent over the years we arrived by car with a guest using a wheelchair and were immediately expertly assisted setting up the wheelchair transporting the guest to a lowered part of the curb and up to the room with our luggage with minimal hassle the whole process was smoothly done in reverse on our departure i agree with other reviewers that 71 was expensive for valet parking but in our;3
check in was very quick and easy when we arrived and we had queen rooms booked which were small but enough room for 2 people the room had a massive flat screen tv fridge hair dryer iron and ironing board and the alarm clock had usb charging points in it which i used to charge my smart watch and phone each night the small clothes hanging area is in beside the safe and fridge and was ok for shirts etc but no good for long maxi dresses which had to hang over the edge as they were too long for the space no great inconvenience the bed was comfortable and everything worked as it should but the noise from the ac system was deafening at times my husband had to wear ear plugs but i was so tired from the walking i managed just fine the bathroom was very small but the shower;3
i spend a lot of time in hilton properties so i have a baseline that extend from the low end to the resorts the hilton universal city is right at the cusp of needing renovation dated but not tawdry it is close to the 101 not much of an advantage if the 101 is at a stand still and an easy walk from universal studio it is not a great location if you have business meetings downtown or even in the hollywood area if you are renting a car expect to pay 30 self park a night if you do not want to eat in the mall the hotel restaurants are only so so and quite expensive expect to pay at least 40 per person the biggest issue i have is the poor service at checkin and the billing fiasco first it took 30 minutes to check in and the front desk person was not well;3
if you are looking a place to sleep and then go arroumd the city this is a good place good service intenet service decent bathroom good tv service;3
we visited this hotel as part of a short break to new york the plus points being it is in a convenient position for times square and very clean the minus points are the rooms are smallwith no tea or coffee making facilities when we returned from a days sightseeingwe asked at reception if we could purchase a cup of tea or coffee and we we were told that there is complementary tea and coffee on offer at breakfast time the air conditioning in our room was extremely loud good job i had taken ear plugs the receptionists who we dealt with were not very helpful and rather obnoxioussomething which we have never experienced on previous trips to the states the doormen were totally different and were really helpful and charming especially jeff maybe they should be on;3
pros the hotel is well located in front of the penn stationmsq gardenthe lobby is fine and the front desk people are attentive the gym was ok cons to get down from the 34th floor youâll have to wait for the lift 510 min the room is clean but very small good view of manhattan and the empire state from my room;3
if you are visiting universal studios for a couple of days or more this is a good place to stay it is a very large hotel with restaurants a large pool and is within walking distance of universal studios and the universal city walk it is a nice hotel with comfortable beds good amenities and good service you pay a premium for staying here though both in terms of the cost of the hotel and the cost of the extras consider not bringing a car because parking is very expensive per night and if you are visiting universal you dont really need one the pool and hot tub are very nice and they stay open late cabanas are first come if you are going to universal for one day i would consider staying someplace else the hotel is very family friendly;3
well positioned but not high class hotel small dark rooms standard queen room is unbelievably small watch out for hidden extras on bill like coffee machine in room concierge poor bad advice and wrong direction;3
the hotel location is awesome it is relatively close to hollywood my daughter and her boyfriend stayed in a king bed suite while i had a double queen bed room the two rooms are not joint and i only stayed there one night prior to checking into my conference hotel which was what brought us to la they stayed 4 nights first of all the staff is very friendly and responsive the hotel and room we stay in are clean and relatively spacious but there is a big stain on one of the chairs in my room and i only have a small tiled shower stall in my room the phone has not dial tone either;3
after reading these reviews on the hotel i really was expecting the worst i was on a school trip visiting new york so i warned friends to take towels and bed sheets they laughed at me but i told them after the reviews ive read ill have the last laugh they were right though i didnt need the anti bacterial wipes or pillowcases one room out of eight in our group did have problems with the toliets but the staff sorted it out quickly so it was not really a problem the hotel wasnt wonderfully decorated but it was clean and the showers were not a problem it was in a great location in my opinion and wasnt too noisy the room was big enough for four of us and the amazing amount of clothes that we bought and really didnt need i have very high expectations of;3
in russian accent are you leaving are you checking out imagine that all morning long from your 10th floor room nice no but this is how the empire strikes back check those hotel charges i have stayed in this hotel for work many times but i have noticed that small things have changed and not for the better first off the bathroom is about the worst aspect of the rooms no matter how small or smaller your room is the bathroom with that overhead shower leaves a lot to be desired i have never been able to wash my hair properly but it sure does get wet the hand wand is just insipid watching the hotel shower soak the bathroom door and eveything in the bathroom proves that form should follow function and not the other way but then again service is well missing;3
why did i book this hotel reviews were pretty good and best of all it has a pool on the roof as we were in nyc for over a week a couple of days by the pool would be great the pool as it turned out is tiny and was at the time absolutely freezing so in short did not use it but was a nice area to sit out and read anyway room wasnt ready when we arrived at two pm and even at the guaranteed checkin time of 3 either after a long haul flight it would have been nice not to start this way the hotel itself was great and the staff very attentive room was spacious and clean but oddly no bedside tables location is great for central park but quite a walk to times square etc but nyc is all about walking the charging for wifi thing is always so annoying and seems just an extra;3
old art deco hotel with some lovely features including terrace and courtyard but it is old and needs some attention we were also surprised that there was no information bookletguide in the room so making finding information about hotel services and local area was more difficult we found the staff polite and efficient but not overly friendly my friend was annoyed that the breakfast was advertised as hot buffet but itwas really a continental buffet with an egg chef egg chef was awesome and only pork sausage and waffles as hot selections also the line up for the one egg chef was tedious as we are finding in america the coffee was bad but this is not unique to this hotel the hotel location is on the outer edge of hollywood and in a mostly latino neighbourhood;3
please work on fixing the internet issue or remove the fact that internet is available because its not overall the experience was nice but i would have liked to use the internet comfortably in the comfort of my room instead i had to stand next to the door to respond to emails and that sometimes took forever or i would get kicked off thank you;3
it is in a good uptown location and the lobby is smart and i can see why it is very popular with european guests however the rooms are small even by ny standards and the full size beds are really small not only too narrow for 2 people but also quite short however we are all 6ft and sharing a room for 4 people so it was a struggle might be ok if you are smaller the bathroom is tiny but the biggest problem we had was the air conditioning unit which was unbelievably noisy and kept us up all night however the hotel were extremely accomodating and offered to move us to another room but we decided to go to a hotel with larger beds and they kindly refunded us for the night very helpful front desk;3
the staff were friendly great comfy bed but everything else was unremarkable tiny room old tv no cable loud bathroom exhaust fan no fridge or kettle spent a fair bit of money catching the subway everywhere because nothing is within walking distance;3
the wyndham is located a few blocks from time square and just a block away from penn station we came by train so this was very convenient however this convenience came with a cost its new york city so the hustle and bustle was expected but the many homeless sleeping on the sidewalk was a little more than disconcerting the hotel itself is dated and could use a new paint job our room was very small there were only two of us but the room felt cramped and the toilet is at a childs level the staff are very friendly and housekeeping is accommodating however the room we stayed in had a musty smell and the rug felt clammy on bare feet the bed and pillows were ridiculously hard and very uncomfortable as were the chairs in the lounge if i could sum up this review in one word;3
i chose this because i wanted something near the lincoln centre it could not have been much closer checkin was very gracious as was checkout as by chance it was the same lady and we were delighted to have a room well before the 3pm checkin time the room was a reasonable size although the bathroom was a little cramped the shower had only a half door so water sprayed everywhere and had damaged things like the door frame the bedroom decor was a little dark but that is a matter of taste it was clean and comfortable i shall definitely stay here again have already booked i am however very critical of the fact that they charge for a cup of tea or coffee that you make in the room this is the first hotel where i have experienced this 3 for a cup of coffee;3
i stayed in room 406 late may early june 2012 the room was clean and it was cleaned satisfactorily every day the room was modest see photos the bath towels were small but when i asked for extra they gave me extra i used the microwave in the basement to cook my cereal the front desk people were courteous they stored some perishables for me in a small refrigerator at the front desk my bed was firm but i slept well on it there were no bugs of any kind that i could perceive in my room repeat in my room i did not get bitten or grossed out in any way this place is very convenient to the grand st subway station and i had a view of the park across the street where people exercise in the mornings and play soccer this is smack dab in chinatown its likely;3
from arrival you are in opulent surrounding from the entrance through reception and the lobby and bar step out of the lift and you wonder where all the opulence went it is clear to see where the priorities lie with the empire and it is in its image not the substance shabby tired corridors and rooms our shower was a bit tempramental to set but once done it was quite good although the extraction was pityfully inadequate the room itself was clean and resonably fitted out but no cupoard only a curtained off space everything is extra in the room and wildly overpriced the lobby bar was a great place to hang out after 10pm and the cocktail service is superb i liked the way the service charge was added to your bill as it saves trying to work it out for yourself location;3
the empire hotel is my go to when visiting manhattan the location is the number one reason and the staff is the number two danny and luis at the front desk are willing to work with me and find solutions to whatever issues arise the general manager scott takes great pride in the establishment and it shows and yes the rooms are smallitâs nyc the air conditioning is iffy at timesitâs nyc the street can be a little noisyitâs nyc having said all that my most recent visit was marred by terrible non functioning air conditioning terrible shower in the room we were switched to because of no air conditioning in my original room how about thisno hot water no fun taking a cold shower this place is a dump any where else on earth they gave me 100;3
the room was clean which is most important to me but there was a lack of service which bothered me my used cups were not replaced and my used towels and washcloth were not replaced after the first day i placed them on the floor the next day and they did not replace the washcloth aside from making the bed i am not sure they did anything to the room each day the appearance of the room was ok but you could tell it was just surface level improvements the bathroom updates are not to code and the vanity is less than one inch from the toilet making it extremely uncomfortable to use with plenty of choices in nyc i will not be going back;3
this hilton is not exceptional however it is in a good location we were here for four days and overall enjoyed our stay the positives were the location near universal studios and the breakfast buffet in the lobby was very good the negatives included the elevator which was terribly slow we often took the stairs because it was only four floors up the small awkward pool and the parking garage being very far from the room;3
i have stayed at the hyatt place and marriott courtyard both very similar to this hotel but both i would say are better than the hyatt regency so next time i go out i will be going to one of those instead;3
we were recently in nyc for our sons college graduation the empire was on columbias list of suggested hotels so when we found a decent rate we booked here located beside lincoln center the location is wonderful and very close to the subway the staff was very accommodating allowing us to check in before 300 and upgrading us to a king room the room was nice with a lovely view of lincoln center and on the 8th floor so we avoided the street noises the bed was very comfortable and there was a nice desk area we were given an access code for free wifi but the room furnishings showed a lot of wear chipped paint etc and the bathroom was less than adequate very small no counter space no shower door and no fan and i found it offensive that;3
just back from a great visit to nyc nice hotel great location between times square and central park on broadway really nice friendly staff especially said and julian one downside is if like me you arent the type to be up and out at 7am is that housekeeping knock on your door really early was fine with the do not disturb but then generally they didnt bother with your room beds are extremely comfortable and shower amazing now the disappointment after returning home i noticed the hotel had taken â£190 from my account there was no reason to do so as if only had a 4 box of snacks from the room tried contacting the hotel via facebook and email just to be totally ignored 4 days later and still no answer or refund this was going to be the place i stay on my frequent new;3
staff is friendlyhotel is large the bar is the coolest thing about this hotel its dark red velvet wooden ceilings and walls which are darkly stained tiny sconces on the wooden pillars its an old world style and the ballroom is quite large and darkdarkdark i was surprised to see how many people were streaming in at 1am on a tuesday this place gets hopping id stay here again but its very basic but is situated in a good area;3
the hotel looks great but dont look too hard its not as tidy or cool after further inspection doors slam prettying loudly and rooms are small service is lacking at the restaurant and dont count on ice being delivered if you want that bottle of while chilled the location is great;3
this hotel has an excellent location and great ambiance but the rooms are somewhat weathered looking and the elevators are old and take forever i would give this hotel a much better rating if the service people were slightly more friendly and the rooms were repaired to look new oh and if their elevators worked properly and promptly;3
whilst this place is some way short of its art deco post ww2 zenith these days it is still an iconic hotel that retains more than a hint of its historical past these days it plays host to hoards of both national and international tourists as opposed to the jet set and many areas of the building are crying out for a refurb but the rooms for nyc anyway are generously sized it offers guests several eating drinking options and is ideally located for exploring the great metropolis of nyc being no more than a stones throw from madison square garden and penn subwaylocal commuter train station apart from the needtorefurbish issue the other things that niggled were the poor fit of the hotel room windows which was particularly unfortunate as the outside;3
lets face itthe jane is not for everyone when i read some of the few negative reviews i wonder what these people exactly had in my mind when they book their rooms did they not do a little researchmaybe the cheap manhattan price sucked them in well let me tell you i paid 90 for a closet of room so tinyand i loved every minute of itthe jane rocks yes i had to share a bathroom and sleep in very small quartersno problemlove the atomosphere of this hotel the staff were so friendly and helpfulno attitudecool awesome neighborhood hotel has a ccol history if you stay heredo a little research if its not for you no problembut if you are like me not uptight and up for an adventure you will love it;3
stayed 2 nights at the hilton universal city just 8 minutes walking from universal studios thats the main attraction here the hotel rooms are outdated the tv in my room was about a 32 tv who would expect that at the hilton ive stayed at hampton inns with 40 tvs also the carpeting was a little on the worn side but the main floor of the hotel is where they spent the money there is a nice lobby with sofas free lemon water and a nice restaurant very pricy the shuttle to the universal studio runs every 20 minutes or you can walk 8 minutes also there is no negotiating with the parking situation they charge everyone 24 dollars a nights another way for the hotel to make money absurd probably wont stay here again even though i got a great rate on the;3
myself and my sister stayed in a twin room with private bathroom the room was very small and basic however clean and manageable for a short stay really good position for getting around london hammersmith tube station is a 2 minute walk up the road lots of shops restaurants and bars also 2 minutes up the road;3
very well located and i quite liked the old skool art deco feel off this hotel and whilst i hear what people say about it being a tad tired it is for me that wasnât a distractor large room with super comfy beds teeny tiny bathroom which i think would be a tad painful if a large person or you were trying to navigate kids in and out of the shower etc but it was very clean with lots of towels very long queues for lifts but hey ho not a biggie but they charge 5 per piece to store luggage which is an outrage not once in all my years of travel work and social across the spectrum of hotels iâve stayed in have i had to pay to store luggage beforeafter checkout on principle i would never stay at this hotel again nor would the three others in my group;3
was in nyc for the weekend needed a hotel for friday night only and since its the holiday seasonalmost every hotel in town 3 is 300400 on fri and sat nights so finding astor on the park for 210ishwas a great deal quick facts not within walking distance to times square 40 blocks away right across from central park very convenient building is old but isnt most of nyc staff at front desk were polite and smiling door locksbedstvcarpetac unit are all out of date but functional bathroom was actually quite nice nicer than bedroom the walls were kind of dirty bottoms line for what we paid we thought it was pretty good for a place to stayespecially due to the proximity to central park i wouldnt want to stay there for any more than 3 days;3
i stayed one night at empire hotel and its one of the few suitable hotels in nyc that provides government rates so for that purpose it was fine the decor is over the top very gaudy the location is fabulous and i would stay there again just because of the location i had a tiny room on the 2nd floor that looked out over large ac units that were quite noisy my sink did not drain properly the shower was ok the bed was ok but the pillows were hard and there was no separate top bed sheet just the comforter or nothing this is the first hotel ive stayed in that charged for in room coffee 3 for a keurig cup seriously other in room amenities were also way over priced the roof top is nice with a very tiny pool but it closes at 9pm staff were friendly and;3
weve been coming here for years and have noticed its physical decline rooms are tired bathrooms worn elevators rickety lobby getting shabby butthe location and staff are excellent and its clean we usually find a room deal so keep coming back;3
stayed here to visit universal studios upsides clean lovely views good food although awkward to get as the the food stations were located in the dining room but also in the walkway outside the dining room and there were so many people rushing to get their food close to universal parking for cars provided pool area lovely interesting the piano in the dining area which plays sort ofprerecorded music without a pianist downsides 1 we arrived mothers day and ate at the sun night buffet advertised for 49 a head already expensive when we got the account they had charged an extra 10 or so because it was mothers day this surcharge was not advertised anywhere 2 we had prebooked one night but decided on arrival that we needed the second night this they;3
daughter and i had one of the bunk rooms was exactly as described so was expecting the tight quarters quaint and memorable we each had small carry on luggage and was manageable with some planning each bunk had its own tv and window ac worked great shared bathrooms were again manageable as i was prepared for it did see other guests in there during our uses tried not to think to hard about the shared shower piece and made sure we didnt touch anything and did wear flip flops again was expected and planned accordingly was clean robe and complimentary slippers were provided did not have issues with traffic noise horrible mattresses and even as tired as we were it did not make for a good nights sleep i paid the price with my back the following morning am 39f fit;3
we stayed 3 nights to visit the area the location was perfect however the front desk checkin was very slow with a long line the area is crowded into a corner of the lobby poorly staffed and inefficient the hotel does not have a comfortable bar lounge for a social gathering or watching tv the restaurant food is substandard with a very limited menu there is no complimentary coffee no newspapers in the hotel and no airport shuttle our room was not serviced until after 4 pm when we called the front desk to complain as hilton honors members we have stayed at much better hiltons;3
we took this hotel at short notice after our airbnb failed to materialise in a great location but lots of street noise and noisy aircon room small but comfortable and the staff were very good and helpful enjoyed the 11 breakfast and the best possible has been done with an older style building and facilities to make our budget conscious stay an enjoyable one;3
the hotel is good great location they go for a european vibe which is not your standard american hotel experience the staff is great i stayed there almost weekly for over a year and the bell men especially daniel on the morning shift took good care of me;3
other than the fact that there was no bell service the staff at this hotel were very friendly and accommodating the hotel room itself was ok very small sink so it was hard for 2 females to get ready at the same time the bed was stiff but better than lumpy the heating unit was atrocious you pretty much burned your hand off trying to change the temperature which you had to do often basically there was no temperature control so you either froze or sweated your butt off the hotel has a rooftop bar which is not associated with the hotel common misconception of many guests do not go to this bar unless you are a 21 year old looking for a dance club and a hookup very shady people going in and out of there wouldnt doubt if they deal drugs from their office location;3
i stayed at the jane in a single cabin room with shared bathroom access the room was tiny yes and being a corner room was not ideal and it was even smaller in size the hotel is a lovely historic gem and an amazing area of nyc the location alone made my trip but i will mention a few things to be aware of this hotel has sro tenants who also live there which made for some interesting interactions in the shared bathroom like when i witnessed a tenant washing a crockpot one evening which was a bit off putting for a hotel guest who has to use that bathroom i feel tenants should be accessing a shared bath that is not also used by hotel guests if thatâs what itâs being used for there were 2 on the 4th floor otherwise the bathrooms were mostly clean being such an old hotel you;3
we booked a suite online and no room was ready when we arrived they said to come back at 430 and when we did we were told no suites available and we got 2 rooms instead this was a girls trip for a special occasion and we wanted to be together staff was nice as there was nothing they could do but management was less then helpful we definitely felt like we didnt matter and management did not care that they screwed up they treated like we were some annoying teenagers not the 30s something professional adults that we are we could have booked a suite at a million other nyc hotels instead the rooms were ok clean but tiny and outdated staff in the diner and the nicer restaurant in the lobby were very nice bell staff and valet were also great overall it wasnt bad but;3
thereâs a shuttle bus stopping at terminals at lax parking facility to the hotel only stayed a night due to flight delay nothing to complain average business hotel recommended for anyone with layovers;3
good location my second time staying during the westminster dog show good with having show dogs as the basement is converted into dog area room was fine good size and clean what i didnt appreciate was waiting for 2 hours in the lobby for the room to be ready;3
visited here with family over three rooms all staff were courteous friendly and helpful if needed rooftop bar only visited once but was lovely area location is good away from hustle and bustle of other areas of nyc and near good restaurants for breakfast and dinner if needed our room that we were sharing was particularly small and dark nowhere to store cases and one very small high rail for clothes that could not reach the bathroom is in major need of a refurb as is showing lot of wear and tear overall a clean hotel lovely staff and great location;3
as usual the staff was friendly and very helpful at this hotel and the bathrooms were clean this time we stayed in the upgraded captains cabin which normally costs around 325 per night the size of the room was adequate and the bathroom was nice but the elevator wasnt working and we were on the fifth floor ugh there was a sheet with holes on the bed and one heavy thin blanket the first night the heat must have been cranking because we had to crack the window and turn on the fan and were still too hot the next night there was no heat at all and we had to sleep in sweat pants and shirts and were still chilly the mattress was hard and a bit lumpy i really like the building and there is some really good people watching here but we may have to look elsewhere in;3
bathrooms are too small avoid any of the rooms that end in 11 they are next to the elevators where you hear them all night good location within walking distance to central park and lincoln center;3
this hotel has the makings of a really great hotel however despite meeting rooms that are named after movie stars a lovely fountain in the back entrance nice wide hallways and renovated rooms this hotel falls short i arrived at this hotel very excited because many movie stars have stayed at this hotel in its long history the hotel still has that feeling of past grandeur but it needs some money and time spent on it to bring it up to snuff it also needs a better cleaning staff we arrived to our room smaller than anticipated but bright updated no bathtub but we were prepared to live with that until i started to notice hair on the tile floors it was long dark curly hair and it was all over i called the front desk and complained and was told that housekeeping;3
stayed overnight at the county hall checkin was dreadful we arrived 30 minutes early and was told that we could checkin but it would incur a â£10 early check in fee not wanting to pay for the pleasure of being early we decided to eat at the bar the choice of food was pretty scant and took forever to arrive when it finally arrived the server apologised for the delay but it was obvious that our food had been hanging around in the kitchen as it was lukewarm we went back to checkin and found the queue was out through the door onto the street the selfcheck terminals were not working and with only two staff working the checkin it took forever we had now wished we had paid the â£1000 finally got in the room and was pleasantly surprised it was quite spacious we went out;3
i stayed here in 2013 for my 21st birthday upon arrival we waited around 15 minutes to check into our room when we got there we were disappointed tiny room and the view was of a building maybe 15ft away from the window so you couldnt see anything and there was no light coming into the room we phoned front desk and mentioned our unhappiness with the room and the manager advised us that if we sit tight tonight he will try do sort something the following day the next morning we met with the manager who upgraded us to a suite which was incredible views across the entire city had i of had a room like that i would have given it 5 but due to the first room i was given i can only give it an average score in terms of location i would say its around a 10 minute walk to;3
even after a renovation a few years back the rooms are small and tired seeming the bed was a queen not a king and felt like a double the wallpaper and tile were a bit worn great location though expensive bar and restaurant dont eat or drink at the hotel all the convenience items in the room and the room fridge cost a fortune of the four ancient elevators only two were in service so get a room on a lower floor and use the stairs or you will be waiting a lot the bellman and front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant there is a starbucks next door where we got coffee and breakfast ever morning the continental breakfast they offer doesnt start until after 8am and we had to be at appointments earlier than that so could not take advantage of it even;3
me and my boyfriend stayed here at the end of july for 4 nights as part of a bigger holiday in the us we found the hotel nice with clean well furnished rooms and enjoyed our stay we were asked to move rooms half way through our break due to maintenance and the manager dealt with this himself he was more than helpful courteous and polite also giving us a room upgrade the hotel is in an okay location good for central park however its a bit of a walk to times square etc despite us largely enjoying our time here there were a couple of things that we felt let the hotel down firstly the lack of free wifi a lot of hotels have this now but unfortunately this was only available in the lobby and it was difficult to connect we used the starbucks next door whilst getting a;3
this hotel is very well placed for a trip to ny and if you manage to get a high floor room the views must be excellent our room was on the 25th floor and over looked the city but not the empire state building which we did hope for so my advice would be to ask at checkin if you could go to a higher floor with the view you want before unpacking the hotel is old and our room was very out of date and small but thats what you get for a cheaper hotel we found out that some rooms have been updated but they seem to go to the returning flight crews that stay there regularly dont be put off from this hotel as its location was excellent for subway travelling around and some staff not all were very helpful tick tock dinner attached to hotel made a great start to the day for;3
we stayed at the hilton for one night during our recent trip to la the hotel was easy to find and very convenient for universal studios and city walk which were about a 5 minute walk from the hotel the hotel was of the usual hilton standard although the first room we were given smelt very strongly of stale smoke it was clear that a previous guest had smoked in the room but it had not been cleaned effectively as the smell really lingered we complained and were moved immediately without hesitation however this fell below the usual standard expected of a hilton hotel our new room was spacious and was on the 10th floor so had some good views of universal studios and the hollywood hills we used the car park which was easy to find secure and convenient with;3
location was great beds comfy room was ok but as said in other reviews the bathroom is a design disaster only a half panel to keep water in the shower we went to starbucks underneath the hotel for coffee as i refuse to pay for in room coffee we also refuse to pay for the ridiculously overpriced items in the room 8 for water and another example 350 for a bottle of vodka oh and a cheap touch was the sex kit you could also use tacky i didnt interact with the staff except for the man who stored my luggage on departure day who was great i found it amusing that pascal on the desk asked me to leave a tripadvisor review after he was quite an abrupt little man so to sum up if it wasnt for the location i would not of stayed here and when i return to nyc i wont;3
great location cool service and nice room but real small bathrooms that is really a minus unfortunately roof top is cool but could use a revamp restaurants at hotel are decent gotta love pasquale front desk;3
arrived after 300 pm not early first room was dark dusty small and reeked of bleach had to be moved because the smell was so strong that i began to wheezesecond room was much better was a bit disappointed with the size of room and bathroom for the rate paid 400 to 500 a night;3
the hotel was in an ok location dont think we would have ventured to walk very far from the hotel a night though it was close to the train station and took 5 mins to get into the city and all the tourist attractions breakfast was ok but it is a shame that no other meals or snacks are served during the day or evening we resorted to eating a proper meal at lunchtime and getting a sandwich from the local subway and eating in our room at night the pool is a good size and nice and private staff were very helpful and friendly the room was adequate but needs modernising and updating didnt like the fact that there was only a clothes rail and no proper wardrobe we did use the onsite laundry which was cheap and easy to use;3
my first time in new york and was so looking forward to staying here but found the attitude of all the staff very poor which was a real shame in fact the only person there that even bothered to talk to us was jeff the doorman that i couldnât speak more highly of the only asset to the hotel i feel rooms were very dated and only got cleaned once in the whole week we were there and that was only because i went and asked totally unacceptable in this day and age in spite of the hotel my daughter and me had a fantastic holiday and made some amazing memories the hotel is situated near central park which was beautiful although to close times square lovely if you like the smell of weed i would advise anyone going to new york to get a go city pass which we did;3
we stayed for four nights nov 30 dec 3 while on a sightseeingtheatre trip to nycgot the room at a terrific price on a blind purchase discount site and wondered if it might be too good to be true we were pleasantly surprised the hotel is old and worn but kept clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly we loved the neighbourhoodand getting downtown via the subway was easy we were moved to a top floor larger room after the first day they did the moving for us so we didnt have to wait around and really appreciated the extra space and the view dont expect luxurybut it is very good value for the money;3
so ill begin with the pluses of this hostel proceed with the minuses and close it out with my overall opinion which will hopefully be useful to anyone reading this pluses nice neighborhood and in very close proximity to trains and buses 2 minute walk building is nice has marble flooring throughout and has plenty of nice bathrooms showers and cooking kitchens rooms are mostly private and affordable â£1750 per person great deal for people who prefer this but are on a budget towels soap and shampoo are provided this is rare in my experience mini fridge in each room sweet lord a place to chill my beverages before a long night out minuses there was construction that began at 830 am ouch it is very loud even with earplugs knocking;3
the best thing about this hotel is its location and proximity to public transportation the hotel itself is historic but needs an update particularly in the bathrooms we had booked three standard rooms two with queen size beds and one with two twin beds the rooms with a queen size bed are much smaller than the ones with two twins in this hotel it really makes a big difference the mattress and pillows are not the best ones forgot to take our own pillows with us and none of us 6 altogether slept very well the bathrooms are very tiny outdated and have no space for your things unless you want to keep them on the floor the staff were friendly enough;3
we had a one night stay at the hilton universal way so that we can go to the universal studio as well as explore la the hotel is in great location for universal studio and does have a shuttle running from the hotel to the park every 15 minutes however it is quite far from central la so you would have to get a taxi which can be expensive the hotel is clean and nicely presented lobby but the the executive rooms look tired and could do with a make over as it does fall below the 4 star standard you would expect from the likes of hilton staff were generally pleasant but there was one member of staff at the reception desk who was rude and snappy we got to hotel at 9am so we knew we have to wait to get in to our room and that was fine as we were planning to leave our;3
this hotel was great the staff was very friendly but there was no room service and pool hours very inconsistent make sure when you book that you ask for a good view and space because they put me in a awful view and a very small room i get it it was just me and my sister but it would have been nice to have at least a view in such a beautiful location again i will book again but i will ask for a big room and a view;3
stayed here for 3 nights in july 2013 we decided to treat ourself to an executive room during our stay and got room 2054 on executive floor 20 after our stay i can say that staying in an executive room added no extra value to us i am already an hilton honors gold member and the continental breakfast that was included in the room was of no value since i would have gotten that anyway there are no executive lounge on this hotel so you sit in the general breakfast area and what worse is is that you are treated like an idiot i was 3 feet away from the bagels but since i had only continental breakfast i was not allowed to stand up and go and get the bagel myself a server had to do it for me another bad thing is that i had to wait for my room to be ready for 15 hours;3
when i made the reservations i made a note in the special request box stating it was my birthday the woman checking me in never acknowledged that did not state where the amenities were or their hours of operations she simply asked for my last name id and credit card once she charged my card she told me my room number and that the elevators are behind me to my right my room was fine but there was a broken pen i ate at the buffet in the morning i passed house keeping on my way down when i returned house keeping was about to enter my room i still had an hour before check out wasnt the best introduction but the morning and grave yard staff in the lobby and buffet were very helpful;3
family of 4 16 and 19 yr kids stayed from 8th to 12th july 2018 first and foremost the staff we encountered within the hotel were all fantastic and couldnât do enough to help the location was perfect for us far enough out the way of the crazybusy midtowntimes square area but not too far that we couldnât wander down to the likes of 5th av times square penn station etc unfortunately the hotel lets itself down out first room was a âsuperiorâ double double room we were just able to find a spot on the floor large enough to open one of our cases there was very little drawer space for clothes and the smallest hotel bathroom i have ever seen the room faced inwards and so had virtually no natural light we requested an upgrade and for the privilege of an extra;3
very lax service for the extremely over priced 32 buffet wait staff had to be asked for water and coffee refills and got bills wrong ordering off mene fo breakfast equally expensive and incredicably wasteful portions of food;3
the empire is perfectly located for those interested in the lincold center or the juilliard school of music you just have to cross the street and you are there it is surrounded by good restaurants and it is relatively easy to reach we stayed here several years ago and it wa a dark old aging and not very compfortable hotel when our hosts reserved a room for us at this place we were converned the place has improved since our last visit and the room we had had been updated it was somewhat lighter spacious and the air conditioning worked reasonably well the bathroom while updated was awkward there was no counter space the sink was tiny and the swich to control water flow in the shower was out of reach unless you were a basketball player the closet was for short;3
this hotel is literally a 10 minute walk from the park its not the nicest walk but very doable otherwise there are shuttle buses leaving frequently which are excellent the room was large and nicely appointed bathroom was nice too the main problem with this hotel is the downstairs communal areas the entire ground floor was freezing and they had one restaurant open in the evenings which had a very limited menu the breakfast in the main restaurant was a fabulous buffet i would recommend this hotel if you want to be as close to universal as possible;3
i was going to the listen to the dalai lama at the beacon theater on broadway and found this hotel to be only a few blocks walk away in a quiet residential neighborhood after reading the reviews i have some trepidation about staying there but my stay was uneventful the sheets were clean the refrigerator worked the bathrooms were immaculate and the shower had hot water see pictures in fact the bathrooms on my floor never seemed to be in use the hotel is old but the price is unbeatable for a decent private room to sleep in nyc;3
hotel was decent for the price staff was nice for the most part had an unpleasant situation with one of the desk clerks she was argumentative and unpleasant the area the hotel is in is not that nice of an area i wouldnt recommend small children stay overall for the price its to be as expected my first room had all cold water had to call 4 times to get resolution the view of that room was loud and had bad scenery of street the second room i was moved to had a nice courtyard with a fountain view and was quiet;3
it is what it is and that is a cheap by nyc standards place to stay in a great location there are no frills here such as coffee washclothes or cable tv we stayed in room 710 it was tiny just enough room for the queen size bed and dresser dont plan to watch much tv if you speak only english most channels are not in english interesting enough they get fox and the home shopping channels as other reviews stated the elevator is slow and small slow enough we took the stairs down from the seventh floor a few times and beat the people waiting however i didnt come to the greatest city in the world to stay in my hotel it was perfect for us it was a place to shower and sleep the bed was comfortable and the location was amazing it is in a quite neighborhood and i;3
we spent 2 nights here at the tail end of a long vacation in other 4 and 5 star hotels when checking in the room wasnât available at the checkin time we had to wait a bit but they held our luggage so it was fine the room was a mess and just felt grimy in general the carpets look like they have never been cleaned in the nook where they had the mini fridge on the carpet the surrounding carpet was so filthy you can see a thick layer of grey dust all over it wallpaper was ripped doors and walls had grimy smears and dents and paint chips the caulking in the bathroom was smeared all over and the fake plastic wooden laminate flooring was used as tile in the shower with the same weird smudges caulking the shower has mildew all around it we stayed in room 1023 and the;3
rooms are nice and clean shower pressure is rubbish and staff could do with being a bit more friendly i mean most staff were friendly apart from a few that were not breakfast was nice bread stale but than again its a 3star hotel not much to write home about all in all an ok hotel;3
second trip to ny first stayed in riu hotel amazing the rooms were really small but we had been upgraded as i asked and it was my 30th perfect location across road from maddison square gardens penn station and all subways right outside which was fab for getting about deffo get 7days pass for 33 well worth it empire state and mach within easy walking distance hotel does need a bit of an update especially on some corridors as look a bit outdated and dingy but they are clean we were on floor 22;3
the hotel is located right by madison square gardens and within walking distance to times square the rooms are extremely small the shower is like being jet washed but itâs clean the staff are really friendly and helpful even when most of the guests were complaining of the strong smell of weed lingering in the rooms when you check out and still have some time to explore the city then itâs 5 per bag for the hotel to hold them we stayed for 5 nights and the room tax was 120 which is expensive compared to other hotels checking in was easy make sure you have id and the credit card you paid with as the hotel take a security payment of over 200 which you get back at the end and can also use some of that money to pay for the room tax pros good location friendly staff;3
welcoming staff great beds modern minimalist decor bathrooms very clean rooms have complimentary water but no snack tray bar not open both forgiven very comfortable in the heart of midtown recommend highly;3
we had this hotel booked for us trough round the world experts we paid around â£350 for two nights and having looked at the prices in these other reviews feel that we were ripped off room 212 was quite large but in an l shape and although there was room for a bigger bed it was a very small double and it was pressed up against a chest of drawers on which i banged my elbow in the night the views were not good and the window blind slats were broken in places we left the blinds alone for fear of further breakage and therefore were not able to have daylight in the room the air conditioning worked well the hotel desk staff were polite and quite helpful the room next to ours was very noisy one night with a lot of comings and goings until at least 3am when we finally got;3
this was my forth business trip to ny and i have always stayed the empire my room was on the 4th floor so the street noise was loud and the bathroom was too small to be comfortable when i checked out the front desk did not ask me about my visit interestingmaybe they knew based on my room assignment they were going to get negative feedback;3
the hotel is in an excellent location and not far from the subway or times square 5 min walk to both it really is in the middle of it all the staff were really friendly and couldnât do enough for us the place is clean and had everything we needed ie iron and board hair dryer etc we booked a double room as we figured out we would not be in it much apart from sleeping i say that tongue in cheek as the windows do not keep out the road noise and the air conditioning unit is like an aircrafts engine running even when you turn it off you can hear next doors iâm a heavy sleeper and didnât sleep well at all i would be pushing it for 45 hrs sleep a night due to this and when iâm gone iâm gone itâs hard to say whether i would recommend as the location and staff were great;3
absolutely great location very central needs more than a lick of paint reminds me slightly of the tower of terror at disney if youre getting a good price then stay here staff are friendly just really could do with a full make over;3
ive just returned from 5 days in ny with my mum and 4 nights staying at this hotel i really cannot understand why it has been given such bad reviews the price you pay when booking this hotel indicates that its not 5 luxury but its nothing like the terrible reviews it has had on arrival the doorman came out of the hotel and wouldnt let us carry our bags in he then started chatting about our visit with us the lady on reception let us check in early and she was so nice our room was basic but clean with two double beds the bathroom was also clean with a decent size bath and a very hot shower there was complimentary shower gelsoaps etc the maid came in and cleaned every day there was plenty of wardrobestorage space too to be honest for the amount of;3
amazing location and aspiration to be a beautiful boutique with animal print chairs big beds and fluffy towels but avoid top floors due to noise from night club unless you are a clubber and expect faded glory tiny bathrooms and long lift queues best if you want some atmosphere of bohemian ny and arent worried about quality;3
this was the only property en suite that we could have afforded and that was close to central london the location is indeed excellent only the service is rather poor it would be great if the staff learns how to say good morning or hi wifi is paid and the computers in the room are extremely slow our room was very small just enough space for the bed but for visiting london it is not a problem at all it was clean and proper curtains;3
it was our second time staying here the room is about the size of a smallsingle dorm room but we donât go to nyc to stay in hotels as we spend our time exploring the city the staff is friendly and helpful there was an issue with the heat and maintenance was at our door within 10 minutes of calling the front desk it has all the basics a clean room a comfortable bed a hot shower and itâs reasonably priced as far as nyc hotels go especially around the holidaysâ¦ also itâs close to the subway and being near the park itâs a quieter more residential neighborhood;3
i visited the hollywood hotel over labor day weekend this year the hotel is pretty nice inside with a private fenced parking lot that made me feel pretty secure leaving my car there although they do charge for parking you want to note i believe 18 a night the suite we stayed in was fairly large with a mini kitchen desk couch some of the items in the room are up to date tvs refrigerator desks but other things like the carpet and ac system seemed a bit outdated i am not a very picky person when it comes to staying places so i was happy with my room but if youâre looking for something lavish and lush you might want to look around more you also share a balcony with the room next to you you get free wifi which is nice and a free breakfast every morning with a;3
for anyone looking for a glamorous hotel in the prime location of hollywood youll be disappointed the room is tight and not very modern there is however complementary breakfast which may somewhat offset the lack of food choices in the typical la neighborhood busy safe but not beverly hills an important safety issue to note is that you must make sure to fully close the door once i walked into the wrong room because that guests room wasnt locked despite being closed later i discovered the door in my room was also not fully secured i suspect the doors are old and quiet loose be sure to tighten the door handle when you go out this is really a hit and miss hotel depending on what rate you get the room at;3
my husband and i stayed at the jane hotel after reading reviews that it was trendy and in close location to a subway stop while all this is true and very cool there are some things i would like to point out to help future travelers firstthe bed was extremely uncomfortable springs were sticking in my back and my husband actually ended up sleeping in the floor because it was so uncomfortable secondthe front staff although there were typically two attendants in staff it seemed that they couldnt multitask and take care of more than one quest at a time it is typical that guests will turn in their key when they go out or come back in but having to wait in line to get a key reprogrammed was not time efficient for the guest or the staff if i may suggest that even though the;3
the place has undergone renovation one elevator still doesnt function the others are very slow the front desk staff was friendly wifi is free but slower than dial up service if you need to be on the upper west side it may suffice its difficult to hail a cab in the area there is a subway station 1 block away look for another place if you can;3
i did not choose the hotel i was a guest on the dr oz show the room was extremely small but i believe this is probably typical of nyc hotel rooms in this price range i dont think two people could have comfortably stayed in this room so i was glad i was solo;3
excellent location just 2 subway stations from times square the hotel is clean although the furniture could use renewing the reception desk clerks were all very nice and helpful the hotel provides free wifi not working in the lobby area only in the rooms on the down side the hotel does not serve breakfast you get avoucher for breakfast at a coffee shop across the street at approx 675 only 2 elevators were operating out of 3 i believe which made it sometimes a very long jurney from the 7th floor to the lobby as the elevators are very small and the hotel has a lot of rooms i sometimes had to wait 10 minutes for a free elevator another issue was the room keys that did not work three nights in a row and i had to go back to the lobby to have them fixed after a;3
jr suite was nice but most terrible thing was the shower had no curtain or glass partition the partition looked like was broken and never replaced called house keeping and was told that there is no partition when you come out of shower there is water in the entire bathroom and floor very slippery easy chance of falling ac is turned of at night and gets hot and stuffy 3 star hotel at 45 star prices not worth it;3
staff was okay but certainly didnt seem to go above and beyond to make the stay special shower took 15 minutes to warm up and many coworkers had issues with showers as well taking a very long time to heat up rapid temperature changes etc food was okay but i was surprised by the bill each time i travel a lot and have come to expect pricy menus in hotels that said i spent 35 on a breakfast buffet what;3
the morningside inn is a well organized hostel with friendly staff the rooms are ok and there is even a kitchenette the shared bathrooms are impractical but quite clean bus and metro will get you downtown easily;3
the location is strategic and close to popular spot in nyc like high line plenty of bars and restaurant to choose since it is located in greenwich the standard room is really small and good for one person with a small luggage good for backpackers but per night is quite pricey the theme of this is well thought but i think the price is too much;3
as it is a cheap hostel we cant ask much but there are things you can work on the kitchen is definitely not prepared to cook anything you can just do things in the microwave or in the oven the cleaning part must be more regular ive been there for 6 nights and my room was just clean once the showers must be separated as the toilets are for ladies and gentleman and i would definitely change the place to put the mirror in the room beside that it was a nice place to stay nice people nice prices really warm room witch was the best quality and the fridge in the room is also a good one;3
the hotel is located close to the red line metro station vermontstmonica so its easy to get to for example walk of fame or staples center without using the car its also close to the griffth observatory and the grove farmers market by car the hotel itself is in need of refurbishing at least our room was the complimentary breakfast was ok especially the omelettes the area is a bit dodgy with quite many homeless people begging for money so i suggest that you use the hotel parking area even if they charge you a bit too much for using it;3
hotel was walking distance to universal studios and metro but nothing else we had to take taxis everywhere which was quite expensive hotel itself was clean and beds very comfortable the restaurant was overpriced and no good restaurants around;3
needs up grading brown carpet looked dirty and hard when we first went into room the bed was made but the room had not been cleaned old receipts where lying on the table and there was used soap still in the bathroom im glad i ask my wife if she had opened the soap before i showered as we always take shower gel and soap;3
we stayed for 2 nights in the hotel standard room and after the first night started to think about other optionsâ¦ so starting with the good things 1â â â although the room was tiny and had not much extras in it like tee coffee maker glasses etc the staff was very friendly and helpful and brought everything at the request and no extra cost thus my suggestion is if you stay there and feel that something is missing just ask 2â â â central location some might like it others might hate it but i would place being in the centre of manhattan as a positive 3â â â the history of the hotel they have a long and rich history that theyâre proud of and they have a small but interesting exhibition downstairs dedicated to that 4â â â room although had seen better days;3
overall i chose premier inn because of its price and location it was on the cheaper side of hotels i could find that were around popular landmarks i also liked that it had a restaurant onsite for nights that you didnât want to leave your hotel to eat;3
being two college students at the time we needed something on a budget while this is a hostel we made sure we picked a room in which we had our own bathroom everything is very small and its hard to move around however it was worth having a small room for our own bathrooms the beds were very small as well im only 57 and my feet were nearly off the bed the staff was friendly though the location is nice as well we were just a subway ride away from times square i felt very safe in the neighborhood we were also a walk away from central park if youre young and looking for a budget this isnt a bad deal;3
very frustrating that this nice great reputation hotel charging a ton of money will cut cost on the most important part of a hotel room the beds should always be queen beds full sized beds are the back in the day twin bed luxurious is not small beds im 125 lbs my husband is 215 lbs we are not overweight we are an averaged sized couple and we could not sleep we were literally on top of one another so frustrating knowing how much we paid for the room only thing that was frustrating but the most important being on vacation and wanting rest;3
unfriendly staff who would not even open their mouths to speak except when booking in i booked online and arrived to find i was given possibly the worst room in the hotel i asked twice for a new room and was given one even though i was told twice none were available unfriendly frontofhouse unfriendly tour operator at tour table what is their problem there is no wifi or internet access in any of the rooms so we all had to seat ourselves under the freezing aircon in the lobby internet access in their business centre is 2 for 20 mins yes you read right the hotel is clean no bedbugs and well located to where i wanted to go if you bring your own mobile broadband and dont waste your words this is a good hotel to stay at;3
stayed here to be next to universal studios and it is a perfect location we had a view of the park and it was awesome what was not awesome was the fact that they charge you 4000 for valet parking is your vehicle is over 6 while the self parking was only 2800 so not happy with this charge will go looking for another place when i come back in a few months;3
for the last 7 or more yeats i have stayed a week at the new yorker for my annual business trip to manhattan this year the hotel was not nearly as nice as in years past for one thing only three of the six elevators are operational it took a very long time just to get in and out of the hotel each time they have also taken the coffee makers out of the room and if you want one it will cost you 25 per day finally they check in process took a very long time the man apologized saying that he was having a hard time finding a room for us this was disappointing as i had made the reservations and paid for them a month prior to my arrival i did the recheck in the night before and i arrived at the hotel at the time i said i would;3
got a family suite based off of pictures on hotels website great location excellent staff the room on the other hand was severely lacking half the size of what was pictured on the intenet and the bathroom was pretty busted and could use a refresh;3
i stayed here for the convenience of proximity to universal studios hollywood i was charged more to park per day at the hotel than if id parked at universal studios in addition the shuttle to the park was not running during early entry hours to the park id recommend a cheaper hotel for anyone traveling with a family for the purposes of attending universal studios hollywood you will not miss anything;3
the bathroom is very tiny dont reserve here if youre claustrophobic the bathroom is designed for small skinny people my room was very small and very hot when i called to have it fixed it took 3 calls before it was finally fixed the people were pleasant;3
last weekend a friend and i stayed 3 nights at the jane it was a good value for us as we travelling without our spouses and preferred to have our own rooms overall the hotel was a nice place to stay ive outlined what i feel were the pros and cons below pros great location in the west village right on the river quite close to a metro and plenty of great restaurants and the highline is steps away bargain price for manhattan without having to stay in a hostel or share a room nice restaurant off the lobby loads of character small but well appointed rooms considering very good service they even let us check in hours and hours early cons shared baths if you stay in the bargain rooms overheated i slept with the window open and the ac on there;3
rooms are a good size and trendy the location is great service is usually above averate however there are quirksthe first floor rooms dont have window locks its not super quiet which is common with nyc hotels they do provide ear plugs next to your bed they charge for inroom coffee at 250 a cup and 750 for inroom water bottle;3
ive stayed here many times and been pleased with it there are quite a new faces in the lobby and at reception and not as friendly as the previous staff 325 before taxes is veering towards to low value for money as the jane was fully booked i stayed at the maritime for my last 2 nights and it was only a bit more expensive for a much bigger and lighter room cafã© gitane tenant is the big let down faux french indifferent smug service from people that are a bit pleased with themselves and have no right to be its one of those places that i find irritating on contact and instead i go to one of the many wonderful restaurants in the neighbourhood the breakfast is substandard and no refills on coffee is a no go its a lovely room but its an odd fit in the hotel;3
the checkin associate was extremely helpful and accommodating to my specific needs she handled everything professionally and had a warm and pleasant personality unfortunately during guest were evacuated to the lobby then outside due to a exhausttype of smell on the 37th floor however the hotel staff handled everything with professionally and with care for their guests the kept things calm and made sure guest were supplied with bottle water for such an inconvenience i have to applaud the efforts of the entire staff;3
this place is a great price great location clean room and safe neighborhood free wi fi really came in handy nothing fancy but will do if you are trying to get a good price on hotel while in the city the only problem was we had a window that faced the club across the street it was very loud during the weekend and on one week night we were there we finally figured if you left the tv on all night that would drown out the noise the only way i would recommend this hotel if you be sure to ask for a room on the opposite side of the club located on broome st;3
1 old and tired everywhere you looked 2 intake staff bored minimally polite long lines for no obvious reasons 3 long line to check bags into coat room 4 for nearly 600 a night the room fixtures seemed quite old and threadworn and i had the 29th floor suite 5 the bathroom was clean but again old barely functional fixtures shampoos average and cheap better ones in cheap motels 6 the ac was just barely adequate the thermostat claimed 60 degree it must have been closer to 70 and could not be lowered 7 no food or drink options as far as i could tell ë1 location location location 2 ticktock diner next door for breakfast;3
i dont like that your guys double charge me for the second time and no one wants to talk to me about it you guys said that you was going to call me back never heard from you guys i dont like it;3
we stayed here in august the location was good the hotel was surrounded by many different restaurants and subway was very disappointed that only one elevator was working the entire time of our stay the sofa bed was broken and uncomfortable and i couldnt believe that the hotel didnt have a microwave on the premises;3
i arrived at the hotel on a tuesday at 11am and there was no que to check in was asked for my credit card in case of any damage deposit and was told that i wouldnt be charged anything extra as the hotel was paid for i was booked in for 7 nights and luckily had a room on the 36th floor with a great view of the empire state building and madison square garden the room itself had 2 double beds a tiny wardrobe and a bathroom slightly dated but that is the draw of an artdeco hotel so no real complaints there i used the gymnasium on 2 occasions and although it was quite basic in there it was better than i expected and not very busy the staff in the hotel are very helpful and there is security you show your room key to before going in the lift i befriended one of the ladies;3
the room was little and the wardrobe was not enough the two beds that should give room enough for two adults and one children each one as declared by the hotel were not so big and for this reason our nights were not relaxing the bathroom was like the room a little place where to stay one by one ok for the cleanliness;3
ultra mini small room smallest bathroom ive ever seen shower needs mold remediationelectrical outlet in bathroom requires repair ac system is quite loud bed was fantastic and the welcome upon registering was very pleasant;3
i was pleasantly surprised by the location of the jane in a lovely part of town it is like a film set the lobby and bar but the rooms are beyond small and more cubicle as are the bathroom facilitiesthe fact that men and women share the bathroom are not for the private or shy the staff are friendly but you only really see them on arrival the rose cafe is pleasant but breakfast is simple the wifi in there is good it is quite a no frills experience the whole place but if very reasonably priced for new york so good value for money;3
depressing rooms tiny old views what view oh you mean of the back of a building very nice staff clean sheets new bathroom and nice amenities but none of that can make up for a brown sad room w no view and the sound of an air shaft i was fooled by the low price and high trip advisor reviews something doesnât add up here;3
this hotel is in a fabulous location close to penn station and tube lines and close to empire state building down sides were that it was extremely busy which led to queues to check in queues for lifts today one bank of elevators broke down we were upgraded to an outer room with windows didnât know you could end up in a room with no windows so watch out for that there were 3 of us sharing and it was a tight fit no fridge tv signal not great and shower wasnât great;3
my wife and i stayed at hilton universal for a couple of nights in september 2012 we found that it is a good value hotel ideally located for visiting universal studios a short walk or via shuttle and with convenient metro train access to hollywood 5 minutes we have stayed in los angeles a few times and found that this is one of the more convenient locations for seeing many attractions in los angeles the room was quite large and was clean and comfortable and the experience was mostly positive the biggest let down at this hotel is standard of service when we checked in at a bit 400pm our room wasnt ready which is very inconvenient when arriving from a long haul flight with a function to attend shortly afterward whilst this is not an uncommon issue the delivery of;3
we came to this hotel for a short break from the uk the location is great and walking distance to a lot of sights the bed was very comfortable and warm the room snacks were extortionate and there was no wardrobe so our luggage stayed in the suitcases on the floor as there was nowhere else to put them the shower was really nice and the towels were changed daily we did travel with friends and they had gowns and slippers in their rooms however we did not the bar was of course stupidly expensive and to top it off a huge tip was added to the bill which was served at the bar which was unnecessary we had one drink and never returned which was a shame as the lounge was really nice there is a starbucks next door to get your morning coffee and a small shop close by to get some;3
my daughter i went to new york for spring break 2017 and stayed at the wyndham new yorker hotel on 8th avenue the actual hotel looks nothing like the picture we shared a room with 2 queen beds only it was 2 double the room was the size of a shoe box my daughter i had to turn side ways to pass each other in the room seriously that was the smallest hotel room ive ever witness i will never never stay at this hotel again everything was old and out dated the shower was clogged but maintenance did come and fix that but no i will not recommend this hotel to anyone after my daughter and i return home the hotel charge my daughter credit card 3900night for some ridiculas charge that they never told us about before hand we specifically asked at checkin and checkout;3
the empire hotel is in an iconic and ideal location just steps from the lincoln center and central park its entrance is nice with cheerful doormen the lobby is just off a highend bar with comfy couches and nice separator curtains eds chowder house is just above the lobby and its a great place to grab a fairly expensive but probably worth it bite to eat the hallways are trimmed in brown tones with what appear to be the white shadows of tree branches its a somber look but very nice it does look a tiny bit worn but overall its a good look our room was on the back of the hotel which trades a view for quiet its a trade i was happy to make in fact the room was one of the quietest ive experienced in a central new york venue very nice the decor which;3
i will never recommend this hotel they charged our card for an extra room called to speak with a supervisor and she was super rude i am sorry for 266 a night i would expect better service from a manager;3
great breakfast to start your day is a plus hugo the chef is very friendly and helpful great asset to the hotel unfortunately the internet connection is not always functioning although there is internet all throughout the hotel;3
my husband and our two boys stayed here for a weekend our view of the park was beautiful and the location is perfect the room is very small though i knew that going into this trip but it was tiny we struggled to setup our pack and play the room and bed were clean i did kill a cockroach on our 2nd night but it didnt wreck our trip or anything if you choose to stay here just know that its bare bones;3
my husband and i stayed this hilton property because of its locationbeing on the universal studios lot so basically the convenience and the usually good reputation of hilton hotels we felt comfortable knowing that we had made a really good choice in booking with them i really have mixed feelings about this place location great but they get you on the nightly rates i guess you get what you pay forwhich is the convenience of being able to access the park but if i would have known how my room was going to bei wouldve booked elsewhere the carpet of my room was so dirty stains everywheredust on the dresser and tv we paid close to 300 a night i suggest for anyone who is planning to visit universal studios to stay their sister propertythe;3
while your establishment was nicely located i was disappointed in the rooms and the fact that coffee was not complimentary to each room and the prices were very high for a small cup which came with the coffee maker the rooms appeared old;3
some issues with my stay was badly jetlagged and put the do not disturb sign in my door staff completely ignored it and disturbed me anyway waking me up when i complained to staff their whole focus was on making excuses rather than owning it made a bad impression was asked to move to another room midway through my stay unexpectedly no gesture of goodwill was offered a free drink or something which would have been appropriate in the circumstances terrible snooty service from an rude arrogant barman and a tipfocused waitress in the cafe downstairs customer service in general feels a little forced and not that genuine that said it is a convenient hotel offering a competitive price in a great location staff have some things to work on;3
cant beat location proximity to penn station made this very easy to get to when i arrived i walked to the hotel also centrally located to get to times square hardly any yellow taxis need uber i was surprised at how old the hotel looked once inside the rugs are very old and worn however there was no musty smell the room was clean and small as expected no mini bar no water for the guest ice machine on another floor staff were nice i liked the extra security at the entry of the elevators ate at restaurant for lunch bianca right off hotel and i thought it was good;3
the americana hotels is located near the central park easily accessible via the metro and a short walk to many good restaurants and sights in new york we did not eat at the hotel but the first evening we at at a neighboring mexican restaurant called iguana excellent choice;3
empire is a boutique hotel â defined by me as small rooms funky plumbing some charm but very hip if you are attending lincoln center or carnegie hall columbus circle or even the upper east or west sides â then the hotel is a perfect location i thought it was pricey 30489 on thurs and 38268 for fri and sat nights tax included â my last big city experience being philadelphia â but others tell me that is a reasonable nyc charge the room had a view of the rest of the hotel â so the shade was down all the time the staff was fine â in that nyc detached way the valet suggested i find my own overnight parking which would be less expensive than the empire 60 a night â and it was i used best parking in nyc and found a nearby garage for 98 7 tip â for the 3;3
the locstiin of the hotel is great the bedroom id ok withe new bathrooms but bit the hairdryer it was broken the bar is also great and the cocktails od the bartender julio were great if is too cold no need to go outside;3
checked into the hotel on a thursday for our wedding weekend the lady who checked us in maggie was the most helpful worker at the hotel she did everything that she could to accommodate us on our trip but there were some problems with the hotel friday and saturday we had no hot water at all it took hours for it to get hot again when we would call to get more towels and toiletries they would take forever bringing it to our room more than one occasion they didnt even bring everything that we asked for at one point we went to the front desk to ask for a pen and paper and was denied it because they said they cannot give out anything like that and the man that said these things had an awful attitude and facial expressions like we were a disgusting bug upon checking out;3
some things were above averagesome okay with problems so gave them middle of the road 3 circles out of 6 the checkin staff was very helpful sold out of room choice so gave us 7th floor with view but too low of a floor for a great view hotel was sold out and the staff couldnt handle that we were supposedly on a nonsmoking floor but smelled the whole time promised deodorizing but never addressed the hotel ran out of pillowsnever heard that in my life so no extras the first night and first breakfast excutive lounge was crazy and ran out of food and coffee but they did snap in to action and handle things better in the lounge on other two eveningsmornings there were a lot of banquets for proms weddings etc and extra guests for that some of the prom;3
if given the choice i would not stay here again there was construction in the lobby and service was slow check in lines were long at times and elevators did not work at least twice great distance to universal studios and breakfast was a plus pool and hot tub area need a face lift next;3
the halls are scary looking dirty and poorly maintained the elevator feels like a tiny deathtrap and the place appeared to be severely understaffed but the room itself was fine albeit small but for the money about 30 less than just about anything else it was acceptable;3
location was outstanding located in walking distance to central park the staff pasquale were great rooms are small air conditioning bad and hot water took long the pool is a small lap pool fits 7 grown adults closes at 8pm because of the rooftop bar the hotel amenities i give a 6 staff a 10 and location a 12;3
the art deco hotel is in a great location but is somewhat tired some of the staff were simply doing a job and struggled to extend the courtesy to guests that one would normally expect the addition of a hefty resort fee of well over 30 per night was both unexpected and hard to justify given the quality of the hotel rooms are understandably small given the location but they are also a little dirty and could do with a refresh and better daily servicing by the cleaning staff;3
this is our 2nd time at the hilton for location to universal its ideal but at over 200 per night its a bit steep maybe the sheraton is a better value its a 75 taxi ride from the airport and being up on a hill walking to things other then universal is a bit tiring the room is classic hilton but its starting to show its age last time we came here 5 years ago we had a nicer room and the condition of the hotel was superb reception and bell staff are very professional but there is no concierge in the lobby you have to call them a bit strange they have a reasonably priced buffet for lunch the workout room is in a temporary room but the equipment is very good the pool is outside so its too cold to use in december overall everything was fine it just;3
very affordable hotel in great part of manhatten wireless access was not in the room but you have to go down into the basement which was a pain bathroom was very clean there is no coffee maker in the room but there is a fridge i dont recommend this for a business stay but if you dont care about amenities i would recommend it;3
stayed here for a week long convention our room 2944 was clean but very out dated the bathroom was tiny and they really should replace the tubs put in bigger shower instead tub is ancient and was very hard to get into and out as i have back issues a walking in shower would of been nicer tub was from the 1950s i think really old floor tile was not clean basically they need to redo their bathrooms bed was firm ok to sleep but what they call and queen seems more like a full size safe in closet if you want to make your own coffeetea ask at desk for a keurig to be brought to your room no refrigerator at least in my room elevators are very confusing one set goes as high as 20th floor other goes 20 to top in conference area the rest room are;3
a very well located at the heart of midtown clean however very crowded and old at one step you could reach to subway time square is about a km needless to say that price benefit ratio is not stasifactory a bar and a cafe is on either side of the lobby havent tried the bar i enjoyed the waffle fries at breakfast you could reach to every spot very easily;3
we returned once again to the hollywood hotel the room we stay in is perfect as it has a slider door to the outside and i travel with a service dog the breakfast is still good and the room is large and clean issues still remain the front desk staff especially michael g is rude on two separate days maid service skipped us entirely the bordering street lexington was loud on the weekend good luck never quite sure what youll find;3
situated right in the middle of chinatown next to grand street subway stop bowery and delancey stops are also within a walking distance so you get direct access to b d f j m and z trains that is you can eventually get anywhere in manhattan and have an easy trip to brooklyn if needed obviously there are plenty chinese restaurants and take away places nearby and in 5 min walk you can reach little italy when tired of chinese food for a good morning coffee your best and closest bet is two hands on mott street this is pretty much everything super positive i can say about this hotel otherwise it is far from being bad but severely overpriced i guess thats nyc reception staff is fairly ok check in was fast but first room they assigned to me was not in use actually;3
positives the hotel is in a great location the lift attendants and the staff at tick tock restaurant were fairly nice the rooms are very clean cons the room was very small and outdated the reception staff were appalling too little information given at check in questions that were asked were given curt responses that did not provide the correct information anything that stopped them rattling through their scripted check in or out speech at pace was frowned upon they lacked the basic customer service skills awful;3
went to nyc with my daughter in early march 2008 was a little worried about some of the reviews eg rat in the garbage personally i dont believe that review was true the woogo was fine not spic and span but it passed my daughters standards and she has a very low tolerance for anything she defines as grub the apartment was bigger than hotel rooms ive booked in ny and had a really large closet it was nice to have the kitchen factilities next time i will request a room at the back of the building because the street noise is something im not used to coming from the burbs but it wasnt that bad walls were a bit thin but that wasnt really a problem although a bit embarrassing as we were packing to leave because the couple next door were having quite a;3
we stayed here for five nights at a rate of about 13 of what everything hotel in manhattan would cost our room was small but clean with a good bath and hot water and a huge bed we liked the proximity to the subway and the bus from the airport we also liked walking to park west the little turkish place a block away in the morning for our coffee and a friendly visit with the owner so its not fancy at all but if you are in new york and just need a basic place to sleep and shower i would recommend this place as a good way to save money on lodging it is very conveniently located to the subway you can take the bus from laguardia for a few dollars and walk to the hotel from the bus stop there are other much nicer places to stay in manhattan but for the price we;3
iâm partially disabled so i called the hotel prior to flight to ensure shuttle was running from airport it was but the driver blew right past the labeled stop in the left lane grr i attended a conference whose experience was marred by the major hvac failure that left some meeting rooms at 91 degrees all afternoon really hard to concentrate in a saunasome hotel room lights didnât work no soft reading light it was there but no switch to light it up;3
when we checked in they provided a card for a room which did not exist on that floor i complained than we got a card for room but the card was not ok it was really a bad start on behalf of the hotel staff we stayed in here for 4 nights the double room was small this a tourist hotel because you could get wherever you want to go eg empire state building you can have breakfast on the groundfloor and there is an italian restaurant as well;3
iâm sure the new yorker was a grand old dame in its hey day but it feels very tired today heating in rooms was very ordinary it was either full blast hot which made sleeping tricky or cold shower wasnât great and the rooms are very small the staff were pleasant enough and the room rate was ok but just an average experience overall;3
rooms are small drawers are not accessible and they do not have breakfast room service i would not recommend this hotel to anyone as the amenities available are over priced and not what is displayed online;3
good resort type hotel situated right next to universal studios the rooms are big comfortable and clean with large bathrooms and some great views the amenities include a bar area a restaurant a coffee shop discount entry to universal and a great pool lounge area outside the staff are also really pleasant and helpful definitely add something to the stay which was offered at a great rate there is a major downside which has knocked at least one mark off the rating the elevators lifts ive travelled extensively all over the world and stayed in all kinds of establishments and ive never experienced elevators that are this slow this is a 30 floor hotel so they are very much needed but theyre so incredibly slowthat there would always be queues in the lobby area;3
it was our second time staying at the empire our fist stay in 2009 after a great first experience we couldnt wait to go back however the empire turned out to be a disappointment the rooms are so small there is hardly anywhere to put your bags the bathroom is the size of an airplane bathroom and in desperate need of maintenance the shower doesnt have a full door and everything in the bathroom becomes wet because of this there was a bit of mold on the floor and the wallpaper was beginning to peel of the walls the rooftop pool views are amazing but the pool is about the size of a bathtub although the hotel is in need of some maintenance it is in a very good location only a short cab ride to broadway and soho;3
this hotel has so much potential and many things about it are very good but many things about it are not i stayed here in late august to move my sister in to college across the street at fordham the lady who checked me in was rude and very short with me i should mention that i work in an actual forbes rated four star hotel in la and there is no need to be anything short of lovely to a guest beyond that the lobby looks like it was decorated by the same people who decorated the cheesecake factory its like i get it you spent money but why did you spend it this way the shower doors were weird it is set up like a conventional sliding glass door but instead of them both sliding one is permanently fixed and the other is just not there but the tracks and wheels are i;3
hotel was generally clean but there were stains on some of the furnishings the shower was not always hot the heating was sporadic and one night the room was like a sauna we asked reception to turn off but they sent up an employee who just looked at the radiator and said itself later;3
we stayed here for a london city trip room was small but affordable bed was not very good and quite some noise from the corridors shower was ok staff was efficient facilities match a backpacker hotel;3
nice hotel it needs some tlc in certain common areas the lack of a shower door is wearing terribly on the the bathroom the whole room basically becomes a shower when it is used and mush be wiped down afterwards;3
before u go up to room and u booked from a second party website make sure u ask which bed you will receive i had bad luck and even tho i booked a room with queen bed i received a room wit 2 full size beds;3
i stayed here 1 night while in town for a business meeting the location was very convenient and seemed to be right in the heart of everything close to penn station and subway station many restaurants food options etc my hotel room was on the smaller side and a bit dated but clean and no major issues minor complaint was the tv was pretty sub par in terms of very bad picture quality and minimal channels i used the fitness room which i found to be pretty adequate for a hotel decent amount of cardio options some weight machines dumbbells and enough room to spread out i thought the resort fee was a bit high 31 considering there didnt seem to be any real resort amenities overall i was pleased with my stay and had no major issues;3
stayed here for work bc of group rate in the middle of timessquare staff was ok and door man helped me get a cab during the craziness of the un general assembly fine for a work trip but wouldnt go out of my way to stay here again small things like no bath robe;3
the hotel is very close to universal studios and city walk and provides shuttle transportation its an ideal location for those planning on spending their time at universal studios the staff was extremely friendly and helpful the hotel and guest rooms were in need of some updating daily self parking fee seemed high;3
this hotel was by far the cheapest option i found for my trip in september 2013 and the reviews made me apprehensive but i was pleased by the cheerful desk staff and the room was much bigger than i had pictured the tub surround seemed held together by mildew and id never be motivated to take a bath in it but the hot water was plentiful i peeled off the white bed coverlet and the vellux blanket beneath it neither seemed especially clean and just slept on the clean sheets with a clean towel covering the pillow the room was quiet the hotel seemed safe and i got the two wakeup calls i requested however i spent so much on cabs going back and forth from the times square area with luggage that i would in the future spend an extra 50 per night and stay closer to;3
bewarethe empire hotel has a fabulous location and an attractive lobby but the rooms are less than optimal on our first visit the room was fine not so fine on our second visit expensive prices for a seedy room;3
this def isnt a fancy place to stay but was good enough even with our 3 year old daughter the location was great just a short walk to all the shopping and fun things to do in chinatown as well as downtown area short train ride ask the front desk a good place to eat and they will giv u great suggestions we went to an amazing chinese place that u would never find or even think of goin to if u dont ask the locals the air conditioner leaked water but apart from that was an average hotel in a good proximity to a fun time;3
pros near trains tubes taxes landmarks clean room that looked new cons breakfast buffet was dull and boring experience no ham cheese etc scrambled eggs was not real was made from egg powder staff in reception was politetrained but did not follow trough on saturday morning i asked them to change the bed linens etc not only make the bed come back saturday evening was not changed best reception could do was giving me linens so i could change it myself they promised to change it next day for sure next day i told the reception people what happend the night before just to make sure no more mistakes came back in the evening and guess whatâ¦ they had just made the bed not changed it 1 fault i can accept but 2 in a row of the same subject sorry no premier inn;3

wouldnt it be nice to book a 5 hotel one day and find everything is as it should be and everything that you hoped for from a 5 hotel the positives the rooms are a great size and larger than one typically gets in new york hotels they are as the photos show great location close to 5th avenue and convenient for theatres etc the negatives a 5 hotel that still charges for wifi really room prices are pricey enough so charging additionally just gives a very poor impression very outdated and miserly to charge for wifi no free water in the rooms same sentiment as the wifi point staff surly and disinterested on both check in and check out ignored feedback on checkout wasnt my own experience but at times during my stay i saw some very long queues for;3
we stayed here for 3 nights while apartment hunting on the upper west side and had no problems whatsoever it had pretty much what we wanted and expected in a hotel the room was large enough for two people not to feel too cramped theres free but slow wireless they were happy to receive a fax for us checkin and checkout were fast bathrooms and linens were clean and everyone was professional on the 11th floor where we were street noise was minimal the location is fantastic just a few steps to a subway stop and you can easily walk to lots of tasty restaurants and cafes in a variety of price ranges of course youre not paying a superhigh price so you should have some realistic expectations there was some grunginess where the carpet was coming off the floor;3
we picked this hotel because of its location close the universal studios and because the parking was only 17 dollars a day la is so big itâs hard to know where to stay for a first visit the hotel itself is ok easy to find and in a good location universal city is 3 mins walk away with lots of shops and restaurants or you can walk down the hill and under the bridge to a fantastic pizza place with singing waiters the room was spacious and clean with a great view of the city we were on the 21st floor however it was very noisy we could hear the man next door blowing his nose for example there appeared to be no sound proofing between the rooms we went for the continental breakfast which was ok but there was very little choice and not a lot for the health conscious they;3

stayed a week have stayed 3 times before room this time was quite small water temperature overall was good although a bit sporadic and ran cold a few times a great hotel to experience as it has a lot of history including a bit of a museum experience downstairs but the main issue for me was the heating system and fan cannot be separately operated so if it is cold or extra hot it goes on strong and then shuts off deadly quiet the fan has a manual option but i was told manual is not an option would be an easy fix but for heavy sleepers i would guess no problem i just prefer continuous fan especially with traffic always noisy but if not for that an easy 4 stars for service nice 24 hour diner below strong wifi great location old but clean fast elevators and a not;3
stayed here for three nights this past week while my husband was hospitalized for surgery made reservations for four nights per drs recommendation my husband was released one day early and we just wanted to go home lost payment for last night due to making reservations through expedia hotel charges 1800 plus per day for parking lot is secure with plenty of parking hotel is in a sketchy neighborhood but as a woman alone i felt very safe at the hotel the room king bed was nice and spacious the bed was luxurious amenities were nice the full breakfast was fine but standard i would stay again if we needed a place close to the hospital would not otherwise due to the location only not because of the hotel itself;3
contrary to the first time i visited i was greeted with a smile and given a room that i could actually turn around in it was still quite small the problem with boutique hotels like this is that one of the things you expect in nyc from a four star hotel is space i realize that space is at a premium in ny and that we are not in omaha but if your regular rooms are not adequately sized then you have no business calling your self a four star hotel the ac is the room did not have a thermostat and was one of those old fashioned types that you used to see in the 70s and 80s it made quite a racket while taking a shower on the first night i noticed a great many flying insects which were coming from a small hole in the corner also on that first night my television remote;3
pros excellent location to explore nyc or to visit the theatre super friendly bellboys really confortable bed cons unfriendly reception personel ac very loud toilett was not cleaned during our stay 4 nights shampoo soap etc was not refilled during our stay;3
we arrived at 1pm the check inn was fast flowed nicely we got to our room opened the curtains and we were greeted with a wall i had specifically booked a room with a view i went back down stairs spoke to the receptionist who had given our room and she actually argued with me and didnt believe me that we had a brick wall as a view i really wasnt impressed after waiting an hour yes an hour she finally believed me and gave me another room that was before she checked it her self literally couldnt believe it the rooms are so so small its very cramped the photos need to be changed on the website very misleading no facilities no kettle or fridge very annoying the beds are super comfy the bath was awful once you got in the water disappeared so kept the tap on tick tock;3
the hotel was clean which is always great and the room was pleasant enough we were handed our key and charged on arrival then left to it to figure everything out for ourselves the oven in the kitchen didnt work and the food we bought from the reception area was out of date aside from sleeping we spent the rest of the time away from the hotel we were aware of the shared facilities but we were in a room directly opposite from the which resulted in it being very loud also the towels provided were tiny so take your own towel the only way to describe this place is mediocre and ok id rather pay more for elsewhere next time though;3
large art deco hotel conveniently located across the street from penn station 24 hour dinner in hotel was great for breakfast arrived early and had to wait to check in i was told at the registration desk that they had upgraded my room when check in time arrived i was told they took the upgrade away my grandson and i went to our room which was the smallest hotel room i was ever in the view from the window was a brick wall my grandson turned on the tv and it didnt work i called the desk and they told me to come back down and they gave us a different room the new room was a lot bigger and the tv worked the staff were very nice the added on resort fee and taxes brought the price of one night to 300 its nyc and all the hotels are pricey the location was;3
selected the hilton universal for its proximity to universal studios and quality overall based on photos and descriptions we thought it was ok and our stay was fine but it didnt live up to our expectations and we wouldnt stay here again next time we visit universal studios our room was average a bit outdated bathroom wallpaper is peeling bathroom toilet tissue is in an odd location way behind the toilet and awkward to reach no magnification mirror in the bathroom and poor lighting beds are only marginally comfortable stayed 2 nights and i made tea in the morning with the coffee pot in the room supplies werent replenished by housekeeping so that i could make tea again the next morning the first morning we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was;3
the abercorn house is located in hammersmith the underground station isnt far away it takes about 1020 minutes by tube to get to the main attractions of london it can get really noisy in the morning cleaners other travellers and construction work even in the evening you can hear people slamming doors we had a double bed room it was nothing special but enough space for 2 people one cockroach was spotted but it wasnt a big deal for us hehe the flush in the toilets was very weak and the shower rooms were fairly clean there is no entertainment such as tv in the room and wifi was only available for 1â£ per hour we managed to go to some local pubs that offered free internet;3
bath room had a column in front of the mirror which made the bathroom very uncomfortable and hard to use the mirror shower needs maintenance lots of dry rot sink did not drain well location of hotel was great rooms are small;3
location is a win around the corner to penn station access front desk workers could be friendlier and welcoming walls are very thin could hear doors closing and conversations of people in the hall ways i would assume if i can hear them they can hear me need ventilation in bathroom when finished with hot bath the walls and ceiling would be dripping water;3
the best thing about this hotel was that we got a complimentary upgrade which was a very pleasant surprise that made the price very appealing but i think it was high 200s for one night for the original room i chose the bed was huge and comfy the bathroom was niceeverything was clean the rooms are small couldnt have imagined the other size of original room the rooftop was fun although if was a quiet night but we were there on our own party so it was fine the location is great minimal interaction with staff but was pleasant sadly and i kind of found it hard to believe it was fully booked on a weekday we couldnt add an additional night the lobby is fun impressionable to walk into i didnt pay much attention to remember little details like wifi or if;3
the good cheap the room was clean the hostel is nice and near the tube station the bad the receptionist who sits on the left side of the two is abrupt to the point of rudeness the corridor doors are heavy and awkward to open and shared toilet clean but shared is never a great thing and the bed lumpy and uncomfortable;3
not what i expected and not worth the money the hotel needs a refresh some staff very helpful while others rude or abrupt didnt sleep through the night for a week noisy neighbours and staff slamming doors in hallway all day long especially early in the morning charge for coffee in room tacky;3
the location of this hotel to all of the attractions is perfect the hotel is a little outdated and overpriced i wasnt satisfied with my room initially so i requested to change my room wendy front desk hostess was very helpful and pleasant i was satisfied with the new room but the ac in the room smelled of mildew or mold which both my daughter and i began to experience some sinus symptoms i reported it at checkout hopefully it just need a filter change;3
staff at hotel checkin was friendly and accommodating they charge you 30 if you want to get into your room prior to standard checkin time the room is large and we had a great view of universal studios no frills cafeteriabuffet style dining was mostly disappointed with the cold low pressure shower when you are paying premium prices due to location hot water should be included in the package;3
it really is all about the location only a quick walk 58 minutes to both of hammersmith tube stations so very convenient very cheap accommodation for london stayed in a private twin room which was very basic and the beds were clean but mega uncomfortable ok for a thrifty one night stop over but because of how uncomfortable the beds were wouldnt stay for more than 1 night;3
clean yes amazing location yes downfalls in places like noisy ac old furniture front desk staff with limited knowledge i wouldnt say dont stay here i just think it could be improved price was good though;3
we stayed at the astor for 5 days and it was our first trip to nyc i was a bit apprehensive after reading a few negative reviews but was reasonably satisfied at the end the room was small a little dark but clean and comfortable the walls are also a bit on the thin side the staff at reception were not terribly friendly but overall it was reasonably priced for nyc if you only want a place to sleep and shower then this hotel would suffice its on the very top end of central park west and close to harlem the subway was just 3 blocks away so getting about was easy enough;3
i been in this hotel last week is nice the location is perfect close to central park 5th avenue times square the room is not bad is it clean but the bed was uncomfortable to small and short and the was all night long the ac noises if you are in vacation you need a good bed to sleep in the night and relaxing and this is not the right hotel for that;3
first the good things top located near nolita and soho many good restaurants around the corner good beds clean and spacious bathroom we had a room with view on the 5th floor on the corner with windows on 2 sides but the rooms need updating all curtains are torn lots of stains in the carpet old furniture the painting hung askew of course you are not in new york to stay in your hotel room we got a good deal and we would stay here again if they have the same offer next time;3
like others have said location is good and the price is definitely on the cheaper side however there are hidden fees for the free wifi of which you pay per night the shower and bathroom is incredibly outdated and the rooms are depressingly small youll have a much better deal elsewhere getting a nicer hotel for the same price after you count in the hidden fees;3
we have just returned from the new yorker and there are lots of things we liked but on balance the bad knocked the good points down to average we had our resort fees included in our package with virgin which was great however i do feel the fees are not value for money we contacted the hotel before we arrived to ask for rooms close together and a nice view we got one of those requests and had a great view of the empire state building the hotel is clean and staff helpful it is in an excellent location so convenient for the attractions and subway the not so good now the smell of weed seems to seep into the rooms through the vent the rooms are very small and there is no fridge or kettlecoffee maker unless you pay for them also the lifts were a nightmare when we;3
its all about location with the empire hotel an older property with a minimal makeover this hotel is kitty corner to lincoln center a fabulous location but the rooms are pretty worn out and cleanliness is a bit sketchy the bathroom was quite worn the carpet was minimally vacuumed and the heatac unit looked like it would break if i turned the handle in anything but the most careful manner for us it was 1 night and the bed was fine the price for a saturday night in october was pretty outrageous given the quality but as i said its all about location here;3
my husband i a travel to nyc often so we are always looking for an affordable hotel we paid 150 a night which i thought was a bargain this time of year we did not mind the location as we are familiar with the upper west side but if you are a first time visitor i recomend staying in midtown so you are closer to the action the lobby was always crowded with guests and the elevators are really slow but the room was fine ive stayed in smaller nyc hotel rooms before the bed was quite comfy too there is a starbucks one block away and the deli across the street is a great place to get a bagel and cream cheese before heading out for the day;3
we were in la to see a concert at the gibson amphitheatre and this was perfect for that the room was clean and had a great view and the staff were friendly and helpful overall we had a great stay but there were some issues the hotel restaurant has a large buffet most of which is left out in the open constantly we were always walking past it and i found it mildly disturbing that they left out shucked oysters and other seafood covered in plastic wrap when the buffet wasnt even open we had an issue with taking a cab from the hotel i know that this isnt the hotels fault but i feel like i should point it out because it was a cab that the hotel arranged and we tipped them for the cab driver tried to pull the tourist scam on us by basically taking the;3
i was there for 9 days with a travel group of elder women and i must say tht the employers have been very nice and patients with them the hall is great and perfect for early morning meating but the air conditioning was overwhelming i was there in august and i got a cold rooms are not so small there was plenty of space for the luggage what was really narrow was the bathroom but if you stay in new york youre not going to spend your time in an hotel room wifi avaiable for free only in the hall and 14 dollars at day in the rooms;3
having read previous reviews which i take seriously i looked forward to getting to this hotel after nearly a 3 year wait and was celebrating my birthday whilst there and my wife was belatedly celebrating her 60th and the hotel knew this as it was mentioned on the booking previous users have extollled the virtues of the check in staff and their willingness to offer free upgrades no such luck for us we were then allocated a room on the 21st floor which we didnt realise at that time would mean a terrible wait most of the time for elevators the elevators on the right serve floors 20 to 40 and are so busy whereas floors up to 20 use elevators on the left which seemed to hardly be used the rooms were old and dated and did not seem to reflect the glossy look on the website also;3
great location but this place needs a shake up the music in the lobby is too loud and not at all relaxing i had to use the lounge a lot as wifi was free there but 1299 per day in the room this meant that anyone could walk in from the street and have access but paying customers in my case several hundred dollars had no more priveledge its time to renew the internet access policy people its 2014 free wifi is a not a luxury;3
location wise this is perfect a subway right outside the door loads of eateries central park a few blocks walk away and the upper west is a great neighbourhood the hotel itself is basically a building site at the moment with renovations in full sway and id expect itll be nice when it finishes other floorsrooms are a bit tired not dirty but they feel old still youre not going to nyc to spend the time in your room so its perfectly adequate the staff are fairly hopeless i felt i knew more about the area than they did so do your own planning otherwise a very reasonable cheapish hotel on manhattan and they are not easy to find;3
it seems that the reviews on the days inn broadway are 5050 on the experience the rooms are average but adequate the frontdesk service was great and the security staff were all cordial the bed was comfortable and no bedbugs the bathroom clean the water hot and the noise level more than acceptable for nyc you are steps away from the subway and can be to the north or south of manhattan within a halfhour some great restaurants try longgrain mixed asian right around the corner a couple decent bars the dive bar has good music and friendly staff on weekends but the patio service is slow on sundays like just about everyone else had some concerns with the speed of the elevators but other than that no complaints the hotel is tired but it appears that;3
just returned from a girls weekend at the new yorker we stayed in a double executive suite with pull out couchone bathroom the room for 6 is quite small however it was duable the location of the hotel is great and convenient overall the stay was okay the hotel was clean and a bit dated the staff was helpful i would probably choose a boutique hotel for our next stay;3
the room was very small with no adequate room for our toiletries the bar restaurant and the tick tock restaurant had an inadequate number of servers to consider eating at called the front desk about a bag the airline sent over and i was told i had to come for it without even asking to have it delivered i felt that was rude and unprofessional otherwise everything else was good;3
booked this hotel very last minute after going through a couple of reviews the hotel itself is located on the outskirts of hollywood but when i say its conveniently located i mean its easy to get to most places from here cos its 10mins drive from downtown as well as central hollywood so its like somewhat in the centre of both 67min drive from sunset strip the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable the ac is a bit noisy and may turn off at night but once you inform the reception bout it they change the settings and have it on the breakfast is very average just had it for one day the front desk staff can be more courteous we were checked out by someone named gisel who didnt come across as very friendly all in all its a good option for the price your;3
reservation and check in was great the location was perfect and i felt secure even coming in late in the night i unfortunately was over charged and a week later i am still waiting on my account to be corrected looking forward to hearing from someone;3
there were a few positives about our stay i originally booked 2 nights at a great rate called to add a third night and the young man who assisted us was very helpful but could not offer the same rate due to the holiday season which i understand we arrived early they stored our bags until our room was ready when we got into our room there were no hand towels or a bath mat the second day after the room was made up still no hand towels and now no wash cloths called housekeeping took close to an hour to get items third day no toilet paper or wash cloths prompted a trip to the front desk after phone calls went unanswered met with a manager who came across as being inconvenienced by our problem but did accommodate rooftop bar was very loud and catered to a younger crowd;3
if you want a decent shower dont stay here other than that the room was nice and clean the staff was friendly and it was very busy there were a lot of events taking place which crowded the area quite a bit;3
i stayed here with my girlfriend at first we were very disappointed with our room on the 5th floor the air con wasnt working properly this led to a very uncomfortable couple of nights with no response regarding our issues from the usual day time staff until we met rudi who at midnight was helpful enough to get us a new room which was an upgrade the second room was excellent with a good view and two air conditioning units in case we had the same problem we went to eds chowder house for one breakfast and one lunch the staff were the same both times there was plenty of staff but they just sat there watching us forgetting parts of our order which was worrying the food was good though and the drinks menu was very impressive the internet situation at the empire is;3
its old very old but hey we were there for the sightseeing so my room was only so i that i have a place to sleep shower and change not to watch tv wifi was working fine the bathroom was clean and so was the bed i didnt see any bugs and thats my main concern you could see that there had been water infiltration but again as long as it didnt rain in the room while i was there i didnt really care we stayed there 3 nights service could use some improvement on our last day we asked for a wakeup call that never came that being said this place is sooooo welllocated right off broadway street where you can flag a cab that will take you fairly quickly straight to time square when theres not too much traffic think more of an hour 21 to get to see a;3
i booked this hotel in a hurry and didnt read the reviews until later in the day after i had booked a nonrefundable reservation my bad reading tripadvisor quickly didnt look like any real issues but if you read some other sites whoa make sure you read all the reviews i do think a disclaimer needs to be made though if youve never stayed in nyc then you will be shocked at how small and old all the hotel rooms in the city are it just is what it is so yes this hotel falls into the same category its super old and the hotel room size is almost claustrophobic compared to other cities i checked in with a friendly agent went up to the room and the keys didnt work so i had to go back down 29 floors and she had made a mistake writing the room number but she gave me;3
stayed here for one night while my mom and i were in new york the lobby was very nice and the staff was very welcoming especially with letting us leave our bags before checkin we got into our room and it was extremely small we didnât need much space but it was shockingly small the room was very clean and nice set up for the size check out was easy but when we went to pick up our bags later in the day to head to the airport it took about 5 minutes to find our bags which was frustrating since we were in a rush;3
the hotel was basic but was good value for money thankfully my reservation was in the system as the receptionist said a lot of people had arrived and there was no record of their reservation the receptionist was really friendly and dealt efficiently with check in the room budget single was comfortable with a double bed tv fridge and small closet the bathrooms were adequate although very tired there was no hairdryer available even though it says on the website available of request the receptionist said there was only one and another guest must have it this was disappointing but not the end of the world it was a little noisy during the night both within and outside the hotel but nothing too extreme in essence this was an acceptable stay and good value;3
good for 3 stars hotel breakfast is poor ä°ts better to go out if u like breakfast room is small but clean and nice the best part is location hotel is middle of manhattan close everywhere also airconsition is centralized and working noisy;3
we stayed in new york for a total of 6 nights recently 27 may 2016 the staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean and the bed was confortable but tea and coffee in the room was chargeable by the hotel very poor attitude to charge for them we stayed for 6 nights and had to rely on starbucks for our morning caffeine kick the pool bar was overpriced and the cocktail drinks were rubbish they appeared to come from syrup and the mohito was made up of dried mint leaves somewhat resembled a sunday mint sauce dont go there it was truly bad we only went there once because of the bad experience very poor service the drinks at the hotel bar were fine the restaurant seemed ok but we never used it because it closed too early for us brits;3
we stayed here for two nights during a road trip from san francisco to las vegasthe hotel is very nice and the rooms were lovely it was my 50th birthday whilst there and a lovely cake was delivered to my room on my birthday and as it was my friends wedding anniversary some chocolate strawberries were delivered to their room these were both nice gestures as we had alerted them to our celebrations beforehand where it went a bit wrong for us is that we had ordered a bottle to our room for 5pm so we could have a toast on my birthday before heading out for a meal but it failed to arrive we phoned room service but were told they could not deliver and my husband had to go down to get one from the bar it took about three quarters of an hour to actually get what we had preordered;3
there is no microwave in the room which would help if you are traveling with kids does not come with free continental breakfast either got to pay for wifi the only and one and only good thing about the hotel is that it is walking distant to universal studio if we didnt travel with kids wouldnt stay there;3
the good great service by the employees especially front desk and valet location is the best you can get for universal easy walk to universal studios and a shuttle service the okay room location was second floor below the lobby standard room with an okay bedlumpy bedding the diamondgold line never had anyone working it no matter how busy it got so being a frequent hilton traveler isnt worth much at this hotel no room upgrade despite being offseason february the bad the food is just the worst now overpriced even by resort hotel standards every single meal was poor bread was stale oysters grainy meat was chewy they even managed to screw up pasta which should be darn near impossible avoid the slow overpriced buffet a few items are palatable;3
nice place for those that are not claustrophobic or those that dont like bright rooms it was kind of what i expected of new york small room we had 2 double beds no room to swing a cat we had 4 people all with luggage nearly checked out after 7 min after experiencing 10 12 people squeezing into lift which is for 8 maximumtagain claustrophobic i got off every time more than 6 people got in as you can imagine it took me time to get to my detination the pool is very small lap pool the reason we booked was because of pool and picture of pool roof area what a mistake i wanted to escape the darkness but you cant take your own food or drink onto the roof area paid 20 for a gin tonicdecent walk up to the roof area after leaving the lift lobby area again dark 3 of;3
the staff was almost always exceptional i was so impressed with almost everyone we interacted with the room was fairly meh it had a great view of the lincoln center but was was teeny tiny i visited with my eight year old daughter and it was tight accommodations not sure how two adults would make it for more than a night we experienced a number of issues with our room shower didnt work properly sink didnt drain well curtain rod was hanging awkwardly out of the ceiling all those issues were fixed promptly after reporting them though we were essentially kicked out of our room so maintenance could make repairs later we realized the shower wall seal didnt work and the bathroom flooded anytime someone showered so we showered quickly each time them mopped up the water;3
it has so much to offer but really feels as though its coasting on its location and faded glory and facilities we were upgraded to a suite but only because our room wasnt ready and after going away for a few hours and coming back still wasnt ready the biggest disappointment was that the pool was closed and that was the specific reason we chose this over other hotels dont get me wrong there is much to likelocation general feel roof top bar pool if open and eds chowder house but there seems to be a lack of pride a desultory apology about the pool being closed and a shrug of the shoulders 3 nights into our stay when we asked if was still closed is not really good enough when the hotel markets itself significantly on having one the staff we interacted with;3
we booked this hotel through hotelscom consider as a reduced price night there were fees associated with this hotel that one must read in the fine print before accepting i believe for our night this equated to about 30 some extra dollars i must say when you enter the lobby you are encircled by a nice modern red themed decor i was very impressed by the design the check in process was quick there are a couple scary elevators i remember the one we rode had a broken light the other customer riding with us was also scared the room was new york sized no issue with size we only needed a place to stay and sleep before our next day flight unfortunately the street noise was undeniable we attempted to use the constant feature on the air conditioner but to our;3
i have stayed at the new yorker many times the one thing that always strikes me is how friendly and polite all of the employees are whether it is the housekeeper concierge security front desk etc everyone greets you with a smile and an attitude as if they really enjoy working there this is an old world hotel with the mood of the 40s a step back in time beautiful old marble and decorative accents in the lobby dont expect contemporary appointments many rooms at this hotel are quite small the size of the room im given directly corresponds to my enjoyment at this property i was given a small room this six day trip in the past ive had larger rooms which typically generates a 4 experience and they know im a trip advisor reviewer when i checked in they told me;3
the kind bed was so nice and comfortable shower room has the rain shower and the regular hand shower it is so usuful while most of the todays hote has only rain shower the king room is large as that of at grand hyatt dfw breakfast buffet menu selection is good;3

we went to lincoln center 3x during our stay which is right across the street this convenience made up for the somewhat tiny room and stuffy air circulation in addition while wifi is free and slow in the lobby you have to pay for wifi in your room;3
we arrived at the new yorker after a 3 hour wait to get through immigration i would have thought an airport like jfk would have been more organised we got a taxi to the hotel 65 plus tip and upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a family suite on the 39th floor we were also told that we had free wifi and free international calls there was a facilities fee of 135 which we were told was for things like waterroom service etc turns out the facilities fee was for the free wifi and we felt completely ripped off and we were charged 92 dollars for this privilege of using this our upgraded suite turned out to be nothing more than a run down bedsit with a double bed and a dirty looking sofa bed we declined the offer of the upgrade and asked for the;3

before i start with the negative lets highlight the good points 1 location the hotel was located in a safe neighborhood easily accessible 2 no bed bugs this speaks for itself 3 friendly front desk staff at checkin the gentleman who greeted us at checkin was very friendly welcoming definitely something nice to see in a large hotel this was the bright spot for me in the entire trip but unfortunately there was some room for improvement 1 maintenance our room phone was not working no dial tone no nothing we actually went down to the desk and told someone they assured us it would be fixed but that never happened 2 what recent renovations the room itself was small not unexpected in a nyc hotel but also shabby the tv was an old model with;3

we booked this hotel through priceline thinking that it was a great deal it was advertised as a 4 star hotel i arrived extremely early that day so i left my suitcase and proceeded to give my information to the hotel clerk i asked her if she could provide us with a room with a view and told her that the highest the floor the better thinking that it would be a better option i was so wrong first let me tell you that while she took my information she started complaining to her coworker how difficult her job was and how it was to accommodate all the guests that have the same type of the request because apparently everyone wants a viewi politely asked her to do the best that she can as i was going to check in later in the day and maybe a good room would be available by that;3
the empire was in a good location with subway close and really good restaurants close however thats the best part we were there during the snow storm and the front door was frequently open sucking in the smoke from the people standing outside smoking generally only two of the four elevators worked usually only one we stayed on the fifth floor and it took a good 3 minutes for the water to get warm we actually wondered if the water was hooked up backwards yuri at the concierge seemed to be the only employee who liked being there no one was rude or mean but they by no means went out of their way for anyone that i had noticed our room was very warm even with the heat off we had to prop our window open with the bar of soap we found on the window ledge that someone;3
recently spent a night at the wyndham new yorker and the room was doable but mediocre at best the rooms clearly need to be renovated i can see where in past years this hotel may have been a high end hotel but to me it the room was just out dated and passable i did not feel as though i was staying at a four star hotel beware of offers to valet park your car it will cost you 75 per day and you cannot leave and return if you park your car yourself you will save 35 per day;3
clean quiet and comfortable all at a level reflected in the cost shared bathrooms were a minor problem room was bigger than expectedi would stay there again;3
about a 2 star really excellent staff got up early for a stroll through central park which was excellent couple of blocks from subway by no means luxury but ok for a short stay great reception staff and concierge;3
first impressions are everything and mine was not good arrived earlier than check in time and was told to come back at 3pm which was absolutely fine came back at 3 and was told i had to wait as they were in the middle of a shift change what sort of hotel schedules shift changes at check in time i stood at the counter waiting while 4 staff members stepped away on their computers and talked amongst themselves every now and again one of them asked what i wanted and i just kept repeating that i was waiting to check in by the time the fourth person asked me i quite loudly stated i am just trying to check in the woman then checked me in but was very abrupt and did not bother explaining any features of the hotel or where anything was very bad attitude the hotel;3
the location is brilliant we saw war horse which was right over the road at lincoln centre and central park was a short walk over 2 blocks i think it was there are two subway stations within close proximity so as far navigating our way around the city from the hotel it was a great base point the room was sooooo tiny nicely decorated but it didnt make up for how ridiculously tiny it was we also noted that it was our honeymoon and no one was interested i dont expect an upgrade and bubbly but a congratulations or acknowledgment from staff might have been nice the housekeeping service was painful we had to call no less than 6 times begging for new towels particularly a floor mat as the shower leaked onto the floor we resorted to using spare towels for this every;3
the jane has the advantage of a great location in a beautiful neighborhood in the west village that is quiet and safe next to hudson st greenwich st and west 4th st that are abundant with great little restaurants cafes and stores also just a few blocks away from the 8th ave14th st ace stop the service was great all the employees were polite and respectful with a smile on their face at all times the room was much smaller than expected even after i went through all the available pics online my only recommendation is the addition of some hangers bring your own also a room sink and some tissues would be awesome as the bathrooms use air dryers nevertheless the room was clean comfortable under the circumstances and provided a bottle of water every day the bathrooms;3

if you are going to nyc with the intentions of never being in your room then this is the place for you the location is fabulous 2 steps from lincoln center and also a subway stop 2 minutes to central park and a 10 minute walk to time square this hotel is very conveniently located of course in nyc everything is about location the hotel lobby is great the barlobby is fantastic and the rooftop bar and pool are amazing the views are awesome and the drinks are great the rooms are a bit of a disappointment make sure you know which room you are booking ahead of time the firstroom we were given was the size of a closet you can not walk in to the room with your luggage in your hand at the same time because there is no room for both you and the luggage there is no room;3
a good location at a fair price although the decor probably once bohemian is now on the shabby chic side and could do with some attention we were treated courteously by all the staff the bellman was particularly helpful in getting us a taxi during the friday rush hour build up and as we were celebrating a special birthday the front office had left us complimentary fizz and a handwritten card which was a nice touch and much appreciated thank you mr casas i was a little disappointed that the roof terracebar was only open thurs sat and was booked for a private function on the thursday night as we were staying mon fri this deprived us of the opportunity to use the facility as this had been a main factor decision making factor when comparing similar offers this was;3
hotel has gone downhill used to rate this hotel highly but since they changed and cheapened the regency club with their putrid food selection no more the staff is still great especially cairo and derek too bad they did this to the club;3

double bed not queen or king â two small beds z beds and a hollow middle â did my back in and i spent the second night sleeping on the floor they offer 10 a day for extra â free call anywhere â wifi gym and pool did not get to gym or pool room was ok and i love 1920 style â its opposite penn station just a walk and well apart from the small bed i should have complained wifi good big but average hotel we stayed as part of a package so i cannot help with the pricing;3

my 12 year old daughter and i stayed at this hotel in december this year yes the hotel is basic but clean enough rooms were small but adequate for 2 i agree with peoples comments on the fact that you are only sleeping in the hotel so why pay a lot we got a reasonable deal here flying with american airlines whom were excellent with masses of room on the plane the hotel is quite a way out but after the hustle and bustle of manhattan the peace is most welcome we to suffered from a cold room but we asked for an extra blanket which we got straight away and were then more than comfortable i was a little concerned before we went about getting to and from the hotel but after the first nights long walk back to hotel we tried out the subway not pretty but cheap and;3
iâve stayed at many hotels in midtown and this one is just ok on the positive side the rooms are in good condition the decor is quite nice rooms reasonably sized for nyc and the location just off broadway on 54th is convenient the negatives when we were there the room was expensive 400 for almost no amenities no restaurant no coffee maker in room call for a bar of soap took almost an hour for a response and the staff outside of the excellent bartender at the tiny bar were not friendly or helpful think two employees at the door almost always and no one opens the door for guests there are so many options in the area i donât think iâd tried here again;3
had booked for 5 days and at the time of checkin i was told that the room was upgraded staying in new york you do not expect big rooms but upgrade made me think it was a slightly better room there was absolutely no change same 2 feet clearance around the bed and bathroom which was tough to fit even a person less than 5 9 except that there was coffee machine in the room the only advantage was that it was just 10 minutes walk to the office;3
we stayed for 4 nights in early december check in was easy but when we got to our room the bathroom sink was filled with dirty water with a dirty glass next to the tap we rang reception and it was quickly sorted but it left us wondering how clean the room was given it has been left like that the room was small but functional it was hot though and we had the aircon unit running constantly which wasnt great for my skin the location was fine close to central park and sights like moma we walked to most places we wanted to see if we returned to new york we would stay in the village though i think overall a fine stay but nothing stood out and marred at the start by the cleaning issue;3
booked here because of proximity to penn station access to ewr figured rooms would be tiny in an old hotel and they were no problem there downsides once they have your email address they just dont let up in their effort to squeeze every last nickle out of you frequent offers to buy upgrades meals tours etc etc arrive daily in the run up to your stay want a checkin prior to 4pm that will be 50 late check out same if youre above the 20th floor better budget up to a 15 minute wait for an elavator and hell awaits those with animal dander allergies decades of visitors for the westminster and other animal pageants make this place a severe challenge to breathe in getting our train to the airport was a breeze though;3
the hostel was clean iâll give them that it was also cheap and it was actually 100 cheaper than expected when we checked in which was great it is however cheap for a reason but to be honest i think you get what you pay for and we were happy enough the bed collapsed every time we sat on one side and the shower had to run for literally 10 minutes to heat up it was quite a comical experience the ceiling fan didnât work either but they fixed it as soon as we notified them and they offered us another room after the bed saga staff were generally friendly too and it is in a good location good for a few daysâ cheapish stay in new york;3
really disappointed for the money we paid room was so small we did not have room to place our two suitcases complained to hotel we were then given a slightly larger room which was more acceptable hotel is older and really needs upgraded and staff were not very friendly;3
well what you read on this site is pretty accurate the room was mini sized just enough space for the bed and small desk it was clean the bed was pretty soft so there was some ok things but when i got off the elevator i couldnât find my room the reason because it was in the stairwell yes i had to go through the fire door to the exit stairwell and there on the landing was the door to my room it was terrible loud people donât mind walking up one flight of stairs and standing on the landing and talking loudly until they go through the door to the hallway and their room at all hours the other thing that was very annoying the shower i could not stand under the shower unless i was at an angle because this has to be the only hotel;3
we stayed here for 3 nights the location of this hotel is fantastic it is a few minutes walk from the south west corner of central park and about 20 minutes walk from times square and the rockafeller centre this was the highlight of the hotel the hotel is pleasant enough but our room was quite small and there was no view from the window apart from the massive air conditioning unit outside which hummed constantly this meant no sun light or breaze could get through the window during the night about every 2 hours a very loud clunking noise would begin which woke us every time we subsequenly asked to have our room changed the next day which they seemed happy to do we were to pack our things and that our suitcases would be moved to the next room when we got back;3
clean but not much service took forever to have a clean room in the morning location is great but i would not stay in the astor again 120 per night is way overpriced the only thing i could say is that it was nothing more than ok;3
pros close to penn station close to subway which will take you direct to wtc in one direction and natural history museum in other direction comfortable room albeit quite small hairdryersafe provided good view of empire state building cons outdated furniturebathroom water takes ages to drain in shower your feet end up dirty no coffee facilities this alone drops it down a whole star for me such a simple change no room service etc no bottled water provided in room location feels unsafe see below overall an adequate stay we were here 4 nights i think if youâre just stopping in nyc this place would do you fine but for slightly longer trips i found myself wanting a little bit more just basic stuff that is missing such as coffee making;3
the bath was clean but the tub was broken and would not hold water when i arrived home my credit card was charge 100 more than the bill i was given accounting wasnt available when i called there was smoking smell coming into our non smoking room we were awoken numerous times from the loud neighbors we are talking from 1030 pm to around 3 am i found it confusing getting from parking garage to lobby the parking card we were given didnt work so we had issues getting out and back into the garage it would have been nice if there was better signage coming from the garage area to the lobby check in area the room did have a nice view the staff we did deal with were friendly the shuttle service was nice and ran efficiently;3
we paid 249 a night for 2 beds 2 adults1child subway location great shower great bed super comfy look beyond that my daughter lost a part to a toy so i was under the bed and dresser filthy manhattan diner just down the street amazing food and service room very outdated ac worked one ice machine on 11 th floor a little pricy for me especially since we just needed it to sleep and shower neighbor hood very safe feeling staff very friendly bed comfy and very refreshing shower my cellphone did not work in the room and no wifi in the room ok in lobby hotels computers you pay to use;3
other than the lovely women working the breakfast area excellent full service breakfast included this staff needs retraining i actually had a busboy rudely and loudly embarrassing me in front of a room full of people try to stop me from taking my ill husband a small bowl of cereal some fruit and a juice upstairs to him his arrogance was unheard of in someone in such a position the maintenence worker who came to fix the lack of hot water in our room which turned out to be a ten minute lag rudely said what this not hot enough for you when it was luke warm i learned to run the sink and tub for ten minutes prior to getting in the shower the beds needs new mattress pads badly and comfortors that dont weigh a ton the halls are very loud and the hotel is;3

nice hotel but the shuttle bus is fouled up we got in late and had to leave early the late pick up worked well the early morning 7am pick up was messed up two busses came by full yet it was supposed to be only a hyatt regency shuttle i forced our way on to the third one the driver didnât like it i wonder if the drivers are pocketing money for their own pick up service;3
this place was just what i expected from the reviews it was run down and old and just perfect for the money and what we needed we found the room was clean and did not smell the bathroom was large and clean we never had to wait for the bathroom the neighborhood was quiet and safe an easy walk to the subway i would have no problem staying here again holly bryan fort worth texas;3
though room was small it was very clean and nicely furnished the hotel had a very euro feel it was definitely nice to be across from central park the staff was friendly and courteous would definitely stay there again;3

well lets start with the good things about it 1 location very nice area on the upper west side of manhattan lots of restaurants pubs coffee shops close by we walked around late at night and didnt feel unsafe 2 close to public transit bus stop is within a 2minute walk and subway a 5min walk 3 bedroom is clean sheets and towels smell nice and the cable works well shower has great water pressure bathroom was clean as well 4 there is a fully equipped kitchen for guests use so if youre on a budget you can buy frozen food or whatever and cook there now for the bad things about 1 rude staff i never had such a bad first impression of a hotel before we got there and without even greeting us the gentleman at the counter asked for our reservation;3
great restaurants teeny room no view excellent mattress great location this historic old hotel needs a renovation so this is a mixed review no 2 rooms are alike many dont have a coffee maker it seemed clean our chamber maids were attentive to our needs the location hotel restaurants make this worth consideration;3
its cheap for la and the room is okay but the location is not so good there are no places to eat within walking distance not that you would want to walk in this area as we never felt safe i think it would be better to just pay more money and stay somewhere else;3
of the 4 hotels i stayed at during my visit to nyc this was my 3rd favorite i had asked for a quiet room so i was upgraded according to the front desk clerk this room had a queen bed rather than the king i requested but i oked the change no fridge contrary to what i had expected but i made do with the ice machine across the hall which was very noisy i saw a tiny cockroach a couple hours after arrival sneaking up on a bit of granola id left on the dresser maybe it had hitchhiked in on my rolling suitcase i dont know squished it many affordable places to eat starbucks subway a few green grocers drug stores diner a subway stop not the edible kind a block away a block from symphony space performing arts center hotel elevators were a little slow;3
we stayed at the empire hotel for christmas this was a late honeymoon for us and i had seen the hotel on the website and decided to go after reading mixed reviews yes the rooms are small but its manhatten how long do you want to spend in your room on the first night we did get a room that was next to some very noisy air con units outside but when we went down the next day they swapped us with no problem the bar downstairs was very nice the bar food we had was yummy we didnt make it to the upstairs bar but im sure it was lovely the location was brillant central park just a couple of blocks over lincoln centre right next door and columbus circle was just brilliant we were there for 3 days and managed to get pretty much everywhere by walking thats how good the;3
was a regular at the empire a few years back the location is great the sun deck during summer is amazing the service is pretty much ok for ny and the prices are good value for the city spent two stays one of two nights and another of one night the same week this august first room was great two queen beds and nice view the second was awful minute with view on a wall even though both rooms cost the same it was something to do with the rate at one particular date suppose its fair but i would not want to have paid 300us for the second room at any time more annoying is what they call the splash package which was supposed to englobe free wifi and breakfast well the receptionist forgot to give me the code for the wifi so as i had no idea she was;3
everything was just ok except the toilet needed service the chain inside the tank broke so we had to manually flush the toilet not so great something bad with the food i actually got sick a few hours after breakfast we had breakfast downstairs we had a family in the hospital near by so we really didnt have a choice of which hotel to stay at;3
stayed in a captains room for five nights recently this is a double room with private bathroom both room and bathroom were good sizes and i loved the decor which presumably has been refreshed since the titanic sank but not restyled no kettle in room but kettles in rooms seem to be going out of fashion based on my recent experiences drinking water is provided the room did get cold but heaters are available if you ask the worst thing is probably the noise it is a very noisy hotel there is a busy road outside and a bar and a nightclub on the ground floor staff and other guests add to the noise throughout the night take earplugs if noise bothers you but besides that the location is great cafe gitane is excellent have the avocado on toast and the staff were;3

check room when you arrive before committing some rooms termed deluxe are anything but lighting and amenities in some rooms are poor no night tables no lamps low energy bulbs in overhead light front desk very slow to pick up telephoneno milk sweetener for complimentary coffee;3
everything about the hotel is small from the lobby to the elevators to the hallways to the room that plus the tiredness of the carpets the walls and the room we were on the 8th floor make you realize the age of the hotel they do have signs posted about renovations but to be honest the place is just old and while you can spruce a place up you cant make it bigger that said if you can get past the smallness and tiredness it is a decent location for a manhattan visit the 96th street subway is around the corner as are several eateries and central park is a 10 minute walk oh one more thing parking kind of important in nyc the hotel does not provide parking but has an arrangement for 27day with the hertz lot on 95th street as we discovered this;3
its a nice hotel overall few annoying things the room keys deactivate everyday so after going in the really slow lift to your room you will have to go all the way back down again most annoying thing was paying 200 for parking standing at the desk waiting to have our room keys reset once again and a couple next to us checking in said they didnt want to pay for parking so the receptionist said she will remove the parking fee so we paid 200 they pay nothing;3
few blocks from central park breakfast and pharmacy within the block relatively quiet and clean however during the 2 nights we stayed there the toilet clogged twice and we did not have cold water for shower one morning very old structure the administration tries hard to make it work but not always successful would need more significant investment to bring it up to date which should be easily done considering the price charged manhattan prices anywhere else this property would be a 1star;3
the location is great the bed is very comfortable and clean although the bathroom is very small which does not have ventilation and a very small toilet the bar is ok but the restaurant is generally poor;3
great location that must be what we paid for the room was small but this is new york after all for more than 400 i foolishly hope for a bit more luxury it was clean the couple of small pieces of trash left under the desk notwithstanding maybe the maid was in hurry who could blame her bed was comfortable but the noise from the rooftop ac units made me glad i travel with earplugs there was no bath mat not a major crisis but still all in all it was comfortable but thats about it;3
we spent 10 days in this hotel and the over all impression is that it needs a freshening up the first room we were put in was horribleold dirty wall to wall carpeting very dusty run down stinky stale cigarette smoke and very sharp air freshner smell and yellow from nicotine the furniture was huge and outdated and a big television cabinet took up most of the floorspace the television was from the age way before flatscreens and the reception was very bad we asked to be moved after spending 30 min in the first room and there was no objections we got a new room that was much bettercleaner but still run down and with wall to wall carpeting there was a flatscreen on the wall and the reception was ok both rooms had airconditioning wich was quite loud so we turned it of;3
we stayed for a couple of nights given we spent a day at universal studios and basically were disappointed we felt there were a number of negatives as follows the response to requests for further room items shower gel make up pads was poor to such an extent that on more than one occasion we did not get what we asked for sound proofing between rooms was poor the ambiance within the current temporary bar was non existent the restaurant is set up in school dinner style ok for breakfast but too sterile for enjoying an evening meal surprised no complimentary water supplied there were positives but well outnumbered by the negatives the positives were good location for visiting universal studios and park the room was comfortable but should be for the price charged;3
the jane was booked at the last minute as i arrived during nyc fashion week and my preferred hotels were booked the jane did not disappoint my room was very small i believe the building is an old sailors quarters on the hudson river since converted in a hotel loved cafe gitane on the ground floor fantastic coffee which is somewhat of a rarity in america super cool art deco themed foyer and pleasant helpful staff would book again albeit a larger room;3
stayed here for 2 nights before qm2 cruise was worried seeing other reviews but pleasantly surprised as it was clean and had a spacious bathroom with a tub to soak in yippee i get so fed up of just a poky shower with no tub nice area with good little turkish run deli at end of block which i highly recommend for breakfast and good coffeenot too strong and really tasty opposite cpark great location and on direct bus route from centre of nyc need to get a metro card for fares as the drivers can only take dollar coins and its only 2 a trip frequent clean buses why pay taxi fares and on departure day they arranged our taxi to cruise terminal for us and it was on time waiting for us only drawback is noisy plumbing during night would i stay again probably yes if i was;3
ive stayed there twice the beds are pretty good the size of the twin room wasnt bad and the bathrooms and showers were quite clean the soundproofing of the rooms is very bad if youre a light sleeper you might find yourself annoyed they charge for the wifi which isnt very pleasant the location is very convenient for tourism in london and its very close to a tube station i would go there again;3
the picture shows the most desirable bit of the hotel its very beige standard fittings gross bed duvets helpful reception breakfast is good but walk outside and down the driveway than back in as the lift is very dodgy you begin to wonder whether you will be able to get out breakfast had waffles bagels eggs cereal lemonade coffee toast bacon etc hotel is quite far from hollywood thank fully a mtr station is close wendys burgers just across the road ok hotel for the price actually stayed in april 2010;3
price was right but airconditioning was not working properly and the fellow at the desk tried to tell me thats the way it worked in temperate climates location is a bit nasty with nothing to do within walking distance wouldnt stay again or recommend given the number of other hotels in la;3
the location is great not even a 5 minute walk to lincoln centre subway station or slightly further to columbus circle the subway line gets you easily to times square etc central park was also a 510minute walk away very small room but apparently that is what you expect in nyc king size bed was comfortable enough desk and a lounge chair in the corner however the storage space was very poorly done there was a small set of drawers with three drawers and a standalone cupboard which also housed the mini fridge and safe which left some hanging room but the safe and fridge got in the way if you wanted something to hang straight and not just hang and sit on top we ended up using the drawers for some things and had to push the sofa chair out of the way so we could leave;3
we stayed at the hotel on august 2 and 3 2004 not knowing what to expect after reading all the negative reviews we were surprised yes the place is old and the elevator holds only about 3 people the beds were very comfortable the room was clean and the shower had excellent water pressure just dont flush the toilet when someone is in the shower you may be scalded the blanket had a rip in it but we were able to request extra pillowsno extra blankets available hotel staff was friendly great location to the subway this place is nothing special but if youre just going to sleep and shower the price 116 is what we paid per night was definitely right we would stay there again;3
dont think well be coming back to this hotel after having drinks in the hotel on 6212022 we went out for dinner and the laptop we were using in the room had been taken when we returned we asked security to review the tapes and find it as we had not left the hotel with it this morning i find from find my device that it is now in playa vista which is just north of the airportfive days after checking out of the hotel since we never left the area the only explanation is that housekeeping took the computer when they saw us leave the room tuesday night the 22nd of june sometime between 5 and 9pm there is no other explanation we didnt put it away or in the safe we were in room 341 close to the elevator with this kind of activity we wont be returning to this;3
we stayed at the hilton one night to see a concert at hollywood bowl we did walk city walk in the day time so it was a great location for universal city attractions this was our 5th hotel of the trip and we were a little disappointed in the personal feel of the hotel based on the experiences we received at the other hotels this felt more of a large franchise that farmed you in and farmed you out the only reason we received free wifi was because we were hhonors members and in this day and age free wifi should be pretty standard the hotel were working on their elevators so people had to wait long periods of time to get leave or get back to their room i commend the staff because they were cognizant of the waits and had someone assigned at all times to get you to where;3
the website looked much better than the actual hotel lobby was the most impressive part of the stay great location though i probably will chose another hotel for my next trip to nyc ive stayed in many different nyc hotels and i think this was my least favorite;3
do not use the phone in any case the rate is absurd inexplicable the location is great subway line 123 lincoln center stores restaurants etc it would be better if you needed the care;3

im writing this review from the hotel now im staying in the 3rd floor a cabin room traveling solo i booked directly with hotel ive stayed in many boutique hotels and this one is definitely one of the quirkier ones to make it easier im going to divide review into positives and negatives positives hotel location is surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes the staff is very friendly hotel is kept very clean and thats including the shared bathrooms barely no wait time to use the showersbtw the rainfall shower head is fabulous rooms aka cabins are ultra tiny but good use of space and storage see pics bed firm but comfortable hotel has tremendous charm and character subway 1015 minutes away a train negatives this has been;3
i had to wait a few hours to get another room but it was worth the wait the first one was literally over the front door with huge traffic noise if i have a complaint however it is that there is no way to get coffee first thing in the morning no in room maker or lobby offering;3
the hotel is nice and comfortable however attention was not the best the last day a lady in charge of housekeeping knocked on my door in the morning to ask if i had checked out this was annoying for me because the suggested check out time was about 11 am but she was beating my door at 8 am when i was resting and this was annoying for me i felt pressured to leave the hotel on the other hand when i went to cancel my account i noticed that you loaded the different cost universal charger as the price does not appear in the service book the first day i arrived at the hotel i contacted the front desk to ask for the price of universal charger and you mentioned to me that the cost was 15 plus tax at that time i estimated a maximum cost of 20 usd but the surprise for me was;3
this is a decent hotel with great service the downside the hotel was built in the 80s and looks it the rooms are fine ive stayed here twice and the second time the shower drain was clogged and showering resulted in an ankle deep bath the up side the staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is great if you have business in universal city or are visiting the park;3
checkin was simple enough paid in advance some of the lifts didnt work but the alternative lift still got us to the right floor easy enough bed was very comfy and had a sound nights sleep rooms are small booked queensize but well apportioned with good facilities water an issue fine in the evening freezing cold in the morning ran for 10 minutes still freezing cold wifi did not work and staff could not resolve the issue high rooms get a lot of noise from the street not that bad if expecting it air con is very noisy too close to everything with the subway nearby restaurants shops great location;3
nice historical building great location right next to the subway when we arrived to the room maintenance was unexpectedly there the sink in our bathroom was always clogged so that was most likely why reported it to reception a few times but the issue was never fixed it didnât bother us much as the pipes in the building are definitely not new but itâs an inconvenience if you need to shave great views if you get a top floor room;3
i had the worst check in experience because the staff does not know the computer system normally i really dont mind but this time we checked into this hotel around 12 midnight we were tired and hungry with our young son keeping us at the reception for a very long time was no fun we order room service after that and it was fast service and the food was better than i expected overall the location was good and the other staff was very friendly;3
my wife and i stayed here as part of our honeymoon we thought wed pick somewhere that looked a bit special and would be nice to stay in my biggest complaint is that its supposed to be a 4 star hotel but its not really it doesnt have the atmosphere or the service to have that sort of accolade nobody even offered to help with the luggage were not hotel snobs by any means but we were expecting a little bit more and felt ripped off our first room was tiny damp and had absolutely no view we complained about the damp and were offered another room which was a bit bigger and overlooked the lincoln centre but was not really that great it really was a let down at the start of a special holiday and although we would go back to new york we wouldnt stay here again if youre;3
food was great parking is not free traffic to reach hotel was terrible service is excellent price was very good kids are allowed to stay with no extra charges staff is very cooperative hotel views are very good extremely clean looks refreshing;3
beautiful lobby great elevators and great location unfortunately i was on a floor with loud people who left their doors wide open until late at night i got the impression that they live there bedroom was okay but bathroom was circa 1962 lots of grout missing and cracked tiles on walls not sure if tick tock diner is owned by hotel but the people were not friendly or helpful customers were complaining;3
fantastic location but the room was very dated 28th floor and very small we were a family of 4 and there was no room to walk around the beds there was also very little room to store clothes or toiletriesthere was a shelf in the bathroom but it was very narrow and at a slant so everything fell in the sink no tea and coffee facilities in the room but there is a mcdonalds across the road which is open 24hrs so that was great for us i wouldnt stay here again due to the small rooms and the outdatedness of it all but for location it ticks all the boxes;3
we are back at the empire hotel hardly our first choice the reasons are twofold our preferred spots were unavailable since this was tree time at rockefeller center and we were attending a longish opera at the met across the street in lincoln center so here is the number one reason for being at the empire location if you have something at lincoln center or environs even that is qualified by the noise levels outside our 8th floor room facing lc the hotel provides ear stoppers practically the only freebie in the place prices are high here and they are way beyond the value of the hotel and beyond the basic price how about this addon 3 for a mediocre cup of coffee made with an ancient model of a keurig in the room and of course a fee for wifi in the room and in;3
hotel had everything we needed the only downside was that there was a mouse in my sisters room and then ran into her 2 childrens joining room she rang down to reception in the middle of the night and got no answer she had to get dressed and go down herself the manager took her to one side and said they would investigate we were moving on next morning and was told that they would ring us no phone call or apology my sister asked for a refund through out travel company but this was refused she was offered a free nights stay in the hotel if she was to return as if;3
the empire hotel is in a great location across the street from lincoln center near wonderful restaurants walking distance from theater district and museums hotel employees are nice and efficient bathrooms are small and inefficient;3
this hotel is old but fairly clean ask for non smoking room people on floor were smoking spoke with desk clerk male said if you see someone let me know nothing was ever done about it the four days we were guest we had the odor of smoke plus no tv for two days told us the first day everything was done the second day we were told the same that night going out to dinner talk with another guest about the tv and they had tv spoke with clerk at desk and he told everything still down when i told him that i just talked with another guest and they had tv told me that some did have it others did not it was not until i said i need a credit on my bill did i get action when we came back from dinner he stopped me and told me we had tv went to our room and put on tv nothing;3
i was recently put in this hotel while in nyc interviewing for a job the hotel itself is fine the location is good if you are going to something at the lincoln center or dont want to deal with all the hoopla of times square and it is a short walk from columbus circle personally i prefer being down near more of the action but that is just a personal preference the main drawback of this hotel is the feeling of it being very cheap what i mean by that is their attempt to charge for every little thing as people have mentioned the in room items are outrageously priced a bottle of water or a can of coke is 750 a bottle of complimentary water would be nice the worst part to me was since i was there for business i really needed to use the desk in the room;3
just got back from nyc and had a great time second stay at empire hotel the location for lincoln center and central park cannot be beat the staff is professional and do their best to insure a comfortable stay i really only have two complaints that management should be able to rectify rather easilyfirstly the showers seem to runout of hot water this morning i actually had the faucet turned all the way to maximum heat and it was still chilly the shower was never really very warm but todays temperature made me write this review the second problem is that they charge 300 for in room keurig pods that is just excessive there are plenty of starbucks around so either dont offer in room coffee or charge a reasonable price i found the price insulting petty and;3
hotel next to main subway and only 10 minutes walk to times square water bottle in room eight dollars bottle of jamesons whiskey 255 dollarsdo not worry cheap supermarket next door did not sample hotel food although overall it was a good hotel helpful and pleasant taxis on door step room very nice although noisy aircon unit;3
small hotel in an excellent location rooms are small and basic but clean mini bar as always way over priced road noise through night was at times unbearable with roadworks construction and garbage collection going on;3
i probably shouldnt complain about this hotel because i got a really good deal on hotwire that being said if i had to pay full price for what i got id be quite unhappy my husband and i just spent 2 nights at the empire so its all fresh in my mind check in was a snap lobby and bar scene is nice decor in general modern and edgy our room was a standard with 2 double beds with hotwire you dont really have a choice of beds you take what they give you it was small very small and upon entering we realized right away the heat wasnt working not good when the outside temp was about 17 degrees we put a call in right away and they said they would take care of it and they did then we checked out the bathroom it was tiny barely one person could move around in it;3
noisy room bathroom a bit small but with great shower doormen very kind and available after electrical fault breakfast offered much appreciated he located and friendly staff almost always convenient location and well served by public transport;3
the photo you see is not the front of the hotel itâs the back where the parking lot is the hotel is decent but dated especially the bathroom old tile mildew in the grout and chalking etc the area the hotel is located is sketchy and seriously run down so much so the parking lot is fully fenced with two security gates but thatâs hollywood unless youâre staying at a 5 star thatâs what youâre going to get overall for the price it was decent parking was 26 way over priced and not included in the prepay price;3
the hotel is on 8th avenue three long blocks from the javits center i chose valet parking as the price was about the same as doityourself parking around the block while i was there madison square gardens is a block away i took in the billy joel concert while i was there good hotel for the price conscious there are old rooms and newly updated rooms i had a updated room nothing to complain about friend had an old room was less than thrilled get an updated room;3
hotel is conveniently located just literally steps away from the entrance of the 96th street entrance with key attractions penn station times squares wall street area etc just stops away on a direct line line 1 red rooms are a decent size for nyc and reasonably comfortable and clean with good showers and decent amenities my only complain is that the carpet needs some deep chemical cleaning or changing it feels grimy to the touch otherwise a good base to explore the city easy walking distance to central park with plenty of eateriesrestaurants nearby;3
it was fine glossy lobby and pool deck areas rooms probably were great when they were built but they have definitely seen better days bathroom door swipes the toiletthe bathroom is that small;3
we heard there was drinks on the menu named after all the gossip girl characters and being such a fan of the show i couldnt wait to try some and be in the hotel that featured so much in the shows the decor is nice but dated we sat in the lobby by the stairs and bar and its very dingy we asked the waitress about the drinks but she said they had stopped servicing them 6 months ago why was it still on their website then she said if we knew the name we could order it though we couldnt remember the names so took a guess for chuck bass and got 2 im chuck basss for 15 each and they were tiny after 4 drinks the bar girl asked us to either go upstairs or leave as they were shutting the bar how can they be shutting the bar and asking people to leave the hotel lobby;3
the location was great but my room was small had less than 500 watts of light in the room excluding the bathroom and the closet was minute i was there on business so i didnt spend much time in the room but i will look for another hotel the next time i need to be in that area;3
first of all i actually like the location of the hotel most of my friends begged me to stay out of the general times square area but i am bullheaded so i booked anyway i wasnt disappointed by its proximity to broadway which was my most important consideration though if you want familyfriendly relatively cleaner and attractive scenery this is not the hotel for you as for the staff people in new york arent the most warm and welcoming but i received decent treatment during my stay the room i booked the new yorker suite was adequate as expected it was compact compared to other hotel suites and the bathroom was small im asian so thats saying something;3
the bathroom looked like it hadnt been renovated since the 40s the water pressure was nonexistent the queen sized bed was definitely more like a full sized bed the rest of the furniture definitely looked dated and worn out the location was nice however and it was convenient to have a diner albeit pricy even for new york in the building;3
check in was a breeze was walking distance to all the touristy places very disappointed with the roof top bar walked in around midnight could tell they wanted us out as fast as possible to go home and the drinks were very expensive we asked to sit outside and were denied as soon as we got a drink they handed us the check the pool on the roof top was a nice touch the view from the pool deck was really nice room is very small but perfect for us since we were just sleeping there the shower has some water damage in the upper right corner and the bottom of the door was rotten out the shower design was nice but the excess water flooded the floor each morning wish they gave us a few extra towels when we booked trip advisor said we would have a view o the parkinstead we;3
a nice hotel in a great location but our room was very small and basic with a very poor outlook which was disappointing bathroom needed an update badly hotel staff were really helpful and friendly free wifi was good;3
small room and very small bathroom reception gives a feel of 1960s which is different the only thing i liked but i would recommend staying in a newer hotel as the prices are similar but the amenities will be better than this hotel i guess my expectations were too high with it as i liked watching the tv series where it was featuredl wont stay here again also the wifi even it is paid is too slow i used to go to nearby starbucks to use internet;3
my wife and i were very much looking forward to staying at the hotel due to the big hype it gets everywhere we were rather unimpressed the rooms are very small and the bathrooms even smaller the staff although fairly friendly have a very rushed attitude this helps in receiving assistance quickly but you never feel calm and relaxed there are always lines of people waiting for checkin bag storage drinks everywhere this is probably the reason the staff seem so rushed but i like a relaxed feel when i get to my hotel if you enjoy returning to a calm and soothing atmosphere after a long day of shopping or sightseeing this is not the place for you the other thing youll notice at the elevators is a bunch of people waiting to take their own luggage to their rooms i;3
the location of this hotel is okay easily walkable to times square and near to penn station unfortunately thats where the positives end walked out of the lift to see curtains up with apologies about refurbishing went into room to find it had no view at all looked onto other rooms despite asking for a city view customer service was nothing to write home about asked for information on the area and was given as little info as the staff could manage tried the tick tock diner go elsewhere is my advice the food was overpriced the staff were stressed and unfriendly and we ended up leaving most of the food as inedible our room was in need of refurbishment cracked tiles and patched up areas in bathroom when complained was told room would be taken out of circulation;3
the location is excellent but the room is very small the television was problematic had to call for help twice but it doesnt get the normal channels i only had cold water in the shower the third morning i had asked for a wakeup call but did not receive one when i went to the basement to get ice after an injury i had to step over rolls of carpet and bags of debris to reach the ice machine i wouldnt stay there again;3
though this was a great location next to the universal city just a short walk in fact being such a large hotel chain with apparent standards i was hoping for more for 7 nights my room was only serviced once the barlounge was very expensive the shower took a while to heat up if at all the greatest amenity however would be the pool and heated hot tub;3
great location subway just in front of the hoteldecent neighborhood with the charm of upper west side budget hotel in newyork good location standard rooms are lousyoutdated and very tiny always go for updated or renovated room with upgrade worth it as big difference in the room typeelevators are very slow when busy period need to wait for long time waiting;3
this is a late review i spent one night at the jane on a trip for work i didnt choose the hotel and had low expectations despite the cute website i stayed in a single room as expected the room was narrowsitting sideways on the bed my feet could touch the opposite wall however the decor made it feel cozy not claustrophobic the layout and the design was very smart with lots of room for storage it was actually more comfortable than many larger rooms ive stayed in the location is fantastic its a pretty neighborhood that made me feel like i was in a movie about new york i was with a group of folks and it was fun having several rooms on the same floor the service was mixed the checkin process was painfully slow and i felt embarrassed about the costumes;3
i wanted somewhere clean and comfy for a short sightseeing break and thats exactly what i got the staff on the desk were polite the bed was fine no issues with the wifi it was incredibly quiet and ideal for getting to the subway but also not that far from central park i liked being away from the hustle of downtown and since its slightly off the beaten track that made it all the more interesting there is a good jazz bar close by and some decent restaurants too i could also leave my suitcase in their storage area before i got my flight home very convenient only drawback is the shared bathrooms yes they are in need of updating but they are all clean serviceable ac could have been a little bit better too as it got a bit warm at night but you can live with;3
keep it simple stop charging guest for breakfast honestly i would not return to this hotel for that the lighting in the bathroom is very dim overall the location to the airport is perfect shuttle service is good;3
i booked this hotel on the understanding that as a wheelchair user this was fully accessible unfortunately this was not the case and access was via a portable ramp which was not particularly safe but moreso was undignified entering and leaving hotel by holding up passersby all that being said the front of house staff were extremely helpful and special mention to mourad for his assistance;3
absolutely love the bed the hotel building and furnitures are pretty outdated but it wasnt a problem for us room is quite clean staff are friendly and helpful free wifi in the lobby is pretty fast location is considerably far from downtown but its very easily reachable via metro with line 123 just 2minute walk from the hotel the room rate is normally pretty good value but i left it quite late so i paid for a much more expensive price then i should have there are a few pharmacies restaurants and shops nearby which is very convenient central park isnt far away but we didnt try to get there by foot;3
the location was great and the hotel pleasant i was given worng information about the timing of breakfast despite asking twice and this led me to miss out on having breakfast which was included in the price paying for coffee in the room in a hotel of this expense is ridiculous;3
ii dont understand reviewers saying that the hotel disappointed them what do you guys expect paying 200 usd per night in manhattan yeah the staff dont care about you yeah the rooms arent luxurious but you are getting value here walk around manhattan all day return to the hotel take a shower and get some rest and thats it the hotel is located in upper west side a very calm location not a tourist neighborhood by the way but its are one block and half from the metro line 6 and you can be anywhere in the nyc area in minutes ideal for low budget travellers;3
the empire has always been a favorite of mine great location great staff and a great atmosphere unfortunately my last stay was a little disappointing the bed was quite uncomfortable and i was unable to get a good nights rest and our room smelled like sewage the last two nights we were there however i am always pleased with the staff there as well as the location;3
we just stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and we found that the location including the free shuttle service that takes you to universal was fantastic it was a great feature and the rooms were extremely spacious and clean however we ordered room service 3 times and all 3 times the food was not enjoyable even being uneatable one time we also ate in the restaurant and we found the food choice to be limited when ordering off the menu and again not that great we do believe the food needs to be improved and the variety updated finally we enjoyed the service very friendly staff our arrival was handled pretty normal just a few glitches but nothing to complain about although the look of the hotel could use an update it is a very old looking outdated hotel;3
this is a nice hotel for an overnight stay to catch a flight the next day this is not a destination hotel if someone is vacationing in la you donât want to stay here in my case i had an overnight layover;3
after reading the reviews i was very worried let me tell you it was for nothing we were received by smiling helpful staff who were busy but courteous and yes the rooms are not the ritz but the beds were comfy and clean i check everythinga tad retentive the bathroom was small but clean the toilet had flushing issues but someone was up within 5 min of us calling cmon people its a reaaallly old building i found it to be a place i would stay again and recommend to friends as it was inexpensive clean and by clean i mean well cleaned by the staff there are age issues with the building for sure but that cant really be avoided they are renovating and very convenient cab ride to times sq was around 7 bucks you can walk but make sure you have good well;3
we could never get either the tv or the heatair conditioning to work despite having staff up to instruct us on both and the beds have stands with legs like exposed square pipes that each of us accidentally kicked with our bare feet during the night ouch;3
i visited this hotel as part of a school trip in february 2016 my first impression was that it was very old definitely needed a redesign the lifts were old and quite creaky in the room the tv was old and not the best quality but i suppose in the inner city you wont have much time to watch it the bathroom was small but seemed to be okay at first throughout our stay things began to reveal themselves to us for example the shower was never a good temperature the temperature went from boiling hot to freezing cold every ten seconds or so leaving you with 23 seconds of tolerable water at a time despite how hot you have the temperature set after speaking to my friends this was the same in their rooms too and was unbelievably irritating secondly our toilet wouldnt;3
recently stayed here after a long journey checked into rm 522 at 10pm to discover that half the rm hadnt been cleaned there was takeaway in the fridge dirty cups not hoovered sink and floor not washed and when i moved the face cloth it was full of beard hair i rang reception to be told housekeeping had gone home and to leave a list to morrow which is not acceptable at all but it was 3 am our time and we were exhausted i myself used to work on reception and someone even if it is the receptionist themselves should of cleaned the rm after all i am paying to stay there i found the receptionists very frosty no good morning not even asked if we had a nice stay just didnt care conceirge were lovely and the only ones who actually spoke to you it was resolved the next day but;3
we stayed at the empire for five nights as the second leg of our honeymoonas were on honeymoon a bottle of prosecco appeared in our room with two glasses which was a lovely touch the hotel was centrally located between two subway stations near to central parc and the lincoln centre there were plenty of restaurants within a stones throw away our room was small and dark with no view and very little storage space virtually no wardrobe space the noise from the air conditioning unit was quite loud fortunately we did get used to it so it didnt effect our sleep the bed was large and comfortable the room average a bit shabby in places and the repairs that had been made had been done to a poor standard as other reviewers have pointed out there is no complimentary;3
we booked our room directly through the hotel website and payed 8995 with the aaa discount which is a very good deal in new york city we too had read several bad reviews of the hotel on this website and were scared as to what we might find we were pleasantly surprised the lobby area is old looking but nice and the staff was prompt and friendly parking is not fun around the hotel you can pay 20 a day around the corner but if you want to save money and park on the street beware of the crazy nyc rules on the left side of the street there is no parking on mon and thurs from 11301 and on the right side of the street there is no parking on tues and fri from 11301 you can park anywhere on wednesdays apparantly they clean the streets at those times it;3
great location to the studio about 10 mins walk rooms are of good size as well and amenities sufficient beds as expected are comfortable although hotel is under going renovation it is minimal inconvenience to memy family as we are out most part of the day breakfast spread including hot food is sufficient to fill the stomach but i would not term it lavish tried the seafood dinner buffet as well and spread was ok a few front desk staff were friendly and helpful during my stay always addressing and greeting me whenever i walked by;3
outside of the room the hotel was great but the sleeping conditions were terrible super hard bed broken heater and loud clanking in the walls kept me from sleeping more than 5 hours each night the room was also super tiny i barely had room for my suitcase eds chowder house had incredible food and service and the wait staff was excellent i would definitely eat there again but i wont be booking another room;3
this hotel is in a perfect spot near to time square and all the great landmarks the hotel is lovely inside and felt very safeyou have to show your room pass to get into a lift very disappointed with the size of the roomnot enough storage spaceno chest of drawers to put underweart shirts sink was tiny and useless if you use a flannel to washwe were on 7th floor and didnt hear any traffic dont think i would stay here againunless i had a bigger room with better storagetick tock dinner was nicebut expensivebreakfast for 2was nearly â£30;3
the jane is a young hotel and has some rough edges which is particularly noticeable in the services provided while some staff were very friendly and went above the call of duty jp carlos jose others were less so eg when i wanted some boiled water front desk just said sorry we dont have the equipment for it yet there is a bar and a cafe on the ground floor the room was clean and didnt smell bad or was particularly noisy though i was on the 4th floor the shared bathroom wasnt too bad though the supplied slippers were worthless and the showers have offer no facility to keep your towel or bathrobe dry take a few plastic bags with you they do however offer free shampoo conditioner and body wash the residentsvisitors were all very friendly didnt;3
spent one night in this hotel following a concert in central park location was great as the surrounding area was so quiet slept well king sized bed which was comfortable yes the rooms are small its new york my first impressions were simple lobby okay got on the elevator and thought kind of old elevator hmmmm stepped out of the elevator onto the 5th floor and thought the hall looked a bit sketchy and thought ohoh but once in the room all was fine clean very simple room bathroom fine in the morning walked a block north to park west cafe and had great coffee and an inexpensive breakfast to start the day would i stay here again yes if it was just to sleep;3
minutes from amsterdam columbus and broadway great local bars and restaurants where you can mix with the locals the deli on the corner of the block is superb he even found the world cup match whilst we ate the subway is on the corner so access is easy to the rest of manhattan try the bike rental up the road riding round manhattan was the best decision we made so funny;3
hotel was clean staff was all friendly and attentive parking extremely expensive food was above average but food drink extremely expensive convenient to lax not convenient to any other restaurants or bars;3
not really a critique of the hotel which i suppose is not fair the hotel itself was fine 99 per night on a weekend in nyc great rooms are tinyi have no idea how they made them look the size they did in the pics they are smallbut clean and the communal bathrooms are fine and contrary to other reviews the staff was ok friendly semihelpfulok however 2 points the guests are the most ridiculous people i have ever been around how did you folks manage to find each other and book the same hotel i mean geeze ive never seen so many people trying so hard to be different yet ending up looking and acting exactly the same we went into the hotel bar during the early hoursnothing special 9 canned beer and old furniture just for;3
but hardly a 4star hotel the lobby was large and spaciousand filled with tour groups the staff was lovely and very helpful but the room was tiny if you were sitting at the desk the person in the bed could not get past you to get to the bathroom the closet was tiny as welland very shallow because there was a safe in the closet it was almost impossible to hang up clothes we would stay again only because of the location but this was clearly a 3 star hotel not a 4 star;3
i stayed at days inn during the recent posthurricane power outage this is a good budget hotel in the upper west side very convenient location half a block away from subway line 24hour drugstore right underneath and several good restaurants in the area you can easily be in midtown in 10 minutes via subway the room was clean with a modern bathroom and the usual amenities i would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a great value place to stay in ny and would like to avoid the craziness of times squaremidtown downside is the super slow elevators and somewhat noisy ac unit upper west side is much more familyfriendly but i dont think theres much to see in terms of tourist attraction in this area side note for similar price you can get more upscale;3
positives were that the hotel is close to the 96th street broadway subway the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean negatives were the worn carpet in the room and a need for some sprucing up also the immediate neighbourhood is not great but there are lots of restaurants there and it is relatively close to central park i suppose one is not in the room much while visiting and its rates are generally lower and for those willing to ignore the negatives it is probably not a bad option;3
we were looking forward to the empire hotel because of the pool once we checked in we were informed that it was closed rooftop bar was open only to guests of a private party ok location ok room size;3
we stayed here for a friends special birthday and the room had a great view of the empire state building unfortunately the room was tiny for a double double room handles on all drawers were hanging off and the bathroom was very tired there were no coffee making facilities in the room or a refrigerator and when we queried this we were told we could have them for an additional charge of 50 plus tax per night this would have added over 200 to our stay the room was also that small there was nowhere to put them even though we were told this was a large room by a very rude receptionist its a good job we didnt spend much time in the room also had noisy pipe work at 4am in the morning and on the last night very rude noisy neighbours who had to have three visits;3

we got this hotel through an online offer so we paid a lot less than the advertised rate for what we paid we were happy enough pros its located right next to a subway station including an express line so its really easy to get anywhere in manhattan lots of places to eat in the local area the bed was huuuge and very comfortable cons the girl on reception was incredibly rude the gym they advertise on their website actually just consists of three machines surrounded by mirrors to make it look bigger when the lift was working rare we had to wait at least 5 minutes every time for it we once waited 10 minutes and then gave up and walked down the 8 flights of stairs when we got to the lobby there was a sign up saying the lift was out of;3
to be honest after reading all the negative reviews about this hotel i was nervous to check in but it was much better than reviews lead me to expect our room was always cleaned well toiletries were always replaced and the room was nice and warm which was great considering it was february in new york the wifi was slow at times and it would have been nice to have a fridge but we still enjoyed our stay;3
during my two night stay at this property invited by a newyork company so i will not comment prices i suffered from the noise coming from corridors room doors are very old and there is a free space between the bottom of the door and the floor making all the noise freely flow from corridor to room or the other way room doors also make a lot of noise when guests close them although checkout time is noon housekeeper knocked at my door at 8 am on departure day to see whether she could handle my room i should have placed the do not disturb sign on the door but such sign was missing in my room also a lot of noise coming from outside ac and so on to sum up i have found it difficult to rest and have privacy in my room otherwise the bathroom was rather small and;3
i was a bit nervous booking at the hollywood hotel based on some of the previous reviews however the value for the rooms for a 5 day stay got a good deal on hotelscom was great and i was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room it was a corner suite we had 2 queen beds a microwave fridge and sofa and table and chairs the room was on the 3rd floor and faced south and was very quietit wasnt sparkling clean but not dirty either unfortunately the airconditioner wasnt working during our 5 day stay and our room smelled like fresh varnish and if you need any supplies at night shampoo toilet paper there are no housekeeping staff late at night and the front desk staff state they have no access to their supplies additionally the housekeeping staff do not;3

the hotel could use a room facelift as once you leave the beautiful lobby area and walk down the corridors to your room you feel like it has not been redone in a long time i almost wish hotels would get rid of carpets all together i wish they had windows that at least opened a little bit as i like fresh air having to have recycled air all night was a problem for me they do have a good housekeeping staff that keeps it very clean the hotel employees are all super nice the pool area was disappointing as was the hot tub that looked like the water was not clean they allow smoking around the pool so i kept having to change my seat so i wasnt breathing smoke since it is near universal expect allot of kids around the pool it didt bother me as i like kids there is a;3
first time staying at this hotel location good staff good so whats the problem this hotel is very very old and no matter how much one cleans its just old rooms very tiny not functional or stay friendly bed is about the only thing thats from this decade oh and tv nothing is positioned correctly because of the size bathroom horrible cant maintain water temperature so you either burn or freeze overall its not bad because most of ny hotels are worst;3
old and getting older great location next to the met this is getting comical i have said what i wanted but it is not 200 characters so that leads me to rant about discrimination against people who have difficulties with written language;3
i got this hotel on priceline for 75 bucks which is an absolute steal for ny for a 4 star hotel however when i got there they said i had to pay a facility fee for 27 bucks or something which i thought was stupid they coldly said that priceline should have let you know which they didnt anyway the front desk man was very nice and gave me a two queen bed room which is rare for ny and the room size wasnt huge but for ny it was the room looked like it hadnt been renovated since 1975 i mean come on bathroom was gross definitely not a 4 star hotel like the travel sites claim but all in all if it werent for the good location across the street from penn station this wouldnt be an ideal choice that and the upgrade is the reason im giving this a 3 star view;3
we arrived early for our stay on a recent saturday and were able to check in right away which was a plus the floor we stayed on however was quite dated with frayed rug and in need of painting our room was bland and in need of an update with an old loud ac and no dresser the location of the hotel is fantastic near great bars restaurants a farmers market on sunday and only 2 blocks from central park the hotel staff was wonderful very helpful and friendly no matter what time of day offering discounted parking and suggestions for bars with and without entertainment and good eating spots if youre looking for luxury this is not the spot if youre looking for a basic room in a great location go for it;3
this was a very average hotel we have been travelling around the usa and this hotel was the most expensive and the worst that we have stayed in we stayed four nights i realise new york is expensive but this hotel was not value for money it is very old our room had been recently painted and the bathroom tiles resprayed but still needs work carpet was grotty room was small and although it was a queen room the bed was not comfortable and seemed like a double bed but that could be because it sank in the middle bathroom was tiny with no bench space there was no fridge or coffee maker and worst of all i found a dead roach in the room hotel is extremely busy and was always a queue at the counters it was full of airline staff and tour groups we picked the hotel;3
my boyfriend and i stayed at the hilton universal simply because we were going to universal studios and for that it was perfect it is a 5 min walk from the hotel plus you have the city walk for restaurants and shopping in the evening the hotel however is in need of a refurb the rooms are very big but not the cleanest i have ever seen at breakfast i went through 5 cups one morning until i found a reasonably clean one the breakfast was good though one thing i didnt like was the unfriendliness of the staff throughout our stay there only one member of staff was friendly and welcoming also didnt like the fact that someone left a packet of what looked like an illegal substance in the safe youd think they would have checked the safe was empty when the last lot;3
air conditioner kept breaking in room location was good restaurant was not that great pretty hotel beds suck closets suck and bath rooms are small shower was good over all just ok would not stay there again;3
old hotel and rooms reflect this it looks like bathrooms have been updated but showers only have half a screen so water goes over the floor the ac cant be controlled from your room and is on 247 carpet in front of the ac unit was wet however all staff we met were lovely and welcoming location is one block back from central park and about a 5 minute walk from columbus circle one of the main subway stations which was very convenient for us;3
the bed was comfortable the water was hot though hard to adjust sometimes there were no bugs the towels and sheets were changed when we didnt leave up the privacy sign its an old building but didnt smell musty there was peeling paint in the halls the wifi was barely adequate there was no street noise and when i called to have another room quieted down it happened quickly there should have been a towel rack for a hand towel in the bathroom we hung it on the doorknob it wasnt possible to close the blinds tight the bottom sheet was neither fitted nor sufficiently large no laundry facilities available to guests the rooms info notebook hadnt been updated recently usa today not available restaurant listings not uptodate the room was just big;3
the empire is very close to where i do business when im in nyc but it would not be my first choice in places to stay the rooms are extremely small particularly the bathrooms and poorly lit some of the amenitiesthe inroom safe the umbrellaare very useful but the hotel lacks other amenities typically found in less expensive hotels glassware a coffee maker housekeeping is generally adequate although on this most recent trip i had to call the front desk nearly every day to request that wash cloths be brought to my room since housekeeping failed to do it;3

my boyfriend and i stayed there for 12 nights only downside is the size of the room i have never seen anything so tiny however as most of the other reviewers mentioned its only somewhere to put you head after a long day out the beds were extremely comfortable the location of the hotel is wonderful its on the upper west side subway only 5 mins walk away from the hotelor you can take a bus m10 which will take you through times square and drop you off outside macys overall hotel is very good however size of rooms toooooooo small;3
this hotel is in a great location rooms are small but most are in ny lobby nice but after you get past that this hotel needs a lot of renovation going to the room the walls and carpet are drab and dimly lit not at all welcoming they did not have our room ready when we got there we were early but they said if they did we could get in for another 50 we took our bags to the bell hop and that cost 5 a bag no matter the type of bag it is a shame when you pay so much for a room that all of that cost even more pathetic staff was good tick tock diner was below average have been there before but food was below average and the staff were not friendly at all and borderline rude;3
the hilton is conveniently located within walking distance to universal studios but is a little on the pricey side for what you get i really expected the place to be perfect and the staff to be on top of their game it was just average and a little outdated;3
was really looking forward to staying here but was a little disappointed our room got no natural light as it looked out over the vents for air conditioningthe restaurant which made a lot of noise the room was tiny and we didnt touch the minibar as everything in it was a complete rip off the pool is more like a plung pool id challenge anyone over 7 to swim in it though the views from up there are amazing it was also annoying that there was no free wifi in the rooms everywhere has free wifi on the plus side the bed was comfy and the location is great and the concierge gave a great recommendation for breakfast;3
dont get me wrong3 stars doesnt mean the hotel was bad it was decidedly average for its class i save 4 and 5 stars for more outstanding experiences first and foremostthe hotel was clean and roomcleaning service was efficient with that saidhere are some issues i encountered fitness centercramped and many of the treadmills and bikes needed repairs room lightingnever could figure out how to turn on bedside lamps lack of housecleaning optionsmany hotels now ask if youd like sheets changed if you do you leave a preprinted sign on the bed same with towelsany towels you want changed you just leave on the bathroom floor i really appreciate this as it is somewhat friendlier for the environment main restaurant dinner menuthe dinner menu in the;3
overall the wyndam new yorker was ok the staff couldnt be nicer or more accommodating and the location was great for us on this particular trip our room was clean but i have to say that i travel a lot for work and family and suffice it to say that i have never ever stayed in a smaller room in any hotel the room was small but clean and the bathroom was old and small the shower on all 3 days for both of us ran in a continuous flow from scalding to comfortable to ice we had no view it was fine for a quick 2night stay;3
slow and steady normally wins the race but for me it was a small l i had flown into lga around 9am and got to the hotel around 1130 thanks to heavy traffic and side street adventures so by the time i arrived they were clearing out the rooms i stored my luggage and walked around the area to get lunch and mingle with friends shopping in the w70s is great i wouldnt recommend taking a cab since its nearly impossible to flag one down at certain times location wise its nice you can definitely walk at a slow pace here by the time i returned it was 1pm surely they had something available but they told me no and i sat in the tiny lobby for an hour even though i sat and watched her check someone in ahead of me the rooms are great kind of roomy really the one;3
reception and staff are fabulous rooms are outdated noisy small in desperate need of a decent renovation rooms are very hot march taking a shower is a challenge the room is so moist and hot after that you feel disgusted hallways are dark and make you feel like your in a horror movie pro location staff free water;3
seriously the rooms were great not sure what it is but the hallways creeped me out a bit otherwise ok no frills typical midtown hotel the room had a bit of an old style victorian almost leaning gothic feel although it was ok it was not good enough for me to stay at again just too many options for a blah place great if you need a place near penn station;3
we booked here because the reviews were great and it was rated higher than the sheraton next door on trip advisor we arrived to find half of the hotel under renovation horrible elevators and rooms that were well we have stayed in doubletree better than this the digital room key is hit and miss with your iphone only 25 of the time did it work straight away the upside was that the breakfast buffet is pretty good if you want the free shuttle to the theme park in the morning there are no staff to supervise the queue so people ended up pushing ahead of us and we nearly missed our prebooked tour which was really disappointing as the doorman the night before was amazing if we had some kind of warning for the renovation we wouldnt have minded so much but to pay full price;3
top location mid town where you want to be the rooms are clean if not a little tired if you ride the lifts you will notice a number of the floors have been turned over to some form of student hostel university accommodation which whilst nothing against students seeing pad locked room doors from the lift is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel effectively not a 4 star hotel when compared to other 4 star hotels i have stayed in in new york it is cheaper than the others i have stayed in but not by much overall good location and clean;3
great location great security procedures at the entrance and in room we must show the room key to the security personnel before getting in the elevator when we returned to the room during the room cleaning was in service the cleaning personnel asked us to put the key card to open the door in order to proof that we stay in that room bed and restroom cleaning are good the hotel should improve the cleanliness in the hallway corridor entrance and the far to reach areas in the room such as lightninglamps bathroomvent on the ceiling etc it was very dusty and dull the the hotel very greatly the deadbolt at the door was out of order the room smelled a bit and we sensed overpower use of the air refreshing spray to override the odour in the room we were so far;3
my biggest but is the fact that internet access shouldnt be charged additionally and the room could also have a minifridge and microwave really good location room double clean and small yet not too crowded so you can easily move around stuff nice but not too eager to attend you overall ok for the price;3
such a shame with this one the lobby is nice location is great 10 mins from griffith park and universal but the bedrooms let it down we had room with 2 queen beds and the bedroom had dated decor and the bathroom had peeling wallpaper and cracked tiles not the photos you get when you book and doesnt work out so cheap after they add on parking and quite a few different taxes wouldnt rule it out but just be prepared;3
reasonable value for money in ny however room 310 is horrible make sure you dont get this room the bed is over a foot short of a normal single bed im 167cm tall and had to sleep scrunched up the other foot or so where some of the bed length should be is taken up with water pipesthat while surrounded by rope are warm to the touch in this room you have the added bonus of hearing the water running when people use the bathroom i asked to be moved due to the size of the bed which they did without question on the 2nd night apparently full on the first night quite clearly being fully aware of the issue whatever you do make sure you request not to be put in room 310 also be careful of the slippery marble in the bathroom;3
smells of smoke on some floors and rooms very outdated needs an uplift but clean and great location was there for my 50th birthday and didnât get off to a good start due to having to change rooms due to smoke smell;3
this place is really close to universal we booked it so we could just walk over each day we had a rental car too and the self parking was super easy to use the rooms are dated but still pretty clean and nice the pool is big but there are not enough chairs the pool service was quick though the breakfast and dinner restaurants on site were nice too;3
i booked this hotel as an overnight stop prior to an early internal flight however my husband and i were both arriving on international flights at different times of the day on the day of checkin my husband arrived at 6am from sydney so i contacted the hotel to enquire about any early checkin options this was hard work email options nonexistent and phoning needed to allow for 19 hours time difference when i eventually spoke to reception they told me they couldnt help because id booked through an online agent bookingcomlastminutecom back to the online agent and i eventually received email confirmation that although it was unlikely my husband could checkin much earlier than the nominated time he was at least recognised as being a partner on the;3
my wife and i have stayed at least six times strictly because of location nearly every time itâs been on a prebooked deal so perhaps weâre getting the worst rooms by design but after a half dozen stays iâm ready to conclude that every room is mediocre the temperature is never right often too hot the inwall heatingcooling units are loud the carpeting has a slightly tacky feel the bathrooms are cramped the decor is dated on the upside the front desk and bellmen are pleasant the rooms are always made up the beds are crisp and comfortable enough and we clearly appreciate the prices we use the empire strictly for sleeping and thatâs enough;3
my room is a good size for new york hotels bed nice and comfy air conditioning very good great view of the empire state from my room lots of banging of doors bathroom very poor definitely needs updating not a pleasant experience having to use it not many sockets to use good wifi mine was free but not sure if you have to pay for it great location very busy lobby busy hotel;3
its my second time here we came to spend christmas time here in nyc it is basic but good clean and hospital one if you want just a room hot water and basic utilities it has a good service with a good price best choice if you have limited budget and you want to spend time in nycâ¥;3
the hotel has good location the stuff are very helpful room service is good they clean it every day however they provide coffee machine only after a few requests the room is very small old fashioned bath they donât serve breakfast you have to add extra money for the continental breakfast at the attached diner and to add extra money for every item;3
we had 4 nights 4 people 2 rooms i paid for both rooms one receipt had a 25 per day fee the other did not i left a voice mail to have someone return my call and no return call this was not explained to me upon arrival;3
i work in new york do a lot of travel in and out and usually stay at the four seasons checking my calendar i saw that id forgotten to book a hotel for a month long stay and my hotel of choice was booked up for the first two nights happily i found that the empire had an amazing deal on a suite from expedia for the two nights in question and i booked about three days ahead the location is greatright next to lincoln center close to the park etc the hotel is beautiful my room was enormous and since i had a corner suite i had amazing views of columbus circle the lobby is chic and stylish and inviting the facility itself is great my issue was with the staff of the hotel granted it was the middle of fashion week granted im just a lowly guest who paid for a room;3
the lack of hot water for my morning showers ruined what was otherwise a great experience low water pressure i understand for this is california however tepid water is inexcusable please fix this for me to stay again;3
i stayed for 2 days herewhen we arrived at la union station by train from san diego we called the concierge to send us a taxi to our location but instead he advised us to take the metro to the hotel and then walk to the hotelso we dragged our luggage to the metro station purchased the ticket and went inside one of the worst places on earth the metro as you will have beggers asking you for money or strangers staring at us as foreigners bad smell everywhere zero security or police around although the place needs 247 security due to the number of beggers and drunks there also we booked for a room with a breakfast but suprise suprise when you go to the breakfast serving resturant you find that what you booked is continental breakfast not the buffet and the;3
first off this really is a historic hotel with an incredible story to tell unique architecture and style that somehow feels new york even on the first visit to the city the location is incredible walking distance to empire state building times square and broadway by european standards walking distance at least if thats not your thing penn station is literally across the street with all sorts of local longdistance and subway trains available as well as cabs ubers and whatnot in abundance the hotel itself is clean the staff helpful and polite now the first time i checked in i got one of their new corporate suites up to date nice and exactly what this sort of hotel should look like in my opinion unfortunately due to some plumbing issue leaky shower i was;3
despite some of the negative reviews on here we decided to stay at the ramada hollywooduniversal we arrived before check in time and the very efficient desk clerk had someone check to see if our room was ready and it was the room was what we expected nothing special but it was clean serviceable and perfect for our needs as we only intended to sleep and shower there it would be nice if guests could better regulate the hvac system but it wasnt a huge inconvenience the room showed signs of having been recently paintedwallpapered and the bathroom was clean and there were always extra towels our second day we arrived back to find a new microwave and refrigerator in our room the desk clerk informed us they were putting them in every room we had a nice view;3
the hotel location is great the food was nice the rooms need an update as they felt very old i felt like they needed a good clean i have stayed in lots of premier inn hotels and this is probably one of the lowest standard ones i have seen;3
abercorn house is not a luxurous place but it isnt expensive either for london standard its cheap rooms are clean bed was good for the money you pay is a very good place to stay its great value for your money location is fine with the tube you are in central london within 15 minutes;3
in room there are snacks and beverages are expensive no need leave there in rooms should be in gift shop rather than room outside mm candy cost 99 cents compare your hotel 600 12 oz water cost 500 compare 12 bottles cost 399;3
lets start with basics yes rooms are very small ie 50sqft or 5m2 and if you are staying in standard room bathroomtoilet is shared good news is that it works some have said that beds are rock hard but i dont agree firm maybe not hard the premises appear clean and comfy as so many before ill also tell you that the place is quaint picturesque etc main concern is noise pick your favorite westside hwy the ballroom club and your ac they are all there rumbling thumping and humming when you are trying to sleep and i was at 4th floor not directly above the club or facing hudson pros on the other hand location is very good it is still a bang for your buck in this price category it is safe and it is clean additionally thereâ´s a nice sense of community;3
i stayed here with 4 of my friends basically you get what you pay for very basic but friendly staff willing to help it was nice to stay more in the real life part of new york lovely friendly deli at the bottom of the road which was great for cups of tea and breakfast;3
this hotel is close to many top attractions empire state building times square madison sq gdns a lively neighbourhood of bars and restaurants the hotel staff are very efficient and friendly especially mohammad at the front desk this is my 2nd time staying at the new yorker this time we traveled with our 2 grandkids for a special trip we booked a double suite which was expensive we were disappointed the furniture is worn and âtiredâ carpet is all browns and beige drab and overall in need of renovation the sofa bed in living room area is uncomfortable no lamps in the living area just a yellow overhead light the lobby looks much more attractive than the rooms security is good room key must be shown to enter the elevator we enjoyed our time in new york;3
hotel is in a good location but noisy if you like your window open at night small bathroom cruise ship style walk across the street to lincoln center and starbucks on the corner the staff was pleasant and the availability to ny ambience was surrounding not sure if there are larger rooms but i would definitely ask next time around;3
the room was small and didnt offer many amenities the shared bathroom was a challenge to use at timesthe room was clean and well stocked with towels and what not the staff was reasoably friendly but i was grossly over charged for my room my online reservation rate was 7500 a night i was charged 10600 a night tried to reach the manager multiple times to no avail im still attempting to have the difference refunded back to me;3
i was in new york for a business trip from sweden i stayed at the empire hotel many times before but this time i was more than a little angry that there was no dining establishment to eat ati was early for check in and fortunately there was a lovely bar in the hotel lobby it was about 1245 and the roof deck bar wasnt even open the lobby bar was delightful with a splendid drink menu it got very busy at check in so other patrons were pleased that this bar was open too comfortable and friendly bar staff;3
accommodations were average bathroom dirty staff was very friendly and accommodating that was the best part the wall unit ac was quite noisy as well the free wifi was very slow frustrating to use;3
my family and i stayed here on a weekend visit to universal studios the hotel staff was very nice the location was convenient the room was okay nothing fancy very basic and clean i dont recommend eating there for breakfast or getting room service both are over priced and there werent very many options especially in the full breakfast buffet i recommend eating at city walk there are tons of different types restaurants bubba gumps rainforest cafe tony roma and more overall it was a nice stay and we liked the location;3
upon checking at midnight having just got off a delayed internal from san francisco i was glad to see that there was no queue at reception however i was ignored by the reception staff and made to wait for a nonvital radio check to be completed once i had been shown my room i was very disappoonted to find that a bottle of evian cost 8 and that the in room coffee machine cost 3 a cup they also charge for the wifi the bathroom had loose plug points and loose fittings to top this off the bath and shower screen were filthy i would not mind if this were a budget hotel but it is not although ive stayed in budget hotels that are better value i will not recommend this hotel to anyone stay away;3
stayed at the new yorker for 4 nights location was the key to this hotel we were able to connect with the hop on hop off bus and walk to many of the main attractions the new yorker was a hotel to lay your head the room was very small and the bathroom was dated with very little moving room if it is a little bit of luxury you want you wont find it at the new yorker but if you want s basic hotel in a central location the new yorker is for you;3
expensive hotel but great location right in the middle of everything and easy to find and get to the rooms are small and basic however we had a great view of the empire state building nice and clean interior of the hotel with a handy shop in the hotel friendly and helpful staff;3
the morningside inn is a very good hotel the rooms are clean the hotel is really close to a subway food outlets and is right next door to a church we all enjoyed our stay;3
i stayed here in october when on holiday with family hotel was very expensive so was expecting a lot more from it had to go to lobby for wifi which was annoying rooms are very small also there isnt much room when you have your suitcases staff were quite friendly although when we asked one of them could they book us a taxi they said that they couldnt hotel very close to times square which was very convenient;3
the rooms were a decent size for nyc elevators are extremely slow beds on the firmer side employees are very friendly great location for metro station you also get a discount at a nice restaurant attached to the hotel;3
to be completely honest i was told the size of the room but was not told there were no shelves or places to organize my personal items had to use the window sill to put my make up the shower was difficult to use and only has one half door which meant that the 2 x 3 bathroom was fully wet when i finished showering i suggested to the hotel that they remove their sell items and place some type of shelves to put your personal items we had fun on our trip in spite of the barely sufficient hotel;3
i like this hotel its old and wellworn but clean and everything seems to be working good old american style the windows are far from soundproof though and some constructionwork on the street kept me awake the whole night but i like the style of the hotel and hope they will keep it that way;3
hollywood hotel is ok staff are very friendly and helpful in particular reception the rooms are a good size with comfortable bedding and daily top ups of amenities like shampoo the water pressure in the showers is no doubt among the best ive experienced from all the hotels ive stayed at a small thing but an important thing but the location is terrible yes its in an excellent spot if you want to be near attractions like universal studios and the hollywood boulevard the former being absolutely amazing the latter being a complete waste of time ive written quite a scathing review on the location if interested but its a dodgy spot being woken several times each night by the loud blaring of a police car siren racing by seems to be common practice whilst we;3
the rooms and bathrooms in this botique hotel are tiny first off the good stuff the ac worked great although we did not take advantage of the honor bar it had a number of nonfood items that were interesting the linens and towels were clean and the lobby was pretty the location is ideal and is right outside the lincoln center and about two blocks from central park the only parking at the hotel is a 60 per day valet eek there a numerous parking garages nearby but they run about 40 a night plus tips if you are patient and start well before the lincoln center crowd starts parking around 630 you can find an onstreet spot if you are willing to walk quite a few blocks be careful though make sure that the street sweeper will not be cleaning in the morning;3
my husband and i recently stayed here ending our epic honeymoon with 4 nights in new york being a special occasion we also celebrated our 10 year anniversary at the jane we splashed out for a captains room overall the decor and general feel of the place was interesting and fun there were aspects to our stay that we were pleased with however there are a few areas that disappointed us the main issue we had was that we had no idea that the hotel bar was actually a hot night spot on the weekend this bar was listed as a hotel amenity therefore i would have expected to be able to use and enjoy this during our stay we had hoped to enjoy a drink at the bar on the friday when we returned to the hotel however once we saw the queue outside and the many security guards it;3
we had tickets to see billy joel at madison square garden and wwere taking the train into penn station since i was just recovering from a back injury we wanted something close and this hotel was less than a block away we loved the old new york feeling in the lobby but the long walk to our room and the size of room reminded us of what we didnt like about that old new york feeling the room was clean but worn finding a place to plug in our phones was interesting when after crawling around my daughter realized an extension cord was being used for lamps and house phone the room served its purpose and i would stay there again if the price was right there was a 25 room fee that i have no idea what was included if it was the internet it was a waste since we couldnt access it;3
about us my gf and me both of us are from singapore im 35 shes 29 we are budgeted travellers who just need a clean and quiet place to sleep after the mixed reviews we decided to go with the inn based on the budget and location to the subway we stayed in morningside inn on oct 9th to the 12th arrving with an open mind and preparing for the worse the notorious front office was noticibly plain but clean the young girl working there was nonchalant but quick to check me in i paid cash to prevent any future discrepancies although be mindful that the young girl do not have access to the cashier after office hours so pls bring exact change so far so good now the room i booked a double room with shared showers the room is really plain but clean a bed;3
i have not checked into this hotel and i am already very dissatisfied before you book this hotel i strongly recommend visiting the universal sudios website for special package deals i just went on to purchase my park passes for 1 day and noticed a special deal with the hilton universal city i could have gotten two 7day passes 67 per personper day free hotel parking 17 per night free hotel breakfast free transportation to and from the park and of course hotel at discounted rate this would have been over a 300 savings for us you think there would have been some advertisement on the hilton website when booking;3
great location wonderful staff fabulous lobby time for rooms to get a facelift they need fresh wallpaper and paint needed beds were very comfortable for new york the room size was expected was on the small side but adequate;3
first impressions we could barely fit our 3 cases in our first room and open the door the room is tiny can almost touch the window bathroom door and main door from the bed a view of another building through the window and beware if booking online as you may not be aware they add on 29tax a day resort charge for no real reason the bed creaked badly the pillows were not comfortable there is no water or teacoffee making facilities in the room this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel its art deco so old fashioned and original if art deco is your thing as the lobby is a nice example as are the fixtures and fittings otherwise find somewhere further out and save your money the previous night was spent at a hotel overlooking the central park and this cost half the;3
i spent three nights for both business and leisure during one of the most brutally hot stretch of days in all my many trips into new york city i only state this because the ac unit in my room was fantastic and kept the room very cool the hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and the hotel is just around the corner from the 96th street subway station which services the 1 2 and 3 lines giving you easy access to the entire city i was everywhere from down in brooklyn to up in the bronx and the location of the hotel and proximity to the subway station served me quite well also as the hotel is set in the upper west side there is far less noise and such that one will find around times square however as has been stated in other reviews there are many drawbacks to;3
i was disappointed in our 2 night stay at the hilton in universal city upon arrival in our rental car we were offered the choice of valet parking tip remember at 25 or self park at 20 for 24 hours welcome to the hilton can we say gouging as a paid guest one certainly would have thought parking would be included not so neither is wifi which charged 750 per device for 24 hours yes we had a laptop ipad and iphone with us that adds up quickly when trying to access wifi gouging again upon arrival to our room which looked fine i noticed that the previous guests dirty towel was hanging on the back of the bathroom door and a dead bug was on the side of the tub obviously the room checker did not do their job i called housekeeping and;3
we arrived at the hotel to again have to pay extra for parking when we got to reception the staff seemed disinterested and even though there were 4 or more on reception none of them asked us to come to the desk some even went into the office we were then called over and our room was ready but again the receptionist seemed totally disinterested in us she kept looking around at her colleagues whilst giving us our keys and we had to ask a lot of questions as she was not very forthcoming with any information wifi was not free either when we got to our room it was very spacious and clean the lifts were not working properly on our floor so we had to call down to get a lift sent up we decided we would go out and about as we had a few hours to kill so we went over to the;3
when we got to the hotel check in was quick the elevators are small but there are 4 so we never had to wait long walking down the hall to our room we worried the walls have different colored patches of paint and the carpet is old stained and coming up in some places when we opened the door however we were surprised to see a clean albeit small room there was a king size bed with several fluffy white pillows and a clean bedsheets the bathroom appeared to have been recently renovated the toilet sink and tub all looked new and were very clean even the shower curtain appeared to be new there was a window in the bathroom a plus for women to put their makeup on in natural lighting there was a closet with lots of wooden hangers and the tv was old but;3
we spent a week at woogo when we arrived late at night we had to wait at the reception for about 30 minutes just to get our key we were up on the 16th floor we had a fully equipped kitchen two chairs but no table how were we expected to eat our breakfast i do not know are tables so expensive in america otherwise they were quite helpful and nice except for our prebooked taxi by them to jfk which cost us much more than we thought i would not go there again;3
we were looking for an affordable place to stay in ny for a week over christmas the price was under 100 a night and we couldnt find anything comparable with a private bathroom so we booked it i was nervous about staying here after the of negative reviews but we decided to take our chances the guys at the front desk were very friendly but we were not rude to them about any of our problemsquestions ex the pipes rattle at night they explained that its an old hotel and thats just how the pipes were built but have plans to update these things the carpets need to be replaced but i brought house shoes so it wasnt a problem we thought this was a great location for never experiencing the subway before easily take the red line down to times square and change over to any;3
the location of this hotel makes up for what was an ok stay i stayed at empire about five years ago wonderful experience this trip the room was small but clean and comfy the roof top pool deck was great for a sunset view we came to this hotel for a two day work trip we needed to use the wifi provided by the hotel work from the hotel which was not working at first the issue was not handled well then when management took over it was handled appropriately overall an ok stay with the help of starbucks wifi id recommend this hotel for a weekend nyc holiday because the hotel location is great;3
my family and i stayed here for 3 nights and it was an okay stay we checked in and only one of our rooms were ready which was fine since it was an hour or so before checkin time we were fine with going to the room that was ready and leaving all our bags there until we received the other room we were able to get rooms right next to each other and they were connecting rooms which was a plus for us when we checked into our rooms i can honestly say i was not impressed the rooms were very outdated and the furniture as well the view of the mountains was great my mother aunt and kids did enjoy the outdoor pool a lot the best part of the hotel is that they have a complimentary shuttle that goes to universal studios hollywood we took this shuttle which was a 5 mins;3
i stayed in this hotel which is in north hollywood in the month of january the hotel was clean and quietthe neighborhood is a little edgy but not undesirable for a stay at least in my opinion the hotel room was large with basic furniture and the food was good the carpet should be changed but overall i enjoyed my stay and you are close to places of interest;3
the empire hotel has several good points but the standard of service lets it down its location is a great one just across the road from the lincoln centre and a short walk to columbus circle check in was ok if a bit slow considering there were four staff on reception the hotel is atmospheric due to the style of its decor and dim lighting but i found my room unsatisfactory in several respects if noise can prevent you from sleeping id advise you to ask for a room facing out front my room looked out on the inner hotel walls and was very noisy due to loud air conditioning equipment were it not for the trusty ear plugs i always bring on holidays i wouldnt have slept a wink the bathroom was small and pokey with no bin and a box of tissues that was almost empty i had;3
was pleasantly surprised at the renovated digs of the empire hotel the only reason i didnt rate it as very good was because of the bathroom when we took showers alot of water ended up on the floor so we had to mop it up with towels clearly an unanticipated error in the design the bed pillows and duvet were a great upgrade we stayed on the first floor which was suprisingly not horribly noisy and we were only steps away from the workout center which besides great equipment always had good water we kept being surprised at how close it was to everything sure the room was close but it wasnt claustrophobic;3
the location is very central which is the best part of this hotel we did luck out when we booked two doubles the room came with two bathrooms and two closets which is perfect for a girlfriend get away the downsides were the dimly lit room which looks old and tired despite some attempts to update the front desk and baggage checkin clerks have attitude but i think thats the ny customer service the worst part was when it came to pay there were so many additional fees on top of tax at 1475 there was a resort fee city tax etc be prepared for a shock when you get your final bill;3
we had received a free two night stay after sitting through a 3 hour time share presentation on a previous stay we had to pay 60 a day for valet parking and taxes and fees for the two nights we had to use valet as my son was staying there as a ny arts study program student and we had to take a full car load back home they gave us a better room with a view of the empire state building and of madison square garden this hotel is old and still had a lot of its old style attributes its rooms are small the paint in the bath tub was peeling the windows were dirty and obstructed the views everything was small and tight but it was clean and the bed was comfortable for sleeping the tv had a bad connection i wish they offered a free breakfast i guess this is good;3
we visited usa in july 2015 and booked 6 nights at morningside inn hotel it is bed only it is clean and ok for travelers who wish to explore ny hot showers and clean rooms most of the bathrooms are for share if you wish to cook for your self the kitchen is there for you restaurants are near by for breakfast ect i like it and will stay there again;3
nice retro hotel however i seriously have issues being lied to about the beds they state itâs a queen itâs somewhere around 55x74 because we measured it and that is the size of a doublefull so if you want great reviews wyndham donât lie to people our backs were killing us the entire stay and in the 3 nights iâm sure i slept less then 5 hours each night now letâs talk bathrooms take note if you plan a bathroom the size of one on a cruise ship at least be smart and turn the faucet to the side so you can wash your face wifhoyt hitting your hands on the middle i stalled faucet as for the sink itself itâs less then 2 inches deep so the water absolutely flows over the sides no matter how low the flow showers the showers are built with a step in recessed base of;3
the room was clean though small the hotel was fairly busy and this made it quite noisy at night although the hotel has obviously been renovated and updated it feels basic rather than anything special which is a real shame since it obviously has potential as a glimpse into a bygone age the lobby is probably the most impressive feature we did object strongly to the additional tax we were expected to pay especially since our travel agent had assured us that there would be no extra payment at checkout we made such a fuss that they actually waived the payment so perhaps if all travellers made the same objection this pernicious practice would end overall our experience was satisfactory but nothing we could wax lyrical about the hotel was rather impersonal and;3
we stopped in nyc to visit our daughter on the way home from europe the empire has been nicely remodeled since my last visit however i found the service and staff to be less than efficient the price was good and the location was excellent rooms were tiny in spite of all i would stay there again;3
i got the trip to ny in a promotion and i only had 24 hours to confirm it at first i didnt even look for the hotel i only saw his location and it was great as long is in manhattan then when i started to prepare the trip i look t the reviews of trip advisor an admit i was a little bit scared and afraid of the hotel but i can ensure that it was just fine the beds was really confortable and clean we got so tired after a long day exploring ny that we didnt even listen the sound of the streets and lets be honest who goes to ny to stay in the hotel in the end of the day i just wanted a confortable bed and a hot shower and thats what i got by the price you pay is really greatis a 2 star hotel so dont think your getting a hilton hotel treat so if;3
sad to see this west side gem decline so rapidly we have been coming for over 10 years and over the past few months have noticed a marked deterioration in service on our last visit in early november one elevator stopped at every floor on the way down the bathroom had a tiny two inch square of soap coffee in the room carries a ridiculous 3 price tag not to mention 750 for a half pint of water the hotel charges for wifi at some ridiculous daily amount the desk now adds 200 to your bill for incidentals and promises to refund the amount if nothing is taken from the service bar as if this doesnt invite a frustrating dispute down the road 200 we looked at the few goodies in the room and they hardly added up to 50 the rooms are clean but the carpets are;3
i stayed at the new yorker for 2 nights the location cant be beaten it is located on w 34th st and 8 ave across the street from madison square garden time square lies on walking distance 1015 minutes although the rooms are very small its in consensus with the average ny hotel good pricequality relationship with clean rooms but mediocre bathroom;3
my roomies small but comfortablethe ironing board is like the ezbake oven of boards it is meant to sit on the bed on little feet very tough to use and actually press a blouse there has to be a better solution but my staff angel today was pasquale who printed out documents i needed for a meeting in the morning just an immediate yes to my asking himprovided an email for me to send the documents to and voila my problem was solved not every place helps like this not every staff smiles like pasquale who got me out of a real jam thanks for being gracious and helpful;3
first the good bits staff were friendly and helpful room was clean great location and reasonable value not so good bits room was small and had poor lighting decor dated noise of building air conditioning going all night was annoying worst of all for us was the cost of w ifi in the room was far too much in a city where free wifi is available everywhere we found this unacceptable please make it free;3
im not one to write reviews i simply never go back to a place when im not happy but this needs to be said we arrived to the hotel late afternoon to a indifferent and cool reception from hotel staff no details of the servicesfacilities offered and no luggage help or direction to our room was provided our nonsmoking room smelled completely like smoke had been embedded into the upholstery for years a generous size room by nyc standard but very poor lighting installed and with no natural light at all the shower screen was missing making having a shower impossible to do without water completely flooding the bathroom every time be careful the cleaners steam clean the bed sheets with bleach we found this out not long after our room was cleaned as we happen to;3
check in problems with no fee card had to use mastercard incurring conversion fee charges were confusing as they were charged refunded and charged again hotel and service was fine but a little noisy even from floor 24 overall ok;3
pleasant enough hotel toilet blocked on our first day but a plumber was sent fairly quickly plenty of clean fresh towelsrooms were clean but badly in need of updating every time we opened the wardrobe the door threatened to attack us didnt have much interaction with the staff but the doormen were very pleasant and helpful particularly dennis and tommy terrific guys friendly helpful cheery and tommy was a godsend in making sure we got to the airport in time thanks tommy make sure you have a credit card as the hotel want it to charge you 150 holding fee never heard of this in any other country ive visited all in all a nice experience;3
this hotel has a fabulous location for universal studios and the rooms are fairly spacious however the dining experience for us at breakfast left alot to be desired we were left waiting for a ridiculously long time for a simple and uncomplicated breakfast order even customers who arrived at the restaurant after us were served first when the order eventually came half of it was missing or wrong what was more disappointing was the fact that having complained about the poor service and being assured that a manager would contact us noone bothered the other slightly disappointing aspect of this hotel is its small pool area although we eventually got a bed today we spent sometime lying on the grass the best thing about this hotel is its location;3
hotel is very well located but apart from that not much is going for it the rooms were very small as were the bathrooms had to move right into the bathroom to be able to close the bathroom door and the shower didnt work properly the beds were big and comfortable but couldnt get much else in the room the corridors were very noisy which suggests poor sound proofing in the rooms and very disappointing there was no internet in the rooms had to constantly go into the lobby or to the mezannine;3
busy hotel in midtown small room typical nyc really basic amenities byo toiletries and forgetful housekeeping room was tiny we couldnât unpack strong showers pressure was nice at the end of long day exploring ny check inout was smooth though and location was great with many food options i would stay somewhere else with bigger room next time a little farther away from the hustle and bustle;3
i have a hard time picking my overall rating for this hotel i dally between average and very good i think good might be right if good happened to be in the rating scale but its not so i have to settle for average first off the location is ideal situated near drug stores shopping malls coffee shops subway it is hard to beat the hotel is nice doormen polite as well as reception staff the bar down in the lobby looks nice if a bit dark the room was small and basic but very clean the big problem was the noise from the airheating vent outside it was so loud that we asked to be moved which we were without any effort to a room on a lower floor but the noise was still an issue and it meant i had to wear ear plugs at night hardly appropriate for a romantic getaway the;3
if you are looking for just a room in nyc without spending then go to the jane it is a little off the beaten path in regards to the subway which is good for some but it serves a purposesmall rooms that dont cost a fortune if you get a room with the bunkbeds it is very small the shared bathrooms were spotless and the bar and lounge were very cozy in addition the frenchstyled cafe was light and airy i would go back but make sure you get the bottom bunk;3
hotel has good manhatten upper west side location just next to central park nearest subway station is only 34 blocks away rooms look not big and old but acceptable for this price staff is friendly no breakfast option in hotel wifi is not free;3
ok well if you have read any of my reviews you will know that they are spot on so lets take a quick look at the wyndham new yorker hotel this current hotel was built in 1930 and basically refurbed a bit in 1994 the wyndham chained has owned since about 2014 with that said keep in mind the building is 85 years old this hotel is a mid price range hotel on the backside of msg the garden i stayed in room which has a great city view and basically a straight shot of the empire state bldg the bathrooms are niceish for a 85 yr old building that only charges peoplepatrons a price point of mid range it is what you pay for water pressure is good in shower and occassionally you will get hit with ice cold water and then it will go back to hot so piece of advice is dont;3
considering we did not use any amenities and used the room to sleep in this review will be based on cleanliness location and breakfast great price to stay near highways sunset strip and hollywood very close to griffiths park and observatory hotel also included a hot made to oder daily breakfast the room was clean spacious and bed was comfortable the actual location of the hotel seemed a bit questionable but we were able to park our car in a gated area inside hotel lot for 2200 per day all in all if all your looking for is a decent clean and affordable place to sleep while sight seeing this is the place for you;3
as a first holiday together as a couple we thought why not new york in the summer hotel itself was booked through a ba package so got a reasonable deal we found hotel room to be small but to honest we were only sleeping there so not too worried housekeeping kept our room very clean but like other reviews could do with some up dating concierge was helpful and had maps etc however needed to print baseball tickets which cost 5 pool was not really a pool so be warned photos on websites are deceptive didnt spend anytime up on roof terrace entrance always seemed to be busy with people going up to private functions stayed in a few hotels in new york and the empire served its purpose for a bed to sleep in but we didnt spend any extra money in hotel itself apart from using;3
after ordering some ice for a cocktail and wait for over a half hour ant then doing a reorder it a good 45min from the first callsecond night same results and at the time of ordering they said it would be up shortly;3
the hotel was very clean tidy staff very helpful very busy yet got sorted with our room quickly staff near the lifts asking what room and looking at our room cards was very good as anyone can just walk into a hotel these days our room was very small but clean and tidy was very dark only had a small window without any view only the other side of the hotel all windows bathroom clean tidy again very small and old fashioned slept well and it was very quiet from all the traffic from the city i would have liked a room with a view but if we did we would have to wait a few hours after a long flight from the uk just wanted to have a shower and a rest before evening meal yet a room was booked i do think they should have had a good room and we did pay a lot of money for just;3
room was extremely small shower was not updated beds were way to small i hung off the mattress top 12 of the room was 72 degrees while bottom half of the room was freezing just wasnt comfortable for the price felt more like a cardboard box then a room;3
overall this hotel is a tad dated by modern standards and the bathroom size is pathetically minute so there is no chance whatsoever of me giving more than a three star average rating and that in some ways seems generous that said there are upsides location is 300 metres from the corner of central park the hotel has eds chowder place downstairs the bar area is surprisingly good and dennis on the door is great oh and for those with more get up go than me then theres a nightclub upstairs as well downsides well horrendously small bathroom and the rest of the very small kingsize room was only just acceptable despite there being virtually no wardrobe space also theres no room for your luggage and they charge 3 for the coffee in your room if you drink a;3
disappointed as it was the first time in a long time i have done premier inn it was not the standard i have come to expect from them check in poor room poor yes location location but thatâs it everything else is low quality better hotels around for similar price;3
we arrived after a long road trip from las vegas to be told only one of our three room bookings had been paid for this was incorrect and despite showing the credit card statement the male receptionist would not accept the rooms had been paid for this resulted in a long call to the booking office who confirmed the rooms were paid for and eventually after speaking to accounts the check in clerk accepted all rooms were paid for and we booked in no apology the beautiful picture of the hollywood hotel is in fact in the car park at the rear of the hotel the hotel is in a very seedy area which is surrounded by a large group of tented homeless people although they did not bother us just be careful we didnt walk anywhere in the area but it was a good base for hollywood;3
you cant beat the location here you are one street away from penn station times square is a ten minute walk away unfortunately the hotel seems rundown and in need of a major renovation it just looks worn out worn carpets cracked tiling creaky elevators speaking of the elevators even though there were supposed to be six of them it only seemed like a few were working be prepared for long waits and once you do get one it will be packed with people stopping at every floor the room itself was incredibly tiny if you are with someone i hope you are very close the bathroom is tiny as well the sink has no vanity and really no space to put your toiletries out they also nickle and dime you for stuff here to check your bag at the bell desk is 5 per bagi gave it three;3
i stayed here free on my hilton club points for just the one night in january when visiting la we were upgraded into the executive suite on the top floor and the room was dull and shabby the room was of an average size with a poor view the bed was hard and the bathroom was small with dated decor and fittings and this was meant to be better than their normal rooms the service was very good and the staff were helpful and friendly the breakfast was appalling and would certainly never pay the money for it i am not a fussy person and for a free night it really was fine and probably would return if it was another free night but i would not pay the prices they charge for a room i understand the location pushes up the room prices but i am sure you can find cleaner and more;3
stayed in this hotel for 5 nights not the best quality hilton i have been in but in a good location to hollywood and la had problems with the tv in the room called a technician twice and was told to pull out the cord and plug it back in every time we wanted to watch tv no mean feat when the plug was located behind a large cabinet plus quite annoying for a 6 night stay hotel is located midway up a large hill the metro station is at the bottom of the hill and universal studios at the top it is possible to walk down to the metro but i wouldnt recommend walking up to anyone who isnt seriously fit there are two shuttles that can be taken one to universal from hotel the other to the station from universal which is a bit time consuming if you are in a hurry staff;3
we stayed for 7 nights and our room was just big enough for two which i believe is normal for nyc you have to ask for a coffee maker as there are no kettles but be persistent as itâs our experience that it will not arrive after the first time of asking the room was cleaned promptly every day and being on the 19th floor did not preclude the street noise from keeping you awake at all hours also fellow guest were always talking loudly as they passed your room so sleep was often interrupted but that is probably part of the new york experience we had the feeling that as we booked via a uk travel agent and paid in advance to get the best price we were given the âless good roomâ didnât want to say the worst room as it was adequate and we only slept there or tried to the;3
nice hotel and friendly staff but beware of all the hidden extras in your room 8 for water 3 for coffee in the room avoid these charges i did spoils what could be a 5 out of 5 apart from that excellent location for the park and near the subway;3
we chose this hilton so that we could walk to universal studios which we did we upgraded to an alcove executive room which was spacious we did have to call twice to get robes which should have been in the room and they did not replenish the amenities we used the first night one of the window seals was gone so we had wind noise for about 12 hours during our stay they did have duct tape but it was coming off it also took about 10 minutes to get hot water in the shower there is no executive lounge which surprised us since we thought that was what booking an executive room is all about the elevators were not all working which caused many delays going up and down to the top floors we did get coupons for continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant we tried to let;3
need a place to stay while visiting someone with an apartment to small for guests this might fit the bill on manhattans upper west side with an easy access to the subway it is located in safe neighborhood in the city that never sleeps we did not appreciate the blue lights that were always on as a night light on the underside of the beds head board use your room key to get 15 off for breakfast at the upper west side cafe 2528 broadway 95th at that cafe be careful not to add your tip to the bottom of your bills total our tip was included within the bill;3
what we liked clean rooms no bed bugs comfortable temperature it was winter good bed fair size good location good service and very good price less than 60night what we didnt liked the noise and the slow and undersized elevator youll probably have to wait several minutes to use it during the rush time there is a subway entrance 2 12 blocks 3 min uptown and another one 3 blocks downtown 4 min you can find a deli to have breakfast 2 blocks uptown and a subway restaurant plus some markets in the corner of the central park we could also find a good skating rink at the central park very close to the hotel for less then 12 entrance equipment less than half the price of the other rinks we visited in ny;3
the hotel is in a very good location close to the subway red line 123 and to central park nearby there are many restaurants and a starbucks for your frappuccino our room was really silent but the view was terrible we saw only other courtyards it was big and comfortable but in our opinion not so clean fitted carpet on the floor the staff is really kind and there is a person dedicated to organizing trips for tourists and answering questions really useful maybe too much expensive we paid almost 100 per person per night but is upper west side in manhattan;3
amazing location off the hudson and high line walking distance to chelsea and the village cordial staff tiny room for one person it was comfortable with everything i needed dont do the shared bathroom unless you want to relive your college dorm days interesting smells bikes are a nice bonus;3
stayed here recently for a couple of nights the first night thursday was great but on friday night the roof loungebar is a very popular nightspot the crowds that it draws makes the hotel very noisy and the staff seems more preoccupied with dealing with the nightclub than with being a nice hotel;3
a great location and it looked promising but the service falls far short for a hotel in this price class arrived at 3 pm but my room wasnt ready it wasnt ready when they projected either so they took my phone number and never called to tell me it was ready basically i had to keep checking my cell phone would not work in the lobby and there is no phone they could let me use speaking of phones to use the landline phone in the room is absurdly expensive even for toll free calls so i missed a conference call being out of my room also prevented me from practicing my upcoming evening speech when my room was finally ready it took 10 minutes to get in an elevator there are not enough elevators in the building there was a similar problem when checking;3
so me and 3 friends stayed here on 2 occassions on a recent trip to nyc first time was for 3 nights then we moved to a hotel in williamsburg and then back for another 2 nights we booked a âview suiteâ so we had 2 double beds and a sofa bed for the 4 of us first time arrived at 7pm told room was not ready even though check in is at 4pm front desk staff were quite rude unable to say when the room would be ready not apologetic at all not great after a long flight finally checked in at 9pm had already emailed in advance and asked for sofa bed to be made up and asked again on initial arrival at 7pm got up to the room sofa bed not made took at least an hour for them to come and do it the room was fine clean and reasonably spacious definitely no;3
they have a lot of rooms their hotel is not bad but the area especial the restaurants in from like mc donalds is so iffy i arrived late and was so hungry so i have to cross there but the hotel in general is ok;3
average boutique hotel in a fantastic location helpful staff good restaurants close starbucks across the street easy walking to subwaycentral park broadway theatres hotel bar was closed looked like they had an onsite restaurant but it was shut down also but the location is so good you donât need those things;3
rooms didnt seem that clean and were somewhat in disrepair and one person at front desk during check in was rather arrogant and condescending roof top bar did have a fabulous view and concierge was helpful;3

i booked without reading the reviews these were very negative i was a bit scared to be honest especially about the bedbugs when we checked in i was positively surprised the rooms were basic but very clean also the facilities were regularly cleaned apparently they made improvements after the feedback the only downside was the hallway the fire escapes were open all the time which made it very cold and easy accessible for people outside location is very nice the center is easily accessible and there are a lot of little restaurant and pubs in the neighborhood i recommend this for young couples of groups of friends;3
this is a very busy hotel due to its proximity to universal studios however the hotel staff does try to ensure each guest is satisfied and that each room meets hilton expectations however my recent visit was somewhat below average due to issues with the assigned room i am a loyal hilton patron and will remain so despite my disappointing visit this past week i hope that this review will help this hotel staff to finetune the quality of the hotel rooms they assign to guests;3
the empire hotels location is wonderful across the street from lincoln center walking distance to central park and to broadway the area is quiet and lovely during the day lively in the evenings its also very close to abc studios so we were able to see a few talk show tapings a fun free thing to do in nyc if you can score the tickets also the pub downstairs is great and there are other good restaurants all around anyway the hotel is a little tired but totally adequate small room and bathroom nicely decorated but showing some wear ours was an inside room with an ugly inner courtyard view ie big ac units and pipes but street view was more so we skipped it;3
this breaks my heart about the jane ive stayed many many times over the years its a real gem in a marvelous location i love the staffroomslobby and once gorgeous ball room that the hotel once opened to its guests to have a coffee sit in front of the roaring fire cocktails in the afternoons it was a huge perk sadly now it belongs to some club that opens only at 9pm and is incredibly unappealing the restaurant remains closed as well the biggest miss to me is the non available cup of coffee in the morning wouldnt it be so very easy for the hotel to put a little coffee station in the lobby there is no coffee available one has to get dressed and walk several blocksfor us it was insanely easy to fix with a coffee station but no such luck the staff remains;3
the location is within a block of the subway and a couple blocks from central park it was easy to get to all the sights but dont ask for help from most of the staff the room was cozy but the halls were not air conditioned and only one set of elevators that worked i almost passed out from the heat no restaurant on site but several 24 hour restaurants and a grocery store parking garage around the corner and hotel has door loading area;3
hotel lobby is fantastic and very impressive we arrived at 215pm and asked kindly at the front desk if there was a chance to check in already the lady at the desk was very rude and just said no only at 3pm we dropped off our luggage and walked around the neighbourhood for a bit when coming back another agent checked us in and upgraded us to a room with two queen size beds we were happy again the rooms are fully equipped with toiletries tv ac a safe etc though due to its dark colours and the weird brown of the bathroom tiles it looks kind of dirty but for a nyc hotel it was a huge room and offered everything we needed for the time being rooftop bar not my crowd of people there a little scatchy but other than that its nice to have a drink before going;3
hotel in a vwrybstrategic position and overall good but frw things left me speechless if i compare the momey spent windows with briken glasses keept inplace by tapeis it a safe environment for a customer paying to have an accptable service the same window had damaged frame and once opened i have not been able to close it backhad to ask thenreception to send someone to repair it bed lining damaged and not by meusin 1 week i saw just once the shower gel refilled i think these are minimal things which could be easily aieted out but that on the other hand can be very unpleasant for a customer hope ameritania will put a small effort to offer an overall high level standard to customers as the rest of the steucture does lqst butnnot least free wifi just in the;3
pros location mattress comfort room cleanliness value for money cons extreme noise in the room from the ac even if the ac is off the neighbouring rooms will annoy you small room poor breakfast;3
this hotel is conveniently located on 8th ave and 34th st close to penn station the lobby is pretty impressive and the staff at the front desk was very friendly my room has everything i needed it was small but i guess thats normal for new york if you have ever tried to find a good hotel in new york for a reasonable price this is one however dont look too close the bathroom was okay but certainly not perfectly clean;3
if i could give a rating of 3 12 i would because truthfully this property is a step above average for the price and location in nyc like most accommodations in the city it was on the small side and everything from the furniture to the television to the bathroom to the elevator has not been updated in some time howeverit was very clean and comfortable and at least the mattress and pillows seemed to have been replaced somewhat more recently this hotel is very close to the subway and to some restaurants so getting around and getting something quick to eat was quite easy i would definitely stay here again;3
this hotel lies on upper west side manhattan relatively close to the city core it comes up the new york standards which has been set in 1930 and have not changed since but it is far below the europeans broken bathtub obvious need of renovation everywhere noisy ac but i mean like a truck noisy streets is what you deal with in exchange it has clean comfortable beds good bathroom and good prices for manhattan;3
arrived at reception to a robot checking you in no emotion then arrived at room with no view so top tip ask if you have a view or can you get one we left it as we are only using this as a bed for the night but would have been good to have a view apart from the disappointment of room at least the room attendants done a great job and were very pleasant so well done to them please note that they charge for coffee and 8 for a bottle of water but there is a starbucks next door there is a shop around the corner for cheaper water the hotel needs to be refurbished never managed to see pool as door and access seemed to be blocked at 1900hrs so no comment there for a room that was tired looking and rhat the front staff think its ok to give out without mentioning that;3
i love the new yorker and have been staying there for 15 years before wyndhams management of the property we take the train from washington to penn sta often arriving in the city before we can check in or staying in the city after we check out i have stayed in many other hotels in the city also but often choose the new yorker for convenience and its familiarity over the last several years the sales pitches and nickeldime fees have gotten more and more out of control for example bag storage fees free in a great majority of new york hotels used to be free at the new yorker then it was 1bag after wyndham took over management now its 5 per bag which is out of control paying another 30 just to stow 3 bags upon arrival and departure while being pitched to;3
had a few issues with the hotel but had amazing employees make it right for us renato our maintenance guy was our first great impression at the hotel andre from sierra cafe took care of us well from our dinner buffet and also breakfast the next day almost all staff was great but then we checkout and i went back to fd to settle some issues with my bill after taking care of the guest in front of me aimee did not even acknowledge me and continued to work on something in the computer also proceeded to talk to her coworker before finally helping us with some attitude;3
stayed here over the weekend and while i stayed here over 20 years ago as well the hotel is showing its age still decent hotel but will need remodeling soon hotel is very convenient to penn station and thatâs good if flying from newark and taking train into the city;3
this cheap hotel i can recommend for its location near the central park the hotel is situated in very beautiful and silent street with nice buildings hotel room is simple the restroom is on the floor but no problem very clean and not so much people for one restroom;3
this hotel is quite typical of new york not a lot of space but more or less what i expected the benefit is it is very central and within great walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go a bit tired and the central areas are a bit drab the thing is in new york you dont tend to spend any time in the actual hotel so not a great issue the staff were friendly enough but it didnt have much atmosphere;3
the hotel location is awesome near walking distance to central park met museum the met the subway station is very close by to columbus circle or 59th street the concierge was great and very helpful in giving directions and great to walk to broadway;3
i stayed with my my then 11 yo daughter spring 2014 at the days hotel i was concerned upon arrival as the lobby had a slight hostel feel however we upgraded to the club level and were pleasantly surprised the hallways were freshly carpeted and painted and much different than the lower floors the room was roomy and the bathroom was large the wifi was horrible and spotty the front desk person that evening at checkin was very nice the others the next day werent as hospitable but not rude either i am writing this review now as i will return to the hotel next week and will post any changes or improvements;3
i would rate this hotel as a 35 if that were available wyndham new yorker is an old hotel with charm it is a 40 story hotel well situated near madison square gardens macys broadway and lots of action the rooms are updated although there are some that are not quite as nice if you can get an upgrade to higher floors you will have some magnificent views you may want the higher floor to limit noise from the busy city if you don not like old style places you may prefer smaller hotels on a few streets above that are newer and refurbished that being said this hotel really has character you get a sense of old new york there are restaurants in the hotel and a walgreens and cvs just across the street;3
front desk staff are great with humorous and prompt staff i then proceeded into room and found iron decent bathroom and bed and large tv but thats where the good impression ends bunch of things that i dont enjoy include aircon that doesnt allow user to set temperature temperature is set by central system that heats below 65degf and cools when above 85degf whats worse is the ac control which only allows fan speed control is faulty and runs on high fan all the time which is very noisy tv wasnt working and front desk sent someone up to fix it promptly but images werent sharp location is not good pretty far from main hollywood attractions which will cost you 1520usd to get there by cab breakfast though free was pretty average lastly wifi signal is weak and;3
i stayed with my grandson at this hotel for a trip to introduce him to manhattan there are several pros for booking 1 the price is certainly excellent for new york 2 the location is central for using the subway or attending plays 3 the elevators are quick and are enough in numbers that you donât have to wait long one theater district hotel we booked in the past required almost 30 minutes to exit the hotel 4 the security was visible 5 the staff was pleasant and check in was quick 6 housekeeping was conscientious and rooms were clean the beds and linens were comfortable 7 our room on the 23rd floor had a fabulous view of the empire state building cons 1 there was no room service and coffee machines must be requested for your room there is no;3
i enjoyed my stay here in general the very small room was sufficient and the shared bathroom didnt bother me at all the room however was very hot and in the end i had to leave the air con running and get under the blankets to be comfy the cafã© attached cafã© gitane was quite charming but the service was variable and the staff appeared to have some problems with basic maths at times the rooftop bar was a real treat and popular with the locals as well as hotel guests;3
stayed for a business trip nothing particularly wrong with the place but lots that would have been disappointing if i had paid for the trip as a holiday wifi was very unreliable only managed to connect once all trip 4 days and even then it was super slow additional coffee in the room after day one was three dollars per sachet shower was a bit dodgy kept going very hot then very cold tv remote was also temperamental generally the rooms were clean but in urgent need of an upgrade to match the description on the website;3
if you book a room at this hotel and go with the attitude that its just a bed for the night then you wont be disappointed the beds are comfortable the linentowels are spotless clean the shower is good the guys on reception are very helpful thats the good stuff our room was very small and had partitioned walls so you can hear everything from other rooms showers toilets voices their aircon etc the noise aspect is the hardest thing to accept other peoples noise the aircon which is ridiculously loud and disappointingly ineffective considering how hard its working the extractor fan in the bathroom is so loud that you cant have a conversation with someone in the bedroom unless you shout the toilet blocked twice and the plug mechanism was broken on arrival;3
i stayed here for almost a week and i chose it because i was looking for a place in manhattan with just relavitely cheap price and bathroom inside the room without having to go to brooklyn or another area of ny it was a good choice because it has an underground station very near so you can move around easily itâ´s almost in the beginning of harlem very calm area ok forget staying in manhattan visiting ny is a must brooklyn or queens might be a good place i guess and everybody knows much cheaper and with a wider range of places to choose from but i didnâ´t think so and itâ´s not easy to find a hotel in manhattan with these features and not super expensive rooms were average just basic and we indeed had some problems with the hot water since some days it just didnâ´t;3
amazing location hotel itself not worth price the lobby area was gorgeous and very nice but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated my room had a gorgeous view but looked nothing like the rooms the hotel posts pictures of it was much more outdated the shower had dirt in between the tiles that couldve been scrubbed away and the bathroom also looks much older it wasnt super dirty or anything but definitely couldve been cleaner especially for the price the tv was older and i had issues with it being so grainy at some points not the whole time that i couldnt read the guide the diner was nice facility fees none of which i used its basically the office and gym plus wifi for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing 100 which;3
weve just returned from our first visit to la and had booked 7 nights at the hilton reasons for booking location close to citywalk and the fact that it was a hilton a brand that has pleased us in the past however we were dismayed when we saw our room we had a view of the freeway and could hear the traffic in the room it was dark small and poky smelt of smoke and cleaning fluids we asked to move but the hotel was full so front desk promised that theyd sort us out the next morning which they did we were moved to a higher floor with a view of universal which was better the room was lighter and quieter the big issue with this hotel is the cleanliness of the rooms there were areas that had not seen a duster for a while and the previous guests hair was;3
stayed one night for business in may 2017 the room was clean the hotel was deco palatial int he lobby but the rooms are small and the bathroom was the smallest one ive ever been inincluding on a cruise ship no room for even a tissue box could not use the toilet with the door open towels a little ragged at the edges toilets flush with industrial forceand you can hear the toilets from rooms above and below and to either side of youalso hear faucets running and the street noise is unfilteredhear it all night long too cant reach the curtains so good luck trying to block the light pillows smelt like essence of old man hairthey need some freshening badly;3
perfectly located for a night at lincoln center room was clean and the bed was comfortable next time we come to nyc to visit the met i will check the room rates and if they are good ill stay at the empire again;3
the location is great if youâre wanting to be near the park which we did one of the best things we did in nyc was go for an early morning run in central park the main problem was the noise the window of the room looked into the central âcourtyardâ with the fans and the noise was deafening really loud granted it was hot outside but the noise was very very loud the room was small and not fancy;3
my wife and i have just returned from 6 nights in the wyndham new yorker booked through a package deal the hotel is ideally located for anyone wanting to travel around the city with penn station across the road and its easy access to anywhere the hotel is undergoing some refurbishment yet the hotel lobby is still very grand the art deco dã©cor throughout the hotel is plain to see even in the rooms where the bathrooms have period feature vanity sets the room we had was a standard double and was very small enough room for two suitcases the bed and our shoes however the room was essentially only for sleeping in as the city was the main reason for visiting the hotel has two eateries connected to it an italian that we did not try and the 24hour ticktock diner both;3
i booked this hotel with less the 24 hours notice for a quick getaway they do not offer the breakfast option like other hyatts they have a restaurant on the inside that provides breakfast and lunch if you have a rental car it is 55 dollars a day they have their windows locked and no balconies for extra circulation the city view rooms literally face the airport there is no pool at this location;3
had a room on the 14th floor view of the neighbors on the hill across the road but thats fine bit of road noise even up that high loved the fact that the curtains actually were light blocking or room darkening whatever the mattress was not one i would choose to sleep on at home and i tossed and turned looking for a comfortable spot so did my husband didnt find one cleaning staff were perfection personified these ladies know how to make a room shine anything you want they will get for you loved it please leave them something when you go they work their collective butts off the staff at the front desk were ever so charming and polite a pleasure to be greeted by them every morning on the way to breakfast which by the way was great hostesses;3
even though i live in the region i spent the night here 42717 as my flight the next morning was at 6am checkin was a breeze although when we inquired about a room that was quiet we were told that we had one of the quietest rooms however when entering the room our window looked upon the runways and for most of the night the aircraft that were landing were quite noisy and when the evening tpac departures were heading out we could hear the engines spooling but since we had to get up early it wasnt worth it to go downstairs and swap rooms other than that the room was really spacious and had an interesting motif with bright lighting the hvac system was really quiet it was not louder than the airplanes arriving and departing in the morning after;3
i stayed here first 20 years ago location is great a fine example of an art deco building in the city that does them best a stones throw from madison square gardens and penn station you are in the heart of midtown on the westside lobby is busy lovely examples of brass plaques antiquated lifts and a huge art deco chandelier however the lobby is the best thing about the hotel your on 8th avenue and i was on 29th floor and could hear the traffic and emergency vehicle sirens throughout the night which tells me the windows are old and not very good at insulating the rooms do not seen to have changed in 20 years dirty tiles in the cramped bathroom which remind you of your grandparents bathrooms back in the 1980s rooms just as dated no fridge or tea or coffee making;3
overall a decent hotel great location and average clean rooms quite small rooms normal nyc standards very outdated bathrooms biggest complaint great food on sight and convenience to major landmarks nearby subway is at hotel;3
great location but staff was not attentive to simple needs and doormen made you feel uncomfortable every time you left or arrived back to building huge disappointment overall location is key and walking distance to everything;3
it is a good location with shuttle service from to lax airport the front desk could not find my membership so there was not member service no higher floor option there is no complementary breakfast for members either i woke up from the noise probably from tv next room around 3am and from talking around 5 am;3
i was assigned room 137 and it was very noisy form outside ventilation fans room windows are to the inside service patio and next building terrace was less than 3 feet away so it is very uncomfortable;3
we stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to universal studios hollywood it is one of two hotels within walking distance to universal they offer a shuttle to the park that is shared with the sheraton however we walked most of the time versus taking the shuttle the shuttle is scheduled to come every 15 minutes however more than not it was more than 15 minutes they only have one bus even during closing hoursfaster to walk if you are not too tired overall the hotel was the quality expected from the hilton brand the bathroom sink drained very slow and not much counter space in the bathroom parking is very expensive 28day for self park and 40day for valet as a hilton honors member we received bottled water upon check in very nice touch rooms have;3
overall this was a good stay the hotel is in a great location you can see it is dated and a little worn in the common areas such as the halls elevator lobby etc the service was great the room was spacious clean and updated the bed was comfortable my only complaint was the wake up call that i received 15 minutes late thankfully i only use wakeup calls as a backup the indian restaurant directly across the streetmmmmmm;3
the empire hotels location is why we chose it we had stayed there about six years ago and it had been newly refurbished i dont believe they have done anything since then our first room had water damaged walls and was in sad shape we called our booking agency to see what could be donewe were ready to find a different hotel they called the front desk supervisor to see what could be done tatiana the supervisor switched us to a suite on the seventh floor overlooking broadway this room was in better shape so we decided to stay she saved the day the hotel needs an update so many small improvements could make a big difference like change all the bad light bulbs there were so many out in the lobby that i lost count the drain stoppers in the sinks do not work and the;3
if this review was based on just our first night stay id have to rate it a 0 we arrived late never thought 7pm was late before but that was the reason that we were told there was only one room left in a king junior suite on the smoking optional floor well my option was not to smoke but it made no difference to the room it was definitely a smoking room it looked like the hotel had accepted the fact that these rooms were abused and would only do so much to maintain them burn marks on the furniture a deep horrible smell stains on the carpet whew thank goodness i was only paying 315 per night we did get moved for the remaining two nights and the same room one floor up was very nice an apology or upgrade would have been nice but nothing was said oh well;3
i stayed in a one bed apt with my daughter for 6 nights this month i was worried after reading the reviews but thankfully there was no need ok the building smelt a but musty like an old building but that was ok i can deal with that we were checked in in five mins our room was on the 5th floor it was perfectly adequate we had everything we needed the bedroom was clean and the bed comfortable the sofa in the living area was extremely comfy too we had ironing board extra pillows blankets toaster microwave and fine tv and music centre there was no view just a wall but that as fine because it was extremely quiet at night so we slept really well it is a great area and the doormen helped us with where to get shopping etc subway and supermarket only;3
nice greeting on arrival room dated and needs some attention as there was a lot of wear and tear on bathroom door and bedroom furniture overall staff were very friendly and helpful ideal spot for being at the lincoln centre and top half of town with central park only a block away which was great for early morning walks;3
if you are staying here plan on leaving at least 1520 minutes early for wherever you are going there are only 3 functional elevators also if you need the hotel to hold your baggage while you wait to checkin or before departure they charge you 5bag the checkincheckout process is very inefficient and the lines are very long with few hotel staff working the room was tiny even for nyc standards but we did get a free fridge delivered to our room upon request overall would not recommend but location was convenient;3
how come in 2016 a hotel in nyc charges for internet in the room and for a internet that does not work properly reception staff were unpatient rooms are ok but matress are too soft so the pilows it is better to stay in the hilton gardens inn across the street;3
we stayed in 2 rooms for two nights whilst visiting universal studios the valet parking is smooth but the head doorman who unloaded the car only pushed the trolley through the door before he had his hand out for a tip only later did i ralsie i would alos have to tip the bellman who took the trolly to our room check in was good and the rooms we had were spacious although you had to stand against the coerner fo the window for the view of the park we had been promised the room was clean and comfortable the charge for wifi is annoying the cookies left in the room each evening were a nice touch at check in a big deal was made of the remodled pool area what a let down we stayed here 6 years ago and the pool area looked exaclty the same apart form being less well;3
perhaps i hadnâ´t read the small print but i had a somewhat claustrophobic feeling when i entered the room â it was so small the tiniest room i have ever slept in and beware of the noise from west side highway but i liked the way they have restored rooms lobby and the restaurant great district;3
average hotel you have what you need nothing more stayed june 14th 16th 2014 pros late check in awesome location steps from restaurants subway central park 7 min subway ride to times square cons dont come with high expectations this hotel has mostly whats needed ie private wash room bed tv air conditioning sometimes functional wifi or elevator and nice enough staff and no parking i would recommend this hotel because of the location;3
very close to universal city studios and ultraconvenient to visit the park and studios but if youre in la for other reasons might want to find somewhere else obviously a dated property with the age showing elevators are old rooms and fittings are old and the upkeep is okay but not much better than that our carpet looked at best scary the bed was good furniture appropriate and the bathroom was good hotel restaurants are good to better hotel bar is okay but seemed a bit short of staff pool is quite nice but the security detracts a bit from the pool and outdoor scene my son lives close by which drove our choice if you are with your family going to universal not bad;3
we stayed here in jan 2018 this was our first trip to ny location of the hotel is excellent and we had a fantastic view however the rooms are tiny we barely had room for our suitcase bathroom is dated and could do with a refresh beds were comfortable hotel corridors had a very strong smell and the hotel generally could do with some modernization and a refresh;3
unique advantage of the hotel was its location opposite madison square garden and penn station in fact after 11 pm it is quite place to sleep you can open a window of the room and feel cool morning breeze coming from hudson river together with the sound of the flying seagulls the rooms are awfully small but very clean and the stuff is helpful;3
we had two nights at the new yorker in a pokey little room with a pokey little shower and no shelves anywhere in sitei suppose this is what you should expect two minutes from macys and ten minutes from times square a massive hotel just too busy for us but the staff really are most helpful and smiley which means a lot for weary travellers;3
best thing about the jane is its location just under 10 minutes walk from chelsea market and bit over 10 minutes to the 14th st ace subway lines the rooms are indeed very small 4050 sq feetthe size of my bathroom at home but not cramped or claustrophobic i requested and received a quiet room that had a single twin and was close to the shared bathroom which was very clean a bathrobe and slippers were provided but far too small for me to wear just there for an overnight so no complaints however for longer stays in the future i will return to my favorite guesthouse in harlem for half the janes price;3
pricey views into other peoples rooms small rooms cramped bathrooms if you like a college room experience with the added extras of listening to your neighbours conversations tvs dogs and awkward bed noises you might like this place however decent spot next to central park and subway isnt too far away;3
great location and service but many rooms still have those old clunky noisy and inefficient air conditioners poor temperature control empire has great location especially for an elderly guest like me right across from lincoln center and great restaurants nearby but they badly need an upgrade;3
the style of the hotel did nothing for me like it did for some other reviewers the lobby was nice in a retro way but the sleeping room was run down and not overly clean the location is very convenient as is having a quick wellpriced 24hour diner in the lobby you can grab a quick bite to eat and be on your way for the rest of the day the service is just ok we arrived before our room was ready so we checked our luggage with the bell stand when we got into our room later in the day we were trying to relax for a bit so we called the bell desk about 56 times over the course of 1015 minutes no one answered so i went down to get our luggage by myself because the person i was traveling with has an injury the guy gave me all our luggage and basically walked;3
we booked the hotel to have a place to land during down times on a day trip to the city the location cant be beat and even my partner who can be very picky was pleasantly surprised by the accommodations and rate it was great to be greeted by denis at curbside and use the valet parking danny at the front desk was helpful and efficiently met our need to check in early the hotel has modern decoration and colors used eg browns and golds seem to make everywhere appear cozy but dark the room a king was european sized and well appointed the bathroom while dated and small by usa standards was clean and met basic needs the heating unit needed attention because adjustment was not possible the room was warm and a bit of cooler fresh air would have been nice we;3
i havent been to this hotel in a long time this is mainly a hotel for people visiting universal studios they have upgraded their rooms and hallways but the elevators you may have to wait for a while the only thing that surprised me is how long they have had this issuelike for years the last time i stayed here in 2011 they had only one elevator functioning and at least this time they had 3 of the 5 working i dont know how long it takes to replace an elevator but you may have to wait a bit in the morning to catch one the parking garage seemed to have enough spaces and access was easy the staff is very accommodating and help answer any and all questions i had there is a coffee bar with quick breakfast stuff to go if you are in a rush as well and dont have;3
after extensive research done on this and other websites we decided to stay at this hotel for a week on the first leg of our summer 2005 west coast trip we chose the conciergeclub level as the amenities offered drinks light food was worth the small extra fee and afforded us the ability to have a quick breakfast or light snack during our days in los angeles note that rates for less than a week were charged at a daily rate once we decided upon 7 nights we were given a cheaper weekly rate the location was good for visitors to universal studios a short walk got you there in about 7 minutes we avoided most of the la traffic by staying here as it was easy to find offhighway routes nearby that with the help of a map took us wherever we wanted to go we did a lot;3
its a great place to stay but they do not have proper water tea coffee availability in the room;3
i recently stayed at the hyatt regency by lax for an overnight before flying out the next day for a business trip the hotel is very modern and has ample places to sit and relax in the lobby area as well as a gift shop with incidentals and food area i did notice a very heavy perfume or room freshner spray in the lobby which was a little overwhelming the room dã©cor is very modern but the room was not super clean i was pretty exhausted with a later in the evening check in and did not notice much as i went straight to bed in the morning i noticed a large greasewater stain or something on the cover for the box spring the chairs in the room had stains on the arm rests and the bathroom sink had a slight sewagesulfur smell staff were very nice and friendly but would;3
for one night passing through nyc it was fine expensive for what it is but the location is great right next to central park the room was small but okay for me travelling alone reasonably well equipped comfortable and clean okay for a short stay but i wouldnt fancy anything more than a weekend im sure there are better hotels available in the price range nearby;3
i stay at this days inn on 94th street because of the neighborhood upper west side vicinity to the subway two express stops from times square access to good restaurants on amsterdam avenue and the price which is usually pretty good however i have a couple of gripes about my recent stay 1 the room lacked a bureau for clothes usually i come down to nyc for several days at a time and i dont want to live out of a suitcase where all my clothes can get wrinkled in the past this hotel had a bureau or at least a desklike affair with several drawers in which i could deposit clothes but on this visit there was an empty space below the wallmounted tv where the bureau should have been whats that all about the absence of a bureau is worth a demerit in ratings;3
i booked this place hoping to be closer to central park and i did it in a hurry totally did not read my reviews carefully honestly for ny i should have just paid more for a bigger room at a more central location to the parks of manhattan i enjoy for shopping and scenery soho broadway southern end of central park the smallness of the room even by manhattan standards kind of tainted the nyc experience for me the nice thing was that the hotel was pretty clean and accommodating still not great value for that price though oh and the heaters were really old and weird;3
we always read reviews before picking hotels and i knew the jane had rooms that were noisy and that most larger rooms had views of the hudson i therefore asked for a high floor with a view when we checked in to our captains cabin about 530 pm it was on the second floor with no view the bathroom door was also jammed shut and had to be opened by an employeewe were told that if we got down to the lobby early in the morning we might get a better room both of us were very tired after a night with very little sleep and the flight from the uk and were not happy to be kept awake by the techno beat reverberating through our pillows until the early hours and also having to call down for someone to open the bathroom door again which took some time with various tools while i stood;3
this was our first trip to new york as we were being checked in at reception i overheard the other receptionist giving a couple of females free wifi in there rooms so when we were offered it only in the reception i queried it and also received it so dont be shy ask for it the hotel could really do with an upgrade our room on the 10th floor was quite enough clean and tidy but very compact the bathrooms were tiny and very little room the air conditioning unit could do with a change there was no temp gage on it so we either froze and couldnt hear yourself think or just unplugged it there is no extracter fan in the bathroom therefore the bedroom got full of steam the hotel is in a great location with two wonderful eating places across the road the smith and cafe;3
my wife and i stayed here in april 2005 it was a trip that we organised at the last minute and we were being quoted 250 dollars and more much more per night at other hotels that had vacancys we were a little concerned about staying in the lower east side but we did not have many any alternatives and at 150 per night we decided to go for it the hotel itself is about average very clean and the rooms were serviced each day it is a modern hotel but it is starting to show some signs of wear the bathroom is modernish but i prefer modern over antique charm any day so it was fine it was necessary to run the shower for a few minutes to get hot water but once we had worked this out it was not a major problem we reported this to the hotel and they say that they are;3
positives beautiful lobby good location staff very friendly suites offer comfortable amount of space negatives rooms and bathrooms especially very much in need of remodeling very poor workout center understaffed to answer calls from room ie calling to get wake up call or ice for room took multiple attempts or were just never answered;3
i booked the hotel through online travel agency the rating is excellent however my experience is not as good as i expected the room is clean i have double bed breakfast is complimentary free wifi the one that surprise me the parking is not free for the guest i paid about 12day which is supposed to be free for guest the breakfast staff is not friendly and very intimidating though location is good it is nearby several restaurant about 20mins to universal studio and about 15mins to hollywood walk of fame;3
positives clean room good amount of space very decent breakfast freecheap street parking and central location negatives stained bath towels grimy neighborhood expensive hotel parking and current construction;3
the hotel needs a more secure parking system so that individuals parking must prove that they are the hotel guests they claim to be and the parking attendants can verify their room numbers we have had a fraudulent charge added to our bill which is clearly due to lack of appropriate security for the hotel parking;3
convenient location next to penn station and madison square garden we were able to walk to broadway pier 83 macyâs empire state building time square and rockefeller center the staff was very friendly and accommodating the rooms are not anything special and the bathrooms are long overdue for renovation the walls are way too thin and you can hear everything going on in the neighboring rooms which is not cool we had to request a room change after the first night due to all of the noise in the room next door the staff gladly moved us to a different floor without hesitation the new room was bigger the bathroom was also very dated and small and while nothing like the previous nights neighbors we could still here everything that was happening in the room next door;3
decent hotel at a decent price close enough to the sights;3
just returned from a one night stay at this hotel after reading the rave reviews on tripadvisor we were a little disappointed yes the hotel is in a perfect location for visiting universal studios and the universal walk but there is no wow factor parking is pricey food also rooms are clean and comfortable but dated typical hilton layout staff were helpful;3
rooms are spacious and clean and v handy for universal however the food is not good which is disappointing for a chain like that my friends had dinner in the restaurant which they said was pretty bad and i was v underwhelmed by the breakfast plus lots of messy tables both in the bar and restaurant staff all very attentive though so just eat elsewhere;3
brilliant location but after spending time here previously the customer service and room cleanliness has slipped the room didnât have enough towels for 2 people and the room didnât get cleaned or checked on in the 3 days we were there no fresh towels coffee toilet paper we did ask reception if someone could just come in and replace towels but didnât happen however canât fault the buffet breakfast all you can eat helps start the day the right way;3
it is very good that you can reach to penn station easily times square is just a ten minutes walk but hotel is old i think it deserves its price its history is also interesting it is a very crowded hotel so checkin check out concierge services take time;3
we were looking for a hotel on the upper west side to be close to family lobby is very nice but as we headed up the slow small and ancient elevator then found our room down a narrow musty smelling hall which backed up to said elevator i was a bit concerned although all we wanted was a clean bathroom and clean bed as we were planning to be out every morning by 700 and not back til late i was beginnning to think what is plan b yes the room is dingy mismatched furniture smells musty but it was clean and the bed was fairly comfortable tv didnt work but they did credit us back 12500 we left the fan on which buffered the clicking of the elevator overall it was ok and will stay again as it totally served our purpose there are great delis and restaurants in the;3
we were there for a single night the room was clean and basic and manhattan small as expected our room had zero view the window looked out to a flat roof and brick parapit bathroom was small but clean again nice clean and completely average would stay again;3
i stayed here only one night the night before i left america after a recommendation from a friend who used to stay here long before it was the jane of today it certainly has a history i stayed in a standard cabin with communal bathroom all i can say is the rooms are tiny however they do advise you of this on their website you literally have a bed and the width of the door which isnt a particularly wide door but if you just need somewhere to sleep its ideal the communal bathrooms were satisfactory as any shared bathrooms are i doubt i would stay in a standard cabin for any significant length of time but as prices in nyc are through the roof this makes for a cheaper option cant say i necessarily noticed the noise but this was at the end of a long hols and i can;3
i found this hotel on tripadvisor i read the reviews and selected this hotel was best choice although wifi was not free the hotel is very close to central park staff are very nice my room was very clean and very serene;3
great hotel great location bedroom was a good size bed was comfortable room was clean close to all necessary amenities good restaurants in walking distance walking distance to the subway station;3
hotel is in a great location and is convenient to restaurants the park the hotel is a little dark and not real light and airy feeling employees were all very nice helpful the room we were in was extremely small not sure if theyre all like that or not though it wasnt terrible but not my favorite either;3
the rooms looked nice online are very small i travelled with 3 teen agers the bathroom is about 5x5 including the shower fridge is stocked full everything costs a fortune such as water or soda for 750 a bottle no room to put anything of mine in without taking their stuff out coffee in room great oh waitit is 350 for each keurig pod which costs about 40 in stores wifi in room is 1295 a day ac is freezing or roasting you at least one elevator out of service at all times called for maintenance for bathroom 3 times in as many days great location but i feel way overpriced for what you get;3
the hotel is right in the heart of nyc its rather large but the rooms are never loud it took a bit for our room to be ready but they held our luggage the room two doubles was pretty sizable for a ny hotel room the bathroom was also pretty roomy didnt spend a lot of time in the room close to transportation tick tock diner was good for breakfast;3
charged for checking in early put in a suite that had this annoying constant ringing sound only to be moved to another room with a view of get this the roof which wed paid for a view it also had constant horrible noisy sounds we had to complain so very many times but was not receiving no love finally my husband had to show some aggression which he and i both were uncomfortable with him having to do and we too felt violated by this so we were atlas given a room with a viewwhich like id said is what we paid for but the front desk manager lied to me and said that we didnt ask for that option while making our reservations online all of this after having to complain to hotel staff and on my birthday which i also kept reminding them of in clothes that we;3
i stayed here twice before and had enjoyable experiences both times night 1 included a standard cabin very small stylish perfect size tv acheat and a somewhat comfy twin size bed the shared bathrooms are just down the hall and are well maintained and i never had to wait for anything night 2 i was upgraded to a captains room which had a real full size bed more spacestorage and its own bathroom it was a wonderful upgrade my only major complaint about the hotel is it can be sometimes loud in the hallway with people slamming their doors to go back and forth to the bathroom with the dangling keys which you use to turn on the electric in the room this is perfect for someone who doesnt plan to spend much time in the room at all;3
i always stay in this hotel when i am in la but this time it was my worst stay unfriendly staff a little rude at checkin i did not really feel welcomed this timejust a touristand in fact i was one but good hotels should make you feel home rooms large very comfortable beds just beware of the rooms facing south noise from street was very loud excellent buffet on fridays and saturdays evenings for the rets hilton as usual;3
new yorker hotel is a beautiful deco building and very central for 42nd street times square empire state building macyâs and maddison square gardens staff were very helpful rooms clean but a little small for 2 adults and all our luggage there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel and the subway is on the next block we choose to walk up to central park and grand central station which was a lovely trip and an interesting walk there are plenty of taxis around but the traffic is heavy as you would expect from a city centre it is a good location for walking from only issues i had were that the room safe didnât work and was not fixed in the 3 days i was there and the hotel was hosting a large dog show at the time ok if you like dogs i found having dogs in;3
the best part about the hotel is its location walking distance for all the locations and near to a c e line on penn station but thats the only good part about the hotel the hotel is still looks very dated and inspite of all the makeovers there is still a lot of work to be done the suite rooms are dated and not worth it maybe the refurbished single rooms might be better considering the scale of hotel its a pain to ask for anything be it fresh towels or coffee cups they take ages to arrive wish they complete the renovation asap and regain there past glory;3
this hotel is a conundrum it is not glamouress but for a big rude city like la the staff are absolutely wonderful however the hotel is right off the 405 which for a irish country girl was rather exciting but very very noisy the hotel does provide earplugs but like karl pilkington i can hear my heart beat so i dont like them it is convenient if you are a contestant on wheel of fortune or jeopardy as there were several at the bar hoopin and hollerin like theyd won the rodeo but thats more funny than annoying the annoying thing is the bathrooms are so outdated they are worn and rather sad the rooms are nice and the telly is huge for the room the breakfast was absolutely fantastic and the restaurant staff were wonderful i love hilton most of the time and i;3
empty shampoo bottles left for days in shower base obviously not cleaned rubbish bin not emptied we had to call cleaner back to clean toilet bathroom floor not swept or washed carpet not vacuumed in fact most days only the bed was remade we spent 7 nights there when called housekeeping never answered nessitating a trip down to reception location is excellent however i would hesitate recommending this hotel due to their lack of care ed was;3
the location is absolutely perfect for the metropolitan opera literally 10 minutes from final curtain to hotel room the westside location is also very convenient to central park and to the underground via columbus circle station the hotel seemed extremely expensive for what you get but ill readily admit that i am not a regular new york traveler and by the standards of that city it was probably very reasonable a little over 1000 for three nights the room was small with only a shower and no tub but quiet and comfortable enough the front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly and found me a room when upon arrival i realized that i had booked on the wrong night the booking error was mine not theirs but they went out of their way to help me;3
its a mediocre property with bitesized rooms but centrally located not to go for their breakfast package as you only get a toast and coffee but their tick tock allday dining restaurant serves quintessential american cuisine calling guest services is like dialing a customer service center that just rings and rings in short if all you care about is location location and location then the new yorker is the hotel to be checked in;3
cant beat the location very convenient for every part of the city my room was on the small size given the price and that it was a double there was a problem with the wifi which was a problem for me;3
our room in the new yorker a wyndham hotel was smaller than hotel rooms ive had in paris and for less money the plumbing was old and doused us with alternatively hot and cold water it seems wyndham added a coat of paint and their name only the lobby was ok the cafe and restaurant were average too the staff however was very good location is great;3
hard to perfectly rate this one if i could a 35 this time the positives are a brilliant location a historical building good staff and overall convenience cool and decent diner connected to it which is open 247 useable business longue views were great it is a perfectly fine hotel for shorter stays in my opinion if you want to feel you are really on vacation the highvolume of hotel traffic will not provide that feeling tons of rooms and 6 elevators takes a while to get up and down elevator guards to check your room key reminds you this is located in a busy place where you gotta keep an eye out for floaters and belongings while i was appreciative of a penthouse upgrade would def get this room again the water pressure was low and drainage was horrible sadly not;3
we stayed for two nights during columbus day weekend ive stayed in my fair share of rat trapshared baths in this city ive seen pretty much everything and judging from the reviews on tripadvisor i started chocking up riverside studios right alongside the likes of west side inn and come to find out i was wrong yeah there is absolutely no ambience when you walk through the doors and the lobby area the guy checking us in on friday was nice the guy checking us out on sunday couldve cared less about us the hallways are shabby but well lit our room wasnt a luxurious suite at the ritz but it was clean my boyfriend and i checked that room up and down for bugs or any buglike entity and found absolutely nothing in fact the mattress actually looked new the;3
myself and my husband have just returned from staying 3 nights here i was a little disappointed at the standard of the room check in well it was speedy although there was no queue but the female behind the desk did not communicate at allâin fact iâm being polite by saying maybe she had a bad day she gave us no information at all asked for credit card and handed us our room cards room our room was on the 25th floor iâm sure it was once a store room very small lucky for us we are married a while and not shy as if one of us as using the bathroomletâs just say it was all very cosy now all we needed was a base for that it was ok there was a hairdryer and a few toiletries the bed was made everyday and the towels changed if needed the maids;3
ive stayed at this hotel several times but this may be my last i booked a room on the executive floor thinking i was treating myself a bitbut not so much first the floor was supposed to be secured use your key in the elevator to access the floor but not so i was there for two nightstook the elevator several times and never had to put my key in for access second when i opened the door to my room which opened outnever had that before in a hotel the carpet was very worn and dirty third i had to move the coffee table in front of my couch as there was no way i could get to the bed without doing so who planned that fourth the view although some may have liked it was over the parknoisy and not too scenic i was going to ask for a;3
i really expected more from a hilton rooms were a bit worn like the whole hotel was service was great best thing in hilton los angelesuniversal city is the location if you are going to go visit the universal studios its next to it;3
we checked in after 23 hours travelling to find that there was someone already in our room they had just checked in also went back down to the lobby and received keys to a different room to find the room was so small that we could only walk around the bed if the other stepped into the cupboard we were so tired we couldnât be bothered complaining the next day we were contacted to see if the room was ok so we took the opportunity to say we were not happy the staff member was fantastic and straight away organised a different room much bigger and more comfortable not an ideal start the history of this hotel is interesting the staff were very pleasant and the location opposite penn station is great all in all it worked out in the end;3
good location next to lincoln centre broadway great for central park very tired hotel rooms corridors bedroom 225 small poorshabby fittings worst hotel bathroom i have had to endure nowhere to put anything except on top of toilet seat cranky shower mechanics no curtain had to ask for extra towels to cover floor so not slippery water goes everywhere even the door is rotten due to excess water splashes yet has at least 6 coats peeling paint to hide it no air con cranky room heater older windows mean lots of traffic noise would be so good if it was refurbished then it might look like the website photos such a shame as its excellent location;3
i just loved the quirkiness of this hotel the foyer was grand and inviting the lift area hall ways and room decor very much reminded us of the shining film which added to its character the family room two double beds was small and the bathroom was dusty around the paint work the beds and bathroom suit and towels were immaculate and incredibly comfortable we each slept with one of our young children so that we had more room the room had an iron and ironing board hairdryer and mini toiletries the staff as we found all over manhattan were friendly and very helpful when we arrived we were given the choice of rooms and allowed to enter early thank you mohammed the diner was good for breakfast but there is a pub called âhoundstoothâ a few blocks down as you turn left;3
the new yorker is well situated especially if you are attending events at madison square garden or wanting to shop at macys its also an easy walk to the times squarebroadway area if you are reasonably fit security is good with entry to elevators monitored the staff is personable and helpful overall but be sure that you approach the information desk and not the wyndham sales desk closer to checkin where you will have to escape a fairlyhighpressured real estate pitch when first built it must have been a real toptier hotel its features reflect its age it has an elegant lobby some rooms that are quite spacious and some that are quite cramped ours was one of the latter and we could hear the guests in the next room well enough that we could probably have;3
busy hotel in midtown small room typical nyc really basic amenities byo toiletries and forgetful housekeeping room was tiny we couldnât unpack strong showers pressure was nice at the end of long day exploring ny check inout was smooth though and location was great with many food options i would stay somewhere else with bigger room next time a little farther away from the hustle and bustle;3
checkin and check out and digital key was a nice feature to offer however the only thing that worked was the ability to check in there was no ability to check out and the digital key failed to work on 3 occasions the gym was closed and of course they were working on the entrance and interior the whole length of our stay very unsightly;3
new york hotel rooms are unfortunately rather small although adequate the bed was king size and very comfortable there was no coffee machine etc but i always have my own travel kettle with me so am prepared we did not eat at all in the hotel as were only there for five nights and wanted to be out and about the hotel was only two blocks from the empire state building and time square and grand central station were within walking distance with penn railway station only across the road this is very handy for getting to newark airport which is only 30 mins away the staff were friendly and helpful;3
we booked this hotel three months ago through trailfinders after a long trip from london we arrived early on a sunday evening to be told there was no booking for uswith further investigation it appeared they had the dates wrong and our rooms were not made upwe then were asked to remain in the lobby for nearly an hour while they prepared the roomsthe helpful louis promised us a room upgrade in the morning we had a double and our adult daughters had a double doubleour room was tiny and overlooked a grotty courtyard with many noisy air conditioners which resulted in no sleep that night the following morning i spoke to a very grumpy pasquale who had no handover notes of what our predicament had been and told us these were our rooms so get on with it later that day i met;3
our family stayed here two nights at a cost of 400 per night both the front desk and valetdoormen were very efficient and friendly the room was a big disappointmentno safe and no mirror in the room except in the bathroom the cleaning staff manager knocks on all the doors starting at 845 so dont plan on sleeping in some issues with the elevators but on our second day some poor employee was tasked with riding the elevators all day to make certain they were working properly walk to universal because the hotel shuttle doesnt get you there that much faster this hotel is the closest one to the theme park and it appears they have taken advantage of this and have cut some corners way overpriced for the quality of the room;3
staff is friendly accommodating and efficient location next to lincoln center is convenient but closeby restaurants limited the decor of this hotel is dark depressing and strange the rooms are quite small there is no closet and storage is limited the bathroom is poorly designed especially the shower it has a halfglass barrier the other half open space you cant take a shower without nearly flooding the rest of the tiny bathroom flooring likely to loosen in the near future;3
i was here for a week and was quie nice place quite cheap to new york and really clean you have a metro station just few meters away and bar and restaurant close by few meters ago is the smoke jazz cafe one of the best place to enjoy a great jazz concert;3
stayed here for 4 nights good location with easy subway access nearby penn station made it an easy journey from newark airport we were able to get our room early which was great as wed had a long journey from london high resort fees are not justified by erratic wifi and 2 charge per item to leave your luggage rooms were very small and poky we had a double double and there was very little room left with 2 suitcases etc had to do the ironing in the bathroom as the ironing board would not fit in the bedroom although it being new york we didnt spend much time in the room the bathroom was small was a bit grubby although clean towels were provided daily the 247 diner was great for breakfast and late night snacks when needed so great location for seeing the sites but;3
well where to begin with this review upon arrival the staff were not welcoming at all we were not informed that the tv was not working we overheard one of the many guests complaining and put two and two together once we finally got to our room it smelt revolting even the halls smelled of wet carpet and mildew in our room the carpets were dirty and extremely dated it reminded badly of the hotels you see on csi for the murder scenes but all jokes aside it was terrible to add to our disappointment we had a bathroom you could hardly move in and no hot water the hotel was not helpful at all so i suggest if you are looking for a half decent hotel in nyc stay somewhere else;3
this is a real nice place to hold an event good for business and social occasions i went up to the rooftop lounge and had drinks with some friends the other night admittedly the view is not of central park but of midtown manhattan and you only see office buildings wine and alcoholic selections were provided and there was a good crowd on a warm night on the roof area lighting directions to the restrooms and elevators are hard to find especially when multiple parties and events are in full steam would i go back probably yes but not on the top of my list of favorite hangouts;3
nicely located just across from lincoln center near central park and columbus circle with subway access we spent 5 days in january hotel is clean and staff are nice some minor maintenance would be helpful rooms have nice views;3
my husband and i chose to stay at the empire hotel because of its superb location on the upper west side directly across the street from lincoln center we chose an upgraded room to get a better view what we didnt realize was there was not one drawer nor shelf in the room there was a small closet and that was the extent of the storage area we ended up moving to a standard room with a couple of drawers and not as good a view the gym was being renovated the sign read so it was closed i went back the next day and found it had been moved to the basement which required going down to the lobby and taking a specific elevator to the basement however the elevator i had been on was actually the one that went all the way down to the gym there is no coffee machine in the;3
it is a good hotel but errs in simple things that a four star should not miss in first day by mistake the reception front desk we waited for our bags in the room for more than one hour and we even had to seek not attended any of our specifications early check in overlooking the park dante late check out or a higher floor so we pay for an upgrade and take the corner suite in a highest room even getting stayed for 10 nights we didnt receive any of benefits the localization is very good the room is comfortable and also the bed the bathroom amenities are very simple a 3 star hotel and the bathroom has not box which makes you wet all chap while bathing the pool is small but very refreshing the rooftop is disabled ha 6 months but this was not mentioned;3
old fashioned building checked in early room small not updated recently but clean comfortable bed staff gave me choice to wait and get a larger room but i took first option window air conditioner worked well and not noisy staff very friendly and helpful no restaurant in hotel but one just half a block away gives discount for breakfast i stay here because a friend lives close by making the location excellent for me very close to local and express subway making it easy to get around town less than 15 minutes travel to 42nd st;3
decent location we found the staff to be listless and not very motivated to serve i hate wifi fees and coffee seriously just charge me a fair rate and dont try to layer on the extras wasnt unpleasant but would not stay her again;3
we stayed here for one night after a concert and the stay was just ok we stayed at a standard room with standard amenitiesthere was really nothing that knocked our socks off this is a good hotel to use if you are visiting universal studios because of its close proximity we would stay here again if we needed to;3
last week may08 we visited ny city and stayed at the woogo hotel tempo apartments location was just great half block away from subway station three blocks away from central park south overall our room studio was ok but most say that we booked for a studio with queen bed and had gotten a double one which made our staying harder when trying to get some rest after walking all day long the room size was ok for us it included a kitchenette and dvdcd stereo the bathroom was also ok but cleanliness not enough the floor has some marks on it that you could assume were from some time ago not been cleaned properly same as in the room so better not to be shoeless noise was a bad point too some guests were having a dog into their room so they left it alone on it;3
my husband and i decided to give this hotel a try during our weekend getaway to new york city and was disappointed with the quality of the hotel vs the price we paid for the hotel room the room was very small which wasnt as much of an issue but the quality of the room was not great the radiator did not keep the room heated very well and during the first evening i froze because the covers were very thin when i first went into the bathroom to shower i could not get the water to turn warm but after about 10 minutes if playing around with the water handle i was able to get it to warm up then i couldnt figured out how to start the actual shower which was a pain once i figured it out we would definitely not stay at this hotel again for the price they charge;3
pros location is fantastic close to lincoln center central park and columbus circle easy access to subways too the staff was very friendly and accommodating and the hotel itself was very well appointed cons we reserved and were provided a room with two double beds it was smallalmost painfully so the bathroom was so small that you had to actually step into the bathroom and shut the door before you sat on the toilet ice buckets maybe its the hallmark of a good hotel no filling of the ice bucket yourself but i found it a bit offputting rooftop pool this pool if you can even call it that doesnt have a view as touted the pool is sunken into a portion of the rooftop bar area and the skyline is largely obscured by a wall furthermore the;3
stayed here with 3 friends for 4 nights in one room with 2 double beds the room was very small as were the beds the toilet and bathroom were so outdated they may be back in vogue soon and also not very clean i voiced my opinion on expedia which is the company i booked the trip with whilst we were staying there and reception offered to move us to a larger room which was good until we went to reception to do this the receptionist said i will see what i can do for you as we are very full after a while she found us another room which to be honest was a little bit larger but not much and certainly was not the upgrade promised on a positive note the hotel is in fantastic location within a short walk of empire state macys and madison square garden the metro tube is just;3
i usually stay midtown however i found myself in the upper side which was delightful the rooms need to be updated but it has all of the amenities with an updated tv the hotel staff is very helpful and if you have any concerns they step up to the plate to resolve the issue if you arent planning on staying in your roomgive it a try because the location is nice;3
i was here for a seminar so i didnât choose the hotel big pluses comfortable rooms deco design pleasant and helpful staff negative itâs an awful neighborhood and taxis are hard to get since people leaving penn station grab them first the tick tock diner claims to be the largest diner in nyc itâs certainly the archetype;3
the wyndham new yorker provided a nice stay in the city front desk service requires a long wait especially during peak check inout times staff was friendly and helpful we were upgraded to a premium suite based on diamond status which was nice the room was clean spacious and had a nice view it even featured a private terrace although you could not get outside hotel location is pretty central with penn station across the street making all of manhattan a short subway ride away overall a nice option for a few days in the city especially if the price is reasonable;3
stayed here for three nights for a business trip positives great location wifi included in room rate room was kept clean and all the hotel staff i dealt with were very pleasant negatives typical nyc tiny rooms barely room to get around the bed and thatâs it old bathroom and fixtures drafty windows and noisy could hear showers turning on in other rooms and colleagues on other floors heard construction outside all night long i would opt for another hotel next time;3
stayed here for one night for my valentines we had finished watching wicked at the pantages and didnt wanna drive too far home late at night thus we used this groupon deal to stay one night parking if you wanna park in the hotels parking lot you have to pay 20day we end up parking on the street for free ridiculous how that hotel will charge for parking service checkingin was simple and the receptionist was nice and courteous though when it was checkout time we were running a little behind cause we slept in we received a call around 1115am reminding us checkout time is at 1100am would have been nice if they offered us a later checkout time or something instead of nicely saying get outta here grounds the hotel is not in the nicest;3
i would have to agree with the other reviews about this hotel we stayed here because we just couldnt pass up the price since all we would be doing was sleeping there the rooms are clean and warm just your basics though do not expect anymore than that we had a clean bed with cable television a dresser closet nightstand and a refrigerator the staff was extremley friendly and very helpful i never once had a problem with people using the bathroom when i needed it it was also cleaned every morning its not a gorgeous hotel but it works for the budget minded traveler i will stay here again on our next trip to ny;3
i was in nyc last week at the new yorker a wyndham hotel my credit card was asked for incidentals which i had no intention of using the other hotel facilities it was fine i was told the next day that a facility charge would come off my card i had paid for this upfront via my travel agent after speaking with two front desk staff it was confirmed that no charge was made to the card the issue was with the gentleman at the front desk he was dismissive and abrupt when i asked about this definately not good customer servise he said on a few occations next the room was generally clean but i did find hairs in the bath and sink which was disappointing the cleaning staff were polite and friendly i stayed at the the new yorker a wyndham hotel previously and found it;3
we stayed 4 nights here it was good being close to the underground so wasnt much of a walk with our bags not the friendliest or most enthusiastic or helpful reception staff was a good price for the 4 nights close to alot of things didnt get much sleep most of the nights due to noise from other guests constant door slamming and one lady deciding to pace the hall at 2am expected of a hostel though so if youre wanting sleep and very tired from a long flight not the best place also there was only one shower in the womans section that had hot water and the floor was constantly slippery by the toilets so wasnt the best;3
i spent 5 nights at the jane mostly due to the fact that the price was far lower than most hotels i could find and it wasnt a hostel the staff were friendly the location was quite good and a short walk to the subway and although the rooms were small i found it fairly comfortable the inhouse caferestaurant had some good food for breakfast but the staff didnt seem interested in acknowledging me even when i sat at the bar each time i went there so the service was quite poor overall good for the price;3
my wife and i 2627yo stayed here for 4 nights at the end of march 2017 for our honeymoon for the price we paid and that we were here for a special occasion i expected a lot more the hotel is situated in a good location as you are able to walk to times square and there are plenty of restaurants located in the immediate area it does however come with the traffic which is unavoidable so no complaints about that really we arrived on a monday night and were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff we requested a room with a view of the empire state building and they managed to accommodate this for us they even brought a handwritten card congratulating us on our recent wedding the room we were in was situated on the 28th floor and like i said had a view of the empire;3
location is fantastic if you are going to the lincoln center lobby and roof top bar are beautiful front desk is very friendly rooms need some serious updating we switched rooms twice because of filth the staff was very friendly when switching new room was ok housekeeping did not clean our room one of the days ownership really needs to step up and invest in their hotel roomsnew bedding etc paint etc;3
hotel is massive 37 floors its in a great location with easy access to macys empire state building and times square its clean but a bit dated 24 hour diner attached but no hotel restaurant also expected bar to be open all night to residents but it wasnt there are 3 desks in reception which is confusing and concierges were a bit pushy staff not unpleasant but not particularly nice either;3
the pros are the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the universal studios theme park great remodeled rooms very spacious friendly staff the cons parking is 28 pday no continental breakfast available only an expensive restaurant inside the hotel no magnification mirror to apply makeup so pack your own bathroom counter is small;3
hotel stay was 2 nights midprice range with a coupon code hotel lobby floors and room were clean attended an event in ballroom which had a weird 2 floor climb to reach a rest room staff were friendly and helpful cons were 1 room was tiny including bathroom small length tub and narrowshallow sink space around bed was no more than 2026 inches for movement 2 the elevators are slow wait times of 10 minutes easily;3
we attended a conference at lincoln center and the hotel is conveniently across the street its got a great little lobby bar and an even greater rooftop bar the rooms are tiny the checkout process was time consuming and it was the second year in a row our group stayedthere was no hot water and all they said at check out was were working on it wow;3
i stayed here for one night on nov 17th after finishing up a week cruise this hotel was a last minute choice and it was an ok choice the location was easy to find and once i got into the lobby my reservation wasnt ready yet so they told me to park my car in the back once i parked my car i sat in the lobby til my reservation was ready i had booked it from priceline an hour before there sitting i watched interesting guests blaming the hotel for their personal own shortcomings such as cell phone service and providing slippers my own opinion about the staff is decent but they will not put up with crazy requests i checked in a couple minutes later and went up to my room the room was decent with a queen size bed and a nice bathroom the decor was movie like and;3
hotel is in a great location near penn station and subway system ideal when you train into ny penn rooms vary in size from small to reasonable great gym but you do pay for it in your bill but worth it if you travel i stay here often mainly due to the value and location compared to other hotels;3
room was small for a king bed only window with light was in bathroom 1 window in bedroom held air conditioner the other was covered with window shade two side chairs were good no drawer space for clothes i paid an extra 25 to be on 13th floor but fail to see what extra value i received staff was friendly and helpful lobby is attractive vending machine for snacks would be nice;3
this hotel is in a brilliant location situated on the opposite corner to madison sq garden which was very handy and a very short walk to times square the room we were given has a lot to be desired i have shoe boxes bigger than the room we stayed in we didnt even have enough room to have a case out and manoeuvre around it the shower was ridiculous you could not control the temperature so you either froze or you scalded yourself so we then decided bathing was a better option but the bath was the size of a sink and you had to bend your legs to sit in it housekeeping was on point and we did receive clean towels daily and had our room made up the biggest bug bare of mine was the untold facility fee this was a no option fee that you pay upon check out they charge you;3
we flew into burbank to spend a day at universal studios for my husbands birthday we didnt want to rent a car so hired a private company to get us from and to the airport we stayed two nights here it was okay our room had a king bed and was fair sized bathroom was good sized furniture a bit old the elevators and restaurant were under construction there is a heated pool but we didnt use it the hotels food was expensive 13 for bagel and tea 28 for breakfast buffet but it was walking distance to universal studios if you have a car you can drive and get less expensive food or go to universal city next to universal studios where there are restaurants within walkingshuttle distance they also have a shuttle from the hotel to universal city for those;3
the room was clean the image shows 2 bedside lamps there were none the room amenities boasts tea and coffee making facilitioes there were none you can heat your drink if you have a cup in the microwave there is a kitchen on every floor there was no drain plug for basin or bath shower worked well tv was great hd channelsfridge was useful plenty of closetdrawer storage bed was comfortable no ac overall it was ok the area was pleasant residential lots of local shops subway is 710 mins walk;3
was disappointed with this hotel room was very basic poor lighting lifts breaking down all the time carpets smelly and bathroom tiny but to end on a positive note staff very helpful and great location would think about paying extra for different hotel in same location next time;3
my boyfriend and i booked this riad after reading all the amazing reviews on here and although the reviews about the impeccable service of the staff were not wrong we were slightly disappointed i feel like all the reviews focus solely on the service which covers up the cracks really yes the staff cant do enough for you however there has to be more to a holiday than service the main negatives were you really can feel quite isolated as its a nightmare to get to and from the riad first of all the walk which is like going through a maze takes around 15 minutes before you get to a road you cannot look lost otherwise one of the kids on the streets will pick you up and start leading you somewhere which you have to pay for the privilige of when you are in the hotel itself;3
i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in august with my wife and daughter i was a little apprehensive when i first arrived initial impression was not that favourable i have to say that the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel is clean and comfortable the room was very basic and quite small the aircon was a little noisy but given the weather i can get over that the tv reception was appalling it looked like it was on a signal splitter that wasnt working given the uk airport security situations and my wifes inherent fear of flying not being able to pick up all the news was not such a problem and anyway who needs tv in new york position was a little out from where we wanted to be but budget constraints limited flexibility anyway the subway service into and;3
hotel located in a fairly good convenient area plenty of restaurants shops etc in the vicinity absolutely safe to walkstroll in the night subway station 96th street just around the corner able to reach midtown manhattan within 10 minutes on the express train hotel staffs are friendly ever ready to assist with enqueriesinfos hotel room the one we had attached with shower had all the basic amenities extras like hair dryer iron ironing board user friendly safe as well as a coffee maschine comes in really handy comfortable bed with clean bed sheets and daily change of bath towels were a welcome there was also a tv an airconditioner the only downside is that room is freezing cold even though heater is at maximum due to non isolated windows carpet on;3
well located between times sq and central park this hotel has very small but clean nicely decorated and updated rooms with bath staff are friendly and responsive to requests the price was reasonable for nyc but breakfast isnt included parking across the street is usd 4050 per night and extra taxes also round up the cost unfortunately we had to call reception every day of our stay to request that varying deficiencies be corrected eg no towels no shampoosoap no internet and tv room not made up by our return at 445 pm the ac heating unit was absolutely required for air circulation but was so noisy that a decent nights sleep was impossible we thought much could be done to improve things;3
okay truth be told when i first arrived i considered finding another hotel the location is soso not some place you are going to want to walk around and the exterior looked kind of tired but its not far from los feliz which is very nice and near the vermont ave metro stop which is convenient i took the metro to hollywood and highland and it is safe fast and wellrun way better than dealing with the crazy traffic and lack of parking in that area this place looks more like a motel than a hotel i thought the hallways were kind of dark and i arrived an hour early to checkin time and was told to leave and come back really the bathroom has some cracked tiles and rusted metal parts and you wouldnt want to take a bath in the tubits clean but has that kind of;3
beware for specials they still total what the original price is location is great the staff is wonderful the hotel past the entry is very poorly decorated rundown tiny room 7502 nights a bathroom too small to change your mind in and a view of the courtyard which doesnt exist room 910 temp set for 78âº day which could not be changed enormous equipment noise with the window open for air stifling when closed i was told by phone that parking all in was 5524hrs no inout understood at check out we were told it was over 150 incl taxes do you remember the name of the person on the phone you spoke with last week i thought i did but that doesnt make it not true a typical evasive way to deal with this yes i travel a great deal globally;3
upon check in we were met with pretty unhappy staff nobody seemed very happy there was no offer of assistance to get the luggage to the room the door man who you would think would help you get a cab was not very helpful either every time in was faster to request another ride service rather than wait on him the room was just okay bathroom was extremely tiny i thought the rooms had a mini refrigerator in them but that was not the case i did call the front desk and they brought up a small one to keep in the room for a 20 charge the bed comfort was okay but the pillows they have are the really small ones instead of a couple regular size pillows there are like 6 half size pillows that were not very comfortable when taking a shower the water would only get hot;3
it s ok for the price but the rooms are pretty small and old fashioned plus theyâre very damaged especially the bathroom probably because they are missing fan but the location is prefect to me facing the nyc ballet at the corner of quiet upper west side and central park subway station just across the street;3
nice hotel but could do with being painted staff need be a bit more helpful asked for a kettle for my room but got a coffee machine instead after a day run out of pods for the machine so asked at the front desk girl that worked there said she would send someone up to how room but had to wait four hours later still no coffee pods so i was a little mad by now so i complained and got them at last;3
cant reach the shower head that is 7 feet above the tub tub had no shower curtain or sliding door water got the floor wet wifi didnt work i the room there was an additional charge for that the employees were excellent they shoul dget jobs at hotels that would appreciate them more;3
we made reservations with this hotel because my husband was having 2 procedures done at kaiser sunset which was a couple of blocks away we booked with a nonrefundable rate after we made the reservation we got a email from the hotel showing all of the extra charges like parking in their parking lot 27 tax a night we had a 7lb dog with us were told there was a 50 tax a night cleaning fee for her we got there after 3pm checked in went to waba got take out came back ate our food went to bed our little dog slept in her canvas crate was not out in the room the next morning my husband had his first appointment at 7am so we left at about 630am i told the front desk we didnt need housekeeping our dog was left in her crate the whole time we were;3
very promising and luxurous entrance hotel has a great location couldnt be better as it was just a few blocj away from times square walking distance though downside of the hotel is the very loud and old central airconditioning this installation is in need of a facelift its too loud and the installations in the rooms are due to be renewed urgently rooms are a bit dissappointing when compared to the entrance and the reception desk of the hotel no closet space and very small rooms and bathrooms for a 5 stars hotel the daily service in terms of new towels etc can be improved;3
good points the hotel looks onto central park and is located in a safe neighborhood with plenty of nearby amenities and transport links my room was clean and reasonably well decorated and equipped friendly and helpful staff excellent deli one minute away not so good points public areas of the hotel are on the shabby side rooms are small have no stand to put a suitcase on and no desk or chair hefty fee for internet acces bad point the noisiest heating system i have ever encountered i thought it was about to explode during the night conclusion ok for a short stay but only if you need to be in this part of town and can get a good rate;3
from my earlier review this was a conference for my hubby we stay a couple of days in san francisco than did a couple of days la stay at the hotel from 219222 near everything great location had more than bagels for breakfast only issue we had with this hotel was no air it was in the 80s and we had a fan when my husband called the front desk they told him to eave his window open we did not gave a window we had a balcony that was connected to a row of balconies with no screen how were u suppose to leave it open while u slept would i stay here again probably not i need my air condition;3
great location close to lincoln center fordham university the hotel is in need of updating one thing i cant understand is that they which to paper cups in the room from very nice glass glasses the have a mini bar stocked and bottles of wine water does the hotel think that there customer with to share a cocktail in paper cups when asked my concerns were addressed quickly;3
astor is a hotel very simple no breakfast no lunch or dinner but your location that is really important front of the central park near by subway station it really does what it has created for i recommend it for everyone who is looking for a simple hotel;3
the hours scouring the net for reasonable accommodation in nyc i wont get back with a heavy heart i reluctantly plumped for this hotel as being the best of a bad bunch the other options were either too awkward location wise or ridiculously expensive taking the stilltoohigh costs out of the equation for now the hotel is tired but i found the staff and the room to be adequate all the staff i had contact with were courteous and helpful although i didnt have any pressing issues to test that with and the room sizeconditioncleanliness ok for the obvious high turnover of occupants the location of the hotel was pretty darned good as others have said several subways close by taking you mainline into the very centre in just a couple of stops central park is;3
a great location and huge rooms but the place needs a makeover desperately furniture is worn and torn and lamps in room faulty reception staff generally need a lesson in friendliness and customer service;3
we stayed here after arriving in nyc from penn station so location was great however the check in took about 30 mins only two staff on and even though there was a big queue no more more staff were allocated to the reception it was 2330 and we were tired so not a good start the room was very small even by new york standards so good job we were only staying one night if you stay here you will need ear plugs for the street noise there is a 24 hour diner on site as well as an italian restaurant we had breakfast in the diner which was good and reasonable check out was also slow with a queue so the concierge ended up checking me out i was looking forward to staying in this iconic hotel but felt a bit disappointed by the experience;3
placed room service order and wrong food was brought called rs and they started someone would call us after 15 min no phone call we called back down and was told only 1 person was working room service the gal at he front desk had no solutions and stayed it was not her responsibility such a shame such poor customer service at a hilton property;3
our stay at this hotel was nothing of a surprise that we had the 1st time which caused alot more disappointed this go around they neglected to pay attention to the little things that made a difference;3
its a nice hotel not too much going on close to universal studios we stayed here for 3 nights in jan its an ok hotel the rooms are good size the service is welcoming and warm but its not gonna set the world a blaze that said its very good value for money we arrived in the morning with a hire car from lax the concierge took care of the car and unloaded our bags its was done politely and professionally;3
if youre looking for cheap accomodation in new york this is it it is very close to central park and the 123 subway line that runs all the way downtown is it a nice romantic cosy hotel not whatsoever the room smelled of smoke and the carpet was stained the linen provided was ok but the shared bathroom definitely needs some work done we saw many bussiness people walking to their room and walking straight to the front desk asking for an upgrade or a refund you will not get one dont even try the hotel is good for a maximum of a two night stay if you wanna stay longer in ny spend a little bit more we only needed a bed and a shower;3
its hard to get a manhattan hotel but at 200 per night i guess we were fortunate being close to the subway was convenient we had a renovated room which although small was comfortable no restaurant on the premises but they have a deal with the europan cafe just across the road for breakfast and the manhattan diner just around the corner had an extensive menu professional staff were helpful i would try brooklyn next time;3
location is very good because it is close to the tube station and there is nice part of london all around with some great english pubs restaurants and shops on the other hand the hostel itself is not very comfortable the rooms kitchen bathroom were rather clean but toilets havent flush water very good and showers are poor rather clean but uncomfortable to use the furniture in rooms was very minimalistic there was only one chair for twoperson room the bedclothes were clean but old etc although it is worth of notice that there was refrigerator in our room the common kitchen was clean as wall but also not very nice no table or chairs also wifi needs a comment wifi is not included in price and it is not very fast it is rather peculiar considering that;3
the hotel is located within a few blocks of lax the interior was recently renovated and looks spiffy clean comfortable no noise problems drawbacks parking is several blocks from the hotel walking can be a pain at evening rush hour there is usually one front desk clerk making for prolonged checkin times;3
we shockingly for us had to pay for parking 15 this second time staying at a hotel in la the website does mention this actually we learnt after it was too late the front desk just did what they had to do without a smile not rude but not welcoming either the room was clean the bed comfortable the bathroom clean with a nice shower the room opened into a courtyard in the back which was nice nice location for hollywood breakfast was included;3
stayed at this hotel because there were no marriotts near by that were available i figured hey this could be interesting new experience the hotel was a bit pricey for the service but it was a nice place great food options and the location is great for universal;3
booked a double bed room room was very tiny and bathroom sink had no place to put anything very inconvenient could be cleaner;3
tried to charge 5 for cork screw by room service which was not in room sent me down to bar which did not have extra cork screws after complaining to front desk i was given a free cork screw but what a hassle housekeeping needs more customer service training spent over 400 and they want to charge me 5 for a cork screw;3
its a cute hotel with a great bar its pretty inexpensive but its much older and theres no amenities im a clean freak and didnt find it up to par but my standards may be a bit higher than most if youre trying to do ny on the cheap this place will work its in the meatpacking district so location is good;3
a bit disappointed with the hotel this time stayed 6 years ago with my husband and had a fantastic room was really spacious and clean unfortunately not so this time we were on floor 20 and felt like we were in a converted storage room 2 double beds with barely enough room to move around extremely dated compared to last timelooked like the room hadnât been decorated in years pokey bathroom with a bath you couldnât possibly lay down in and a shower that if you were taller than 5ft had to bend over backwards to wash your hair grubby skirting boards and paint peeling off the walls floor never got hoovered in the time we were there overall canât say iâd recommend this hotel and if we visit new york again think we will stay elsewhere;3
the rooms are quite dark our room was to the courtyard and there it was very very noisy airing was actually hardly possible the handling of the shower we actually did not really understand until today could really score the two rooftop bars the presentation was very inviting and the look just great;3
given the location the hotel price was reasonable compared to others walking distance to central park and times square as well as many restaurants etc the only frustrating part of my experience was the door banging housekeepers first thing in the morning it was ridiculous the banging and slamming of doors was a constant all morning long;3
staying at the jane hotel feels like youve been transported back to the twenties the reception and elevator look like something right of the tower of terror dont worry it doesnt drop and the rooms are made to look like youre staying on a ship this boutique hotel is conveniently located near the meatpacking district and the hudson river its a great hotel for solo travellers the ac isnt very strong so the rooms are very hotel some of the hotel staff are more friendly and helpful than the others i would stay again;3
stayed in this hotel last year for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon as they were offering a free night and so our travel agent was able to get us this 4 for the same price as 3 we had seen the location was great really close to times square and central park but the room was teeny tiny looked loads bigger in the pictures and it backed onto the air conditioning units or at least thats what they looked like cant say the rooms were overly cool the noise from the upstairs bar carried a long way and we heard people coming and going all night but we were near the lifts so perhaps that is why the concierge wasnt great giving us information about the subway ticketing system that was over a year out of date but that said if you are just looking for somewhere to rest;3
very rude staff very slow internet room was ok but did not have the fridge and the shower had this really weird button to switch it on and and the curtain stays wet did not even notice it was my birthday but asked for my id;3
we stayed here for 5 nights when we arrived we where asked if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra 200 we did this and arrived to a small room with a very small bathroom which can be expected in new york anyway and no space for a family of 5 we went back to reception eventually the member of staff agreed to give us our original room back but we where warned it would be smaller with less of a view we had no view in the âupgradedâ room to arrive to our original room with a much better view 2 bathrooms and 2 separate rooms for the family of 5 to stay in perhaps there was a mix up with the rooms however when this was settled we had a lovely stay rooms where kept clean and towels changed for us when needed the staff located around the hotel where all friendly;3
if you can afford a better hotel please do i booked wyndham because it was rated a 4 star and the price was relatively lower there was smell of weed on my floor which was an executive floor requested for a floor change though was upgraded to a bigger room with a direct view of the empire state building however the experience with the smell of weed left a bad taste;3
service was pretty good the elevator and rooms were tiny and there was an extra bed that we didnt need in the room taking up space the beds were rather uncomfortable but we didnt have much trouble sleepingthe air conditioner worked well though and it was a good price;3
picked this hotel because of its proximity to universal studios staff was friendly and efficient room was clean and comfortable itâs very close to universal studios and self parking is a fee but is easy to do 2 issues the walk to universal studios wasnât as efficient as it could be you have to cross 2 streets to get to the same place they should put a sidewalk in to eliminate one of the street crossing cars go fast and donât pay attention to cross walks go figure second problem is the same problem i always have with the hilton and only the hilton brands it seems they never seem to clean my room until after 4 pm and i get their line they have until 5 but geez i always seem to be last on the list itâs insane and hilton needs to hire more people or;3
this hotel is situated very close to the empire state building and everywhere is very accessible the rooms are a reasonable size and if you want more space there is the option to upgrade the staff were all helpful and friendly and everywhere was clean sometimes the lifts got very busy at peak times i was sad that they donât cater for gluten free and as a coeliac it was like going back in time to how the uk used to be we were given breakfast vouchers which were no use to myself or my daughter because there was no pastries that were gluten free we tried the restaurant one day as my daughter is vegan and again we really struggled she lived on salad and chips and the breakfast i had was slapped onto the plate it cost about â£25 the hotel has 80 floors and the view across the;3
travelled with my 8yr old on her first trip to london to this premier inn its a great location and we were fortunate to have a view of the london eye from our room our room itself was ok the bathroom needed a deep clean loads of marks on the walls lots of dust on the skirting and there was a continual foul smell in there which escaped to the bedroom when opening the door we stayed in room 640 and was woken both mornings 5am by the flushing of the next doors toilet not the norm im sure but the corridor was also noisy with guests returning again 5am and doors slamming the breakfast was great as usual and we ate there 1 night again fine but having stayed in the blackfriars one in may i think this is a better option even though its 12miles away this is the;3
lovely hotel who cannot seem to get their room temperatures under control this is the second stay at this hotel due to the location first time was in the summer and very hot in new york the hotel rooms were extremely hot and air conditioner could not keep up with the temp in the room now stayed in march when cool outside and the hotel room was again very hot read 80 degrees entire stay maintenance turned off the heater in the room and the temperature never changed time for the hotel to invest a little in the heating and cooling system;3
i am currently staying here i just drove over hear from the hilton in carlsbad and although they are both hiltons the people here in universal city are frazzled tired a bit argumentative even when asking for something off the menu they will argue with you about taking the buffet instead the elevators are in need of repair only 1 or 2 work and constantly full the remotes for the tvs are bad as you need to be about 12 inches away from the rv to do anything the system is also crappy as you cant easily stop the porn selection from coming up and when you travel with kids thats not a good thing overall a good looking hotel but inside it has a lot of notable downsides;3
room was ok shower was hard to figure when first arrived but was fine once i figured it outthey price was good but the fact that i had to go out to eat breakfast was a disappointment i feel for 100 plus your should at least receive a lite breakfast;3
im not a complainer in general and have stayed in all kinds of places in all parts of the world mostly i just sleep in a hotel and dont spent any time there that being said my room which was under construction smelly primer on one wall holes everywhere and having old blood stains on my blanket was so cold and they couldnt change that that they gave me 2 more blankets which i was totally fine with by the way i slept safe and sound all amenities in the room besides the airconditioning worked perfectly fine best part the staff is extremely nice and helpful front desk as well as anyone else on top of it the breakfast is well prepared and the friendly staff downstairs in the restaurant made me smile every morning thanks hugo and juan and lovely;3
cons a little old and definitely a little tired rooms are small and thereâs no minibar pros reasonably priced for nyc clean excellent service excellent location for us taking the amtrak and arriving at penn station rooms are small but serviceable and thereâs certainly enough room bottom line is the next time i come back on the train iâll stay here again;3
dont expect luxury its good for one night or two with friendly staff my room was small but clean with bathroom and safety box and lcd located in china town near grand station but the internet was slow not bad for the money and for one night stay its ok;3
booked an executive room with 2 double beds for 2700 for 7 nights was lucky enough to get a killer view of the empire state building from my room but oh what a price to pay for it location is amazing right opp penn station a block from macyâs in one direction 23 blocks from neiman marcus in another direction 700 mts from empire state 8 min walking for bus tours great places to eat nearby convenience stores starbucks 24 hour mcdonalds opp the hotel etc etc however for the steep price one would expect at least a teacoffee maker in the room maybe a complimentary fruit basket or cookies or at least the usual 2 bottles of water everyday but alas nothing of the sort expect a basic room executive rooms are decent sized vs a regular room saw one from inside;3
just returned from 2 nights at the morningside the room was very clean we had a triple room one double bed and one single with private bath the room had a clean working refrigerator and a window which opened the hotel staff were helpful and polite we were not able to get extra pillows one was provided per person although the shower water was not cold it was never hot enough for us the room lock was keyed and no dead bolts chains or other security features were provided we added a chair next to the door at night all in all we were very pleased with the morningside our room cost 88 per night we were able to spend more money in nyc with the money we saved by staying in this hotel dont stay here if you want luxury if you want a back to basic place to lay;3
we stayed the empire from sunday 21st until friday 27th normally until saturday 28th but we got a earlier flight because of the coming hurricane general feeling about the hotel nice hotel nice rooms very friendly and helpfull staff the bathroom is indeed small but was ok with us the shower gave us some problems we had to phone maintaince to get water out of it seemes that we had to put the handles on the right place to have a decent showera manual for the shower is maybe a good idea the noise in the room 705 at night from the ac ventilators in the building next door was very loud at night we had to sleep with earplugs the ac in the room was also very noisy so we didnt use it the roofpoolbar was very pleasant to sit and enyoing the sun but 33;3
we stayed here for the obvious reason the location the rooms appearance of the room was nice but upon further inspection it seemed dirty and there was a weird smell the ac did not work at night almost like they turned it off i had to turn it down to 58 to sleep semi comfortable but it was still hot making it miserable at night;3
nice property the first room that i checked into was not only very small but very old although it seemed clean it was very worn down and it had the feel of a cheap motel the front desk clerk changed my room and was very apologetic the new room that i received was still small but it had a much better feel and smelled 10 times better;3
first of all the staff here are just amazing we were worried due to the lack of email responses however apon arrival we had a great south african lady help us out with no surprise due to the lack of emails our booking had been messed up but she was able to fix the solution which doesnt happen a lot weve noticed even all the maids are lovely and helpful transport good heaps of local train stations at 225 per trip locations its cheap so ok but further south downtown was nicer staff fantastic rooms preferably get the upgraded rooms with ensuits alot better we stayed in both wifi doesnt actually reach your room you have to sit on the floor in the lobby 2nd floor do not stay on this floor everyone shares a bathroom and forgets that the;3
the hotel is dated and need to be totally renovated the hotel has massive potential some one at the top level administration needs to wake up and spend some of that money they have made over the years from it;3
the room had a very crammed bathroom there were no glasses in the room for water the comforter cover was torn the room service didnât come in until 330 the end felt a little too hard and could be softer the comforter was not warm enough and the rooms could benefit from more than one overall a number it misses;3
check in was easy with very friendly and welcoming staff they also helped with the parking there is a secure car park at rear costs 27 a day our room felt small compared to other hotels we had stayed in and the decor was tired there was very little space for our suitcases and hanging space for clothes was a rail over a sideboard and the ironing board and iron were stored in the space the bathroom was also small we overlooked a small courtyard which is very pleasant they advertised a welcome drink between 57 but this never materialised the two nights we stayed the breakfast was okay reasonable choice and the chef on duty works really really hard cooking fresh omelottes and waffles there are several places to eat within easy walking distance theres a wendys;3
id recommend the jane for two types of users first anyone who cant face a late night train ride back to long island jersey upstate or connecticut after a night out and wants somewhere to crash for one night second people who understand about travelling on a budget on a short stay the jane is located in a very nice area next to the hudson surrounded by the whitney high line meat packing district pier 51 park and greenwich village there are hundreds of nice cafes bars restaurants and independent stores within 10 minutes although jane st is residential the rooms are tiny about the size of a walk in wardrobe or a queen size bed their design is genius and in fact you get an amazing amount of storage space plus a mirror which makes the room seem twice as;3
30 mins to check in because 1 staff member on at the time auto check in machines not switched on this meant we missed our london eye time staff were rude beer was awful plus side beds are comfy and clean breakfast was edible great location for attractions and 2 min walk from waterloo underground;3
we had a room that overlooked an outdoor bar patio it was only an issue that we were jet lagged and wanted to nap during happy hour thought the rooms lighting could be better felt a little dark also first night bedding smelled like the air fresheners one hangs in cars and the second night it smelled like another disinfectant butthe staff was incredibly friendly even though they forgot to text me that our room was ready and i loved the free coffee in the morning;3
we stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and it was not as bad as everyone made out i read the reviews before we arrived so i suppose it prepared me for the worst but i was pleasantly surprised we got clean bedding and towels every day and had hot running water day and night the staff are friendly and are willing to help with any questions you might have the deli on the corner was an added bonus and again they were very friendly bit of advice if you are looking to buy rose wine go to a liquor store about 4 streets up as its alot cheaper like a previous review said there are alot of good restaurants near the liquor store the indian was superb as was a place called henrys if you are into jazz there is a place called smoke which has live jazz plus you get dinner for;3
this was my first stay at the hilton uc the lobby areas and support spaces are clean fresh and modern the room was large and i had a decent view to the east the restaurant is staffed by welltrained friendly and sincere individuals who truly make you feel welcome the breakfast buffet is one of the largest ive ever experienced and everything appeared fresh overall i felt quite comfortable safe and somewhat pampered here ill definitely stay again my only disappointment the room is not as fresh as the lobbies and other public spaces the bathroom sink had a hairline crack in it and the tub was stained and a bit gritty these werent dealkillers by any means but its clear that some work needs to be to freshen up the rooms an interesting observation;3
the hotel is ok the rooms are clean and fine i was disappointed that there was no coffee making facilities that there is in every other ny hotel its perfectly located for macys madison square garden etc unfortunately the area has lots and lots of homeless people as the area has a high foot fall it can be a little intimidating as a girl on your own staff were friendly and lots of places to eat near by 7 min walk from macys so its perfect for shopping;3
the hotel is in the best possible location right next to madison square garden and a metro entrance which makes moving around very easy we even walked to central park which was only 30 minutes away on foot the room was quite small though and the bed and pillows had seen better days some of the staff were very nice and helpful but others could really improve their manners with guests it was also freezing cold in the lobby especially and corridors caught a cold from coming to the august heat in the street into the hotel;3
first impressions were staff were not too friendly place seemed clean and modern though seemed to be recently revamped but not quite finished the room was nice and clean clean bed linen and towels provided no mirror in rooms and bathroomstoilets seemed to be unisex there was a fridge in the room which was noisy but i turned it off one wardrobe with hangers and a completley broken chest of drawers which confused me just throw it out maybe as there was a shelf in the wardrobesaying this i was impressed at the cheapness very central to tube and bus routes shopping bars etc down a nice residential street as i literally needed to get my head down for a couple of hours it was perfect especially as there is no curfew and i left at five in the morning there was 24 hour;3
my wife and i stayed at the ramada inn for 5 days in late september 2006 because we wanted a good location for easy access to disneyland and universal studios the surrounding area was a nightmare due to three main factors 1 no closeby restaurants that were clean 2 the poverty surrounding the hotel and 3 loud car noises from races and burnouts although the physical location was very good everything else was ok to worrying the breakfast was very very average cutlery was grubby too the service was slow and parking very expensive 12us per day including any toursactivities they offered us we needed to do everything from booking disneyland universal and la tours on our own to ensure we got it at a reasonable price good price and distance from attractions but thats;3
just back from new york stayed at the empire hotel having read good bad we took a chance mainly for location close to central park easy walking distance to times sq etc the room was adequate and we were on the 3rd floor after settling in we found the drinks in the mini bar overpriced also the small snacks and other items in the room also overpriced the hotel is dated in need of a major decor change the door to the bathroom was cracked tiles in the shower are starting to come away from the wall the main ceiling shower needed to be descaled as it only dribbled out we used the wall one this was ok these are minor as we used it more of a base it was always cleaned to a high standard and the bed made up every day not 4 star we have stayed in worse hotels so if you are looking;3
i booked empire hotel because of how it looked the location and the link to gossip girl we stayed over christmas and new year and travelled from glasgow in scotland uk as a couple in our late 20s i was so excited about staying in chuck bass hotel this is an honest review location excellent thanks to chris at reception on our first day he gave me a map and told us the nearest subway 5mins away where we could travel to anywhere we needed to go right beside the lincoln centre near to cafes bars delis and restaurants two or three min walk to central park and 10 minute walk to times square perfect location decor atmosphere a lot to be desired no christmas decorations up no christmas cheer door menbellmen were not dressed smart like other hotels i asked a;3
nice hotel with a nice location at central park but slightly out of the big picture pleasant door and reception staff rooms clean and tidy worthwhile staying here if you dont mind a 10 to 15 minute subway ride into times square area would eat somewhere before returning to hotel area as for us we couldnt find much to eat in the area that suited only other negative was on a sunday it was a struggle to get a subway back to hotel limited service;3
rooms are clean staff is friendly stayed here before as its in our preferred neighborhood walls are thin and not all power plugs worked but for the price it is hard to find a better deal in manhattan;3
when i checked in i was told that my room was much bigger than id originally reserved and had an empire state view much bigger seems to be a little deceptive since the room was very cramped feeling right down to the half sized desk where you could only pull the chair up to the end there were narrow paths around the beds and that was the only open space in the room the dresserdesk combo was metal framed and looked pretty industrial old not chic the bathroom was also small and was tiled in 4 inch square tile like that used in the 60s i wonder what color it originally was because it was painted white very surprised to see that a hotel renovated the bathrooms by painting over the old ceramic tile worse yet no coffee in the room i suppose there wasnt much room;3
booked this hotel at the last minute the good location is great opposite madison square garden beautiful old art deco building proffesional attaentive staff very clean beds bathroom etc very good value i paid 125 for the night free wifi and free long distance calling including international the bad room was tiny 150sqft hotel is old and needs a makeover hallways need new paint and carpet bathrooms work but have very old fittings my pet peeve most hotels toda have either a coffee maker in your room or complimentary coffee in the lobby this hotel had neithe i want my coffee;3
staff is excellent ive stayed here 5 times the last year i have family that live just around the corner so its convenient i have come to the conclusion it totally depends on what room you get pent house and premier rooms are great but after that its a real crap shoot the last one was the worst smoked cover curtains and smell a piece of the crown molding was missing and there were at least 10 squished cockroaches where the crown should have been room 1007 no remote for tv book premier if you can;3
cons 30th floor room that was so small one of us had to sit on the bed while the other got ready tiny 4ft 6 bed that we could bearly roll over without knocking each other out of bed should be a single person room only cant believe they can market it as a double customer service average to blasã© but they still expected major tips pros decent location for all midtown sights modern refurbished rooms average price;3
the location of this hotel is good and we had fantastic views from our room due to problems we has experienced with unauthorised money being taken from our account before our arrival we had been given a free upgrade to a suite which was very spacious and clean thought the furnishings were very shabby the food we had during our stay through room service was tasty and good value for a hotel the breakfast buffet was disappointing items were constantly missing food was cold and we were sat in what felt like a meeting room with no atmosphere there were constant problems with the lifts in the hotel the average wait time was 15 minutes as half of them were not working this became very frustrating as we were on the 23rd floor so had little option but to use them what really;3
we stayed here for five nights in room 4003 which is a one bedroom queen suite on the top 40th floor we chose the wyndham as it was cheaper than some other options pros great location couple of blocks from the empire state and times square and in walking distance of central park and the restaurants on 9th avenue great view of downtown and the freedom tower from our room great adjoining diner tick tock which is open 24 hours and provides does room service cons slowest liftselevators in the world limited hotel staff on hand dont expect anyone to help to get your bags from the kerb to your room rooms are quite old but functional limited in room facilities no kettle and just a random coffee machine which we didnt use would stay again;3
very disapointed the room was to small it very comfortable bath room very little space no wif to used it must be at the recieption not very prive to talk bar is not open at all times breckfast everyday you eat the same thing i could nt have lunch at this hotel nerver saw want they propose its like no resturant at all;3
we had a single room with queen bed my overall opinion was the room was extremely small barely large enough for two people our room overlooked lincoln center which was nice room was clean but i considered it a bit dated service was fine i guess i was just expecting a bit more wifi was not included in the room;3
my family and i stayed here for 2 nights so that the kids could meet the minions in univesal it was an average hilton nothing exciting the safe didnt work and spent the whole of the first night we were there beeping at us but once they found the security man it was rectified quickly there were 5 of us in the room and only 2 bottles of water were left and for some reason these werent replenished the next day youd think the amount youre paying they could give you another bottle the breakfast was an utter rip off the a la carte childs menu was an insult 9 for the tinniest piece of scrambled egg with half a strawberry we went without on the second day we asked for an allergy menu legally obliged to be provided in the uk or if they had any gluten free substitutes;3
this is a really nice hostel with a convienient little cafe laundry and common room in the hostel however not without its problems 1 wifi is terrible and only 2 out of 6 computers worked 2 satillite tv was average limited channels no remote 3 mornings were horrible because the walls are thin and the hallways echo so everyday i was woken by loud cleaners and customers and banging doors 4 beds are very short so my partners feet hung off the bed 5 cash payments only is extremely aannoying for travellers but seems to be the way it is all over europe;3
i booked this last minute and expected to pay a premium because of the time of year nyc marathon sold out msg 2 nights and location what i didnt expect was a 1980s room it was not an updated retro look which i have seen in some hotels the entire room need to be updated the sleeping area seemed as if there were certain updates although the bathroom was an embarrassment paint was literally pealing off the wall mold in the grout lines a shower head that had the pressure of a fire hose the valves squeaked as you turned them on and off i could clearly hear the other ones in the adjoining rooms the toilet seemed to be one you would find in a locker room and the water never got hot i stood at the front desk for 5 minutes until a receptionist showed up and when i;3
we stayed at this hotel in jan 12 service was good but rooms slighty smaller than average and had issue with the smelly toilet and constant sound of garbage collecting was unbearable apart from that great location close to central park and ballet theatre;3
1 room there are no illusions that the room is small there were not really any surprises furnishings were fine clean my ac was noisy but powerful one tip is to remove the rod attached to your keys for the electicity so you are able to run the ac when you are out in the day to enable you to not run it at night 2 shared bathrooms overall good clean were not busy sometimes pools of water in front of the showers but not a major problem with the slippers provided on my last morning someone had pooed in one of the showers which was horrible i think this was a freak incident though and i saw it being thoroughly cleaned afterwards 3 staff fantastic reception were incredibly helpful quite busy but willing to make time to go out of their way to help you bell;3
great hotel good location friendly staff but way too small a room i couldnât move around not to talk of play around with the mrs and i recall asking for a big room not very happy the only bonus is that the hotel is right in the middle of everything and just a walking distance to time square;3
perfect value for money in upper west side manhattan though closer to harlem the onle serious drawback they failed to find my booking made through budgetplacescom and we spent the first night in the available room it was of higher category though in the morning we were transferred to the booked room thanks a lot it was available as a lady at the reception was not sure it would be tidy linen and towels no smell relatively tidy bathrooms as good as it gets for 80 per night for a double with shared bathroom;3
rooms can be small but when i had a couple of minor issues they moved me to a nicer room right away 24hour diner isnât fancy and i would skip the âcoffeeâ but sure is quick convenient right on site or mcdonalds is literally across the street good location by madison square gardens penn station and would stay there again;3
i stayed in the empire hotel 7 nights during my business trip to ny in general i think it is a good hotel centrally located offering average quality for the price it was much better cleaner and fancy than other hotels that i stayed in ny the hotel is very well located close to the columbus circle and central park and just in front of the lincoln center it was easy to reach metro and commute through entire manhattan the hotel is very busy and there are lots of people coming and going in the evenings lots of guests are coming to the top floor bar which sometimes makes it difficult to use the elevators or ask receptionist for help as for the rooms mine was rather comfortable with two large beds it was clean bathroom small but functional beds were comfortable;3
the room of this hotel had the smallest bathroom i have ever seen in a hotel for an average size or bigger only one person can fit at a time you can only use toilet paper if the door is shut the room could have used an update several items were in bad shape but the thing that really bothered me was how they were so miserly no free wifi plus they have keurig in the rooms but to use one cup it was 3 that was a first they could create a better feeling with their guests if they at least provided a free keurig the bar and lobby were very nice and of course its right next to lincoln center all in all i would not choose to return;3
had 4 days in new york and couldnât fault the location of the hotel as previous reviews have said the extra â£100 âservice chargeâ is just a stealth revenue uplift for the hotel you get nothing for it not even tea and coffee facilities in the room check in team tried to sell and upgrade before weâd even seen our allocated room definitely recommend you check your allocated room before agreeing to any upgrade cost would advise against eating in tick tock the food is over priced and poor forego the convenience factor and venture out a block or two room was ok tired and bathroom âsweatedâ with ceiling dropping water after anyone had a shower the key selling point is the location;3
i picked this hotel specifically for its location near a niece and nephew we were visiting it is a nicely kept very retro hotel with historic appeal the staff are very nice and accommodating there is secured gated parking and there is a very safe feeling at the hotel the rooms are very small and poorly lighted the beds are extremely firm and pillows are small breakfast included in a basement restaurant think embassy suites type breakfast but a bit more limited selection i ended up not using the tv as it spent most of the time in a no signal mode it is convenient to hollywood and the studios etc close to childrens hospital overall a decent place with historic value in need of some painting in halls and maybe an upgrade of furniture glad i;3
elevators aside convenient if you are an operagoermy room was acceptable size for nyc and not so much for the priceelevator waiting was long especially on saturday rush hours and too dimmed in one and dashboard lights were off in anotherlooked like maintanence was not a priority;3
hotel positives location comfy bed fresh linen and towels daily decent size double room air con good safe negatives the hotel is majority student accommodation so the lifts are a nightmare so busy and loud noise busy lifts shower boiling or freezing no in between really old decor broken plug on bath 300 dollar deposit for 7 day stay;3
when we booked this hotel over a year ago we booked an empire state building view room we knew this wasnât guaranteed but after emailing the hotel prior to our arrival explaining that we were coming to celebrate my mumâs special birthday i felt sure our booking request would be honoured fast forward to check in yesterday and we were told the room weâd reserved wasnât available however they had âupgradedâ is to a suite with two bathrooms at no extra cost and waived the city tax they told us our room would be available at about 430pm even though check in is from 4pm and that they would text or call us when it was ready we went to leave our bags 10 bags as there were 5 of us travelling and found there is a 5 per bag charge my husband combined that he wouldnât pay;3
positives for a family outweigh the negatives positives location perfect base for exploring nyc family rooms all 6 of us could stay together in the family suite price unbelievably good price we paid around â£1550 for 6 nights by nyc standards this is a great deal decent views of nyc the house keeping staff were very helpful negatives hotel rooms are very dated and quite noisy in so much as you can hear every conversation outside your room the room and lobby outside the room was scruffy but beds were comfortable and clean rooms are made up every day and staff are nice overall great value and perfect for a family of 6 i would stay here again if going with the family;3
the interior architecture is very dark the lights hardly help we switched from our room into a junior suite because we did not even have a dresser in this room to hold underwear or so it was not possible either to work on the writing desk the junior suite was much better but still dark and hard to do some writing work in besides we did not have internet access in this suite although we stayed there for one week and asked several times for it;3
a historical and old hotel with the standard charm of the 1930s and the hallways will instantly remind you of the shining we stayed on the 25th floor rooms were considerably larger than expected and clearly requiring substantial maintenance comfortable and clean nonetheless bathtub was shallow but water pressure and shower head was excellent taps are old so even the smallest nudge will either scald or freeze you pick the setting and do not touch the taps lol checkinout was fast and easy and the staff at that desk on the right as you enter were pleasant and helpful the cleaning staff were very nice and rooms were cleaned daily location is good do not go to the mcdonalds across the street unless you are comfortable with individuals who have untreated;3
beautiful architecture quaint practice of giving guests their own robes and slippers for the shared bathrooms yes shared baths unless you opt for the higher priced rooms ive lived in all kinds of situations so this is usually not a problem but people were not cleaning up after themselves and staff was not thorough with bathshower cleanup doors close automatically so there was a bit of standing water every time i went to shower the toilets are fine the staff was friendly and courteous the housekeepers were nice as well but the showers need more thorough inspections debris was stuck behind the doors and remained there throughout my stay i was in nyc on business and was also not too pleased that the restaurant turns into a nightclub at night and there are a lot of;3
a good hotel which could be a lot better with a few simple touches the service was great and the hotel is clean and wellkept but as of september 2016 anyway there is no bar service in the evening nor any evening restaurant service the hotel has a lovely interior courtyard bar but its effectively wasted since you cant get a drink apparently this was due to staff shortages but how hard can it really be to find a barman in la also there are some nice shaded terraces but these are offlimits in the evenings again when youd most want to use them of course we only found out these things long after wed checked in recommend you check directly with the hotel as to what amenities are available before booking service helpful and informative rooms nice;3
great place great staff great food and nice location however was kept up all night one night with club vibration and noise level dont stay on 10th floor food at eds chowder house was really good;3
they charged extra for everything even the kuerig coffee that was in the room the room was clean but really beat up the room was very warm in march so we had to run the ac unit was so loud that it was difficult to sleep on the very hard bed no ice makers had to order from room service when they remembered to bring it the location was awesome but that was about it;3
good points well located on a subway line central park opposite room for improvement dated rooms no water or teacoffee making facility in the room no free wifi had to purchase 1024 hrs per device;3
my inflight magazine had a review of this hotel that made it sound like the hot spot of nyc it is in a good area with lots of restaurant options and small shops and the subway is about 4 blocks away the rooms are interesting it is all about conserving energy which i like and it was comfortable but the single bed is quite small and stiff we did not get our own bathroom i dont know if that is an option but the shared bathrooms were clean and rarely busy my main problem was the smell in the hall way and the noise in the middle of the night there was a terrible smell all throughout the hallway it made me gag each and every time i forgot to hold my breath while walking to or out of my room i never habituated to the smell however when i entered my room i;3
the empire hotel is in a good location to get to a lot of the attractions central park a short walk away most attractions like the museum times square you can get to on foot breakfast diners like flames a short walk with good old american breakfasts on offer hotel bar and lounge is good and clean room was small and definitely in need of a refurbishment;3
closet is a cupboard with no room for long items towels are in the shower on a high shelf my husband had to reach for me and no place to hang them outside the shower key cards didnt work well dont touch the minibar or food itemsmust be made of gold and 750 for a bottle of water;3
this hotel is in a good location for seeing the sights but thatâs all it has going for it the rooms are very small not enough wardrobe space no tea or coffee making facilities and a dusty bathroom i donât think housekeeping realise the door has a back to it we had to change rooms as ours was so dark donât go to the bar as the drinks are far to expensive 20 dollars for 2 small drinks one guy on reception was very rude they even charge you to leave your luggage on the day you depart;3
wear your flip flops in the shower its a weird feeling to have strange men sharing the bathroom with you great for ppl under 30 i wish they had separate bathrooms;3
cute hotel on the upper west side i wouldnt choose it if you want to be close to mid town but if you dont mid a walk then its perfect its close to the park with plenty of places to eat around it the hotel itself is very well decorated however you have to pay for wifi to be expected in nyc we had a suite however it wasnt the biggest but still very nice we had complimentary champagne and fruit on a tribal which was a nice touch;3
stayed for a week at days inn in feb it is a smart hotel with individual rooms bathrooms wifi and great connectivity to subway very economic price too the hostel sort of ambience but not exactly a hostel but and more of a hotel is charming in its way if you arent particular about breakfast and room service and bar;3
i booked a queen room with a view when i arrived i was given a room that can only be described as tatty no view a mattress that had me sink down to the box spring and a gaping hole in the windows that let in freezing outside air i went downstairs and received the room i think i paid for a decent but not amazing view and a bed and room in better condition the hallways smell really bad overall the hotel has a feeling of being run down and catering to mass tourism i chose this hotel because of its art deco heritage but frankly you can see lol there is to see from the outside the interior does not offer much else also the rates they advertise are not the rates you pay they add a 30 facility fee which is mandatory and really just a way to lure you in with a;3
arrived at 3pm and was informed that our suite was not ready asked to wait for 20 mins which we did in the bar enquired at 330 still not ready asked to wait 15 mins waited still not ready 4pm we got the keys and made our way to the 23rd floor first impressions are that this hotel is in serious need of a makeover its old frayed carpets off whiteyellow paint makes it look awful i was shocked when i saw the room everything looked old mint green bathroom and the corners of the bath were black from years of dirt old brown carpet the security also leaves a lot to be desired sometimes you are asked to present your key before entering the lift at the lobby other times you are not the public toilets below lobby level are filthy dont use them the tick tock diner;3
let me start out by saying that if we had stayed in the first room we were given this hotel would have been rated zero stars a very strange room with torn carpets and an odd concrete balcony strewn with garbage and cigarette butts the balcony had concrete walls with oval cutouts that provided a very limited view of the park and the city luckily we were able to have the room changed the next day and the new room was acceptable if somewhat small which is probably normal for nyc staff for the most part was very helpful for nyc the prices at this hotel are great which for us was a very big plus three blocks to the nearest subway stop however your are quite far uptown and thus away from the main tourist attractions this hotel would normally rate two stars in my book;3
reservation and check in was great the location was perfect and i felt secure even coming in late in the night i unfortunately was over charged and a week later i am still waiting on my account to be corrected looking forward to hearing from someone;3
dear days inn the hotel staff was courteous especially in resolving my gaps requests for directions and useful tips to move independently i stayed at days inn new york for a few days to visit the city and museums i have visited several important museums;3
rooms are tiny key card system is a work in progress could not get into my room 2 nights in a row front desk seemed like they needed more training the night manager was helpful shower sprayed more out the top then on me walls are thin heard room next to me with family annoying;3
while traveling alone on a budget for a quick weekend trip to nyc this hotel did the trick the place has definitely seen its better years during my stay the hotel was being renovated so the rooms were hit or miss the first room i was offered was dark and musty in a back corner of the hotel with a window that looked into a dark alley the staff was very helpful when i turned down that room and were able to give me a recently renovated room that overlooked broadway they also honored my request for a late checkout the room was small but quiet and everything worked you cant beat the location lots of shops around close to central park and just a couple blocks from the subway and the bus to laguardia airport while i wouldnt take my family here if traveling;3
the location being directly opposite penn station made this hotel worthwhile the rooms are very small but liveable for the five nights we were there although the bathroom was so awkwardly small staff were friendly and helpful however when we checked out i realised i had left something valuable in the room and when we returned they said it was not there the hotel did not have teacoffee facilities for the mornings but luckily there was subway opposite the walls were literally wafer thin so the noises from the room next door and outside were pretty loud especially the sirens from outside;3
good for a short business tripvery small rooms not good for a lengthy stay only reason i rated rooms poor was due to size and doorless showers flood on floor after every showerotherwise clean and nice;3
truth be told i had a great time right up until i checked out when i received a bill that included a us29 per day facilities charge i queried it because relative to my daily room rate it was an extra 15 per day which is not insignificant apparently this facilities charge was for the use of wifi and the gym whether i actually used it or not its not the amount involved that i am concerned over it is that by deliberately not including this facilities charge upfront in the published room rate i believe to be false advertising while i did have a lovely stay at this hotel this experience made me depart with a bad taste in the mouth and unlikely to return;3
i would not say that they really lie but just by omition they show you the beautiful entrance but this is parking side so when you are looking for this hotel look at the name and not an hotel with a beautiful fountain you could not find it on google in the description they say luxury hotel and you know thats a 3 stars so when you see the price you say yes ok but luxury bedrooms are for the last level with a great view wait the best is now friday night we didnt have any warm water for medical reasons i needed 2 warm bath a day and i couldnt friday this was inacceptable from a luxury hotel hopefully they have a great breakfast with a pretty dinning room the microwave and the fridge in the bedroom it was awesome to have them and the the;3
great location less than average hotel not hot water no water pressure booked room through travel agent and the reservation was messed up on their end front desk service was only soso have been using the hotel several times a year for business travel and will likely start looking around for something new;3
i stayed alone 6 nights in a single room 70 per night wo taxes this was by far the cheapest possibility in an individual room the location is great 15 blocks from the next metrostation at the and of a dead end road it is 5min from the river a park is there quite calm a tip breakfast at papayas just at the next metro station 72th street really cheap and friendly the hotel inside the room is small but proper fridge is working as the ac which is quite noisy my next bathroom was just next door i never ever had to wait just take flipflops to go there and then there is no problem water is hot and in the room is a sink for brushing teeth there is also a tv with bad reception but who cares for the reservation keep a paper copy as they do not have;3
for a relatively expensive hotel the service level was just acceptable expected more from the hilton rooms were good size and clean on arrival service was inconsistent concierge jesse was amazing location however is excellent for universal studios visits;3
we chose this hotel because of its proximity to the thanksgiving day parade route the room was small and the bathroom smaller on the positive side the room was clean and comfortable the staff was pleasant otherwise the decor was dated lots of restaurants and shopping in the area;3
in my opinion this hotel is nothing to write home about there is nothing special about it this is a typical hilton hotel it has a pool it has around 20 floors and it has a lobby thats it the hotels breakfast is decent the food is fresh and there is freshly squeezed orange juice there is not much to say about this hotel it is around 5 minutes away from the hotel to universal studios i would recommend this hotel to a friend but only if he or she is going to universal studios;3
i cant tell whether the hotel is open or not i tried calling and after going through the voicemail prompts and saying make reservation it rings and then disconnects although one can make reservations on numerous sites it is impossible to tell what would happen when i show up;3
to start with i could not fault the staff at park west as they were all lovely friendly and professional unfortunately the building maintenance is what has let this place down at first this hotel seems really promising the exterior and lobby are very modern and inviting but this is soon let down when you make your way to the rooms it is clear a lot of decorating work is going on to amend the problems that have cropped up in previous reviews but the price should have been reduced to compensate for this the elevator floor was extreamly dirty all it needed was a hoover the hallway leading to out room was also left in a half decorated state with light fixtures exposed and old paint the whole feel of park west felt very half finished the room was perfectly nice but as you;3
room is small but got the essential but thats it no bedside lamp empty walls no ac it is fine for sleeping beds are okey wouldnt complain but not very nice to hang around in close to the tub with many lines stopping so good location helpful staff clean enough got plenty of small kitchens but they seemed to be lacking the things you might find at a real hostel like soap some kitchen utilities left over spices the cheapest place we could find which wasnt totally off so i guess the price was okey for london so in that term you get what you pay for a place to sleep not too far off but in most other cities youd expect more for this price;3
we stayed here in december for 6 nights the new yorker was in a great location perfect in fact in the middle of everything and close to time square without all that madness out room was small but comfortable and it was a little tired round the edges bathroom but nothing that id complain about as its an old hotel we were higher up so the view was great tick tock diner was fab we had breakfast there every day and two evening meals they do the best burger ever really handy to have that down stairs only complaint was some of the staff were not that friendly to deal with at all im especially angry at the extra costs due to a friend recently visiting new york we were told they take so much per night from your card for a room deposit and refunded at the end of the;3
the hotel seems ok to me it is rather well located close to times sq many deli shops and right next to penn station and the moynihan train hall just a small walk away from the 5th ave and very close also to hudson yards and the high line the lobby is good looking in a nyc art deco style once inside the elevators seem a bit old and not very well kept but they have many cars to serve the whole place the floors look a bit odd with large aisles with no atmosphere the rooms are rather small but good enough they are simple with just a few spaces for stuff and a decent bathroom with a gas stationlike wc but clean enough the shower had an amazing pressure i havent seen before they charge you for keeping your lugagge either at check in or check out but with me they;3
from the subway i walked the several blocks from the eighth avenue stop at 14th street to the jane located on jane street and west street overlooking the hudson river my room was small the single mattress was wider than the floor space but i had room for the suitcase under the bed and there were 2 drawers the bathroom was a quick 10steps around a corner with two toilets and two showers economy at its best well it was an experience for 4 nights there is a rooftop bar facing west to new jersey open evenings until midnight open to the public and a nice place to relax and have a drink staff were friendly and polite single elevator was ample and efficient quiet streets and fellow guests werent too noisy after hours;3
i had read the reviews warning me of bad service and a tiny rooms but they were only half right the room was tiny to explain this further the double bedqueen was placed in the middle of the room and you could reach the side of the wall with your hand from laying in bed but as they say you dont intend to spend much time in your room when youre a tourist especially when central park was literally across the road i had a late flight 2am into nyc and the nightman working was rude and unhelpful however the doorman in the morning was very informative polite and provided some nice suggestions for breakfast overall the place was fine the rooms were clean albeit small and i really was only there for sleeping;3
my mother and i just returned from our stay at this hotel on the 6th september and overall can say we had a pleasant stay however upon arrival we were allocated a room which was not up to standard at all i had previously stayed at this particular hotel a week before my mother arrived in nyc and therefore i had a good idea of the expected standard of the room after complaining to reception they gave us a new room on the 6th floor which was so much better the room was bigger the bathroom was nice the air con was brilliant there was a safe that could be used easy and the tv worked fine the room service in this hotel is good too we had clean towels everyday and the beds were made the concierge lady was very helpful when asking about general advice including the subway;3
a very good price for ny nice staff and a great location also powerful internet service on every floor rooms are shabby kind of dirty and pillows smell bad we use our own bed sheets and were never bare foot not for the weak of stomach;3
hotel ok but this is what you expect in new york areas of the hotel need updating and decorating room was clean and quite spacious for new york hotels breakfast in the hotel diner and restaurant good;3
a monterey bay hotel nestled within 22 acres of soaring monterey pines the hyatt regency monterey hotel and spa on del monte golf course is a destination hotel providing the most discerning traveler with the quintessential monterey experience its central california coast location offers guest close proximity to downtown monterey monterey airport and easy access to some of the peninsulaâs most wellknown attractions âthis is what our stay should have been;3
i was interviewing at chla and this was a 3 blocks away so convenient safe neighborhood clean hotel nice updated rooms breakfast buffet was a nice touch staff was friendly excellent central location my only complaint is that the wifi did not work;3
the new yorker is a good hotel and is perfectly placed for exploring ny the good points are staff very helpful and knowledgeable the italian restaurant was also good as was the tic tock diner and as i have said itâs a perfect location to explore all the major attractions on foot and transport links are also very conveniently to hotel i would have given the hotel 4 but i think it could do will a touch up in most areas except the lobby i know itâs an old beautiful art deco building but i still believe it could keep all its decor but should be freshened up;3
on arrival at this hotel the only word that describes the lobby is hectic there are people everywhere hardly anywhere to move to and luggage everywhere there are quite a few staff at the desk and they work through the queue quickly this is a very old hotel building the the deco style but unfortunately the rooms are very small with very small bathrooms the beds are comfy and the tv has a good selection of channels the bathrooms could really do with an update and the one problem with the showers is that the temperature changes on its own and is not regulated well and the water switches to boiling hot which scolds you the location of this hotel is good with maddison square gardens behind the hotel;3
checkin staff very enthusiastic about the newly updated property lobby looked nice and clean rooms small air conditioning filter hadnt been changed in forever coffee table was a large hunk of glass with sharp edges not sure who thought that would be good for a kid friendly hotel next to universal parents watch those edges tv is from the dinosaur flat panel beginningsmaybe a 32 but looked more like a 20 computer monitor food is ok and not much else around for off property dining wont be back for next universal trip;3
stayed at the wyndham for 3 nights in mid march upon check in we were asked to pay a facilities fee of 29 dollars a night even though we had already prepaid for our room when asked what this fee was for it was the use of the gym we dont use any gyms the business centre did not need the business centre but however we still had to pay it our room was small and basic facing other high rise buildings but since we were out of it all day it didnt really make a difference room was clean but could do with updating as did the corridors reception area was quite grand as were the bar areas nice on checking out we asked to store our luggage for the morning and we were charged 2 dollars per case didnt think this was fair considering we were guests and already paid an extra;3
nice hotel great location bathroom is very small and shower screen is very inadequate resulting in the entire bathroom getting wet during a shower staff very friendly and helpful good value hotel;3
room was average and a lot outdated if you are only there to sleep because of universal studios then you will be ok its super close the park the breakfast buffett was amazing and they cater to all kinds of countries for the style of food choices loved it our only real issue was when we purchased front of the line tickets for universal studios after dinner my wife and i split the costs between our 2 credit cards they put the entire cost of the hotel on my wifes credit card after we split the front of line tickets not my credit card that was used to book the room and the card that was used for incidentals crazy right not sure what happened there;3
nice hotel good location and friendly staff the wifi is terrible though free in lobby only and paid connection was so slow to even use also they said you could connect a second device but a code was not provided had to call and get one from the front desk and it never worked;3
this hostel was quite good pendent of your depozit there was realy clean room shower and kitchen as a deficit i saw share shower and toilet so there are not privacy hostl is situated in good location about 25 minutes to london center the hammersmith location is well qaurter but little noisy in total i rate abercorn like good average hostel;3
being someone who has stopped at many hotels in new york including the helmsley this was quite a downgrade however for the price it is good value and if you are willing to travel on the subway or taxi every morning in order to get into the life of the city then this might be for you there is a very friendly cleaner that goes round everyday and cleans the rooms and they are very tidy but very small and the decor of course is of quite a low standard but is still modern and what you expect the most terrible part about this hotel is the elevator it sucks and after a long hot summers day in the city the last thing you want to do is travel up this hotels slow and cramped elevator this really bugged me and these are the sort of luxuries you sacrifice when goin to a cheap hotel;3
stayed there in march 2012 the room was very very very small too much furniture in it but in saying that you dont spend a lot of time in the room what got me about this place was that they are doing renovations downstairs but in the parts that guests dont use the restaurant for breakfast was pretty average and the food pretty basic but ive had worse some of the staff were great and some not too good the lift was the slowest i have ever been in as far as attractions we just caught the subway a five minute walk if you stay there about a 10 minute walk down the road is a fabulous 50s restaurant definately worth a look and you must try their shakes as far as safety was concerned it was ok i would recommend it for the price anyway;3
we just stayed here with our 2 kids for a trip to the theme park the hotel is a very quick 5 minute walk from the entrance to the park and universal city walk so you cant beat the convenience we stayed in a king corner room with a pullout sofa the mattresses could stand to be replaced but the bed linens were great the sofa bed was so uncomfortable that it wasnt fit for an adult to sleep on with the sofa bed open you cant walk around the foot of the king bed so the room is tight overall the hotels convenience to universal studios theme park overcomes the few discomforts we experienced with the sleeping amenities;3
this trip had been planned for a little over two months so i could spend quality time with my wife for her birthday when i called to see if i could checkin early the girl at the front desk was very rude even before i arrived at the hotel my refrigerator leaked the floor lights on the elevators didnt work and i was overcharged not happy with this experience at all i stay in hiltons all over the world and this is by far a disappointment;3
stayed at the new yorker for one week check in was friendly and efficient the excellent customer service we received by sharmayne and mohammed we requested a high floor for views to celebrate our 30 th wedding anniversary and had to wait one day for the room to be available a 30th floor newly refurbished room and corridors our first allocated room was 19th floor with dull dreary corridors and it was small and quite cold draught from the windows but with manual air con but nice and clean it could have done with a thick duvet and not just thin sheets but we were only in this room for our first night and then upgraded to the 30 th floor room 3038 had a balcony roof terrace we did not use as the door was locked it would be lovely to use in the warmer monthsð;3
i have been staying at the empire since 1987 it was always a lovely hotel with a family feel cosy and friendly we returned this december to a refurbished god knows when hotel where the public spaces are good if cold and impersonal but the rooms are not great we upgraded to a queensized room to enable us to get a bath tub in us parlance the room size was fine but the ac didnt work and this was a couple of weeks ago when the temperatures were 65 i would call several times a day and the very nice maintenance man would reset the breakers only for the ac to trip out again why not address the problem properly and fix the units compressor internet at 1295 go to starbucks round the corner where there is a better signal and the bathroom not worthy of a 2 uk;3
if youre looking for a cheap place to stay in new york city here you have it but by cheap i mean affordable for this city looking for hotels in nyc can be a nightmare if youre travelling on a budget and if you want to stay in manhattan its clean enough and it gives you quick access to ny attractions the rooms are small as well as the bathrooms but its enough for spendind a few days in the city i dont think you could find anything better;3
clean in a great location small room with a queen size bed much smaller than typical closet sized bathroom having stayed at other nyc hotels will not be coming back to this one i was here for a conference;3
i stayed here for a week in july on business i had a nice room but was paying top whack for a superior double so would have expected as much it was pretty dark though as was the lobby the lifts and the corridoors which were all very brown the service was fine the hotel has a high turnover of guests so always lots of coming and goings with guests hotel pool is more like a large bath and was full of kids when i saw it roof top bar is fine great if you smoke seems to be populated by twenty and thirty somethings with high heels and clearly deep pockets a round do drinks for five was 100 dollars the location is great and there is a starbucks one minute walk away for breakfast it opens at 530 so is great if you are jet lagged there is also a 24 hour duane;3
seems to me this hotel could really benefit from some tlc to be fair ive only ever stayed there this one time so i dont know what other rooms were like but if my room is typical then id say buyer beware the location is unbeatable next door to lincoln center two blocks from central park easy access to subway etc the lobby bar is great the attached restaurant chowder house is 1st rate and well run if a bit overpriced but everything in that part of town is but its clear to me that whomever is running this place is cutting corners when it comes to maintenance;3
booked this hotel for my 50th as it looked nice and central and had good reviews emailed the hotel asking for an upgrade as it was a special birthday travel agent done the same to increase our chances didnt mind paying a little extra on arrival staff were friendly and they gave us a bottle of champagne as it was my birthday we were disappointed in our room very small and clean but needed updating and looked out on to an abandoned building with graffiti and smashed windows spoke to some other guests who said their room was like new they also had a tea maker which we didnt so disappointed after trying hard to make sure we had a lovely room before arrival expensive for a basic room;3
normally i love this hotel and the area i was disappointed this trip around although the raw bar at the chowder house was very very good as was the bartending staff very accomodating and friendly as well;3
hotel was in prime location to penn station near to all attractions hotel room was clean modern and had everything you needed the rooms are small but you are not in the rooms when in new york as there is so much to do the bed pillows were comfortable the staff were always around to ask questions leave luggage we loved our stay;3
hotel room i stayed in was small but you expect this in new york however the room and bathroom is in need of updating as it looks tired and the bath looks like the baths in the 70âs however it is clean which is the main thing but there are nicer hotels in the area;3
first impression of this hotel is good great location and nice receptionlobby and bar area however regardless of if you managed a good price or paid premium you may find yourself i a miniroom and i mean mini or a smaller but nicer room the smaller but nicer room you would expect for the price but this is considered a upgrade which i was lucky enough to get nobody would be happy with the single small room everything is charged after that being internet connection coffee in the room or a bottle of water despite the fantastic weather during my stay no rooftop terrace was open because it was not yet memorial day which was a real letdown only cold water for two days and constant problems with elevators was a understandable annoyance hotel bar is ok but with very;3
really good if you want a cheap place to stay its pretty basic but for the price its fine fridge and crockery in the room was a plus bathrooms could be better but they were fine dont understand all the doors in the hallways i guess theyre there to keep noise out but theyre so inconvenient when you have luggage be aware that theres no free wifi location is good for heathrow but its about 25min to piccadilly circus;3
great location near central park lincoln center columbus circle etc however the hotel itself looks tired and needs a refresh rooms are small bathrooms even smaller our smoke detector was dead but the problem was resolved promptly long wait for bellhops to store luggage and hotel was not that busy which was a bit annoying overall nothing remarkable but good location depending on what youre doing;3
the empire hotel is in a great location right in lincoln center â you walk out of the hotel and you can see to your left the opera house i had a junior suite corner room with some nice views the room was quite spacious by nyc standards with a seating area with couch chair and table and a separate desk and chair the bathroom was nice but poorly lit â it would have made more sense to put some backlighting on the mirror to help you see yourself while getting ready it felt a little dim and unflattering in addition the toilet was too close to the vanity so that i would bump my arm against it while sitting on the toilet the shower was great with a nice rainfall shower head plus a handheld sprayer it took me a minute to realize that to use both at the same time you;3
pretty on the outside and beautiful general area but the details on the inside fall short no coffee makers in room coffee 800 from room service no climate control in room very loud outside if you can open the old and very heavy window towels thin and like sandpaper beefcake bartenders who prioritize beautiful women bellmen are the exception friendly helpful and accommodating i travel a lot and this hotel is a head scratcher;3
location and room were both great as were the staff we found the pricing policy to be a let down though would much rather they increased the up front price instead of charging for every little thing on top of the room fee wifi parking water and anything we they can squeeze out of you leaves something of a bad taste in the mouth and spoils what is an otherwise excellent experience charging for wifi on top of an already expensive room and also charging per device is the sort of nickle and dime approach that should be below a chain like this but sums up their approach to value and service;3
the hotel location and appearance were excellent however the check in process was awful we had to cancel our dinner reservations and almost missed our show time if you are coming to this hotel for a show arrive the day before not the day of as check in cannot be guaranteed all other aspects of our stay were adequate;3
the rooms are rather small for the price as a result i do not consider this hotel good value check in time was 300pm many rooms were not available at that time i personally do not like a facilities charge which is not optional;3
we stayed here for four nights on a city break during april 2019 in a metro room things got off to a bad start the room we were given initially was quite cramped and had a window with a large gap which created a constant whistle from the wind and meant it was very noisy from outside too we called reception and they sent someone up to look he couldnt fix it and said he would either come back to fix it or tell reception to move us we then went out to have a wander around the area on returning we found nothing had happened so called reception again they knew nothing about it so i explained the situation all over again and they did give us another room the new room had a much better feel to it better layout and a bit more space bed very comfortable all very clean;3
the new yorker is one of those hotels that weve all heard off every city has them and you probably ought to stay at once to tick it off the list its in a fantastic location right by penn station and msg 5 mins walk from macys herald sq and the empire state 10 mins if that from times square getting anywhere in manhattan is easy from here jfk ewr are easy to reach from penn station too theres 3 restaurants in the hotel tick tock is an iconic ny diner open long hours with a big menu although the food and service are average at best trattoria bianca is a decent italian with a nice bar and butcher banker a fantastic upscale steak house in the basement downstairs youll find a very good fitness centre a 24hr business centre and a little archive documenting;3
i was a bit concerned about this hotel as id read some poor reviews particularly as wed booked a cheap room through a third party booking site my concerns were well placed you get what you pay for positives the hotel is in a bit of a middleofnowhere area but is welllocated for many of the main tourist attractions in northcentral la itll only take you 15 minutes in a car or taxi to griffith park or downtown 20 minutes to dead central hollywood the communal areas of the hotel are also good the pool area is clean and attractive as are the outside frontage reception courtyard bar breakfast area and corridors their prices are good for the area the hotel is in service was good during our stay even if it was obvious that housekeeping only turned the;3
days inn hotel is an average quality hotel with a good location on the upper west side near symphony space just off broadway it is easily accessible to the subway and not far from the park we stayed in one of the newly refreshed rooms on the penthouse floor it was okay but a bit dark and sparse the new ceiling was fun the bathroom however was brighter and pretty well stocked only one elevator gets to the ph floor and this was a bit of a problem and it is small enough that not more than eight people with luggage were comfortable breakfast was not included there are plenty of places nearby for a meal we will probably look for another place next time;3
we booked this hotel as it seemed central to all we wanted to do it is in hollywood but the area is not goodwe didnt venture out at night but im sure if you had a car you would be fine the saving grace was the metro line which is one block away which we used to travel all over laits 7 a day which took us to santa monicalong beachuniversalhollywood etcits clean and we felt safe during the day the hotel room was adequate for usmicrowavecoffee machine and fridge providedbed comfybathroom shower with small bath rooms are rather tired and could do with updating breakfast provided which was oksausage and hash browns everyday and an egg stationno bacon staff always polite and helpful pool area quaintpool in need of a clean and i was bitten by something while;3
we had a queen size room on the 3 rd floor facing the courtyard the room was clean and the bed comfortable the wifi was a bit dodgy and we needed to contact it support a couple of times the air con was very noisy the room nest to us air con could be heard in our room and kept us awake at night unless it was turned off with the very hot weather in la the room gets very warm at night the hotel is close public transport train bus we caught the supershuttle to and from the airport 17 per person each way;3
older hotel in a great location rooms are clean housekeeping do a great job in cleaning and tidying most staff are pleasant we had 2 bathrooms both toilets blocked and overflowed the first time this happened it took 2 phone calls and a visit to front desk for maintenance to come and fix the problem worst part of our stay was visiting the concierge desk at reception where you can purchase show tickets there was a lady with short hair at the desk who had absolutely no interest in helping we wanted to purchase aladdin tickets that werent too expensive as we are a family of 5 all she could manage was to tell us how expensive they would be and probably would cost us 240 per seat she then proceeded to tell us the only cheap tickets left would be for the;3
great location if your visiting universal studio short walk to the park staff was friendly parking was a little expensive our 1st room was great but the air conditioning was not working they sent up someone to check it but he was unable to fix so they moved us into the room next door this room was a different story it had a stale smokewet dog odor something brown and sticky spilt on the carpet and up the wall by minifridge this room just was dirty it did have view of the pool and hills that was a plus and the beds were ok;3
stayed here for one night and did so because i wanted a cheaper room that was still in manhattan overall it was ok but would not stay here again due to the location which is in the far northern part of central park room was quiet and very spartan but everything was ok the price matched the comfort level no issues with cleanliness staff were friendly;3
based on expectations we expected a higher class of hotel in ny the hotel room was very small compared to other hotels in america it was also dated and could do with a revamp location was fine and easy access to all sites of ny;3
for what i paid for the accommodations i expected much more i understand that obtaining a hotel in the york is extremely expensive no matter which proprietor you choose however if you pay for a suite it should be worthy of calling it such the location is absolutely excellent but the interior was extremely small and out of date the weather was 90 degrees and the air conditioning system was not blowing cool air;3
hotel was nice and good location to lax not a good location to stay at if you are going sightseeing or trying to find something to eat nothing is close by the biggest problem i had was they charged us 10000 to check into our hotel room early i thought that it was wrong considering the room was ready;3
its a decent hotel and relatively cheap for nyc i found a great deal in bookingcom and booked it spacious room but very cold the radiator did some noise all the time water in the bathroom was leaking general service is ok and the people are very gentle;3
make sure the card for the regency room works prior to giving access to the customer room was very comfortable and coffee was excellent bed was excellent and noise was nonexistent from the busy street below;3
busy central location meant that staff are not always responsive helpful when asked however and directed is to fine local restaurants and sites though they replaced our room keys several times the keys were always hitormiss when unlocking room;3
problems with safe wallpaper peeling and bathroom issues to be fair i didnât notify the staff during my stay because there a short time waited 10 minutes for someone to serve me at store just checked in and wanted to get a tea and snacks;3
we spent a few days at hilton to go to universal studios with the kids the 5 minute walk from the hotel to the universal studio entrance is perfect for this however the attitude of the reception staff left much to be desired at the price we paid not only did they seem disengaged bordering rude but they seemed to be having trouble working with eachother we experienced long waiting times more than once as only 1 or 2 were manning the reception and even though that person tried to call for colleagues to come out and assist notning happened and he was left apologizing that no one came to assist us waiting 15 minutes for a checkout as number 1 in line is just uacceptable furthermore our key cards somehow canceled themselves and getting new ones took time as the only person;3
the rooms here were tiny but cheap with double beds we knew this when we booked but somehow in the event they actually are even smaller than you expect that said the feel of the place was very good and despite having to move rooms three times on our first night after the flight from the uk it was not a bad stay there is a nightclub in the hotel which worried us as in the uk that would be a recipe for disaster but it was fine and much to the annoyance of the club door staff who were turning away c50 of people we even went in for an overpriced drink 10 per drink tips expected on top this was a small part of a larger trip for us so budget was tight on another trip i would pay the extra and stay at a proper hotel but this served it purpose;3
stayed for one night at the empire which is right opposite the lincoln centre in manhattan was upgraded to a deluxe king size room which was fine it just worries me what a standard room is like the deluxed king size had everything you could need apart from a wardrobe where you could hang coatsdresses but ok if you had suits the mini bar took up the lower half of the wardrobe the bedsheets were wonderful the shower was great the service a bit casual prefer a bit more in the of being made to feel welcome the bar looked cosy and the location good not sure if id stay again worried about room size so ask for suqare footage when you book in case you bring a cat that needs swinging;3
i have come to expect a lot from hilton and this stay did not meet my expectations my first disappointment came in the form of learning that the executive floor was just a room on a high floor no executive lounge and no real difference from a room on a regular floor in fact my family that had stayed on the former tower level floors had a nicer room than i did on the executive floor the hotel also has extremely slow elevators a problem compounded by one to two elevators being out of service the hotel staff did the best they could given the situation but always set aside at least 10 minutes to get to the lobby during your stay water pressure in the shower was also a consistent issue in order to be able to rinse off any soap i had to run the sink while showering in;3
the empire was perfectly adequate but by no means the best hotel weve stayed at in new york both the on the avenue and the alex were better although the empires location near columbus circle and central park gave it the edge in that regard we had persistent problems with the room key cards trivial perhaps but a pita when trekking up and down several floors every day laden with shopping and bags after finding you cant get into your room the hotels decor wasnt too our taste it could easily have been based on bet lynchs bedroom the decor was so dark a mix of browns and the room lights so dim that it quickly became annoying drinks at the bar were very expensive but then most hotels are of course on the plus side there is a starbucks right next door that opens as;3
this is my first stay at this hotel i chose it because it is across the street from my client great location with easy access to the subway lincoln center and central park this is a nice restaurant on the second floor and one adjacent to the entrance there is also a full service starbucks next door rooms a actually not a bad size by nyc standards although if you can spring for a king bed you will get more space bathrooms are tight and totally functional there is a spacious roof top bar with yummy food and nice not grand views as a business traveler the empire fell short for me the decor is a bit too retro and dark for me i kept waiting for bogart and bacall to show up there are messy calking and chipped paint in the rooms the floorcarpeting in;3
i think it has been taken over by hyatt recently hence the rooms have been redone etc everything looks new the service was very good and the location is excellent and right next to lax however it is just another average hyatt;3
the guest rooms are small but adequate tic toc diner a bit tired the butcher and banker is solid steakhouse the bar has a nice whiskey selction favorite with budget minded european travellers must be location of penn station next door;3
this was an average hotel not to clean not to dirty rooms could use a makeover noone one was overly accommodating noone was rude location was great for what we wanted to do price was affordable;3
ive been to the rooftop bar of the empire hotel many times while visiting friends in nyc and always had a good time the layout is spacious and conducive to small or large groups and the view is fairly nice as well they have ample heating for the colder months to keep the rooftop open longer however this review is not really about the rooftop but the hotel rooftop 45 stars hotel 3 stars highlights despite being in between midtown and the upper west side the location is actually pretty good you are next to the lincoln center near some nice restaurants and a block from the subway the staff was relatively nice and helpful on balance especially the bell staff drawbacks the room was your typical small not so clean nyc room the kind you find in a wannabe;3
at best a 3 room size and cleanliness ok but water pressure the worst iâve seen at any hotel water barely comes out the buffet is also perhaps the worst quality iâve ever had and all this for a very expensive price iâm a hilton diamond member too so very disappointing;3
it was in upgrade mode when we were there in late april tv was old with only 2 or 3 channels that were clear shower and heater worked the elevator on the same side as the front desk gives the feeling of your stomach going through the floors as it jolts to each floor;3
lovely staff tired accommodation cant agree with other comments about the breakfast as i found it to be low quality mostly stodge that said there was plenty of it and the price was right so no complaints the omelette cooker was relentless and implacable but im not convinced there were real eggs in his omelettes what no kettle only other place ive experienced that was amsterdam madness there was some weird looking coffee maker but it looked a bit grubby so we didnt chance it major for me as i like to make a cup of tea in my room some eating places in walking distance but low quality no safe in room and it felt necessary balcony but no chair to sit on it comfortable bed with a few titivations this could be a great place but maybe their business;3
forget everything you know about tiny the janes rooms redefine the meaning of tiny well heres the breakdown the location is superbthe janes reception is gorgeous the service is great the bar as well the room is very clean and has everything you need except space its really really tiny and at 115 a night a bit too pricy;3
stayed at the new yorker after a cruise started out bad with an aggressive woman who we thought was at the concierge desk trying to sell us a 2 hour presentation for a time share tour all we wanted was a map and tickets to the grayline tour bus they need to better label the real concierge desk and get rid of the crazy lady the rooms are kind of hit and miss on the size and location some were big and some were tiny but with views rooms were clean well appointed but the carpets and halls look worn down elevators were fast which was a plus hotel felt safe and secure 24 hour restaurant was nice good location price was about right for mid manhattan they charge 10 a bag to store luggage until checkin time which was kind of high since a lot of places its free if you;3
we stayed at the wyndham new yorker for 3 nights in december i asked for an empire state building view which was accommodated we stayed in room 2222 i believe it was a metro view double room it was very large for my family of 4 beds were comfy and bathrooms were of an ok size this hotel is extremely busy the staff was not friendly when we checked out we had to wait an hour for our car to take us to the airport during this time my 6 year old son had to use the restroom we waited for 25 minutes in line for security to give us a card to use the bathroom you need a card to get to the bathrooms i wouldnt recommend this hotel to friends or family the friendliest employees of this hotel were the housekeepers;3
the highpoints of this hotel the location and chris at the concierge desk he was very helpful the atmosphere was modern and pleasing to the senses however if you are there in the winter you will need a coat to sit at the bar in the lobby as they keep the entrance doors open;3
i was here for business and found the overall hotel very nice if you are here to see universal studios however from a business point of view it is merely average i know they are currently redoing the elevators which is much needed as waiting for them took quite a while but i think the bathrooms may need a little help too mine had a leaking faucet that kept dripping loudly and started staining the bathtub some other cons the food is way expensive for what it is literally double the price of what youd pay in a restaurant and of course my pet peeve overall parking fees why in the world do i have to pay for parking when i am staying in the hotel and already pay over 200 a night its such a rip off and just makes me mad hotel was booked out and even though i am;3
except for the fact that it is very close to universal studio within walking distance i cannot say it is a great hotel to stay no slippers even after you requested for it it was never delivered no free bottle water i can hardly find any hotels nowadays that does not give free bottled water staff are friendly though which is a like water is running very slow and water pressure is bad you basically cannot control temperature of your water tap in the shower;3
this has 45 on trip advisor but is not a 4 star hotel possibly a 3 star the room was fine but nothing special the bathroom needs updating breakfast was also fine all in all for the price i expected bit more but it was ok we didnt have a car but saw they charge paying customers for parking really;3
at first my sister and i were a little nervous because we didnt know what to expect but after arriving we found that the lobby is beautiful the staff is really friendly and helpful the rooms are small and old but clean the location was great we walked to as much as we could and the subway is right out the front door lots of nice shops and great restaurants in the area very safe very friendly would definately return;3
combination of very bad very good and then there was just weird the lobby has a cool swanky vibe as one can see from the pics and website the hotel restaurant eds chowder house is good and convenient the staff friendly and for the most part very accommodating the bed ridiculously comfortable thats really all the good now for the bad our first room was so small we could barely move around with our bags in it annettethe front desk agent kindly found us a larger superior king room on the first floor insisting no extra charge even when i said i was willing to pay for the upgrade should have smelled something funny then but it wasnt until we entered the other room that the extremely strong smell of mustiness hit us the smell of mold in the bathroom was;3
if the empire hotel were branded marriott or hyatt it would cost 6080night more and for the added money you would get exterior windows that seal well bathroom faucets that dont come off in your hand when you turn on the water functional sink drain stoppers and bathroom doors made of metal or nonwood composite these minor annoyances are just that minor and for the price the empire hotel is a great buy the rooms are clean and nicely decorated with a comfortable mattress and nice towels and bed linens the location is hard to beat across the street from lincoln center see photo and a block from central park on this stay the ipod docking station worked but the ac unit went from the ideal white noise of fan only to a clattering bag of bolts when the;3
we visited for five nights the staff were helpful although the ever present problem of who and when and how much to tip is pervasive the surroundings are quaint and there is history and original features aplenty the cabin rooms are very small and the shared bathroom issue is a problem when toilets and showers are out of order for the entire duration the location is perfect very central and ideally placed for most destinations;3
hotel was very average staff were brilliant though locationnot great for walk of fame etc cost us 70 to get to santa monica yes its right on hollywood blvd but at the end of it about 3040 to get to the walk of fame and bus tours etc nowhere is in walking distance so be ready to get the busmetro taxi breakfast was pretty rubbish we went once then refused to go back but there is a 50s diner down the road which was brilliant atm worked 1 day out of the 4 we were there which was a pain;3
my boyfriend and i spent 5 nights at the hotel in june 2004 it was our first time in new york and even though we loved the city the hotel didnt impress us very much negative points it is very basic and needs remodernising the lifts felt very unsafe when travelling up to our floor the bathroom was old and not very nice it is on 94th street which is too far away from all the attractions good points huge king size bed nice staff internet access charged by the minute which was very handy they allowed us to keep our bags in a room when we checked out free of charge when visiting ny again we wont be staying at the quality hotel;3
i was looking forward to staying at this hotel because they have some great pictures up unfortunately it was kind of a pain i stayed because i had business in the area and while driving in the am was doable i figured i would get more sleep spending the night in the city i drove up to the front of the hotel which was quite a feat and waited for the valet and waited and waited and waited cars were honking and i started unloading my bags until finally the valet arrived he made a big point of telling me that they charged for the valet isnt that obvious in the city and then made a point to tell me that it was 70 a night i was totally fine with that dont know why he seemed to try to dissuade me check in was quick which was rad got to my room which was teeny but;3
for 13 floors of rooms there are only two working elevators housekeeping staff must use these as well in fact the service elevator has a permanent sign stating it is temporarily out of service has been there at least a year if you stay on the 13th floor ph then only one of the two elevators is available to you in previous trips during the summer and fall it was not uncommon to wait 15 or 20 minutes to get an elevator going up or down during our last stay feb we caught rides much quicker most likely because there were fewer people staying there the rooms are clean the water is usually hot the sheets are comfortable and the towels plush theupgraded rooms are the only ones we have stayed in the rooms are quite small great location to subway station and good;3
this hotel has huge brightly lighted and clean lobby great location with a view but the room is small and there is no soundproof walls and doors was awaken a few times people walking along the hallway;3
if youre going to universal studios this is a good selection you have to pay for parking though and the parking garage only fits cars 64 and smaller or use vallet our room was clean but hot if you face universal studios you also face the sunrise which bakes on your windows the air conditioner cant compete with the heat in the morning staff is nice and you get a welcome fruit basket free continental breakfast avaiable for hilton honors members but they are discrete about it would i stay again yes but id ask for a room that doesnt face the sunrise;3
i am a globalist with hyatt already there again for this year this hotel is a one night stay over place and i get that but it used to have a good bar scene and life to it i wont be back until they open it back up again with the bar etc the ability to walk to and from lax is big but i dont want to eat in my room and there is not much close by so might as well go somewhere else until they open back up;3
great location for walk to theatre land if you are fully mobile clean and comfortable room but bed and pillows very hard so didnt sleep well breakfast areas were clean and good choice of hot and cold options but chilled fruit berries etc were still frozen good to have non diary milks available though;3
the hotel is in the vicinity is of great shopping the subway is one block away plus moderate price restaurants and your favorite duane readewalgreens is next door the hotel has friendly and courteous employees but the overall of pricing should be flat rate across the board due to its 5050 hotelresidential rate fluctuated too much one of the elevators goes on the blink of an eye so you will be taking the stairs regularly before checking in specify that you want a new room i stayed in an old room but was paying new upgraded room prices they will request 5000 for the upgrade right;3
we paid â£150 each between 3 of us for 3nights which from what i can gather is normal nyc prices the location couldnt get any more central to so many things there is a subway literally under the hotel if you need to get anywhere not within walking distance and we also used the air train from newark to penn station which took just 20mins the room itself was extremely small and the beds didnt seem normal size either for the amount of time we spent in the hotel none of this mattered didnt ever use the bar or diner as theres so many restaurants nearby we arrived on an early morning uk flight and got into the hotel about 2 and the room was ready which meant we could freshen up before we headed out;3
the welcome by the doormen and reception was friendly the room was prepaid therefore check in was quick and easy we managed to check in earlier than 3pm as well the hotel is well kept and looks nice in the lobby and mezzanine area the room was quite small but we paid a budget price for this so budget can be expected the air conheating was quite loud but did the job the room offered complimentary water each day 300mls but not to be confused with the 500mls size which will cost you 5 per bottle there is a safe in the room which is easy to use there is a hairdryer and also the hotel provides soap and other basic toiletries there was a coffee and milk set available but confusing as the whether or not this was included or an extra charge the bed was quite firm;3
we selected this hotel as one option in a wedding block and booked a standard room we were very disappointed with the condition of the room the bed was not very comfortable and we were only given 3 pillows the ac struggled to keep up making sleeping very uncomfortable even though the weather wasnt too warm our view was directly into other rooms and the roof hvac fixtures the paint and wall paper was pealing and chipping all over the room and the room was in need of a serious renovation the bathroom door knob was loose and close to falling out and the sink drain must have been clogged because it didnt drain without a shower curtain the very small bathroom floor was always soaking wet wifi was an extra charge and there was no bottled water in the room except;3
we traveld in nyc in 102014 and we sleeped in days hotel the hotel is near to metro station central park life night and have a many resturant the hotel is clean and quit but not have a breakfast;3
i was disappointed that i could not get a room that never had feather pillows and bedding the staff is very nice the menu in the sierralobby bar is extremely limited and quite pricy the breakfast buffet is enormous but imho not a good value the elevators are old and incredibly slow i notice the often have someone stationed at the elevators to push the button when the see you coming from the lobby even with this extra help you end up waiting at least the heat works i did get an amazing rate on hotwire parking is not free i probably would not select this hotel again;3
the general manager has since contacted me apologized credited back the charge for the mini bar and my overdraft fees and offered special rates upgrade to a suite and free drinks and breakfast should we decided to come back again this manager was very nice and accommodating and i am going to make plans to stay there for my anniversary and give them another shot i am keeping the original post from my review because it should not have taken up hours of my time wrangling with the shift manager however i did upgrade from 2 stars to 3 this is what i emailed to the manager and posted as part of my original review i am writing in reference to the stay my wife and i had in your hotel this past week we enjoyed the physical hotel very much but had a number of interactions;3
hotel was very easy to find from newark airport took the nj transit and transferred to the subway at penn station and the number 2 to 96th street check in was smooth we got a king sized bed our room was spacious and although the bathroom was tiny it was spotless coffee maker and coffee is provided wish there was a fridge there were three towels although a bit threadbare a hand towel and wash cloth lots of immediate hot water shower is a little high for shorties but seems like a relatively new shower head shampoo is provided but it isnt the greatest so i recommend bringing your own hair dryer worked well and lighting is great in bathroom with makeup mirror there is a safe and its large enough to fit electronics wifi worked very well and we were on the 6th;3
pretty much what youd expect for a midtown hotel rooms were small and dated we would have had a superb view of the empire state building and 34th street but it was obstructed by scaffolding check in was quick and efficient and staff were always very polite easy to get a taxi outside and location was perfect for us;3
everything there is in various shades of brown the reception lounge the walls carpets pictures furniture curtains fittings beds shower rooms corridors mezzanine even the lifts i dont actually dislike brown in its place but everything it meant that the small bedroom and shower room we had on the 11th floor looked even smaller we had a view from the window of a brick wall with windows although if i stuck my head out of the window i got a tiny bit of new york between the two brick walls we were there during the severe snowstorm at the beginning of the year so while it was freezing outside our room cool air thingy wasnt working and even with the window open it was just so hot in the room as previously mentioned the inroom hospitality items were;3
great location tired rooms that need major updates to be clean old carpet old decor sagging mattresses this was probably a gem in its heyday that is now in need of complete redecorating and overhaul of hvac etc;3
i brought three grandsons to la for a special treat on arrival at the hilton the first thing was a complete absence of curb side assistance check in was pleasant enough our room was nice but i didnt expect a shower over the bath at my age the risk of tripping whilst climbing out is quite high then the excitement of checking the mini bar empty the fridge empty so we went looking for snacks for three hungry young boys the coffee corner offered three cookies and a muffin so we had to taxi into town for a light affordable meal on our return at 930pm the queen pull out bed was found to have extremely light blankets and only one pillow to add insult to injury we could use free wifi in the lobby but not in our room coffee corner closed and;3
we stayed for 5 nights at the hollywood hotel the room was recently renovated and was quite clean we had a double queen room on the 3rd floor and it was quite big with a balcony overlooking the swimming pool the bathroom was basic and cleanliness was ok breakfast is practical omelettes cereal doughnuts bread cream cheese some fruit juice etc parking is a bit expensive about 20 or 25 dollars a night but we were able to find street parking most of the time the staff however are not too nice some are nice but some are downright nasty;3
i was very surprised to find a 60 dollar hotel rate in manhattan and feared the worst but found the hotel to be perfectly fine during an october 2002 visit the location on the upper west side near the hudson river is a safe quiet residential area though theres some major construction underway nearbya new trump building the hotel is a converted residency hotel which sounded a little creepy but i was told most rooms have been converted to overnight status it was full of young foreign travellers when i stayed there the room was fineclean and simple and it was perfectly quiet in the hallways the room had a large color tv with remote comfortable bed and reading lampcertainly much less oppulent then most hotel rooms but not at all uncomfortable of;3
if you are not in ny just to look at the four walls of your hotel room and rather prefer to spend your money in shops and restaurants this is a good alternative the hotel is a simple worndown complex of connected old buildings implying endless twisting corridors and an ecclectic collection of more or less permanent residents amongst backpackers families and other tourists but it is safe it is reasonably clean and it is well located on upper west side the neighborhood is not posh but still expensive inhabited by peaceful new yorkers who meet with their laptops at starbucks in the morning before heading to their offices the hotel is peacefully located down 71st street just some houses away from hudson river surrounded by highrise condos and old brownstone town;3
stayed here for 5 nights which was a surprise treat organised by my partner for my 50th birthday apparently my partner advised the hotel of this but no upgrade or acknowledgement from the hotel a card would have been nice room was small and the heatingaircon system was so noisy we couldnt use it shower was good but the bathroom was dusty with a number of rogue hairs i assume were belonging to the previous guest the concierge was quite dismissive and a little rude the only really good point of the hotel is the location close to central park and the lincoln centre;3
i always love staying at the empire but the hotel rooms are tired bathrooms are super small and i dislike a shower curtain other than that i still love staying there bc the people are so nice and the location is wonderful;3
have you seen a tiny room crowded and without any reasonable space to store luggage or clothing have you ever been in a bathroom where you could not fit between sink and wall the empire provides such an experience in a room they called deluxe granted they moved us when they could to something a bit better but far from optimal not a hotel for me;3
we specified a two queen room as we were traveling with our 19 year old son there was not one available at 1030 at night even though we had checked in online the king plus rollaway replacement room did not work out well because the rollaway was terribly uncomfortable not a good experience at this hyatt;3
currently staying at the hotel and definitely call before booking to check on the status of the renovations and construction the rooms on the executive floor are great but the lobby is under construction and definitely isnt going to wow anyone looking for an impressive lobby area and then there is some drilling and other construction going on elsewhere our room on the 21st executive floor is somehow near a construction zone for some reason a lot of these issues are just fine if you are spending your day at universal studios the location is perfect for that and if you love sushi there are tons of great sushi joints nearby including some of the best in the city but if you are planning on doing work during the day like me andor relaxing in the room it might be a bit less;3
we are a family of 4 adults now and the beds were small but doable but we are average size people if youâre tall or large it would be hard to sleep two the rooms are spacious though good location and the price is on the low end so no complaints;3
after reading reviews here i was a little iffy but the price was great for manhattan 85 for a double hall bath and especially for the really wonderful location pretty and convenient to subways busses and central park i checked prices online and called directly and asked them to give me the same price as an online site because their direct price was higher they did i also asked for the best room and apparently that worked because as i found out later they switched us to the newer section after my request newer is a relative term i guess the good news is it was very clean especially the shared bathshower we never had to wait since there were two bathrooms on the floor had a sink in the room albeit chipped a tv which worked enough for us to watch something;3
myself and partner stayed here for 5 nights there for a special birthday we received an upgrade and champagne excellent good service although on two mornings housekeeping knocked and woke us up despite there being a do not disturb sign on the door room nice bathroom clean all good but then on the last day i was extremely ill we asked to keep the room as our flight was not until 11pm given that i couldnt stop being sick they wanted to charge an additional 350 dollars plus tax for the sake of 8 hours not good then i progressively got worse so my partner asked if the hotel could get a doctor i was in the lobby sat there all day being extremely sick and probably disturbing everyone they told us they couldnt because we had checked out not good service at all nobody;3
the location of the hotel is perfect its close to shops and restaurants a few blocks from subway station and a pleasant walk from times square hotel lobby is charming and checkin was quick and easy rooms are safe and clean however too small and dated the main problem during our stay were low outside temperatures that werent compensated by proper heating the airconditioning was actualling cooling our room which meant i has to sleep in jumper and socks to stay warm;3
nice location and great employees buy property overall is in need of updating looks like shortcuts are taken to keep restrooms up but overall decor is dark and dated windows donât appear to be double paned as the noise level was extreme i feel that money is better spent at a more uptodate hotel;3
my room appeared to be clean except when i went to put left over food items in my frigthere i found 4 half full bottles of soda left by the previous hotel guest i also found some trash under my bed and what appeared to be the cap of a syringe on the side of my nightstand those 2 things put a damper on my hotel experience;3
we recently spent five days in this hotel in uptown manhattan we were on a tight budget and this was one of the cheapest hotels that we could find on the internet on arrival after a two and a half hour trip on the super shuttle bus from jfk airport which should only have taken one hour it actually took an hour to go the length of the queensborough bridge we found the checking in procedure to be easy and efficiently handled our room was on the 5th floor and the window overlooked the yard within the centre of the hotel this did not bother us unduly and actually meant that we heard no external noise great when you are trying to sleep the room was adequately furnished although it all had a tired and drab appearance the good points were the helpfulness of all the staff;3
not good experience pool was not available for several hours the air conditioner was broken in the room making terrible noises bottle water which was part of the deal daily was not available the front desk staff not friendly when asked a question they seemed like they were annoyed;3
my husband and i stayed at the astor on the park for a two night weekend getaway we booked online through nychotelscom and got an excellent rate for the central park area the hotel is located at the northwest corner of central park at 106th st on central park west it is a quick 5 minute walk to the subway stops at 103rd st or 110th st we really liked the location as it is outside of the hustle bustle of the southern end of central park we had a room that faced central park the room itself is tiny but clean there was one double bed and an armoire that had a closet and a television set some of the channels didnt come in very well on the tv but we werent there to spend time in the room the bathroom was a good size and had all the amenities we;3
just back from the hotel last week wasnt actually staying at this hotel but moved after the one i was staying in had bed bugs which we seen when moving the pillows this hotel but clean and average as expectedis every days hotel not more or less average but clean and comfortable the room was small but was cleaned everyday seen no bed bugsroaches the hotel was getting mantainence work so wasnt exactly tidy but i wasnt in very much not sure if i would stay again as i would rather put more money for an expensive hotel;3
the hotel was fine the breakfast was just what you need to start the day the only bad thing is that the maids stole from our suitcase the keychains we had bought for family and friends we notice that when we came back home from our vacation so my recommendation is keep all your souvenirs in the safe or lock your suitcases of course little souvenirs are easy to stole and fit in your packet;3
we stayed here in room 504 for 5 nights from 20th january upon check in we had our credit card swiped i read that there was a residency fee of 1995 per night for the room which i was totally not aware of or told when booking the holiday in may 2018 or advised of during check in at the hotel the signage on the reception desk is very small and can be easily missed i challenged this with reception on three occasions over three days who told us we had to pay this as it was for complimentary snacks and drinks not complimentary in my book as im paying the fee for it finally crystal spoke to a manager who informed her that as i had booked prior to october 2018 when this was introduced this would not apply to us for the stay negatives were the room was on the small;3
reading the reviews i was really not looking forward to staying but it was fine the room which to me was the most important was a good sized twin room crisp clean bedding no wildlife a fridge mugs plates cutlery if you wanted to use the basic kitchen facilities it used to be an old hospital the layout rooms havent really changed tiled corridors which are a bit echoy and it really isnt a visually appealing place but if like us you were spending your money on a gig drinks it was a more than adequate base i think spending months there would be a bit depressing but where else in london could you afford to stay for months there was work being done on our floor so i am guessing they are upping the game a little the gentleman at reception was;3
comfy bed good lobby area and roof top bar useful to have open until 1 am rooms small need to get a queen bed even then small little room to hang clothes corner rooms seemed more spacious no complimentary water in room;3
we stayed at the hollywood hotel for 4 nights and found the hotel to be a bit far from anywhere having only a few days to explore the tourist areas we had to catch a subway down to the main area the hotel seemed to be in a bit of a dodgy area for a hotel we thought was in the heart of hollywood the hotel itself was nice comfy bed good breakfast and amenities like pool and gym next time we will look for somewhere walking distance to restaurants shops and tourist sites if it was just a little closer to the main area we would have been very happy;3
for the last 7 or more yeats i have stayed a week at the new yorker for my annual business trip to manhattan this year the hotel was not nearly as nice as in years past for one thing only three of the six elevators are operational it took a very long time just to get in and out of the hotel each time they have also taken the coffee makers out of the room and if you want one it will cost you 25 per day finally they check in process took a very long time the man apologized saying that he was having a hard time finding a room for us this was disappointing as i had made the reservations and paid for them a month prior to my arrival i did the recheck in the night before and i arrived at the hotel at the time i said i would;3
we booked this hotel because it said it had a pool but itâs just a glorified plunge pool the room was small and the bathroom was awkward no door on the shower so there was always a lake on the floor to mop up and you had to bend around the corner of a wall to use the sink the wifi was intermittent so choose somewhere else if you need reliable internet for business purposes street noise is not dampened at all by the windows and the mount sinai sirens were pretty constant it is close to shopping and central park though the rooftop lounge is a nice touch;3
initially i would have given this hotel a very good review if you book the king room the room is spacious and the views of the mountains are quite nice however if you book a room with two beds the room is half the size and the views i had were of the parking lot if you can get the king room then book here if not then stay at any holiday inn or the like because youll get the same basic room for a lot less than staying here;3
room was clean but 1 washcloth for 2 people in 4 days we could not find ice machine or vending machines it is only 3 blocks from subway which was nice very quiet area but had a fellow guest playing the same song over and over until midnight;3
i spent 3 nights here there is no internet in the rooms so im not sure what makes this a 4 star hotel the giant sign was kinda tacky and gave a motel vibe the lobby is the best part of our entire stay free wife and looks updated the rooms are small pillows uncomfy and paint is peeling off the walls the coffee and tea in the rooms is not free its 3 and you would think they would give you free water wrong 8 bottle ridiculous money grab;3
perfect location was attending a conference at alice tully hall very nice staff and kind of funky lobby room tiny no space for your laptop theres all kind of junk you dont need like a kurig coffee thing on the tiny desk they charge for inroom wifi my shower was horrible only has a partial door so cold air hits you and then the rain style shower head just barely dripped tepid water on me really the only major drawback was that shower everything else was pleasant enough good rm service omlette and in a great location;3
nice area easy access to the bars and restaurants in universal the food in the hotel was expensive the room was good but was cleaned late and not very well i never understand why you pay for wifi 28 a day for parking as a guest is outrageous the concierge was unbelievably helpful as were the bar staff;3
the rooms were adequate and clean hotel is old and in dire need of updating elevators were dirty with trash inside them doormen do not open doors they just stand around taxi called for us charge more than the metered cabs which we did not know ahead of time they also do not accept credit card cardsonly cash;3
it was a nice stay employees were friendly the hotel has an excellent location and provides a good service towels were and sheets were daily changed however it should be nicer if dust was removed from furnitures carpet was vacuumed and blanket was eventually changed;3
this was the second time i stayed here first time my room was halfway down a corridor and was at the back of the hotel this time i was close to the toilets and over the street and the noise was dramatically different banging doors and traffic kept me awake most of the night buti had a view of the statue of liberty this time round my only reason for not asking to be moved the air con was completely useless and most of the tv channels had frozen quite cheap for nyc but not overly impressed this visit;3
it is an old hotel and it is not very comfortable but i was having such a great time in new york that i didnt mind for me the hotel was just to get some rest i also had a great deal on the room rate the hotel is close to the subway station which helped me a lot and also near to the central park;3
the first impression of the hotel was good but a few things didnt really work the pool was closed a lot and that was one of the main reasons i booked it since we traveled with kids the roof top was great though wonderful views the room was a bit too small for 2 adults 2 kids and a baby there was no room to walk the air condition was loud and kept waking us up at night;3
this is a historical hotel and you can tell lobby was beautiful staff were awesome and very polite elevators ran very slow leaving you waiting for a ride or deciding to take the service elevators instead because they were faster room was small but if your in your room too long in nyc go home bathroom needed updating big time but the pillows and bed were comfortable we slept like babies the tick tock diner connected to hotel was delicious this hotel is very centrally located to everything and worth it;3
i have stayed here in the past small but ok this last visit i discovered that that the rooms have not been maintained shotty showers bar not refilled ac grills dented this last time i had a city view and the room was a challenge to move about inby myself the bathroom was beyond tinyim a 56 womensize 2 no vanity and i had to put a towel down in the sink in order to have a place to set my makeup etccalled the spa and heard women yelling abt appts etcjoke and hung up third and last time pros great lounge feel when you enter and location is central starbucks rosa mexicana and pjclarkss around the corner dont stay here and you can leave your xanax at home;3
stayed here for one night i live in nj but wanted to spend the night in the city for my birthday room was small but clean and we spent very little time at the hotel its in a nice neighborhood and the surrounding area is nice and safe which is all i wanted not the nicest hotel but its the best you will find for a reasonable price on the upper west side;3
the location is awesome across from lincoln center near central park and columbus circletime warner center it is not that inexpensive lobby is beautiful elevators are pretty good but dont take the stairs our room had a view of an air shaft and trouble with temperature control we had to use the air conditioning when it was 40 degrees out because there was some other source of heat that made the room uncomfortable housekeeping sometimes came and helped us as late as 5 pm that was very nice the shower enclosure was strange even compared to europeanstyle showers there was no way to avoid getting water on the floor they had run out of cream and sugar and didnt supply it for the coffee for several days they tried to charge us for extra decaf coffee and;3
as expected in that it is fine and would suit a lot of people looking for a bargain and somewhere to be in for a few hours overnight but i wouldnt do again pros the location is amazing tube very accessible nearby and lots of restaurants and shops there was a locker room available to drop our bags off first the value of the room the facilities are just fine and you get what you pay for fridge available in the room cons the walls are so thin to the hallway you hear absolutely everything it is just so loud which is why i wouldnt stay again on the floor we stayed on the toilets wasnt malefemale it was mixed which i didnt like there were showers available for womenmen only i didnt look in or use the kitchen there is a tvlounge type room as well which i didnt;3
this hotel has nothing exceptionnal but is a very good price vs quality value the room is clean the sheets and towels are changed every day the service is minimum but the people can help and answer your questions i was afraid to have a bas experience by reading other reviews but it was a good surprise;3
first i would like to say it is no hilton marriott or w hotel property however you arent paying those prices at least when you book thru a 3rd party like hotelscom etc the hotel rooms me and my friends had wasnt by any means grand but they were comfortable enough to stay in and gave us a real feel of how it would be to live in new york i felt the rooms were spacious enough though they were dated if you are on a budget and want to stay damn near in the center of manhattan just to experience the city of new york this hotel would be a good choice there were several stores and restaurants near by also it is no where from the subway and express train into times square another thing the staff accidentally tore my friends bag handle and we were accommodated with a free;3
i found our stay at the hilton to be average quite underwhelming to what i am used to expect from the hilton brand although the staff was nice it just didnt feel like a happy place i stayed here 2 nights and the prior 3 nights were at a hilton doubletree in claremont having compared the 2 i wasnt excited with this pricier hotel i used to live in los angeles and always drove by this hotel so for nostalgia i picked this hotel i wanted it to be more it just wasnt however the hotel was located super close to universal and thats what i paid for the parking fees were ridiculous i paid 28day parked my car when we got there and it didnt move until we left just was too high a fee on top of the cost of the room also one of the elevators broke down we;3
the hotel is a surprise a pleasant surprise due in part to the area around it first the hotel it is nicely maintained the rooms while not overly large and theres no closet more than met our needs the hotel was quiet and there was a full breakfast complete with omelette station included with the room due and the dining area is really nice but be prepared the area around the hotel while not bad is also not particularly glamorous that great photo of the entrance is not the street view of the hotel but from the parking lot or course once you check in you do enter via the parking lot we were taking in a show at the pantages and this was a convenient stay i guess thats the key here its a great place to stay you will be driving to the areas you;3
this is my second visit to the new yorker i think i booked more as it held very sentimental memories of my first ever visit and this rhine i was lucky enough to bring my daughter and was excited to show her bits of fond memories the first being when i was 21 and i am now 37 nothing has changed at all the room itself was very clean and comfortable we were 4 in a room and it was tiny we had no where to hang our clothes so had to live out of our cases which was also hard as there was no where to put them didnât spoil our time as we literally only slept there location is brilliant and the pizza place across the road is amazing my issue was with the staff on reception clueless and rude come to mind iâve been charged the equivalent of â£15 for a bottle of water which i;3
booked this months in advance for a special birthday trip and then contacted the hotel explaining that it was for a special stay the hotel replied but not saying they would help me with my request hugely disappointed to find the room we were given had a damaged bath with flaking sharp coating given another room that was basic and smelled strongly of fresh paint and was far from anything special and certainly not worth the money the reception staff in general seemed to look upon the guests as just more people bringing money to the hotel and certainly didnt feel valued refused to let the way they looked down on us ruin a great trip to nyc but having stayed in another hotel on a previous trip where i felt like i mattered i couldnt recommend this one sadly;3
this is a great location across the street from the lincoln center lobby area and bar are very nice but the room is very tight no viewwifi should be free as in most hotels nowadays and secured with a paassword bathroom has absolutely no counter space;3
just make sure you are aware we had a great stay but when we returned home we noticed a nice chunk out of our bank account having already paid for our hotel room through lastminutecom we were shocked we immediately phoned the jane to be brushed off by the receptionists saying it was the 50 deposit we had paid â£330 doesnt 50 so we persisted and then spoke to someone else who inmformed us it was 50 deposit a day news to us we were then told this money would be transferred back into our accounts after 10 days 10 days as irritating as it is calling the states to find this out we decided to wait it out 10 days passed so i phoned them again this time i again explained the situation to be told once again by a receptionist that it should be in my account i;3
stayed here for 1 night 2 adults 2 kids big 15 big 7yo 2 small double beds also the toilet blocked leaked all over the bathroom floor it was only wee luckily one of those things but not that good when its 3am a guy plunging away your toilet it didnt get fixed while we were there but we were out by 8am;3
hotel was clean and adequate with a reasonably comfortable bed and decor reminiscent of american horror story hotel am i mixing up my art styles in any event i was ready to love this place great interesting architecture good energy among the other guests etc but was quite surprised by the 2500 daily facility fee that was tacked onto the price identified on the booking site that i used i am very aware of the steep fees and taxes that the city charges in connection with a hotel room however those were always represented as hey not our charges the city imposes them which i understand looking to exploit the situation it appears that many city hotels now charge a facility charge or similar addon fee for phone gym wifi etc with no opt out;3
i was astonished when i entered my room for the first time and saw purple neon lights under the bed i almost cancel my stay thinking this was some sort of bordello i requested the front desk to turn these lights off since they also disturbed me at night there was no switch to turn them off the corridors are so narrow that they do not have the appearance of an hotel 200 per night no breakfast was included and the coupons i was offered included a fast food restaurant extremely poor in hygiene to which i visited only once during my 12day stay elevators were extremely slow and tow of them were out of service during my whole stay it is very unfortunate that an hotel with such a very good location is kept in such borderline conditions;3
i love the hotel the location but i did pay for two rooms with tv but nothing the wifi was awful impossible to connect and the only nice people was vã­ctor very kind and helpful the best one the administrator was rude every time;3
ive got a trip planned for nyc next week and i have this hotel booked from july 1420 i am extremely nervous about my experience given all the bad reviews obviously the people who paid for the premium rooms will get premium services but those who reserved a standard room like me will have to be weary of any extra charges and disappointing rooms i really hope we get at least 2 beds for our rooms but i keep hearing the majority of people will only get 1 bed sighhh i rarely get time off from work and this is the only holiday i have planned for the year i hope its enjoyable thanks for all the reviews guys expectations has been established;3
room was small but with a cupboard so able to store bags no tv in room bed and bedding clean with comfortable bed bathroom old and a little run down the rooms had thin walls and you could hear everything from other rooms;3
three friends of mine and i have been in this hostel in a fourbed room so the experience has been a little bit different from what you usually have in a hostel the room was enough clean but very small for four adult male people it was very warm though there were not a lot of people in the hostel so the common kitchen and bathroom were quite comfortable to use even if there wasnt any pot in the kitchen when it comes to service and staff very disappointed some members of the staff are very impolite and i think that 1â£ for a hour of wifi in london in 2018 is a shame;3
overall nice apartments for the money we paid this is not a hotel so there is no room service wake up calls and etc it has a small kitchenette with microwave stow and the fridge some plates pans and other tableware available there is a huge very inexpensive grocery store just next block from the apartment building we saved bunch of money on food cooking at the room instead of dining out however there is minimum furniture in the room and bed linen is not really clean good enough so it might scare u a bit at the beginning but nothing cost that cheap in this area it is one block away from the subway three blocks from central park and 15 minutes walking distance from natural history museum there are also plenty stores around and places to eat i would stay here again;3
the location made this place a gem of a hotel at a great price close to the subway central park and all the museums and its really quiet compared to other places we have stayed downtown the first 2 nights we stayed in a renovated room and then had to move as we wanted to stay 2 more nites to an old roomits an old hotel needing some love is all i will say just make sure to allow extra time for exiting the building as the elevator is small and you can wait 34 trips to get down to the lobby from your floor;3
we have just come back from new york on the 9 jan 2008 after spending 5 nights there this hotel was fine we had no problems i was very apprehensive after reading the reviews as we stayed neared the theatre district last time but we were pleasently surprised ok so its not the plaza but it doesnt pretend to be it is a bit out of the way but we were grateful at night as it was very quiet and we had a room on the central park west side and slept with the window open the subway is a great way to get round there is a station on 103rd street only 3 blocks awayapprox 5mins to walk we got a 7 day pass for 24 it took approx 25 mins to get to battery park which is right at the other end the room its self was fine too small but comfortable it you are not expecting a;3
we stayed at the empire for 3 nights as a short city break on our way through to mexico the hotel itself wasnât honestly to our taste it was described as chic but it was more of an excuse for old fashioned and quite dark in communal areas but to be fair when we booked it we was only looking for a clean comfortable base as we knew we would be out early and back due to being out exploring the city and it was just that âbasic clean and comfortableâ the bathroom was very small you put your arms out and touch both walls coffee facilities are in the room but 300 per paper cup and no milk or sugar starbucks directly outside and only 250 per cup the dã©cor was very dated but the staff were all very nice and helpful the location of the hotel was perfect for all the main;3
if you are visiting universal studios and i would recommend the vip tour there then the hilton is a short 510 minute walk away the rooms are large but the only word i can think of is grotty and the place has a run down feel to it insects in the room including mosquitos drove me mad on the first night room service is quick and reasonable overall impression is ok but not great;3
we stayed here while visiting universal the only nice thing i can say is that it is convenient to the park the hotel is not upgraded the beds were uncomfortable tv ancient and the lobby is under construction the reservation was nonrefundable with no mention of construction which was convenient for them and disappointing for us it would not be pleasing to eat at the hotel restaurants as the construction is literally steps away we self parked and the entire parking structure smells so strongly of an ashtray we had to shower from walking through there;3
we stayed at the ramada for 1 night at the end of march 09 i paid aprox â£55 per room so didnt expect to much we were pleasantly surprised when entering the reception looked like a very nice hotel the rooms were small compared to a standard room in the usa but fine for a brit the rooms had a balcony over looking a lovely courtyard also had a fridge and a microwave everything was clean plenty towels the hotel itself had good faculties 3 saunas although only one was working a steam room nice pool small gift shop laundry room free internet in the rooms pay internet on pc in reception breakfast was buffet style and included in the room price waffles made to order we great the rest was basic few choices of cereal bread for toast bagels my husband had;3
stayed one night before alining home seems we used to stay at the hilton down the street but now we are staying here room was super clean with what looked like new carpeting didnt like the windows in the room made it feel cell like they put me in a handicap room even though i presented my hyatt platinum member card when i checked in i hate when they do that but room was clean and new sink area in bathroom had very limited counter space to put toiletries and even less since the bath towels were stacked there too bed seemed stiff bed stands had plenty of places to plug things in room had bath robe slippers and an alternate blanket that was nice a lot of tile in the bathroom to have to walk on because of the toilet placement since it was a handicap room;3
pros great location close to penn station walkable to times square clean rooms but they could use some updating wifi worked perfectly rooms were sound proofed cons 3 out of 5 elevators were out of serviceso long waits bathrooms were ancient no coffee machines in the room starbucks across the street they charge a resort fee upon check out;3
stayed here rooms very basic reception didnât really speak to us and give us any information about the hotel so not sure why iâve paid â£57 for a âfacility feeâ wind coming through the windows despite closed heard the receptionist telling another to down grade us again not sure why they did this wouldnât stay again;3
i came to the jane on a friday night having booked it at the suggestion of a friend who wanted to share a bunk bed room with me my friend had to cancel at the last minute due to a family emergency the restaurant was very good it was a pleasant enough room well appointed but certainly designed for the minimalist traveler it would be hard to share the space with a second person and have any sort of privacy or room for baggage i could hear music from multiple sources until 34 am and people chatting in rooms as i walked by despite the heavy wooden walls and decor its a great hotel if you enjoy clubbing and meeting new friends while brushing your teeth i likely wont stay there again unless my husband a diver wants to check it out or i have a trip to new york;3
very convenient located but the space is small do not let the pictures fool you with that said we hardly spent any time in the room except to shower and to sleep so it was okay do note that there are student residents on several floors of the hotel so you are likely to run into skimpy dressed individuals who drown themselves in cologne and perfume in the evening our room only had one set of towels and to get another set took over an hour overall very clean the ac functioned well it is across the street from madison square garden valet parking will cost you 60day they charge you a service fee which gives you free wifi you cannot opt out of it and it is 29day;3
id stayed at the new yorker way back in 1963 with my family so i wanted to repeat the experience check was fun we hit at a bad time so we had to wait in line a wee while i had booked 2 metro rooms one double and one with two doubles on checking in i was informed of a 34 tax per night that had never been mentioned even though my voucher clearly stated accommodation and taxes i did eventually sorted this challenge out with my agentbut it should not have happened in the first place the check in clerk was most pleased telling me hed got the rooms on the same floor albeit on the opposite side of the huge hotel the two double room was a metro room but mine was not so i popped down to reception who sorted out the second challenge and gave me a room just one door away;3
best thing about this hotel is the location you are yards away from the subway station entrance and only 10 minutes to time square the staff was friendly and room was clean this is a room you would pay 50 a night for at a turnpike exit neighborhood was very nice definetely felt safe here biggest complaint was that the windows were covered only with cheap plastic blinds so even in the middle of the night the street lights made it seem like daytime and there was no barrier to the street noise the tv was an old big box that only got 10 channels old time elevators but good old building with good noise barrier to other rooms our room was right behind the elevator and we didnt hear a thing except everything going on outside there is a cafe right across the;3
the best thing about this hotel is location right in the thick of it and subway on the doorstep lots of elevators so no waiting around to get to your room staff generally polite and helpful although we did have to wait 45 minutes for toilet roll when insufficient for 24h left in the room when cleaned in the morning room was pretty small and pretty basic apart from the lobby pretty much all communal areas and certainly our room were in need of redecorating and updating despite the age however everything seemed pretty clean overall we had a good stay but be aware of the mandatory facilities fee of 45 a day which was not in the small print of the website we booked through maybe expected by us citizens but we certainly didnt expect it on top of their high rate not a;3
after swearing the place off for a few years i decided to give it another try the service was much better the rooms are small but if you just need a convenient and comfortable place for a couple days its fine i had booked the hotel through a travel site and paid in advance i like to have the room charges and taxes out of the way before any of my trips i arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or i could pay a 50 fee and theyd put me in a room early ive not seen hat option in a long time i decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as i had places to go and things to do the morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door i expected the 50 plus tax for the early check in i did not expect an additional;3
checked in on december 3rd at first i had my concerns because of the area that the hotel is located i made them show me a room before we checked in we determined that the room was fine we decided to stay they have a free breakfast which is fine very accommodating and friendly the omelet station needs a little work on speeding up the process the room was nice the floors are all laminate no carpet they should be mopped every day my feet were dirty after taking a shower the ceiling and walls had a lot of cracks that should be repaired the balcony was drab and worn elevators are very slow;3
spent a weekend in new york city with family this hotel was in good location very close to subway only a couple stops from times square nice selection of restaurants in the neighborhood the area felt very safe walking in the evening was very comfortable i rented two rooms my room was small and had no view at all unless you like to look at four walls it was clean and offered all i needed the bed was very comfortable my sons room across the hall was a little larger with a flat screen tv and a pleasant street view of the area no breakfast was included the elevators were small slow and not air conditioned i was glad i had only 6 floors i would recommend this hotel for anyone who needs a clean comfortable and convenient place to sleep at the end of a busy day;3
the guests should be informed that they need to notify the front desk that they want housekeeping services other then that we enjoyed the lounge area and bartender and jeff at the front door who was extremely helpful in our inquiries and arranging our early departure;3
i am a hilton honors member visiting ca for first time son graduated college and got a job came all the way from fl so i picked hilton near universal because i thought it would be like the one in orlando safe and clean disappointed got parking lot view excellent location room large super comfy beds and pillows walking distance to universal all uphill though problem paid 28 a day for 5 days not once did our parking card work not once to get out not once to get back in no one at desk cared and acted like i was doing something wrong i was sliding it with man working there helping me never worked marianne only one behind desk ever to offer an apology no one ever super friendly next time trying a hotel closer to beach;3
we were recommended this property from our travel agent and a brief google search gave us some optimism it was a 4star hotel in a great location so what could go wrong we were prepared for the 35 city tax per room per night so that wasnt a shock to us the rooms are very small and outdated coming from london we are used to some small hotel rooms but this was beyond belief once you had your suitcase and other belongings in the room you had no moving space the hallways are a dirty brown colour and they look like they have not been updated for 2030 years the location is great you are right next to madison square gardens penn station and a host of other places it is pretty easy for you to get around new york with cabs ubers and the subway we were;3
the room was small and very dark the internet was slow tv remote was missing bathroom wasnt totally clean each day it seemed as if a different elevator was broken the door men were less than friendly barely said hello and at checkout they werent able to give me a copy of the bill which i needed to submit since it was a business trip i was here on business and it was a very convenient location for meetings and overall the stay was fine but i wouldnt recommend staying here if you can find an alternative;3
i stay at this hotel mostly for work the professional photos do it no justice as the rooms are getting very used and if you look closely youll notice things falling apart wood frames are cracking bathroom tiles need repair and door handles have been drilled so many times you can see through the cracks between the handles and the doors one of my coworkers stayed in a room on the 7th floor and noticed there were ear plugs offered by the bedside he realized at night it was because there was a lot of noise surrounding the room and obviously the hotel knew about it by offering complimentary ear plugs its in a convenient location staff are helpful and its relatively clean;3
middling hotel with a good location nothing terribly wrong but nothing distinctive unless the pool changes thingsit was closed when i stayed in midjune ac unit was loud and standalone underneath the window theres a special place in hell for hotels that still charge for internet access its crass and demeaning to guests and it does influence where i choose to stay in the future;3
we spent two nights at this the only great thing about it is itâs location walking distance from metro station but it doesnât justify the very high prices they charge in exchange to the value you gain hotel we paid 632 ð¤ª rooms are very small no fridge or you can pay to get one no breakfast included not even a coffee machine or complementary drinking water fitness center is small and there is no swimming pool even lobby is not a good place for me this was my first hotel to stay at new york ever but i wouldnât recommend or get back to it ð;3
from reading the other reviews i am sorry to say that they speak the truth with regards the downsides the lifts are always breaking down and date from many decades ago the room furnishings are all heavily worn the bathroom suffers from water damage due to only a single pane of glass on what should be a sliding door shower enclosure the boiler broke down which i presume is also old and in need of replacement and there was no hot water in the entire hotel the night we arrived very expensive room snacks on the positives great location and once refurbished which starts next year will be an option worth considering beds are comfortable if you like them firm which i personally do great roof top bar with a popular club for those that like to party newly;3
good location about 10 mins drive from the walk of shame etc clean enough but bit grubby in the corners though this is my experience of many hotels at this level i paid for an extra bed and was questioned at reception as to whether i still wanted it which i found a bit odd on checking in i was advised that parking was not free but was in fact 24 dollars a day when i stated that i was not aware of it and hadnt seen it mentioned on the website the receptionist said its all over the website which i found very unhelpful and unnecessary ive just checked and its definitely not mentioned on the mobile site i booked thru an agent agoda and it was not mentioned in the confirmation either this of course bumps up the cost per night however;3
i actually enjoyed most of my stay at the janeliked the room 549 and its proximity to the bathroom but had a serious issue at the end of my stay the hotel uses a funky key system that involves an electronic key and a metal rod that turns on all of the power except for an overhead light that works all the time i had the option of lugging it around with me or dropping it off at the desk and picking up a new one on my way back in i picked the latter option everything was fine and dandy until i came back late thursday nightfriday morning to find that there were no keys left the man at the front desk looked high and low for one but ended up having to let me in the room with his master key however no rod which meant no electricity other than the overhead light since;3
firstly if youve already booked the empire dont worry its fine however if you havent booked i would probably look elsewhere the hotel location is brilliant but its a little tired and the rooms are small we were a family of 4 sharing a room with 2 double beds and were completely on top of one another perhaps with this occupancy the winged armchair wasnt necessary we had a couple of small problems with housekeeping which took two attempts to sort out but even then a full solution wasnt arrived at the aircon was noisy at night and the lobby bar uncomfortably freezing cold having said this the hotel is clean the staff courteous and the rate reasonable;3
lots of pros and cons for this hotel whose web site lauds its lavish rooms pro location cheerful and friendly guys at the front door not so much at the front desk lovely rooftop pool deck and lounge efficient service for our small convention good food window in room that actually opened rational level ie not arctic of air conditioning in public areas con room was tiny by any standards lighting too dim for reading bathroom so small it was easier to towel off in the bedroom cold water in shower for the first 10 minutes hot by 20 minutes five mornings in a row a vast array of items for sale pods for the inroom coffee maker water at 750 a throw snacks and whatnot taking up valuable real estate with not so much as a complimentary tea bag paper;3
normally i would give a hilton hotel a much higher better review but in this situation where i was not informed at either booking ing or check in about the renovation noise the mind you went from 9am to 8pm monday to saturday all i know is 5 minuets down the road is a lovely hotel at a third the cost includes breakfast this is a â4 starâ hotel where they even charge you 30 per night to park your car this time i was not happy while the renovations are on i suggest looking elsewhere;3
first of all if you are booking this hotel and expecting 45 star luxury then book the sheraton hilton or whatever other hotel it is not even close if you are looking for a inexpensive place to sleep that is comfortable enough then this is the place for you the bed was comfortable the room clean enough bathroom space was adequate subway within walking distance plenty of places to grab a bite duane reed right downstairs would i recommend it to someone sure but i would warn that this is a no frills hotel that does the job of a nights sleep would i stay there again no only because i would rather stay in times square;3
this hotel is an affortable hotel in expensive manhattan its location is close to subway lines and many good restaurants except for just remodelled business rooms on the top two floors most of the rooms look worn out hallways can be very hot in the summer making you sweat while waiting for the elevators also one of the elevators does not work most of time overall if you dono want to spent too much for hotels this hotel will work for you;3
because of hurricane sandy the elevator tv and wifi were down but the staff was uniformly gracious and concerned sharing the bath was never a problem the shower is terrific and the towels wonderful and everything clean there are only hooks for hanging things so either plan on laying things flat or bring a few hangars the cafe on the ground floor is bright and has a good menu on weekends one might prefer a room higher up to avoid traveling sound of the music in the groundfloor bar though they said at the desk that had i called down they would have told the bartender to turn it down an easy walk from a number of restaurants shops and the entrance to the high line and taxis nearby;3
i stayed for 2 weeks in this hotel room is clean as well as the bathroom many things need improvement like towels which in many cases were old and not soft to the touch there is no safe box in room the rooms are noisy you can hear steps from people walking im hallways for instance there are not many services like room service restaurants or microwaves but you can walk a block and there is a deli in which you can have breakfast lunch or dinner and use their wifi for free subway is two blocks away so there is no big deal if you want to visit downtown or uptown staff is extremely friendly i must mention sonya which was our housekeeper she took care of our room and was always attentive to our requests;3
my room had a very bad order and toilet area was not cleaned properly the hotel staff was amazing but for the price i paid for room it could have better i was very disappointed with my room at the hilton;3
when we checked in we received a nice gift from the hotel staff because it was our anniversary we also received an unknown upgrade charge upon our exit we did not ask for an upgrade nor were we told we were receiving an upgrade i did not report the additional charge as we had to leave to catch a train;3
first of all i stayed in one of the capt cabins so quite a large room and ensuite it was a fairly expensive rate for one night considering the air con was very loud and fairly weak the ceiling fan did a better job i gave up on the air con half way through the night bed was pretty average saying that though the staff were very friendly the location is excellent and as a concept type hotel its a lot of fun id recommend going for a cheap room so you know exactly what youre getting;3
had just spent three nights at the park vue anaheim before switching to the hilton park vue had more comfortable beds and pillows bigger tv screens free wifi free breakfast many low cost restayrants in walking distance and free parking the hilton had a nicer bathroom and a bigger bedroom witha nicer parking lot view the desk phone staff were short and unhelpful the concierges were nice;3
i went to new york on july 12016 hotel checking went pretty good got the room right away the room was small but it was clean bathroom also very small but clean the housekeeping was good also security was very good no outsider could get in all guest had to show room key to get into the elevator;3
the rooms are small but well kept for new york the small rooms are probably not unusual but being from the wide open spaces of texas not what im used to the beds are comfortable and luckily the famous flat pillow craze of texas and costa rica hotels hasnt caught on here yet the towel situation is a bit lacking as in having hand towels is sporadic and hanging them anywhere but the pull out mirror is an impossibility at the time of our visit only one of four elevators worked regularly with another working sporadically and two others out of order completely the hotel otherwise is pretty good;3
we stayed here for 4 nights it was a last minute find as i didnt realise how exy accom was in nyc and how much it was booked up very convenient location to two metro lines that get you pretty much anywhere in nyc so location is excellent we spent most time out and about so crashing for night was no biggie wife didnt like it much thought she saw the ghost of a man who she suspects was killed there private bathroom was clean wasnt great value as we booked last minute within 2 weeks but it did us fine even travelling with a baby who slept in the stroller it is not luxury by any means but provided and excellent base for touring nyc easily by metro bed not that comfy if youre happy to sleep basic in the city that never sleeps then stay here as it is convenient;3
this property was chosen by my employer based on its proximity to our event at jazz at lincoln center the hotel was very convenient i was able to make several runs back to the hotel without the hassle of catching a cab there were plenty of restaurants close by as well as a drug store the hotel was very dark in general the worse part of the hotel was the gym the plaster was literally falling from the ceiling the basement level where the gym was housed was extremely dark scary and smelled of mildew the elevators got stuck quite a few times as well my room had a view of a brick wall;3
we recently just come back from the new yorker we stayed for 5 nights the hotel is in a great location the hotel is good value for money the rooms are a little old fashioned and could do with up dating but very clean there are a few things that i would say about the hotel we had to pay 5 dollars a bag to leave at the hotel before check in and after check out which i think is a little naughty we should be able to leave our bags at the hotel free of charge for all the money we have paid also when we arrived at the hotel they ask for your debit card this is incase of damages now we were not informed of this before hand and also the amount it would be 180 and it was taken out of our account and left us a little short and told it will take 56 days to go back into our;3
bottomline upfront just ok no frills hotel close to universal studios amusement park pros you can walk to universal studios if you have to which we did on way back the valet team is great when their shuttle broke down they took us in our own car cons shuttle broke down breakfast buffet staff way to over worked and too many table for each waiter to handle not fair to staff hotel was under renovation which was noisy and caused very long lines to checkout bathroom was dirty and had human hair on floor after checkin we alerted the front desk in person and nothing was done about it during our stay big problem when you have children and a baby recommend only sleep here to be close to the park;3
i reserved a standard queen room on expedia for 190night the website notes that these are queen beds but our room wasnt even large enough to fit a queen bed instead we had a full size bed and a bathroom where you could barely open the door ive stayed in nyc plenty of times and have never paid so much for such a small space with a view of the interior building furnace the good news is the location is good and staff was friendly however this room should have been further discounted because it is about half the size of their normal queen rooms and didnt include a queen bed maybe this hotel simply stiffs expedia travelers that would be pretty terrible if that is the case i will not stay at this hotel again there are plenty other places with friendly staff nice;3
walking distance to train and madison square garden request high level room for view room was ok on site restaurants great lobby always mobbed for some reason unsubscribe to their emails otherwise you will be bombarded;3
the rooms are small but comfy enough because you are mostly outside in the middle of the night weve heard some loude noise from the heating en it was very disturbing the night after weve shut our heating off so we could sleep but weve asked for an portable heating in the room and we did get it the staff is friendly and helpfull i will recomend this hotel for people who are just sleeping in the hotel and are willing to live back to basics for a couple off days;3
this hilton is old and dated and also expensive if you are travelling alone should you be on your way with smaller children a room with two queen beds is a good choice and worth the money sorry to say but here you pay for the location breakfast buffet is very nice but they also know to charge for thattoo much in my opinion service is great as it always is at hilton but they need to refurbish and look at the pricing the elevators are under renovation so that should be better in the near future the rooms are quite spacious but the walls are very very thin;3
great location and close proximity to universal studio and also hollywood one of the best customer service during check in check out which make you feel valued the let down is the hotel restaurant cafe sierra for the price you pay the food is absolutely terrible in taste the service is slow;3
we stayed here for three nights last week the only thing that saves this hotel from a 1 star is its location 1 room sizes are extremely small cannot even move around without bumping into someone or something 2 extremely old needs upgrading 3 bathrooms and closets are tiny just like the rooms 4 hallways have an old dingy smell 5 2900 a night fee for what no one knows 6 charge 400 per luggage bag to hold it if your flight is after checkout not sure why the 2900 night doesnt cover this i will not be rebooking this place like the title there is nothing special and it is over priced seems like there is not much you can do at hotels like this anyway but they need to stop charging the 2900 a night for amenities like the business center and the gym;3
i always give honest reviews and was a little disappointed with this hotel start with the negative we stayed 4 nights in one of the cheaper rooms well it must have been as the view was another hotel window on 33rd floor the room was tiny and the bottles of water they put were double the price of the 7eleven across the road loud roadworks could be heard as the windows didnât close properly the lifts were hit and miss it took 15mins to get to reception saturday morning as the full lift stopped on every floor down to 21 then went up again so annoying plus points location was excellent and felt safe as security wouldnât let you up without a door card how water bath and shower were ok the diner attached was top class see my tick tock review most importantly the bed and;3
slightly below average hotel good location and nice enough lobby and entrance but thats where it ends rooms could be cleaner and more money could be spent on better mattresses and linens old hard and uncomfortable with a dirty feel also i asked three times for a spare cot and was told it would be right up but we never saw it wasted some time waiting initially on the other hand every staff member was professional and friendly;3
the location of this hotel is great metro station is just 2 mins away and central park within walking distance upon arrival we had to change our room due to constant noise just outside of the room the new room was bigger but a strong smell of stale smoke the room itself needed a facelift the door didnt close properly the shower was half broken one of the bedside lamps didnt work the remote control for the tv didnt work the reception staff were friendly however we asked for a wake up call one morning at 430am and we didnt get itthank goodness for our alarms on our phones the concierge spoke to us like we were stupid telling us at 230pm that the stpatricks day parade had finished when it actually went on till 5pm thank goodness we ignored his advise and went;3
as you walk in the empire hotel almost feels like a 5 star hotel the service and staff at the front desk were excellent the rooms are ok nothing to brag about but if all you need the room for is to sleep then its acceptable the room and bathroom were very clean the issue with the room is the poor lighting and the very loud air conditioning unit the wifi was not reliable the coffee in the room was not complimentary and the price for the coffee 300 us per coffee pod was not included in the price list of items available in the fridge hence why i assumed the coffee was complimentary and only found out on my invoice;3
there are a lot of good things about this hotel the staff is helpful the location is good and the rooms and beds are comfortable but there is one huge if the bathrooms the firs room i was given had a totally dysfunctional shower the huge shower head was right in the center of the cubicle there was a glass wall that covered less than half the opening and nothing else when you turned on the shower the bathroom flooded within seconds when i called to complain i was told this was true of most of the rooms and i was offered additional bath mats to soak up the water but when i said this was unacceptable i was quickly given another much larger room with a tubshower unit with a full curtain everything else about the hotel was good but i would never take a;3
i based my trip on the review that i read here so maybe my expectations were too high the pros close to the citywalk clean great view the cons no one told us there was a shuttle to get to the citywalk when we finally figured it out the music in it was so loud and obnoxious every time that you couldnt hear the person next to you were talking axl rose screaming paradise city with the ride feeling more like the highway to hell not what i would expect for families the towels and even tissue were so rough it reminded me of nursing homes that have to use the harsh detergent to kill all the bugs lastly it was my daughters birthday so i had flowers delivered to the hotel the hotel never brought them up or even thought to let me know they were downstairs i;3
great location next to penn station and madison square garden stayed in a room with two double beds so a bit more spacious staff very pleasant apart from our first encounter with the lady on the reception desk who was not the most welcoming after a very long day traveling my credit card payment would not process so i had to give her 1000 dollars in cash she was not at all helpful i dont know what would have happened if i didnt have cash was she going to throw us out she certainly didnt offer any alternatives and her attitude tainted my whole experience of my stay in the hotel also the hidden charges are a major turn off 29 dollars per day extra charge which was not specified on booking however overall i enjoyed our stay in the hotel but i think i could have got;3
this was our 2nd stay the first being about a year ago the location is very convenient close to family we were visiting i had asked for a room like we had last year on one of the renovated upper floors but none was available we had a room on the 9th floor which was old looking but turned out to be ok the bed was comfortable ac fairly quiet and bathroom clean and presentable hot water took some time to come up but once it did it stayed hot for nyc the hotel is a decent value compared to the much higher costs of better hotels but there are tradeoffs you should be aware of the hotel is run down looking hall carpet torn here and there past water leaks evident walls heavily scuffed and patched up in places tv had just a few over the air channels with grainy;3
we were on the 12th floor the rooms are not very large but we had a king size bed a closet and a bathroom with both a shower and a tub the chair by the desk was a dirty lime greenand the chair by the bed had weird bleachlike stains on it we tried not to sit on either one the guy staying in the room across from us kept yelling and banging on our door the first night at around 12 midnight we finally called the front desk and they sent up security the guy said he was yelling at someone in the elevator who was threatening himthe following night we heard him slamming the door and brushing up against our door but he calmed down after a while theres a diner on the corner and a drug store on broadway subway station is two blocks away;3
this was a 5 night trip for my mothers birthday and the hotel did give us a great view as requested however the room was a lot smaller than we expected more like a small double than triple we only had 1 mirror in the bathroom which was tiny and with 3 girls this made getting ready a struggle far worse though was the noise in the early hours from music on the 10th floor we were on the 11th this is a nightclub run separately to the hotel and music goes on until 4am most nights we ended up moving rooms to 6th floor which was much quieter at night on booking the hotel had a spa on website but in fact this had apparently gone months ago so we were disappointed plus the pool is really just a plunge the web photos make it look a lot more impressive and a lot of;3
hotel situated in good location with easy access to transport system and times square is a few blocks walk we were given a tiny room in the old section of the hotel but rejected this and were upgraded to a newly refurbished room which was reasonable hotel was average breakfast is superb authentic american great restaurant in the hotel has superb meals on the menu;3
the hotel sounds on the website as if its close to lots of attractionsand in terms of miles it isbut its not walking distance from anywhere and the traffic is so bad in the area and dangerous that even driving 4 miles takes half an hour also the local neighborhood is very dodgy and dangerous i wouldnt walk outside anyway booked through their website on a rate reduction due to staying more than a night and didnt get the rate advertised when i was charged they then charged exorbitant taxes about 4 different taxes in all per night far more than anywhere else in california charged to justify the cost so it ended up being the rack rate anyway room was nice bathroom and shower were good parking at 18 a day plus tax was a rort given there was nothing really;3
the biggest asset of this hotel it is the great location in the middle of manhattan close to many central touristic spots like broadway the times square etcâ it is also surrounded by many shops restaurants and a few subway stations besides that everything else was just ok the room was small but clean it had thin walls so every noise was noticeable the bathroom wasnât comfortable mainly because there was almost no space to keep all the toiletries the service was just fine quite polite but not really friendly the lobby was always overcrowded and it looked like a busy train station also they charge you to keep your luggage and in addition tried to charge 30 dollars per day for something strange such as hotel services wi fi gym etc after arguing with the;3
i thought this hotel was fine on a recent visit to nyc the location is excellent especially if arriving by train the room was on the small side but typical for nyc clean but a bit tired bed comfortable and it was quiet given the price paid not an especially good value;3
the hotel is beautiful very old art deco style i think lobby was lovely to sit in and use the free wifi our sons had a lovely room looking out onto the street but we were given a room that was like a cupboard that had been converted it had no view at all just looked straight at another building the room was a funny shape and my husband kept stubbing his toe on the bed because of the layout of the room and the room size the room was right next to the stairs to go up to the rooftop bar we asked to move and were told we couldnt the room was such a let down after saving for years to travel to ny from australia the rooftop area was lovely great view there;3
the room was just average everything worked the bed was clean and the shower hot maybe i expected more from a hilton it served its purpose the lobby restaurant and other areas look great a great place for a party the location next to universal studios is great;3
im not sure why ta still categorizes this establishment as a bbinn youd think someone would have awakened them to the discrepancy anyway dont buy the hotels hype about being recently remodeled it still looks the same as when i stayed there almost a decade ago still that makes me a repeat customer so thats a vote of confidence best aspects price and location quiet rooms lousy aspect no wifi in rooms which explains why the lobby teems with young budgetconscious social networkers in the wee hours you also cannot make tollfree calls from your room but if you yell at them long enough they will unblock the phone or at least call the number for you and transfer it;3
on central park west between w 106th and 107th street clean small room essential no fridge no safe box no brealfast as usual in nyc no frills enjoyed low price;3
i took a room with my boy and i can sayreally not bad even if it was just for one night we even did a shower and find an aazing woman who gave us shampoo and stuff comprare to other hostels where i ve been its agoodone;3
stayed here to see a show at the greek theatre first floor room really clean and very comfortable large flat screen better than average toiletries generous with the towels sliding glass door for fresh air no view ac rather noisy woke up a couple times should have turned it off really appreciated the large iron gate for the parking lot didnt think twice about leaving my vehicle and price decent at 20 per night dont think theres evening housekeeping service passed the same refuse in the hallway and lobby from arrival to checkout;3
first of all the positives clean great amenities great location and only a 10 minute walk to universal studios it is what you would come to expect at a hilton hotel the staff were very friendly and welcoming my disappointment was not so much with the hotel itself but with the hilton company which refuses to honor my hilton honors membership because i made my reservation through universal i was surprised because the representative from hilton honors assured me that i would get credited but when i arrived at the hotel they said that they are unable to due to company policy while i do plan to file a formal complaint to hilton i was disappointed that the hotel itself did make any efforts to meet me halfway particularly since it was a miscommunication from their end;3
firstly the positives beds comfy and pillowâs comfy good location for sights thatâs about it room is tiny really not big enough for a family of 4 i slept in bed closest to the window and there was a cold draft noisy i know that i should expect noise from the streets as in central manhattan shouldnât really be subjected to hearing next door flush their toilet or turn their taps on and off for a family the room is just not big enough so if there are more than two people in your party donât consider this homeless people loitering outside with some investment it could be really lovely but itâs shabby and dated my daughter said she felt like she was in the hollywood tower of terror;3
we stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed the handy location it was a quick walk to the subway bus or train due to its location we walked to a lot of nyc attractions concierge was very helpful with all our questions about getting to different sports events room was very small and bed was hard but that didnt ruin our experience as said by others there is no teacoffee in room but with starbucks and many other places to grab a coffee near by it was not an issue thanks for a great first time experience of nyc;3
be aware of the bate and switch the picture listed is beautiful but they put me in a room that barely fit a mattress it had one electrical outlet and when i plugged in my hair dryer it blew i called and they moved me into a fabulous room with amazing views of the city i loved this hotel and would give it a great review if they would stop using the old worn out closets of rooms that arent shown on the site it reeks of dishonesty;3
stayed at the empire for 7 nights on my honeymoon two weeks ago overall we enjoyed our stay although i was disappointed that the hotel did nothing to make our stay extra special despite being aware it was our honeymoon i dont necessarily mean a free upgrade but just something to show they appreciated us choosing the empire for such an important holiday apart from a halfhearted congratulations for the front desk on check in the hotel did nothing else we picked the empire after lots of research and heard that they treated you really well but we did not fell that while we were there also we were given a front facing room with a great view of the lincoln center but were not informed that there was road works going on in front of the hotel and were awoken at 7am every;3
we stayed at hollywood hotel the week of new years we wanted to be centrally located for going to the rose parade and seeing the sights of hollywood the location was a great choice the metro was less than 2 blocks away and subway travel was comfortable and easy the hotel was deceiving because you do not see the beautiful entrance on your arrival the picture is taken of the rear entrance from the parking lot it really is pretty just not visible from the road the lobby was attractive and inviting the courtyard was lovely the breakfast room was beautiful and the food good the guestroom had a few minor problems loosedangerous outlets weak wifi chipped sink fridge wasnt emptied from previous guests but overall it was clean and decent sized they were in the;3
this hotel is in a good location next to the lincoln centre but is a bit tired no free wifi in the bedrooms and no free coffee and tea making facilities but a bustling bar the bedrooms at the back look are noisy due to all the air conditioning units;3
we booked two rooms at this hotel since we were attending our daughters graduation while it was very convenient to universal if thats on your agenda unfortunately thats the only plus i can give the hotel i took advantage of the online checkin since i knew we would be very tired when we arrived at the hotel due to the 3 hour time difference upon checkin i needed to change our checkout date checking out one day early i had to state that i needed to change this date four times to the woman checking us in additionally it took us 15 mins to checkin so im not sure what advantage the online checkin provides at this hotel have not experienced this at other hiltons the hotel food is very expensive and the parking is as well so be prepared bottom;3
my boyfriend and i stayed in abercorn house hostel for three nights in a private double room with bathroom the hostel was in a very central location within hammersmith it was close to the apollo pubs shops and bus station so that was good it is on a very quite and safe culdesac the room was very clean and was warm enough plenty of hot water very good price for london only fault was the room was very small and no iron to be found in the entire hostel otherwise perfect if you just want a comfy bed;3
we adult family stayed at the hilton los angels universal city last summer we picked it as some relatives had stayed some months earlier it is a nice hotel near to universal city and theme park just a short walk away over a foot bridge the food was good breakfast had all the variety you could want âbuffet styleâ tea coffee is served we opted to pay each day we were room only and it was no advantage to paying bb for the few days we were staying if fact the family deal was better value at the time the hotel itself is nice we had adjoining rooms mid way up the tower and had nice views the hotel is located a short distance away from the kodak and chinese theatre on hollywood blvd just one stop of the âsubwayâ train the taxi from lax is about 40 minutes;3
this hotel is in a great location for getting to all the sites it has a carp ark which you will have to pay a daily charge the breakfast included is amazing fresh fruit cereals and a chef on hand to cook eggs any style and waffles;3
fortunately or unfortunately we were only able to stay one night i realize this is new york city but it is not an inexpensive place to stay when we arrived we checked in and when we got to our room it was the size of a closet one double bed and barely room to walk around it i was also traveling with a dog for a show which they knew ahead of time a potty area was set up in the basement for the dogs and the front desk was very anxious to take my money to use it but not so anxious to open the room when it closed at 1000 pm which was rediculous they did give us a larger room so i have to give them credit for that but im not sure why anyone would think a room that small would suite double occupancy we had a family emergency and had to leave the hotel;3
first things first calling the thing on the roof a pool is so new york ive seen bigger bathtubs theyd have been better off being honest about this on the website im sure im not the only one to be annoyed by their used car salesman tactics otherwise this is an okay hotel cute rooms great location just up from columbus circle and across the street from lincoln center staff were absolutely lovely the heatingair conditioning units are so old and dirty they make you feel you might get sick from using them finally and this goes for pretty much any hotel manhattan make them put you on the outside of the building otherwise your window opens on a filthy airshaft filled with the amazingly noisy heart of the ancient air system and only a few feet from all the other;3
we stayed here for two nights before a cruise and was very disappointed we regularly stay at a wyndham hotel in florida so expected this one to be good the reception was bright and airy but the room we were given was small and cramped the wallpaper was coming away from the wallwe reported it as soon as we saw it but nothing was done the plumbing in the bathroom looked like it was original and very shabby the shower was a nightmare but that was due to the very old plumbing it was not what i would expect from a wyndham hotel and it cast a shadow on our first visit to newyork;3
the hotel is located in a strategic location near penn station so if you are using the trains its pretty good other than that its not the best part of town you are bound to run into some funny characters all around you we had a double queen bed room which was pretty spacey the room is very uncomfortable there is no light in the closet room although it is nice to have one but it has no shelves so its basically just a suitcase hideout and there are no shelves in the bathroom you got nowhere to put your toothbrushes or whatever the shower head in the bathroom is something you might use to clean your car with it really feels like the hotel is putting patches on anything that breaks instead of really giving a decent fix we stayed on the 36th floor and had;3
we chose the hilton for two reasons 1 it is a hilton and 2 the location was close walking distance to universal studios unfortunately this hotel did not live up to typical hilton standards our room was good but we found that the supposed clean wash clothes provided had hair in them and the toilet was clogged after a long day at universal studios we had to wait for the maintenance person who was pretty prompt to come unclog the toilet however getting fresh wash clothes took well over an hour i stayed awake waiting for them to arrive while my family slept but of course the knock on the door twice for maintenance and wash clothes woke everyone from their sleep on the bright side this hotel is steps away from the universal studios and city walk entrances;3
my partner and i went to new york for the weekend to see the american ballet theater as far as locations go this hotel was excellent we were literally across the street from the theater and very close to central park so that was ideal i was disappointed in the room though regular sheets were used as the mattress sheet and duvet cover staff was friendly and helpful during our stay though;3
stains in sheets and chairs but clean enough and good customer service the bus that goes to the airport is also a great plus i used it both ways i left one of my bags on the bus by accident and they were very prompt and helpful i got it back quickly;3
overpriced for an experience which more or less leaves a bad taste if something bad should happen during your stay perhaps they could try to work on better customer service without having to ask 3 times and without seemingly demanding tips for everything which is notdone for a hotel in this price range;3
i was notified that the check in time was pushed back by one hour only once i arrived and tried to check in the hotel refused to watch my luggage for free despite giving me my room late then i bought a late check out and the room cards deactivated at the original time i had to go down to the lobby and wait in line to have the cards reactivated preventing me from gathering my belongings and getting to the airport on time;3
location is great close to penn and metro stations with walking distance to port authority times square and other highlights room was surprisingly big compared to what we expected from manhattan hotel looks a bit old trying to keep working butâ¦ the hotel is very expansive and not so welcoming we were 2 families traveling together we arrived before checkin time and found our room ready our family companion room was not ready no offence about that so they had to stand in a very long not welcoming line in order to put their luggage the building has 12 elevators 6 for 2nd20th floor and 6 for 20th40th floor we had a room on the 19th floor some floors between 3rd floor and 17th are not used by the hotel they are used as offices foundations dormitories so the people;3
very nice and friendly staff everyone i spoke to was keen to help great location for universal studios the room and lobby feel very old and in desperate need of update the fitness center is small and be ready to pay for parking which for a suburban hotel is a minus the evening pianist at the bar is a special phenomena great funny entertainment you do not want to miss food is ok with some asian cuisine available as well if you can forgo the old look the service will deliver a great value;3
lobby is filthy as are all the communal hallways and carpets however the rooms are clean linen towels gowns etc all good the shared bathrooms were clean and we had to wait a couple of times but not for two long plenty of hot water we had a bunk room and were well aware of the size when we booked it it has more in common with a japanese capsule hotel room but if youre ok with this then the location is great especially for the highline staff so so not a particularly smiley bunch but did their jobs although didnt proffer much information about the hotel or the surrounding area on arrival we enjoyed our stay but with reservations;3
on arrival we were told we had been up graded unfortunately it didnât feel like an up grade the room had pleasant decor comfy bed did feel clean with a coffee machine they the charged us 13 for extra coffee shower was a let down temperature was tepid flow poor for a drench shower although it didnât soak all the floor at least we reported the shower twice along with the lose wardrobe door neither were sorted during our stay in fact the drench shower didnât work at all on the final day no carpet on the grand staircase not sure if they were waiting for one to be fitted or not the inside doorman kept hiding behind the pillars looking at his phone so had to struggle opening the extremely heavy door ourselves 2 doormen on the outside were very pleasant the;3
we booked this for the last leg of our honeymoon and i wish wed now looked around for somewhere a bit more modern the room was basically just a double bed with limited space to put your stuff bathroom was clean but again quite small and the toilet was very loud when flushing the staff were friendly and helpful on arrival and checking out helping us with luggage and getting a taxi to the airport location was very good but im not sure id book here again as we werent blown away by it it was just a place to sleep at the end of the day which is why im giving it the rating i have;3
room was clean quiet and wifi great so better than feared the hallways though could really do with a revamp totally depressing and for 100 per night shared bathroom was a shocker at least by asia standards walking distance to columbias campus;3
we stayed during our visit to ny i did not realize that the hotel was in the middle of china town i probably did not do enough research we arrived very late so it was difficult to change our minds the room was very small and the temperature was not stable cleanness could be improved and some of the furniture replaced it is however a two minute walk to the b and d metro station that gets you in four stops to 5th avenue china town is vibrant with lots of shops and the streets did not feel unsafe but there were always lots of garbage bags on them;3
stayed in a queen room the night before thanksgiving rate was booked a month before the parade at a very reasonable price for manhattan excellent access to columbus circle for the parade friendly and helpful front desk staff the doormen could have been of more assistance the room was small and the bathroom smaller with no shower curtain which was a weird concept for my kids;3
i would like to start by saying you get what you pay for trouble is paid a lot and got very little in this case the hotel looks ok from the front inside the decor is primarily grey and black the hotel staff are vaguely competent it only took several attempts to get our rooms sorted after some confusion caused by the man at the front desk avoid the lift itâs hot and slow just by way of cost saving the fan in the lift is set to off permanently the room we were given had a view of the waste area central to the hotel at the bottom were many ceramic bathroom parts perhaps spares for our room that was fitted back in the eighties with odd fitting covers it is clean and location wasnât too bad you now know what to expect oh and they charge for wifi in the rooms free;3
this is a budget hotel and while it has its flaws it was convenient to seeing manhattan and we got a good nights sleep every night location the hotel is on 94th street a few steps off of broadway theres an entrance to the subway in front of the bodega 94th street blueberry farm across 94th from the hotel most of the prime tourist action is around times square which youd take a downtown train to get there you have two choices if you pick the express side of the platform youre there in two stops and its very convenient if you pick the local side youll still get there but you will stop every couple of blocks pretty much every subway line connects at times square and that gets you anywhere in the city so once you remember to take the express train to;3
my teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks over xmas new year period it was a basic hotel but was clean and comfortable our room was cleaned on a daily basis the beds were ok we were up on the fourth floor and away from the lifts so it was pretty quiet facing the street and had a view of the park across the road the location was fantastic with only minutes walking to soho and little italy subway was just across the road and it was so easy to get anywhere in manhattan in a short time the staff were always courteous and polite and ready to assist us when required the only issue we had while staying here was the free wifi was non existant in our room for 4 days nights of our stay and staff were unable to fix the problem no coffee maker microwave or;3
we stayed at the new yorker for one night we got a great deal right on the hotelâs website for a suite on a friday night which is a plus so it had 2 bathrooms and a separate living room that was really great because the regular rooms are small it is in need of some desperate updating though i donât mean to say that it is dirty it is neat and clean it just feels like it has looked the same for such a long time it needs to be modernized the one thing that i didnât like and it might sound silly is that the handle to flush the toilets were like the ones in a public bathroom to me that is just not classy for a hotel at all also the shower heads are terrible the water squirted everywhere and the pressure was really hard the walls are also paper thin so;3
our stay was quite ok here no mouses in the room and we got clean towels to the room everyday we used the room to sleep and agree with others that its nice that the subway is close we got what we paid for and generally are happy about it however i have to be disappointed to the fact that i never got my keys back that i left to the room a man told me over the phone that they were found but didnt know how to arrange the delivery i contacted the hotel manager as he suggested and he seemed like hes going to take care of it just asked me to email my address to him they probably arent anymore in the lost and found but in trash and despite my call and two emails i never got any response to them even a fact that it for some reason would not be possible to post them;3
a well located nice hotel with free breakfast and close to many things not a great area but hey its la nothing is great a bit overpriced parking but the fact that has a parking is cool nice outside pool good service;3
drinking water is not made available to guest unless it is paid for and the staff do not provide complementary water and i saw one of the staff members offer some to a guest that was checking in before my husband and me and the water in the room cost 3 to 7 dollars a bottle and we had already paid over 1000 for the room never has this happen with any other hotel we have stayed during our vacationing and never again;3
have just returned from this hotel we chose this particular hotel following a recommendation the hotel location was very good just outside penn station and it was very art deco in appearance 2 adults and a 16 year old so we booked a double double room it was very small and we struggled to accommodate our clothing and suitcases etc the room had art deco type lights which were very dim so all lights were on when we were in the room the window overlooked another bedroom and absolutely no view the whole place seemed tired they had painted the bathroom evidence of this was paint all over the chrome towel rail which came off onto the towels we got up one day and found that there was no water at all in the room yes it was resolved but three of us with no shower in ny;3
this property is better than the typical airport hotel there are a few issues but overall a decent option the airport shuttle is shared with the parking garage that is next to the hotel the shuttles come by every 10 minutes or less but and its a big but they are not hyatt people they are parking deck people i tried to flag down the first three that went by but they didnt even slow down they drove by terminal 2 at 30 mph in the middle lanes empty and without looking for anyone at the pickup sign my assumption is that they are paid to circle the airport and they knew another shuttle will be there in the next 5 to 10 minutes and nobody going to a parking deck is likely to complain but its pathetic prepare to be frustrated a lot of shuttles is great but;3
we visited new york for the new year with my wife and we decided to try the new yorker as there a very good deal on expedia the hotel is ok and relatively well located in manhattan check in was smooth but not really warm rooms are very small even as per nyc standard we stayed in one of the refurbished rooms which nice overall ok but certainly better options around manhattan;3
given how incredibly expensive hotels are in nyc this hotel at this price is acceptable kind of crowded and old feel to the lobby and the rooms but everything worked fine the beds were average comfort the pillows a bit hard the bathroom clean small but functional;3
ive stayed at many higherend hotels throughout my career and for leisure i felt for the value at this hotel the amenities were older and not well kempt for example the towel rack was starting to teeter over the extra square footage is a plus however i would have expected also a microwave from this caliber of hotel;3
stayed here one night for a conference in the hotel overall i found the location just average the room was very clean and comfortable however the closet door was off the track and fell out there is no minibar in the room if you are a quiet sleeper watch out the walls are thin here and i could hear he conversations of my neighbor pretty clearly the bar is convenient universal city is a 5 minute walk if you are a verizon wireless customer beware this is nearly dark territory here dropped calls and slow data speeds which has been terribly inconvenient during a business conference;3
great location quite friendly staff dirty sheets noisy we took deluxe room but it wasnt very clean especially sheets which looked dirty location is really great only two minutes from hammersmith subway;3
not ideal for a traveling family for the price no pull out couch means 35 for a rollaway breakfast buffet is not worth the price no changing tables in public restrooms for travleing infantstoddlers makes no sense as a family destination hotel but the location for universal is unbeatable;3
the staff was amazing both housekeeping front desk security was great rooms need an upgrade the bathroom is very small old iâm not a fan of showertubs i prefer walk in showers the curtains tend to stick to skin ac kept shutting off didnât seem to be the desired temperature i was aiming for tv also kept losing connection several times the floor carpet seemed worn old the beds were very comfortable with clean linen;3
i booked a room with the hotel knowing what to expect in terms of size so i have no complaints about being cramped however my room was just unbelievably hot the hotel has central heating that blows hot air into all the rooms howeverthe rooms do not have thermostats so i had to open the window and turn on the wall unit air conditioner to cool it down which seems like an incredible waste of energy the keys to these rooms are really cool but also annoying they are gigantic metal sticks that you insert into a hole in the door i dont think theyll fit into most female pant pockets the location of the hotel is meh about 5 blocks from the nearest subway station and theres nothing else really worth seeing around the hotel however the hotel has free bicycle;3
a group of us stayed at the empire hotel for a bachelorette party two weeks ago we were delighted by the hotel and its location but were not thrilled with the staff and service two of our three rooms were ready but the third still had to be inspected we are not very fussy so we went and had some lunch while we waited the thirty minutes until our room was ready we went back about an hour later and the room still was not ready our group 16 girls went to the rooftop deckbar for some evening drinks before we had an appointment we were horrified by the drink prices 17drink and 42 for a bucket of coronas gratuity included if you are coming for the pool you will be sorely dissapointed the deck was beautiful and the view was unbelievable but the pool is tiny not;3
we chose the hollywood hotel for its proximity to the attractions we wanted to see in la and most things around the hollywood area are very easily accessible from the hotel the hotel itself is a little old but still pleasant we received complimentary breakfast each morning during our stay and the staff were very helpful especially cinthya who gave us an early checkin following a long flight due to the tiled floors in the hallways every noise echoed around the hotel and could be easily heard in our room unfortunately there was no extraction fan in the bathroom meaning it got very steamy and hot after a shower and the shower curtain was basically useless causing shower water to spill out onto the bathroom floor making it slippery and unsafe not the best hotel weve;3
i stayed here for 4 nights in august before i signed up to tripadvisor hence the late review guest rooms are well furnished but small the bathroom was stocked with high end toiletries but it was really small forget showering with a friend there was barely enough room for me 6 180 lbs to get in and out of the shower on my own in fact a friend of mine left her suitcases in the room after she checked out of her room and travelled upstate to rochester i agreed to store her 2 suitcases but had to perform some olympic grade gymnastic maneuvers that would make mary lou retton proud just to get to the bed from the door as theres simply is no dedicated space for suitcases yall remember mary lou the west virginian who won olympic gold in la in 1984 i quizzed the front;3
the hotel is well located for the northern end of central park columbus amsterdam avenues and the 100th street subway its price is reasonable for nyc the room was worn and tired but clean it was very small and was certainly not one of those shown on the website that all said the staff were friendly and everything was clean with no desk and only one seat it is best for those planning to be out all day;3
stayed in a group of 4 people in two rooms on sunday 23rd october turned up early and left bags in their baggage area returned to book in and asked to be allocated rooms together and away from lifts hotel not busy rooms 412 and 427 were allocated which are different ends of the hotel room 412 is also by the service left exactly want we didnt want working or not air con plant outside window so a lot of noise looked out over rubbish in court yard returned to reception and complained and was told you asked for rooms together we pointed out they got that wrong to we were then allocated room 452 better not much view much in a no noise area after a day out in london returned to have a drink at the bar unhelpful bar girl and seemed to be having a bad day so;3
the location of the new yorker was fantastic very close to penn station times square etc the check in was very quick the staff were very friendly welcoming rooms were very nicely furnished big enough for the two of us we also had a great view of the new york skyline we did think it was a bit overpriced however there are much cheaper places to stay;3
close to central park 10 minutes walk and time square 20 minutes walkrooms are a bit tired need some t l c starbucks close by and restaurants 10 minutes walk all tastes catored for lot of walking under ground good and cheap;3
i my wife and two children were hosted for the sixth time in this hotel with a prime location right near the central park columbus circle lincoln enter great restaurants besides the stores to shop like gap apple store century 21 all them less than 50 meters from hotelalthough in high season times hotel lose some quality in some services as negative and sad a horrible internet during these seasons;3
dirty bathroom and under bed for the whole 4 day stay also hard to work shower other than that nice looking place nice staff the doorman were always working and that was a nice part of it the drinks were good and the food good location;3
deception when you look and see that the same dish your friend asked for and yours is totally different when you arrive in the room to settle and your pillow smells of perfume from the previous guest i will rethink before booking a room;3
first stay here if you are only interested in going to universal studios and city walk if you want to see other places in los angeleshollywood then go somewhere else we booked the hotel because it is a hilton and did want to visit universal but we also wanted to see hollywood beverly hills take a walk etc it was a hassle to get anywhere else from this hilton yes there is public transportation which we did use but to get to the metro station you either have to take 2 shuttle buses or walk and then get on the metro to hollywood and highland thankfully we got our rental car on friday we arrived on wednesday and drove ourselves around to visit santa monica beverly hills etc the hotel is spotless and the staff is very friendly and ready to help with anything we did;3
stayed here for a weekend getaway i booked directly through the hotel the rate for this weekend was not cheap start of a school vacation week womens half marathon opera etc i chose the hotel based on location we were going to the met so here is the good location perfect for why we were here the opera central park is a couple of blocks away many restaurants and you can walk to times square easily staff the door and front desk staff were very friendly the rooms they are mostly very small but this nyc most rooms here are i donât really consider that a bad as long as you know what you are in for before you show up and i do mean they are small the bathrooms are even smaller and the bad the rooms the first room we were put in the ac was making;3
we 2 friends and i stayed at the empire hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of february 2011 when we checked in our room a superior double was not ready laundry service problem so we were upgraded to room which is the largest room at the end of the hall it was still on the small side as far as hotel rooms go but it did have a sitting area w a couch and a small walkin closet and the view was awesome when we got to the room we just wanted to quickly cleanup and go eat we noticed there were no washcloths or hand towels so we called housekeeping it took 25 minutes for them to bring up what we needednot happy after spending our first night there we noticed our internet connection was not good in this room due to it being at the end of the hall;3
chose this larger older art decotype hotel on bookingcom bc of the price but didnt read the fine print regarding the resort fee which i believed was already included in the quoted price they require you to pay it when checking in the resort fee includes 1 free wifi worked mostly well 2 24 hr gym didnt use bc we were out touring the city 80 of the time who wants to come back exhausted then go work out and 3 all local long distance international phone calls only good if you have no cell phone or tablet 4 use of the business center who charges to use the business center anyway this cost is 29 per day on top of the already steep nyc hotel city taxes its next to penn station so its convenient to take the shuttle makes 23 stops from lga for;3
nice place in manahattan has quite street and simple clean room i suggest nearest absolute bagel for breakfast 1020 minute walk to subway if ä± come again ä± would definitely choose here especially i choose cause suitable price;3
biggest issue is the heating system did not work and not only in my room we are at a conference and everyone said that you could not regulate it at all and very uncomfortable on top of it room is very small which is ok but run down staff is nice but they need definite investment in this hotel;3
each year we pick a premier inn hotel in london to stay at me and 2 children so weve stayed in lots throughout the years this was out first time at the county hall and my kids were so excited to stay somewhere so central and near the amenities checkin in was quick and easy but when we got to our floor 2nd floor it was obvious there was work going on as there was plastic on the floors and workmen walking around there was no noise to disrupt us at all but i knew we were in an old section of the hotel and my heart sank as this is our only family trip away and the kids love a premier inn room for how fancy it seems for us we were actually put in a family room for wheelchair users so there was emergency cords around the room which i was worried my kids would pull by;3
my husband and i stayed 2 nights 3 days november 2014 pros close to central park friendly service cons elevator out of service musty smell bug in shower no parking as advertised conclusion you get what you pay for it served the purpose wiith a decent room rate we did not have high expectations would stay again because good price;3
my stay at the empire was ok its a nice quaint hotel with a boutiquish feel the rooms are small and the bathroom even smaller however the rooms are clean and comfortable i would stay here again for a one or two night stay its convenient to central park and a nice 10 to 15 minute walk to times square i enjoyed my stay it was no frills but nice;3
a little run down but rooms were quite spacious average service average continental breakfast didnt really like the location not within walking distance of any nice shops or restaurants we hired a car a service that the hotel provides which is a must in la unless you dont mind spending lots of money on cabs the hotel is close to a metro station but we didnt even bother with the metropublic transport even the staff at the hotel told us that the public transport system in la is crap wont be staying here again on my next trip to la;3
concierge was the best check out the tick rock restaurant in lobby for 24 hour breakfast and bagels felt safe with security at elevator room was smaller than most and basically had room to walk around the bed and get into bathroom bathroom old and paint on woodwork was peeling for the location it was ok and it does have the art deco feel;3
iâm fairly sensitive to mold and felt a wave of gross as soon as i walked in itâs technically clean so housekeeping is doing great but if youâre also mold sensitive itâs probably a place youâd like to skip itâs in the walls additionally the reviews imply the rooms are reasonably spacious for nyc standards and the room i was given was definitely not;3
this hotel was ideally located on broadway a few blocks down from columbia university where our daughter was studyingthe purpose of our visit it is right next to a subway station so ideal for touristy visits to downtown manhatton the staff are very friendly and helpful but the hotel is very dated and our initial room very small wifi is supposedly available in the rooms but we were unable to access itwhich meant a trip to the lobby where it was available when we eventually complained we were moved to a bigger and better roomwe should have complained earlier we then noticed a number of residents complaining about lack of wifi and they were also offered a move;3
just got back from staying 5 nights at the hotel of hollywood and while im not disappointed with the hotel i have to say its nothing to shout home about location i thought id talk about this first seen as thought its a big talking point on here and in the hotel the hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the touristy side of hollywood and i have to disagree with a lot of people about the area being rough its not a great tourist area so dont expect bars and shops within walking distance but i wouldnt say dont walk the streets i never felt scared to walk the streets alone but i can see why some people were finally you need a car if your staying here yes there are metro stops nearby but public transport in la is largely useless if you dont get a car youll find;3
great location and wonderful staff but the condition of our room was somewhat lackluster the ac unit made an awful loud noise throughout the night and the bathroom with itâs odd layout was a slippery hazard at times the wifi didnât really work and when it did it was terribly slow despite these rather minor issues you canât beat the price location and great staff;3
i was in ny for 2 nights solo traveling overall this did not feel like a hotel it is similar to a hostel with shared bathrooms shared showers and 180 sq ft rooms i felt uncomfortable in my room since i saw a handprint on the outside of my door the walls are paper thin so you can hear the person next to you and each time someone leaves their room i asked to be upgraded or moved since i read reviews that many people have been upgraded for free in the past and the staff said i could move to a private room with private bath for 275 per night i did not feel comfortable sharing a shower i did not have shower flip flops or shoes with me the bathroom reeked of bleach the room smelled like cigarette smoke the bar was really cool but that was probably the only part of;3
perfect location for transport being close to penn station for airport and subway connections appreciated the history of the hotel the basement museum was well done staff were welcoming and helpful five stars to housekeeping staff who were super pleasantroom too small to fit luggage and clothes for two for a three week trip stayed six nights at start of trip not enough storage space hangers etc added amenity charges annoying if i have no use for a gym or an office why should this be added to the bill;3
myself and my son stayed there for 2 nights asked for a quiet room and got room on the 17th floor facing the 101 highway the room had extreme traffic noise even very late at night we had enough around 2am as we couldnât sleep the receptionist did not seem very empathic or very honest when she claimed all rooms get traffic noise had to insist to get another room not facing the highway got a room at the 20th floor facing universal studios and it was super quiet no noise at all so evidently the receptionists did not tell the truth this ruined our first night in the hotel other than that the rooms are big clean comfortable beds the location is amazing and you can get to universal studios in 5 minutes walk we ate dinner at the lounge and it was just ok breakfast buffet;3
very cute and trendy hotel in a great area cozy and comfy lobby fun bar and restaurant thats where it ends i am fine staying here for business or my trips without family due to the proximity unfortunately the downsides would keep me from making it a regular stop my room was on the 1st floor on the street very noisy even with ear plugs and a pillow on my head i requested a quiet room when i made the reservation called to say i was delayed please hold my room they tried to accommodate with a larger room the shower was a trickle of water not enough to wash my hair upon entering the bathroom and finding hair all over the floor i got down on my knees and wiped it up corner to corner myself not worth the back and forth with the front desk front desk to get;3
they did not credit me with having another person in the room who was suppose to pay half of the cost for the room they charged me the total cost each night i am very upset over this issue and i would like for it to be addressed and corrected;3
the hotel is dated with carpeting worn wall paper torn in places mold in the bathrooms its getting closer to being a dump the staff are friendly and helpful barely a wyndham worthy property;3
this was a nice hotel needs some renovations and i saw them working on painting the staff was okay the breakfast was okay nothing really exciting in the area i would not be walking down the street at any time and there are not any restaurants nearby the 22 per day parking is ridiculous that is for sure i did get a good price from hotelcom that was the best thing about the hotel i hate writing an average review but that is what this hotel is average;3
the positive fantastic location near broadway restaurants and access to transportation staff very nice depending on who you ask some staff knowledgeable others not so much the room was small but clean enough the bathroom was sufficient and nice the not so positive we were on the second floor facing the street the city noise was loud enough to interfere with sleep the air conditioner is just so loud annoyingly so the tv had intermittent connection on many channels the fridge locked i found this very odd the snacks were mini muffins dailynothing great the lobby is very nice and the area safe i wouldnât rule out staying again due to location and cost but will likely check elsewhere;3
although i did find the jane quite interesting and in the heart of everything the shipcabinlike rooms were a bit small for my liking it is great for an overnight with not too many suitcases and if you dont mind sharing a shower and a bathroom with other guests we had a room with 2 bunbeds and that was it airconditioned thank goodness and each bed had their own lighting and tv if you coming to nyc to stay in the room then pick a different hotel but if you are here to get out and enjoy then perfect the hotel is right in the heart of chelseas meat packing district places to eat activities history surround this quaint hotel the hotel has a great rooftop bar and a really cool bar downstairs they do have free bicycles to use which is a huge plus it does;3
recently took the family to new york and stayed at the new yorker which is a wonderful old art deco style hotel the position was sensational right in the heart of mid town close to the empire state building times square madison square gardens and the giant maceys store was a bit disappointed with the internal condition of the hotel as its very tired but that didnt particularly worry us as we were out day and night looking around very nice diner attached to the hotel and staff were fantastic overall would give it 5 stars for location 5 stars for staff and 3 stars for room condition;3
we were very excited to visit this hotel as we were gossip girl fans we went in april temps were in high 60s and mid 70s we werenât able to get to the rooftop the roof top breakfast was amazing with lots of choices buffet style the bathrooms are coming apart door and walls and warped from the water and way past needing to be redone the drain in the shower didnât drain well either room was spacious and clean great pillows bed was on the harder then we would have liked we never really spoke with staff and the ones we did werenât very talkative i canât say enough about how great the location is though we felt very safe in the area no microwave and no coffee maker in the room we would probably stay again;3
in town to attend an event at lincoln center we chose the empire because of itâs location right across the street from lc our stay was uneventful our room was very small but comfortable despite the noise from the hvac equipment in the air shaft outside our window the roomâs bathroom was the smallest iâve ever seen but modern and clean staff was pleasant enough we really enjoyed the rooftop bar â gorgeous view;3
the wyndham new yorker is a great hotel to stay at if you havent got a lot of time in new york it is well located close to the subway and within walking distance of a lot of new york attractions the accommodation is relatively basic though tidy and clean the resort fee charged by the hotel is excessive given there are almost no resort features in the hotel;3
when we arrived the front desk person told me that my reservation was cancelled and that they where full so they couldnât give us a room after arguing and making a few calls the booking agent the same person told me that she can give me a room but the price was 30 higher i took it it was friday and i had no place to go on sunday when we checked out a guy named kevin was in charge of us when he heard what has happened he made a decision that helped us a lot he gave us a discount on the rate to match the price that we originally had thatâs caring for a client if iâll ever go back for sure iâll consider to stay with them but just for people like kevin;3
the hotel is in a good location as there are many eating places locally we were on the top floor and could only be accessed by one of the lifts it took forever to get to the 13th floor and then it was slow on the way down too we had to run the hot water tap and the shower for at least 15 minutes before the water was hot enough to take a shower this is meant to be a budget hotel bit it was not cheap it was very clean staff were friendly and helpful free wifi;3
on arrival we were met with a building site on our floor with restricted access to our room on returning to the room after spending the evening out we were unable to unlock the door resulting in 30 minutes of trips to reception failed attempts at resetting locks and the delivery of a duvet that we didnât ask for luckily the bed was comfortable and after a considerable period of calming down we fell asleep this wasnât for long mind as the delivery of beer barrels at 630 would have been the perfect alarm clock had i have been off to work we werenât iâve stayed at county hall several times before tjis time was the last;3
staying at an icon can be a lovely experience but doing so may come at a cost to quality and updating the old lady sits in a great part of town just a few minutes walk to so many amazing places loved our experience but the rooms and floors were well used and tired;3
for the first time in the hotels history there is a tv in the bar area and great people working at the front door the front desk very helpful and the guys at the front door very helpful in every way;3
friendly helpful staff tea coffee and water available in reception but not in room tiny room with not enough room to walk round bed tiny but functional bathroom well located for penn station and madisson square garden reasonable sleep sometimes interrupted by sirens on 8th avenue;3
i love the empire hotel its my first choice when traveling to nyc but this last stay was pretty bad the water in the building was turned off and no one notified us we didnt realize it until we tried to shower only to find there was no water when the water did come back on it was freezing cold and it took about an hour to warm up enough to use it which made us late for an event then we received our valet ticket with instructions to text when we wanted our car which we did but the car didnt come thankfully the bellman noticed how long we were waiting and asked if we had requested the car when we explained that we followed instructions on the ticket he said that info should have been crossed out and that we needed to see the front desk he did take the ticket and;3
its interesting how there are rooms available online but claims are made in person that there are rooms available for months;3
this hotel hosted a business conference that i attended rooms are small and not well appointed no coffee maker small desk no notepad or pen in room no room service menu had to have one sent up room service provided by tick tock restaurant and was dreadful everything arrived in paper bags with takeout plates and plastic cutlery including soup in a paper coffee cup for that money one expects at least a tray and real platescutlery i love the history of the new yorker hotel but would not stay here by choice;3
we viatited the hotel as our last stop on our honeymoon and was so excited to stay as it was a hilton and the most expensive so we thought it was going to be amazing but once we got to our room we were disappointed stains on the floor not a nice view bathroom water pressure was crappy and it was a showerbath stains on wall paper in bathroom looking out our window saw the pool wasnât clean and we kept hearing water dropping from above our closet we were also very excited for the buffet but when we went down there was hardly any food and what was there didnât taste nice other than all of that the staff were very helpful and always friendly;3
we booked a king room on an executive floor wich gave us beautiful views the room was clean well laid out and everthing was as promised room rate we had came with continental breakfast which you could upgrade to the buffet which was very good and for my wife who is a celiac could order from a gluten free menu which was far above the standard fare offerd for celiac i rate it average because it comes at a price and you get what you pay for hilton wont surprice you with something nice and unexpected like a free bottle of water we also stayed last year at this location and both time the staff different both times in the little shop where very unpleasant;3
my boyfriend and i have just spent 5 nights at the quality on broadway hotel from reading reviews i was very nervous about staying there when we arrived i was expecting something a lot worse the lobby was fairly large with a reception and concierge desk it was not in bad condition at all just a bit old fashioned and for a 23 star hotel it was fine we were asked if we required a smoking or non smoking room which our request for a non smoking room was delivered we were then directed to the elevators which i can honestly say do not use the elevtors next to the public toilets use the ones next to the information leaflets where the luggage room is the lifts next to the public toilets were not safe and stop for no reason on each floor the corridors were very large with ice;3
room first night did not have working ac we were from east coast so had to get engineer up to get ac working for the night since no room to move us to then toilet ran plumber had to come after ac was fixed to replace parts after complaining about 350 room charge for room that was poor was given complementary breakfast the next day received upgraded new room but that was not the response i wanted third day there my brother and his wife and 13 others were stuck in an elevator for almost an hour hotel response was to call the elevator company sister in laws response was to call the fire department which is how the group finally got out of the elevator hotel is pretty staff is nice just have management issues;3
when going to this hotel i expected so much more out of the room then what we got the room was so small and you can barely move around even after upgrading our room the service at the front desk wasnt the greatest and hard to communicate with the downstairs area and stairway is stunning but for the price of the hotel it wasnt my favorite;3
just returned from 4 nights here hotel location is excellent but hotel inside is very dates rooms are small and dark plug sockets are not practical at all and limited storage space very clean though cant be faulted for that reception was very rude on check in i had 3 rooms booked and was told that she would not be booking all the rooms in one at a time is how she would do it resort tax not sure what you pay it for free wifi and that is it as when i tried to make a call to the uk from the room surprise it did not work who wants to use a gym and business centre when there for 3 days this is included in resort tax but really tick tock diner is a must next door good food service a bit hit and miss but overall great i would stay again if the price was right but;3
this trip was to visit family for christmas so i was only at the hotel a short time the inroom phone to connect with the front desk didnt work one of two key cards didnt work the rug had a big stain on it by the bed the shuttle service was great the location was great;3
the new yorker hotel in midtown new york is great in terms of location but suffers in terms of room comfort and amenities our bathroom only had room for one person at a time the sink didnt drain and there was barely enough room to store our suitcases out of sight i had to request more hangers for the closet the shower temperature was difficult to control;3
bathroom looks old and it is chipping we found hair on the floor and in the bath tub i have lived in nyc for 3yrs and returned for a mini vacation the room size was fine for a hotel in nyc but the quality of the bathroom was very disappointing i was in a standard metro hotel room on the 21 floor our friends also had the same complaints in their hotel room service was great cleaners were very nice and prompt;3
i am a female travelling on my own my first night was terrible i arrived in the middle of the night it had been 33c during the day and my room was so hot small and stuffy i became terribly sick overnight with a headache i was actually claustrophobic and felt i was in jail it got better over the next few nights rooms are tiny the aircon didnt work and to open the window meant noise and bugs no fly wires my room was only cleaned the first day i had to ask for fresh towels staff were helpful and friendly no problems with the shared toilets or showers very cleanok but not overly impressed;3
a friend and i stayed at this hotel in midmay the room was small but functional we got clean sheets towels everyday we did not have a view on the park but that was okey reading the reviews about the noise at night got me a bit worried but we did not have any problems no noise whatsoever staff was friendly helpful the room could use some new paint though the nearest subway is on 103rd street maybe a 3 minute walk id stay there again;3
stayed for a couple of nights before a cruise the check in was quick and friendly lifts to the rooms but a bit disappointing after that the room was scruffy and in desperate need of a refurb there was an aircon unit in the room but was very noisy very old tv but it worked and there was free wifi good position with lots of places to eat nearby the subway was close by too;3
we were supposed to have two queen beds but they had change it to one king bed this was dissapointing and there were no more rooma available rooms were clean but tiny there is a sauna and a pool and nice garden breakfast was very good custom made omelettes etc;3
the room was quite large but needed some sprucing up paint better furniture ceiling cracks etc bathroom was definitely dated the free breakfast was not full as it was advertised but im not going to complain about a decent continental spread parking in the lot behind the property was simple but of course not cheap the front desk was not exceedingly helpful though certainly not rude or unhelpful the wifi was pretty slow the hotel itself is basically in the middle of little armenia and not hollywood its not a dangerous neighborhood but definitely not nice either so if youre looking to be in the thick of things in either hollywood proper or downtown la this is not the place for you we got a deal off some website so its not like we were paying 300 a;3
hotel is amazing the breakfast is awesome its a full free breakfast only had one issue with check in booked a double bed but the reservation said for 1 after a stern talking too they didnt charge me for an additional person fee the hotel is located near some free clinics not an issue for me since i went on a weekend and they werent open you can see the hollywood sign in the distance of the hotel the pool is amazing as well;3
this is not a 300 a night plus hotel and then 28 day plus tax just to park quite a walk from the elevators to the rooms the elevators have been mentioned many times and they are bad pool area and personnel are great but housekeeping and front desk could use some retraining;3
we arrived early at the hotel and was greeted by afora who was very nice and informed me that our room had been upgraded which was very much appreciated i was then told it would be 5 dollars per bag to leave them until check in or i could check in early for an additional 50 which was nearly as cheap which i did the room 3509 was a good size had views of the hudson river maddison square garden and was spotlessly clean and cleaned everyday although like the rest of the hotel was a bit tired and could do with some tlc we had booked for 4 nights bb and was given vouchers for a continental breakfast in the ticktock diner after ordering our breakfast it was brought to our table by the waiter who barely even spoke to us we tried again the following morning and this time after;3
this is a good basic hotel with a great location disappointed after all the good reviews on trip advisor found staff at reception very unfriendly there is no double glazing at all which means you hear anything and everything at street level and i was 4 floors up my room was an interior room and was so noisy by the way my roomâs windows were leaking not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady beds were very comfortable unfortunately pillows were not the clock in the room was broken and overall a bit of tlc requires no wifi in rooms unless you pay;3
stayed here for one night we used the free airport shuttle from and to lax fast and convenient our room was nice and spacious but the windows were very dirty breakfast was included in the room price 230 at check in we were told to pick up breakfast vouchers the next morning why donât give them to us right away when breakfast was included the next morning we forgot about the vouchers the waiter gave us a breakfast menu card and didnât even ask if we had vouchers what a hopeless system we noticed that several guests were in the same situation as we were after breakfast the waiter came with the insanely overpriced bill but after remembering and getting our vouchers the bill was annulled still ridiculous system wouldnât stay here again there are a lot;3
we only needed a place to stay for a night this place was perfect it was in a good place near subway and places to eat easy to get to the price was extremely good for nyc it is an older place but it was fine for us not the ritz but it was a good stay for us;3
i stayed in four different hyatt hotels at different socal locations for four consecutive nights recently all the hotels were nice but i had the worst checkin experience at this hotel the front desk representative was rude and did not have proper customer service she needs more training how to welcome guests and answer questions for people staying at this hotel for the first time i understand this is a very big and busy hotel but no excuse for poor service next time i will look for another hotel when i am at lax;3
it is not clear if this is a hotel as adverstised or a hostel as it says the sign at the front of the building but location is the best of this place near penn station close to everything my room was tiny but it has everything i needed a comfortable bed a big tv screen good internet connection little space to keep things only two hangers on the closet and a small bathroom were sometimes it was difficult to move around literally;3
this hotel has a lot of pros and cons pros great location three restaurants subway entrance next to building next to penn station train station next to madison square garden amazing view of empire state building in some rooms nice water pressure each unit has own air and heat control amazing for 1000 plus room hotel good security 24 hour diner pre pandemic for new york the rooms are a decent size room service was offered but only for the diner there are some major cons though the walls are paper thin you can hear a lot of noise outside this is an old building historic and can give a creepy vibe only two elevators were working out of the ten they have and service elevators there are six of them were not offered to guests long lines to get to rooms;3
i had read the many reviews of this hotel and having booked through another booking service and not directly with the hotel i heeded the advice of others and tried to email them at least twice to ensure they had my reservation even though i had the email to prove it and had paid a 10 reservation fee no reply to email sent to the web site so just before leaving tried the other email on the hotel site and received a confirmation notice just as well because when we arrived from the airport with printed out reservation in hand we were told that we were not on their system and the hotel was full it wasnt until i provided proof with the confirmation email from the hotel that they took us seriously the receptionist was very nice and tried to sort it out by ringing the manager;3
the hotel is a bit more expensive the double rooms are very small the bathroom was dated needs to be renovated had to pay extra to leave our suitcases at check out reception on last day this was not ok;3
we had a twin with private bathroom it was small but did the job the room was clean enough bedding and towels were clean it was a bit worn staff were pleasant the road was very quiet even though its only a 5 minute walk from hammersmith tube bus station and high street we had a fridge in our room it was old but functional we didnt use the shared areas much but they seemed clean and functional i wouldnt come here for a holiday but it was good enough for what we needed a cheap overnight stay for work we were able to leave luggage in the luggage room after check out which was helpful when we were leaving;3
the staff is very friendly the style is art deco and looks great however the bathrooms are still from the 1930s also requesting for a room number on reservation in june doesnt give you the room number in december even after sending a not answered by the hotel reply a week before arrival value for money no;3
my husband and i recently stayed here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary upon check in we were terribly disappointed to find the pool deck was closed indefinitely but you will have access to the local ymca there is no indication on the hotel website to this effect and we would have stayed elsewhere had we known about the pool as manhattanites who are beachsunpool lovers we were excited to take advantage of a total staycation by sitting poolside in our fair city all of that said the hotel is located right in the heart of lincoln center with nearby access to both central and riverside parks the shops at columbus circle and several restaurants so there is plenty to do outside the hotel;3
its a very clean hotel with fair price in broadway 2 min walk from metro station if youre in walking mood its easy to walk to central park and times square as well it seems like an old hotel but its alright lots of fast food nearby very safe area;3
stayed here while attending a tradeshow at piers 9294 great locationwalking distance from piers and a stones throw to central park great reataurants on either side of the hotel unfortunately my reservation was somehow cancelled and i feel that i got a last resort room it was on the first floor with the buildings ac unit right outside the window the view was of a wall the room ac unit was macgyverd with an aftermarket control and sounded like a rock polisher if i tried to use it so i kept it turned off the shower looked as though it once had a sliding glass door on it but no more the rain head was nice but i had to throw a towel on the floor to protect the door and trim from rotting even further the ironing board in the room is good if you need to iron clothes;3
i booked this last year for world pride we arrive at 3pm and go to the wyndham rewards desk to check in since im diamond get to the front and get told we have no rooms ready i will swipe your card and you can check with the front desk later i replied thats fine but im not leaving this seat until you find us a room magically i had a choice of 5 rooms our room was upgraded good size room for nyc the location is perfect subway right here and macys for shopping wyndham diamond benefits upgraded room no resort fees and offered late check out this would of been 5 stars except for the check in process;3
due to the terrible weather the east coast experienced this past weekend on dec 57 i was unable to fly in on friday as scheduled the hotel staff were friendly and cooperative when i asked to waive the friday night fee of 160 the hallways are narrow it looks quite old due to normal wear and tear elevators are slow cramped need to be renovated but the bed was surprsingly comfortable and the bathroom was surprisingly clean sufficient for sleeping in showerhead had good water pressure and warm temperature no leaks at all however the room was supposed to be a nonsmoking room but when i first walked in it reeked of cigarette smoke which made me choke and gag all they did was hide the ash tray into the desks drawer it was relatively quiet so i actually got;3
the hotel is located not near everything but its in a nice and quiet area walking distance to central park and 2 blocks away from the subway it has a convenient pharmacy next to it it is not an awesome hotel but its clean quiet has comfortable beds and clean bathrooms and a friendly staff if you need a place to stop by for a few nights at a reasonable price for this expensive city i would definitely recommend it;3
the big advantage is location of hotel lincoln center good movie theater literally across the road decor of hotel is gloomy lighting terrible cant read in room you have to pay extra for internet service staff friendly;3
i was in town for a week for my 20th college reunion and gave this hotel a second chance as the last time i had stayed i also had a bad experience the location to the 96th street subway is excellent and there is a pharmacy and mcdonalds nearby the wifi is horrible there is password protection for the one in the lobby but not in the rooms probably why it is so slow everyone in the adjacent buildings must be using the room wifi as well i had to use my personal hotspot to use my tablet and now my data is all used up for the entire month and its only 7 days into october every other days inn i have stayed at offers some kind of continental breakfast there was nothing at this one housekeeping never bothered to check to see that i brewed hot water in my coffee pot and;3
slow internet painfully slow everything else average room is much smaller than the pictures look the elevator was really really slow the staff was very kind though and the bell boy were very helpful;3
hotel is getting tired compared to other options in the city we stayed in two different rooms and the door was worn and showing a lot of wear the staff at this hotel are rude at times very rude overrated and we will not return we will return to the nylo again for a far superior experience;3
checkin welcome was miserable as flight got in late we couldnt have 2 rooms on same floor let alone next to each other think we had what is called a metro room for 3 people it was very small totally outdated however it was clean beds comfy location was great for penn station sub macys empire state it was pricey for what you got so id look to stay somewhere different if i go again;3
my fiancã© and i stayed at the hotel riverside studios on december 1st and 2nd of 2006 for just a little over 200 cad total i read a lot of really bad reviews on this hotel some were about the hotel itself and others about the rude staff working there this was our first time in ny and all we wanted was a place to crash for 2 nights since it was the holiday season hotels prices were extremely high i really didnt want to pay a small fortune to stay at a nicer hotel since i knew were werent going to spend much time there anyway id rather spend the money on a tour or sightseeing or shopping so we made a decision to book this hotel and it really wasnt that bad at all our room was actually decent it was clean no sign of rats or bugs and yesthe decor was;3
the secretary is so rude that you cant even try to understand whats going on when i stayed there my credit card was blocked but i didnt know that when i asked her why she answered rudely she would be more patiently and threat the clients better;3
this hotel is conveniently located beside the lincoln center there are some very good restaurants a stones throw away from the entrance and a few stores for shoppers the lobby and bar area are nice however the rooms or at least our room are tiny ive stayed at other hotels in the city so i know that space comes at a premium but i found this room very claustrophobic there is very little natural light our room had an awful view that allowed very little light in and only a few lamps i did not think the bed was comfortable and each morning i woke up with a sore back there is a bed bath and beyond about a block or two away and i was very tempted to go buy a pillow because i found the pillows that uncomfortable the bathroom was the size of most hotel closets and;3
for 1 night it was average but not up to the quality of hyatt hotels weve stayed in before we sort of felt like we were staying in a holiday inn express for over 300 per night the decorating was all d4ab gray there was no room service the food was good portions too large and the staff was friendly and accommodating though;3
i stayed for 2 weeks at the hotel and got an online rate of about 90 breakfast is good large variety but same everyday the staff are terrible extremely bad customer service housekeeping went into out room before we checked and threw out some of our things that were in plastic bags and then had the audacity to say we threw it out because it was rubbish i would however stay there again the location is very practical for sightseeing via public transport or by car as it is very closes to the 101 highway lots of places to eat supermarkets etc close by the rooms are clean although the bathtub could do with a good scrub on the whole good value for money;3
being that i was just using the hotel just to sleep at it was fine as a single woman at the hotel i felt safe yes granted the rooms are small but what do you expect its nyc you cant beat the price and right across from central park you have to wait a few minutes for the water to warm up there were some ambulances that were very loud but miraculously after 11pm it was fairly quiet the bed was pretty comfy when the elevator was slow i would just take the stairs the staff was friendly only a 15 min walk to columbia university;3
the room was nicely furnished with new carpet and newish bathroom the ac worked very well and the view was nice with a little parkette across the street but we found 2 cockroaches in the bathtub one morning the hotel staff were very nice and allowed us an early checkin i parked my car on broome st for the weekend without getting a ticket you really get what you pay for with this hotel its very standard and the rooms are by no means big so if youre an older couple or picky shell out the extra dough for a nicer place if youre a student or not very picky totally go for it ive spent more for worse places;3
hilton hhonors diamond and gold beware if you arrive on a weekend you will not get an upgrade to an hhonors floor and get no free appetizers at bar as you would on a weekday bad show by management next be prepared for loooooong waits at the elevators especially on weekends 15 minutes is common bellmen are allowed to use the same elevators as passengers making it even slower not a sign of a wellrun hotel the buffet almost completely blocks the hallway leading to the parking garage do not eat that food as i saw people sticking their hands in room is ok not large amenities sparse;3
loction is nice is you are planning to visit universal city it is not close to city center however it is 15 to 20 minutes if there is no traffic rooms are not so new some of hotel rooms has renovated however it has 4 star hotel details in the room they serve breakfast and it is also fine for american breakfast standards room rates are usually lower than downtown hotels;3
this hotel offered a great location for the price the staff were wonderful the staff went out of there way to accommodate you the hotel is in need of updating but also there are a lot of other hotels in new york that need updating the bed was comfy and the room was clean the hotel was 1 block to the 1239 red line and that was our main transportation to everywhere in manhattan there are many places to eat around the hotel which was great there is a pharmacy at the corner of the hotel if you forget anything for your trip central park is just 3 blocks away we were with 2 other couples touring and we all stayed at the same hotel;3
we stayed here last summer for five nights rooms were basic but very clean no breakfast although there are plenty of diners serving breakfast nearby good location close to subway staff were extremely helpful and very friendly ideal if you are looking for somewhere to rest your head at night;3
if you are in la for universal studios you cant choose a better hotel its location is excellent however it had only one restaurant which was good but not amazing its pool was beautiful with a nice grassy area for relaxing reading or soaking up the sun the rooms were nice but average i felt like i was anywhere usa when i wanted to feel like i was in los angeles;3
went with two girlfriends we each had our own room tiny but comfortable like being in a train car we didnt spend much time in the room because there is so much to do in the area yes its kind of like staying in a dorm room with a shared bathroom on some floors but its clean and the staff is really nice just a few blocks away you have the new whitney museum the highline amazing restaurants and shopping just a great vibe all around in the neighborhood you will really get the feel of the west village lots of history their ballroombar is so much fun late at night we got into the party and the rest you have to experience for yourself many interesting people to meet the cafe in the hotel was also wonderful and the coffee was delicious i enjoyed the;3
not surprised by significantly small room as that seems typical in nyc but the condition could be better the hot water handle on the sink came off a lot of chips and cracks the shower would go ice cold then scalding hot every few seconds i paid extra for a view room which was nothing more than a view of the brick building next door so disappointed;3
overall the hotel was convenient to everything and was walkable to times square madison square garden empire state state building rockefeller center and radio city music hall i was disappointed in the 35 facility fee per day when in my opinion there were no amenities except the gym also you had to ask for a coffee maker and coffee and that should really be standard overall staff was friendly and helpful rooms were small but clean i felt they did a good job regarding safety of their guests the tick tock diner was great for breakfast and dinner as we ate there late one evening after a play;3
art deco style hotel in a great location right by penn station i have no doubt that in its day this hotel was magnificent sadly that day has passed and it is looking a bit tatty and unloved on the plus side the fitness centre is large and well equipped and staff seem friendly and helpful my room was small but comfortable fairly standard for manhattan unfortunately the bathroom was just filthy hairs around toilet and sink and a strong smell of urine disgusting in summary a shabby establishment trading on its location;3
reception staff are very friendly the bedroom was adequate although the windows could do with more soundproofing the bathroom was a big let down door missing on the shower you had to be either stick thin or very bendy to see yourself in the mirror as you could not stand in front of the sink the gap was ridiculous and who ever chose the wallpaper for the hallways must of been having a giggle when they said yes to that;3
i had a very good time in marrakesh staying at this riad after looking at tripadvisor and other travel related websites the riad is very nice and well furnished in naturally a moroccan theme light and airy the staff were good and marco who is the owner was attentive and kept a sharp eye on the staff they were all attentive and polite the bedroom was clean as were the public areas the only thing that brought this riad down was its location the riad is at times down dark alleyways and i travelling as a single female did not feel very comfortable walking back when it got dark especially dressed up with heels on taxis cannot get to the front door it is about 15 minutes or so walk to the main square and souks if it were not for the location i would consider;3
room was good hotel good location ok but if you have a car doesnt matter breakfast was good found some tiny cockroaches in the toilet;3
stayed for an overnight in early november had a twin room which was very clean but not the most spacious the room had a decent sized wardrobe and fridge along with mugs plates and cutlery ect i was located in the first floor across from a kitchen and 4 toilet cubicles overall the place was clean however it was very hot and the doors closed loudly which could affect you if your a light sleeperwasnt really a problem for me ideal location only a couple of minutes walk to the tube and shopping centre where a tesco can be found for less than â£20 a night i would recommend you get what you pay for and its ideal for somewhere to crash after a day sightseeing;3
ive been a couple of time a the empire hotel and each time i had the same sensation its a bit pretentious you can easily find fashion models in the elevator and a would like to be starlet at the lobby but the room are very small elevators always busy and the most annoying think is that you have to pay for a lot of things that are free in other important hotel 30 for internet 8 for a bottle of water prices who are not reasonable for the place;3
a good price for a perfect location staff are courteous and pleasant though the room is not as big as shown in the picture bathroom is small and has no bathtub no breakfast included but overall it is good if youâre not really expecting a luxurious place to stay;3
perfect location if visiting fordham university lincoln center plenty of restaurants and close to all the cultural venues eg the metropolitan opera juliard and lincoln center rooms are small and the toilet in my room was extremely close to the wall;3
we booked this 4 star hotel for our trip the rooms are lovely ask for a higher floorthe hotel is a 15 mins walk from the empire state and macys we have a great view on the 37th floor rooms are quite big but dated the bathrooms are so tiny and the shower makes an awful noise today we are celebrating a birthday and rang down to the front desk to request some cutlery and plates to enable us to eat the birthday cake i was horrified to be told no we have none of these items and go and buy them for yourselves from the shop opposite i thought you really are joking arent you no they replied i rang the tick tock diner inside the hotel and they also refused to loan us any plates etc im so angry right now and will be taking this up at check out the safe in;3
we had a week to spend in la and as it was our first visit we wanted to be close to the sights but not pay over the odds we found a good deal at this hotel and had a lovely stay here the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station which meant we could easily get to hollywood blvuniversal studios etc we stayed in the spa suite as thats all that was available when we booked the room was massive however a little dark due to lack of windows and poor lighting there was always room to park in the car park and always space at the pool pool became shady very early in the evening due to the hotel building but this i suppose is expected in a city full of high rise buildings the only negative to the spa room is the proximity to the vending and ice machines so our;3
nice hotel but its getting old and it seems like nobody cares about the conditions the sounds of the climaconditions are terrible nearly no long sleep possible take a room with look to the streets;3
people seem to either love this place or hate it i checked in around 1 pm and there was indeed a room ready id been apprehensive but gabriela at the front desk took good care of that it is a lovely lobby and the exterior details and some of the interior is high art deco if youre an architecture buff it reminds me of the hotels my parents stayed when i was a kid and they were at conventions large hallways somewhat elderly bathrooms a few scrapes here and there that were painted over real closets not so common in new hotels in this price range an iron and ironing board smallish bathroom but a big showerhead and quicktowarmup hot water no vanity the hair dryer is in a bag on the back of the bathroom door in this day and age of trademark mattresses this;3
we booked this hotel because of its location to universal studios my family has stayed at many hotels this was by far the most expensive stay of our lives we got to the hotel earlier than expected and asked to check in we were able to but needed to pay 25 plus take to do it an hour before noon bellmen wouldnt allow us to take our own luggage up to our rooms then lingered after bringing up the luggage expecting a tip im assuming do not eat here if you are on a budget breakfast and dinner prices are ridiculous 18 per person for a continental breakfast 65 for dinner service per adult crazy it was cheaper for us to order from ubereats postmates or even at universal studios hotel wouldnt let the delivery people up to the room so you have to meet them in;3
check in was smooth spanish attitude at front desk pool was nice breakfast was fine though there was limits on the eggs lol far from beach close to a nice diner within walking distance overall fine wouldnt stay here again though;3
arrival was quick and easy with great information from the concierge about our location and what was immediately around the local area we had a deluxe king size room and were so glad with the extra space and size of the bed although the desk chair needs replacing soon on closer inspection we struggled to find any plug socket in the walls that we could use as we looked we found there were plug sockets located in the bedside lamps which would have been fine except one of them was hanging out and my partner received a little shock from it to their credit they rectified the problem very quickly and gave us an extension cable so we had more sockets also looking around the bathroom we had a broken towel rail that was fixed quickly but a leaking shower that was not fixed;3
the hotel is very well situated at the corner of eighth avenue and 34th st close to penn station very small rooms with very small beds we reserved a family room for four persons and it certainly was not big enough the beds were very small and there were no place to put the suitcases we stumbled around in the room because the lack of space the cleaning was simply not good enough the room was dirty and only the beds were made the sink was constantly dirty and almost blocked we had to order toilet articles every day and at no point the housekeepers deliver what we ordered if we ordered 4 toothbrushes then only 2 came we paid extra for the view but it wasnt worth it the fitness room was nice with new machines however the floor was dirty even at 6 oclock in;3
we booked a room with a private bathroom we cant stand shared bathrooms and we knew in nyc where most building are ancient it was best to have our own private bathroom the room is certainly tiny but it was clean and tidy we couldnt expect more for a standard nyc hotel for 95 a night every night our wall panel heater will make this loud noise and that threw us off the first 2 nights then after that we just ignored it it is a basic hotel staff are not friendly so your best off using the free wifi and doing your own research overall we would not stay here again theres 2 good points in terms of location of this hotel its close to a subway and theres a delifruit market around the corner of the hotel as well as a bagel shop called absolute bagel which serves;3
stayed for the 1st time on may 15th for 3 nightsroom was nice and great view of universal studiosthe people at front desk were nice and helpful loved the free shuttle and was always on timehowevermy family felt very uncomfortable with the horrible service at the caferestaurantwe had free breakfast but paid the upgrade free to buffet breakfastdont even bother asking for a to go box they say no and then make you feel like your trying to steel foodonly after asking whydid they give me a small box to fit what i couldnt finishthey were quick to get us out and rude when i tried to tell a manager about the servicebecause of this i will not be coming back to the hilton;3
im staying right now with my mom who at 88 broke her hip a few months ago were here to see my daughter graduate from nyu right across the street at lincoln center so the location is perfect the room is a different story while it seems to have taken the american with disabilities act requirements and applied them it was clearly not with a real person in mind my mom is not in a wheelchair but if she was she wouldnt be able to see into the mirror in the bathroom there is very little room for putting personal items no hooks for hanging facecloths near the sink only one reading light in the room hint to management some disabled people have family members or spouses traveling with them the toilet seat is awkwardly placed and too low although it might be fine;3
the one ting that i liked is the hotel location quite and easy to access however the services rooms condition and furniture isnt five or four star i just rate it average and being a hilton member i didnt get any privileges instead treated as a guest;3
i can warmly recommend this hotel to lowbudget travellers but to be honest not to anyone searching for any kind on luxury or top place for small money riverside is like last stop before a hostel place nothing more best properties were low price and good location the room was ok tv freezer air conditioner good double bed bathrooms were comfortable and clean housekeeping was diligent location is quite good 2 good busslines from downtown and several subways comes to 72st station which is just 200m away after all hotel administration should chance all the advertising information in hotels presentations 1hotel riverside studio is only a couple of blocks from broadway next to trump towers new buildings no way 2surrounded by many restaurants featuring;3
i had a private room for two persons with shared shower and toilet on the corridor all were clean unfortunately not all showers had hooks for clothes the room was basic and clean expect for some stains on the wall the beds were ok and a towel was provided there was a small table with chair a cupboard with a mirror and a medium sized fridge also for each person there was a plate and crockery perfect to get some food from the many take away restaurants in the neighborhood or drink a beer after the bars are closed almost after dinner in uk the metro is on 5 minutes walk from the hostel especially it is a convenient if you want to see a match of qpr or fullham or a concert at the eventim arena there is a belushis bar which closes at 200 during weekends so you do;3
this was our 2nd visit to the hotel we were disappointed with the room it was tiny the room should have been for 1 persons but 2 of us in the room no bedside cabinet having to use window ledge to put water etc tiny bathroom its ok for just sleeping very disappointed esp after 1st visit;3
we stayed at the jane this last october and it was awesome it is not for everyone i imagine but if you ever traveled in europe in your youth and embraced the youth hostel environment this will bring back great memories while there are nice captains room that offer their own private bathrooms i prefer the bunkbed rooms are they small yes are they cramped yes do you need to walk down the hall to use the bathroom yes however the room is clean efficient and a one of a kind experience the front desk staff was gracious and accomodating the cafe in the lobby has coffee to die for all the beautiful cool people queue up in the lobby to enter the ballroom late at nightyou can safely walk to the subway meatpacking district and all the while feel like a local this hotel;3
we asked to check in early and they asked for a fee of 70 then they reduced to 50 if we donât want to pay for early check in then we have to pay for luggage storage the room does not have coffee machine or the refrigerator if we want to have those items we have to pay additional for each item the location is a couple blocks from penn station and 1015 min walk to koreantown or timesquare which is convenient overall i wouldnât recommend unless you are willing to pay for those additional fees;3
we stayed at the ramada for 2 nights the hotel is of older style but the rooms are very clean when we arrived we were given one room that was meant to be nonsmoking but it was very smokey and horrible the checkin staff gave us another room after a little persuading we also booked the hotel for the gym facilities which are terrible at the hotel so dont stay here if you want a working gym everything was broken the location was ok there is not that much close by so if you want a restaurant you will need to drive a few blocks up the hotel is close to all the main hollywood sites and near to universal studios;3
used to stay here all the time for work havenât been here in years and have to say this place needs a makeover big time carpets are fraying was no shower door in our room ring the front desk during normal hours and sometimes no one picks up at all no room service accessible and it generally just needs to be re done the good news itâs reasoanbly cheap and the location is obviously very good being close to the park and lincoln center;3
no complaints about the hotel as it was cleanthe double room was not massive but enough space to move around inthe location was excellent for moving around the city and near rail and coach stationsnot far from time square and any type of shop you want to visitthe tick tock cafã© within the hotel serves good food and there is an excellent cafã© one avenue down on 7th avenue called andrews cafã©diner which is superbthey rate there food establishments a b c d etc so watch out for an a in the window as by law they have to show the rating in the window;3
we stayed at the days inn on feb 151714 in room 515 at 200 a night it was supposed to be a bargain in new york but i was surprised on how little you get for 200 in new york the room was clean except for cob webs on the cieling the room was dated small and the ac didnt work on the up side it was in a very good location i would stay there again only because it was the cheapest hotel in the area we wanted to be but i would not brag about this place;3
small and old room bed to small cleaning personal very friendly at the reception not so and altimes controll when you entering the hotel for the elevator 36th was great nice fiew direction freedom tower;3
convenient to the airport we had a quiet dinner at the restaurant to unwind from the long flight service was appreciated and the menu was limited but the meal was not bad even got them to deliver a bowl of ramen noodles from the shop outside the restaurant frequent shuttle service and for an early departure with flight crews having 4 buses first thing in the morning made a difference;3
we opted for a captains room with ensuite good size room king size bed with views over the river beautiful original bathroom big enough to move around in robes very helpful staff great roof top bar quiet despite proximity to roadway no coffee in room excellent location and facilities for the price highly recommended;3
lobby is dark restaurant eds chowder house is bright very good and hidden on the 2nd floor 20 off if you book after 8pm rooftop bar open in season to the public but if you look closely in the bathroom and its hard not too its so tiny you need to step into the shower to close the door the real clue is on the shelf on the wall little orange ear plugs tucked in with qtips and cotton balls if you stay there use them if you are there with another person ask for a 2nd pair especially if you are on the columbus ave side one sunday night we had the worst nyc sleeps weve had in years the deal we got on the price was not worth having such a miserable next day;3
first the good very nice and helpful staff whose customer service was impressive great location for upper west side close to the express 23 train or local 1 nice lobby reasonable sized rooms the less than good water in our bathroom only ran hot no cold we asked once at the desk and miraculously that day had cold water but never before or after the shower was uncomfortably hot plumbing is old and though we were careful the toilet backed up having seen a maintenance man walking around with a plunger i suspect this happens often nyc rooms are small and this king room was no exception but it was doable unfortunately its really drab and in need of upgrades the doors to all rooms do not have the sound catchers that keep them from slamming loudly we had;3
after 15hr flight i desperately need a rest entering my room air conditioner made noisy sound apparently itâs malfunction i ask to change a room our engineer will check your air conditioner mr engineer came after 30 mins after 15 mins check engineer called front desk to give me a new room then another 30 mins waiting came bell caption to lead me to the new room sure itâs quite enough to sleep be patience it took me over one hour to change room after that when i was taking a shower it took me another 1 hour waiting for them bring me toothbrush yes itâs another one hour waiting be patience every service at this hotel goes unexpected slow hotel provide free shuttle service to lax airport at every 10 minutes;3
i reserved a king with a city view using expedia upon arrival we were booked into 235 i think the room number was and it had a view of some trees i went back to the front desk and asked if we could have a room with a view since that is what we paid for and this was the response when you book with a 3rd party like expedia those are just requested rooms there is nothing saying you will actually get the type of room you paid for well that is frustrating he said that for 30 he could upgrade us to a corner king with a city view and he would wave the 2nd nights upgrade fee and also throw in free wifi we wended up doing it and the new room 1457 is great but buyer beware you might not get what you paid for and it might cost you an upgrade fee to get it the;3
i had a long lay over coming back from a mexico vacation the place is very convenient but if youre tired this place is not the place to sleep the walls are very thin and you can hear everything not sure i would stay here again;3
my wife and i stayed here on a four day trip to new york the location was great just a short stroll from penn station which was ideal for the subway also close to madison square gardens we were greeted by very friendly reception staff who presented us with a complimentary bottle of wine as it was our honeymoon thanks mahamood our room was a little small and tired however that is my only criticism the staff were all friendly the bed comfortable and shower excellent this hotel is ideal for those wanting a good location and just a bed to sleep in whilst over in new york;3
ok except for fire alarm for 30 minutes in middle of night and elevator and electrical shutdown for many hours no room maintenance next day no mention by hotel by email or staff by person apologizing for experience not any move to make adjustments for it;3
we originally booked a standard double queen room the room was small and dark it was also on the 11th floor near the lift which after the 1st night realised it was the floor to the rooftop bar lots of noise of people going back to rooms from the bar and had loud noise of fans or generator outside we asked for a different room and with the wonderful assistance given by danny at reception decided to upgrade to a king size on 8th floor well worth the upgrade the room was very light and spacious no comparison to the double queen box room great shower plenty of hot water and good wifi the room was at the side of the building with view of the plaza the only strange thing was that the cheaper room provided a coffee machine and free bottles of water which was not provided in;3
stayed at this hotel for 2 nights between christmas and the new year the main reason we stayed here as will no doubt be the same as most others is the location to universal and for this it is great however with some small attention to detail it could be a lot better i just got the feeling that the hotel knows the location will bring in guests and as such minor issues are left ignored the room itself was poorly cleaned you could write a message on the dust on the tv if someone had opened the cabinet door when cleaning the room they would have noticed there were stains on the carpet one one morning there was no hot water at approx 700 am tried to use the transport to universal twice but couldnt get on it so walked instead etc at the buffet breakfast which isnt;3
yes you get 50 off room size expect a tiny room mabye 100sqf 50 off tv size mine was aprox 27 inch 50 off service we had to carry our four bags ourselves no room service 50 off room amenities no fridge inside the room but yes al least you have a safe box what gives a three star only location a block away from msg and penn and macys also if you go expecting to see an art deco historical place please look for another hotel you will only find an old hotel with no service at all;3
we booked directly with the hotels website and obtained an excellent deal as we were visitors from outside the usa in fact we saved around 50 off the base rate for our stay of 5 nights we had a spacious room with two king size beds nice small pool complimentary breakfast the hotel is very close to the metro system and also close to main bus routes too a day ticket for travel on any bus or metro was about 5 great value we too the metro into la town and also a bus from just around the corner to santa monica the room was adequate if a little dated but at the price we paid i would not complain its 4 stops on the metro to hollywood walk of fame we drove to the hotel from las vegas we parked in the grounds of the hotel we paid 22 a night to park which i;3
if you are traveling alone and dont need a massive room at 300 up this could be your dream hotel but it could easily become a total hell if you dont know what you are getting into im 65 and i was worried that the beds would be too small they are fine standard length and width single beds with room at the end for your feet to hang off cant talk for the bunk rooms but i expect the ends are closed in the rooms are compact but had everything i needed water wifi nice towels robe slippers pencil pad ipod alarm and a dvdtv loads of storage above and below the bed including a safe and house keeping were a pair of charming ladies who would service my room as late as 5pm the shared bathrooms are great nice products good showers never had to wait;3
nice little the emphasis is on the little approx 10 ft x 10ft room on an excellent location and economic price the heating of the room could only be controlled by turning on or off at the stem valve when on it made noises suggesting rodents presence the elevators need improvement;3
while the staff was certainly friendly and accommodating there doesnt seem to be a sense of urgency when it comes to maintenance at the days hotel in particular the elevator doors didnt always open the lifts often skipped floors someone did finally get stuck in one during my stay not sure for how long wireless access in rooms never worked shower water took 510 minutes to heat up tubs had trouble draining and general upkeep seemed lacking especially in the lobby still they did upgrade me to a king size bed they were overbooked on my first night and had to stick me in a smoking room yuck and the maids did a nice job of keeping the bathrooms and such clean if youve ever traveled in hostels especially asia or latin america this place will seem;3
i stayed only one night over christmas it is not my type of hotels usually but i had a 50 expedia coupon and since the new yorker is one of expedias vip accessâ¢ hotel i was able to double the value of my points plus 15 off one night stay so i booked one queen bedroom and the total paid was 9345 look for good hotel offer the hotel location was alright i personally prefer to be closer to time square i got there during the peak of checkin time and the line was long checkin was convenient and staff was ok the room was small but clean the bed wasnt bad either complimentary wifi;3
the location just perfect to visit all great points the hotel staff friendly and helpful was clean room but very uncomfortable and hard bed if you want to use a wifi is 10 charge for 24 hours just few mins walk is subway station and the lovely place for the breakfast and late night sit with free wifi just beside the round about;3
fantastic professional staff very kind and accomodating our issues were air con broken walls paper thin so could here people next door shower extremely difficult to operate lighting difficult to navigate;3
pro very friendly and helpful staff thanks a lot safe neighborhood quite a reasonable price for nyc we payed usd 115 per night two beds private bathroom in general room was clean con wifi isnâ´t included in the room rate sorry not acceptable from my perspective in 2016 when i have free internet even in several subway stations old hotel looks like they wanna make some money from the old cash cow location is good and safe but itâ´s on the upper west end of central park so definitely not central in terms of typical tourist life depends how you define central in new york but there isnâ´t much to see besides harlem and the columbia university too far to walk to downtown so you need the subway dark room just one window to a lightway;3
we stayed here for a couple of nights in the city before embarking on a cruise we checked in around noon and were promised a call when our room was ready after dropping our bags with bell services we hit the city for some lunch and light sightseeing until our room was ready as we had been traveling since 400am we were pretty tired and were ready for a little rest we returned to the hotel at 300pm official checkin time having not heard anything about our room being ready yet sure enough it was not the guest services representative said it would likely be another hour as the previous guest had just checked out too tired to do any more sightseeing we relaxed in the lobby until 400pm the room was still not ready but the representative said they would find out;3
great city location the new yorker is in a fantastic place for exploring and getting around the city situated right opposite penn station and maddison square garden and a short walk from times square and hudson mall and piers hotel staff were friendly and professional and hotel clean but although itâs an old hotel with lots of history it needs a bit of an upgradepaint etc looks tired but bed comfortable and being the city that never sleeps it was well received after a long day on our feet no tea and coffee in rooms but a coffee bar in lobby and the tick tock 24 hr diner too good choice of breakfast and meals and also a mcdonaldâs and starbucks right opposite hotel although plenty diners and bagel shops on each corner too;3
the hotel has a great localization but the rooms and bathrooms need improvement reform we had several issues in our bathroom and after the last one it took more than 3 hours to be cleanded but we love the localization;3
front desk and maintainance staff were helpful there was no top sheet on the bed unless requested the bathroom had major water damage the towels smelled bad and the hallway smelled like cigarettes;3
while i have stayed at this hotel four times i think that my stay with the new yorker was nicer before wyndham bought it it is beginning to look very tired however the staff is very efficient and nice;3
the location is amazing the value is typical for nyc hotels read poor 180 to park my car for thee days 76 for a 25 cabernet in the mini bar glad i bought my own the hotel was clean recently renovated in 80s cheesiness very comfy king bed opt for the king room which is still very small compared to the poorly placed and minuscule queen rooms very polite staff from front desk valets to maids and very clean the only negatives are the add ons room was 300 a night not bad for nyc in this hood and the ridiculously designed cubby hole of a bathroom be sure to hit the roof bar starbucks downstairs for the free wifi 13 a day at the hotel tsk tsk;3
for my wife and me this was the right location at the right price our room was modest yet clean clean and comfortable the only shortcoming was that the bathroom while fully functioning was not yet finished its renovation;3
like many manhattan hotels the rooms are small and the spaces are cramped the lobby is pretty and the room decor is up to date and upscale the location is excellent for lincoln center central park and a whole foods is nearby its in the basement of the shopping center there are no obvious signs outside if you plan to visit in the summer dont unless they have upgraded the air conditioning units under the decorative cover inside the hotel room is a dying relic of a bygone era red and blue buttons offering selections like heat cool high and cool low our unit did nothing we called the front desk and let them know and went out for dinner and drinks we returned ad midnight and nothing was working the front desk said they would reset the breaker they did;3
came for a 2 day business trip when i arrived i received a complimentary room upgrade which was nice the front desk and concierge are lovely and very helpful the room was nice but you could either turn the heater on and bake or turn it off and be a little cold in addition the toilet blocked up which was not pleasant luckily it happened just as i checked out great restaurant just a little pricy i would come again but they should pay attention to the little details as these are what make the difference between a nice stay and a great stay;3
lots of restaurant options and friendly service rooms are typical in size of an older new york hotel small but set up well it is clean but could use a refresh conveniently located near penn station;3
i think the lobby was nice and so was the front desk people as far as the hallways its very confusing the elevators are extremely slow and the room was outdated i paid over a 100 for this room and i was utterly in disappointment because ive been to a lot of days inn but never like this one there have been times ive paid less money and have gotten bigger better up to date rooms the rug was pulled up and tattered near the bathroom the wallpaper was peeling off the ceiling the bathroom was beautiful and was the only thing bigger than the whole room its near the subway which is good but that dont matter to mei only stayed one night but i think this hotel is overly priced and i hope undercover boss comes and check out this one so some changed can be made i only;3
for a fourstar reasonably expensive hotel this place offers no frills its in a great location room and bed were clean and comfortable staff were friendly but note that the swimming pool is tiny even by hotel standards the wifi bottled water and hot drinks in your room are subject to expensive surcharges i would recommend asking for a room above the 2nd floor as the streets were pretty noisy;3
central down town hotel comfortable decent sized room informed of an upgrade when checking in but bathroom outdated recommended if all you need is a bed for the night adequate breakfast in adjoining diner;3
stayed for 4 nights dec 25 dont know why some people complain about this hotel staff were excellentvery helpful at all timesclean roomhot water day or nightclean towels and bedding every day never watched the tv only in the room to sleep really nice little deli run by turkish family along the streetgreat breakfast all in all a great stay for usa big thank you to arisam and the rest of the staff;3
this is an apartment not a hotel there is no service besides a doorman who makes sure people dont get in who arent supposed to but pizza delivery does and they will order an airport transfer for you if neededthey have kitchen facilities and a grocery store close buy its one block from the 72nd street subway with access to the main routes and express there is an awsome restaurant for breaky less than 2 blocks away and a loehmans for shopping the same distance you feel like a resident for sure staying here there is the cutest tea shop not far called alices tea cup wicked scones but no coffee warning the futons are not comfy but are bearablejust sayin;3
i booked last minute through a discount site after other plans fell apart the new yorker offers easy access to penn station madison garden macys and tons of great restaurants the property is best for families groups international travelers and couples on a budget stay hipsters and party seekers might choose something else as this property has a strict nosmoking policy including vape pens housekeeping was very nice attentive and the hotel was clean i would stay again if seeking a quick stay in the city;3
woke up first day to no hot water took several hours to fix that night there was a fire in what we assume was elevator had to sit in lobby with 300 other guests until after 1pm limited working elevator service with 24 floors if you are looking for location this is the place for value i wont be going again there was no compensation for the inconvenience paid for executive level only received continental breakfast for price no executive space;3
you basically need to do everything by your own no warm welcome at the door dont ask dont tell policy at reception just a sleepnfly kind of hotel rather than a fullledged regency hotel make sure you checkin at the hotel first if you arrive in a rental car neither the hotel or the rental cars have shuttles that will take you tofrom the hotel i basically had to come back walking from hertz the hotel shuttle will take you only to the airport and departs from airport every 10 minutes avoid at all costs the coffee in the takeout cafe at first floor it is the worst coffee i have had in my life;3
i stayed here for a week in private room the check was easy and the staff friendly i wasnt expecting housekeeping service considering it is a hostel but our towels and bedding were changed daily the room and bathroom was clean and the noise is very minimal a little noise from the busy road not too far away but nothing i would bother complaining about the location is superb 5 minute walk from hammer smith tube station and bus station and there a nice little pub that does very good breakfast just across from the station also very cheep too all in all a very nice little hotel i cant fault them at all nicest backpackers ive stayed in in a long time;3
great location for operagoers especially on cold winter nights room was quiet and average size for nyc but sadly only a view of the hvac system good access to subway at columbus circle hotel staff in general was helpful;3
stayed here for 5 nights first of all the good great location historic art deco hotel which has in the main been restored with sympathy has a nice little museum that tells you some of the history of the hotel too our room was kept clean not so good staff almost all not that friendly well certainly the ones we encountered our room was on the small side which we had paid an extra circa 175 to have a view which at best was a part view due to where it was in the building not worth it less good was my asking for a tour of the hotel to a front of house staff member who said someone would phone me in my room in an hour to arrange it i didnt get the call the night before we were due to leave the hotel manager phoned to ask how our stay was and when i mentioned;3
my wife and i stayed for two nights in midjanuary at the empire hotel the checkin process took a while as echoed by other reviews and the staff was not particularly friendly but not rude either the room was small but what i expected in ny the bathroom however was impractical especially the shower with only half the enclosure the heater was very noisy at night prompting us to turn it off in 19 degree weather so we could get some sleep tried to call the concierge one evening probably a dozen times and no one ever answered on the plus side awesome location and very comfortable beds;3
great location easy to get there close to the park restaurants shopping midtown and times square the room itself was ok nice decor in the lobby with very spotty wifi wifi in the room was very off and on good thing i brought my own internet device as others have said the bathrooms have nice decor but what a weird design it is almost impossible to not get the floor wet and there is water condensation on everything afterwards unless you shower with the door open all they had to do was put a glass slider or swinging door on beds are hard but pillows are nice we stayed 3 people in the room and it was a squeeze but fortunately we didnt have large luggage the biggest cons if you stay in a room facing the street are noise bring your earphones like;3
i stayed here recently and want to give accolades to gunita the front desk receptionist she was charming warm and hospitable and i am only writing this because of her being a new yorker i booked this hotel as a staycation when i arrived gunita upgraded my room and when i called for ice she sent up a complimentary bottle of wine thank you again gunita you are the definition of hospitality;3
i didnt hate the place staff was nice location is great the beds are awful though and the lack of shower door is just weird we had puddles on the floors constantly rusty chrome on stuff in the bathroom some peeling wallpaper;3
me and my wife were last week in this hotel for 4 nights its clean hotel with simple and small rooms room was equiped by aircondition sattv bathroom fan they cleaned room and changing towels every day personal on reception was unfriendly and boring hotel is equiped with free wifi;3
the only reason to stay here is its closeness to lincoln center we have stayed at 5 different hotels in nyc the last month and a myriad of hotels worldwide this is the only hotel that charges you for making coffee in your room cannot be a big money maker for them with a starbucks in the same building on the street level and starbucks is cheaper the barhroom was barely big enough to turn around in the sink did not drain and the door was dirty and in need of paint another unique feature was the intimacy package for purchase that included condoms and other items strange long line at checkout while employees chatted with guests no reason to stay hete plenty of other nicer places for the same price;3
we stayed at the empire hotel for 2 nights in november 2011 the location is great however we had to change room twice as it was noisy and the airconditioning did not work also the decor is a little dated it was expensive for the service we received overall disappointing;3
stayed at this hotel in july as part of a trip to celebrate my 50th birthday we had chosen this hotel based on its location as it stands on the corner of 8th avenue and west 34th street so is close to macys and the empire state building penn station and madison square garden are across the road and times square is about 10 minutes walk away there are a number of subway stations nearby so the whole of manhattan is accessible the hotel was opened in the 1930s and in keeping with its style the rooms are not massive a bit of a squeeze for three adults but we managed we had a lovely view of the empire state building the beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean the hotel could do with updating and the decor was looking a bit drab there was a safe and we hired a;3
i tried looking for the cheapest accomodation in new york in autumn of course it was difficult and so i settled for this hostel as its location is good and indeed one of the cheapest in nyc reservation was not as efficient as i hoped i had to call numerous times as i found out that the room i booked was not actually reserved for me and offered to somebody else well they sorted it out after several long distance calls but i almost had to beg them to give me assurance that ill have a room when i get there i booked a standard single and it was even worse than my very low expectation it was a really tiny room with a small window and furniture that looked like it was bought from a flea market or salvaged from a garage sale it was a nightmare and i really didnt even want;3
great gentrified location near the sunset strip comfortable if a little worn rooms and clean very nice breakfast very nice staff near some great funky shopping and restaurants and bars and coffee shops;3
close for subway away from the crowds quiet clean we had 3 to a room and had to ask for extra towels twice hair dryer didnât work and did ask twice that was a nuisance in december this is low end but was certainly clean and the price was right we stayed 4days;3
this is a nice hotel to stay at for events at the lincoln center the decor is somewhat funky wild wallpaper in the hallway but the rooms were clean the rooms however are very small unless you get a suite the bathroom has a nice shower but there seems to be a design flaw with the shower head and bar the rain head did not work properlythere was no way to turn off the shower bar and just use the rain option the bar was not positioned correctly the water hit the wall or shot directly out of the shower opening all over the floor an average size person would have difficulty having a relaxing shower the water did come up to temperature quickly though the sink area has a very small soap dish ledge but it was not big enough for a dopp kit or face wash products the;3
not much to do in this area besides layover for lax nothing walkable i would say especially at night hotel under renovation so elevators are slow and you have to walk outside to get to the breakfast area not bad but not great either renovated rooms are okay;3
i stayed at this days inn as part of a conference in nyc and i have to admit being disappointed when i walked through the door the room smelled musty and looked as if it hadnt been redecorated in 20 yearrs the ac didnt seem to be kicking out any really cool air the wifi seemed to sporadically stop working and the bed linens looked rumpled as if they hadnt been changed since the previous guest it was adequate for my onenight stay but the property is really in need of repairs and updating especially in a tourist city like nyc the staff however were extremely friendly kind and helpful;3
first of all let me get started by saying this was my third time staying at the empire and the last time in the middle of the summer the ac in my room was broken so i arrive and was immediately charged a usd45 fee for sending a package over before hand ok a little disappointing but paid the fee and went on with my life secondly i was staying at the hotel during a move so i had a lot of luggage as soon as i walked in i told the person who checked me in i would be leaving two pieces in storage during the duration of my stay and he said ok the next day i asked the bell man to visit my luggage in order to get out a missing item and was greeted by a very rude man asking man when i was removing my luggage which wasnâ´t supposed to me stored in a hotel i might add i;3
firstly the positives the wyndham new yorker has a lot of history theres a small free museum downstairs and you cant really beat the location literally a stones throw from madison square garden and 1015 mins from empire state building and times square there are 2 or 3 subway stations nearby which is convenient service was also good check in was painless and we had an issue with the toilet bring blocked which was sorted very quickly and efficiently tick tock diner next door was awesome we only ate there once but would recommend it for the location we didnt hear any noise during the night etc but i guess this may vary depending on where youre staying in the hotel negatives the room is tiny ive heard this is normal for new york we had a double bed and not;3
i have stayed at the days broadway previously and was compelled to write reviews describing an awful hotel a client booked me into a new york hotel for 3 nights and i was horrified to discover they had chosen the days hotel broadway anyway circumstances conspired such that i could not change the reservation and i checked in with trepidation i have to say the improvement is vast the room was on the 14th floor and it was clean the sheets were pristine the bed was comfortable and the air conditioningheating worked my only problems were a lack of hot water and the truely awful elevators it is hard to conceive how they can be so slow i will have no hesitation about staying there in future;3
we didnt get to the hotel until almost midnight but we still got our adjoining rooms as requested which was great we also got a rollaway last minute and they gave it to us at nocharge one of the rooms however smelled like cigarette smoke but that late at night with a 5 year old we didnt feel like dealing with trying to change rooms we never did change rooms and we stayed there four nights we were all too settled in and didnt feel like dealing with moving everyone the rooms were very spacious we got a large king with a sofa and a room with two queen beds our view was of the highway but i didnt care about that since you arent supposed to be in the room much on vacation the shower leaked a little as well as the sink and the room never really got that;3
i was a bit saddened to see that things at the jane had deteriorated noticeably since my last visit one day nobody changed towels or tidied my room at all the next they were knocking at the door at 830 waking me up the wifi in the cafe is worse than 1994 dialup i had to cancel my order and walk to an outside cafe because it was so slow i couldnât use it for work iâm talking about a minute to load a page of text one night i came back late around 2am and was accosted by two hookers in the lobby the front door was wide open nobody at the desk or door and the women came into the elevator with me groping me and asking me for money the frequent private events in the rooftop bar make it impossible to invite friends to meet there often leading to long waits for;3
i used to love staying at the empire but on this last trip i kept trying not to be disappointed by my experience but was at most every turn i was in a celebratory mood when i checked in and told that to the front desk man who didnt care or comment on that i reserved a room with a city view and was dispatched to a room with views of a brick wall really within the first 5 minutes of my stay i felt not listened to and taken advantage of the only way to get what i reserved and was told i already had was to upgrade to a room that was 100 a night more which i did so i wouldnt have to look at brick walls on my 4 night stay within 1 hour of checking into my room the internet failed and i couldnt get online from my room for hours for a hundred dollars a night moreoh and;3
we paid 173 tax included for this room which is inexpensive for nyc the room was just that â a room to sleep in and not much else no frills at all so dont expect otherwise i have read other reviews of this property and was surprised at what people expect for this price sorry but this is nyc and if you want the waldorf than you have to pay the price however if you are in need of just a place to sleep then this does the job there was an unnecessarily huge dresser that took up a large part of the small room the room was clean but very outdated the elevator was very small and slower than molasses the wifi code they provided did not work since we have been to nyc many times we didnât need to be down where all the action is in midtown we needed to be near;3
problem with check in as computers where down had to wait 20mins then the first room we had was old dirty and tired we thought about walking out but the hotel was full and really busy so we asked to change 2nd room was a lot better they had clearly done some work on the room but still not 4 star bfast was nice whole hotel was very busy and everyone else likes it so it might have just been our standards there are no restaurants or shops in walking distance parking good but traveling places was a nightmare and then you have to pay to park everywhere its not really my sort of four star but i would give it 3 wish we had booked a hotel in studio city more international;3
opposite to the lincoln center nothing could be more convenient if you are attending performances at the center you can cross the avenue in your evening attire avoiding the nonfunctional garderobe services particularly in the opera the property is old and althouhg newly painted and carpeted you can feel the uneven floor surface and see the uneven ceilings room service is inferior i stayed 8 nights and only once was the minibar refilled without separate call apparently one bottle of juice should suffice for a week housekeeping left something to be desired too restaurant not recommended but luckily there are several nice establishments across the broadway boulud sud boulud bar fiorellos smith atlantic grill and the lincoln at the center room;3
wasnt the greatest of hotels was very dated and quite noticeable that the staff didnt wanna be there location is good and cleanliness could be better i would stay again but only if i had too be warned that they expected a tip every second or thats the impression i got;3
the new yorking is a very historic hotel located right in the middle of all the action in manhatton easy walking distance to the empire state building and time square tons of shopping all around including the massive macys store lots of food choices nearby as well the rooms are very small and dated but comfortable;3
nice place showers didnt heat up during hours 9am5pm kinda dodgy neighbourhood maids very intrusive but very nice would have preferred a no maid today sign to stick on my door as was only myself and had four towels only really needed the maids every couple of days internet was good but around 10pm wireless only worked on half of the room additionally phone pizza delivery button sent me to a very strange number;3
one or two of the staff seemed rudetalking about you whilst you walk away i was annoyed as i booked two single rooms for two nights at the same time for two people i asked they put both rooms on my account which they said they did when going to pay i was told 260odd was my total then after taking the money visa card the lady at reception blonde girl said 350odd i said i was annoyed as thats 3 different prices i have been quoted 290odd from bookingcom then two different prices from her she said they only put one night on my account for my friends stay and she would have to charge my card again she said bookingcom didnt add taxes she then went to use the visa card again and said it was declined i was annoyed as the manager who came out after i made a;3
nothing special about this hotel except for the staff really nice and eager to please the rooms were not as clean as i would expect from a full service hilton but the bed was really comfortable i will return to this hotel simply because i found the staff to be so wonderful;3
we stayed here a few years ago now so things might have changed i have only just joined tripadviser so here goes we thought these apartments where ideally situated clean and looked after ive been in some real bad hotels in the us so this was a refreshing change the apartment had everything you would need and it was clean and well decorated we never really bother about the rooms as we never stay in them long only to sleep one thing i found was the staff where not that helpfull but apart from that it was ok location is why we booked this apartment and we where not dissapointed as there is a subway entry 2 mins down the road also there are a lot of locals in this area so you dont feel like you are a tourist we dined out in a few of the restaurants in the central;3
this hotel is well situated close to everything including great restaurants and pubs the bell hops are very friendly and give great advice i found the check in staff slow and didnt speak english well so communication was a little frustrating the room we stayed in was super super small we were unable to leave a suitcase open because there was no floor space;3
we stayed here as itâs one block to penn station and we were going out by train the next am bathroom for standard room is so tiny itâs one person only room is tiny but bed was comfortable and it was clean very busy lobby we wouldnât stay here again too old and tired with too snail of rooms for the price;3
5 star advertised though the rooms were more like 34 star the pool was advertised but closed when we were there for refurbishment staff were helpful friendly good location but a poor view from our room;3
as everyones said this isnt a luxury hotel but it is a comfortable place in a good location its handy to a subway and an easy walk to central park we stayed in a twin room and the beds were comfortable the bathroom was clean and functional noise does carry a bit in the hotel which could be a downside if youre a light sleeper the price was very reasonable easily the cheapest we could find recommend it based on that alone;3
we booked the ameritania due to its close proximity to central park and the ny marathon finish the hotel has some really glowing reviews on tripadvisor whilst we thought it was a good comfortable option for what we needed i am not sure it was anything out of the ordinary in terms of look feel or service i wouldnt particularly say it was great value for money given we paid câ£1000 for 4 nights but i accept we would have been booking on a peak weekend given the marathon the hotel itself is very dark nowhere near as bright as the pictures look on the website we had a deluxe room and i certainly wouldnt recommend going for a standard we saw our friends room you could hardly walk round the bed they had already asked to move once because their original room was;3
appealing common areas room was so so dã©cor is dark various shades of brown so the room seemed even smaller and more confining we were on the inside of the hotel overlooking hvac systems i guess it was quieter than being on the street side but even darker that way and no view the rooftop bar was pretty cool;3
our room was clean and spacious for two adults with 2 full sized double beds front staff are very helpful and friendly breakfast eggs to order are good this is why my rating is 35 all other breakfast offerings are basic and scarce amount on offer does not accommodate the guest sizeevery morning we would be waiting for replenishment of fruit breakfast pastries tea bags not good enough i was questioned why i require 2 tea bags actually i like a strong tea i liked the size off the hotel proximity to metro and bus but the area has a large population of homeless and mentally ill citizens which we found confronting and weary of our surrounds its a shame because the hotel is cute;3
the hotel location is prime you cant get any closer to universal studios traveling with kids i look for safe clean hotels and the hilton fits the bill you can tell the carpets in the room are a little old but the room itself was clean and not bad the problem with this hotel is its understaffed from the moment i drove up no valet greeted me nothing the one valet guy was retrieving cars helping others in a booth they should really have another guy helping not until i got out of my car and hunted someone down did i get some help then the check in was the same deal only one person was working the desk to check in guests the breakfast buffet same thing only one cook working the omeletwaffle station a huge line formed by the time i got my omelet the rest of;3
this hotel feels like a small apartment building that someone has recently retrofitted into a hotel thats both good and bad in some ways the most surprising thing for a hotel isno elevator thats right if you have a room on the 4th floor youre going to have to walk up they are very good about taking your stuff up so no worries about that in some ways its giving you a real nyc experience the first apartment i had in nyc was a 4th floor walk up and this felt very similar the rooms are tiny mine was barely big enough to fit a twin bed but again this is nyc what did you expect that said the rest of the experience is fine the rooms are clean the lobby is nice the location is actually very central youll have to walk a few blocks to find;3
are you looking for a place to sleep in ny this is your place the rooms are not very big but they are very clean and confortable metro is just round the corner the stuff is nice and helpful the area is very quiet and there are a couple of restaurants near;3
the big stuff elefant of my daughter which she used as pillow for years with an very emotional valuedisappeared out of the room the front desk were friendly and appologized they said i have not to worry about but thats it i heard nothing from the front desk or security if they find something out i almost had to demand and the last day it was finished without any result i got nothing as a consolation or apology further we were very disappointed that the pooldeck was closed the pooldeck was one of the decicive reason why we book your hotel in summer our last day we got a breakfast voucher for compensation;3
i went to this hotel with my partner for 4 days room okay but no kettle to make tea or coffee which was a disappoint as most hotels have this was advised when booking the pool would be open thats why we booked the hotel in the first place but to our disappointment it was closed when checking out we never got asked if wee enjoyed our stay just took our key;3
we arrived very tired after driving from san diego after taking a cruise chap on front desk was very nice and gave us a large room on fifth floor near the rear elevators on a busy street but we walked up a ways and got a sub sanwich to bring back to our room no problem there is a childrens hospital almost next door took a tour the next afternoon arranged by front desk worth the money breakfasts were great and there is a wendys near by pool was very nice only slight complaintsometimes funny smell om first floor near the rear;3
this is a nice hotel but the staff seems unconcerned with providing customer service we took cold showers for four days that is bad but what is worse is the total and complete lack of followup by staff they not only never acted to solve the problem they never responded to phone calls other than to say engineering would be notified;3
i stayed here for business in november because my company did not provide another option being a former resident in the city i did not expect this property to provide above the average service or ambiance it was sufficient for a onenight business trip stay efficient checkin and clean small room and very cold bathroom room however finance does not work well i called the hotel twice in the past week asking someone to email me the folio so i can submit my expenses one lady took my information after asking me to spell my name and email address about five times and i still do not have the simple folio email i had requested truly beyond comprehension this is an economical option for a family trip if no one will spend much time at the hotel or if you have a tight budget;3
the hotel does the basics right but generally seems quite worn down and out of dateit seems like theyre trying with a pool roof top bar gym etc however all of these amenities really arent recommendablebed and room was clean though;3
nice hotel staff very polite opening doors for you asking if you need help with anything room was very noisey heatingaircon units sounded like a plane taking off try and get a room as high up as possible to reduce noise level;3
just returned from a 4 night stay as everyone mentions location is fantastic close to time square and penn subway station on 34th also less than 5 min walk to port authority bus station on 8th ave room on floor 27 was dated as was every area we were in corridors etc and our friends floor on 24 however it was clean the housekeeping staff do a good job rooms a small but this was to be expected one issue we had was the temperature of the shower it was extremely hot on the first two mornings we tried everything to control this on the 3rd day we reported it as it was actually too hot to stand underand by this stage we were only turning on the cold tap we reported this issue reception staff assured us they would send an engineer on our final morning;3
we stayed at the hollywood hotel in october 2011 and found it to be very good value and a pleasant hotel check in was a breeze and the staff were very friendly and offered help if we wanted to book showstourstransport our room was comfortable and of a good clean standard this is a middle of the road hotel charging reasonable prices and we were happy that our expectations were exceeded given price paid our bed was comfortable and although our room was on the road noise was not an issue for us the breakfast served downstairs in a nice breakast room was extensive and generous with a good mixture of cooked and uncooked items breakfast was included in the price we paid for our room and was much nicer than weve been presented with for expensive prices at more;3
wyndham new yorker did meet most of our expectations yes not large rooms but for 2 people ample space small bathroom but sufficient for purpose if a bit dated in the bathtub no ipod or mp3 facilities in our room but no matter we had kindles and i pad as well as phones due to comments made by others i did pack an extension lead for recharging as well as a travel kettle as no in room facilities at all the sockets were actually easily located in our room but others not so lucky decor is a bit dated but all in all ok for a 5 night stay check in was quick and easy we had a small wait for our room but that was because we asked for room nearby our travelling companions request sorted without issue the room was well serviced daily with plentiful supply of towels and;3
visited this hotel at christmas and it is ideally situated for all that new york has to offer the first double room we were given was tinyso tiny that it was uncomfortable for 2 people to move around we spoke to the great staff at reception who moved us to a larger roommuch better;3
the hotel is not useable until the elevators are fixed we had a good room but it was on the 10th floor good view but room too highnoise from roof bar wardrobe in room is only half heightnot useable to hang coats dresses or trousers shower drenches bathroom part of the controls and shelves in bathroom are too high for a short woman bad design;3
we stayed there three nights in july on a trip from uk and loved it so much so we booked in for another 2 nights at the end of our holiday then we had big problems the hotel has a nightclub with young trendies turning up in numbers they employ two very large thugs in suits as doormen my girlfriend tried to get to the bar for some ice and one of these gorillas told her to get out when she said we were paying 250 a night to stay there he told her he didnt care she then went to have a cigarette outside on the stairs to calm down and the other thug shouted at her to move when she again said she was a resident he said he didnt care she returned to the room in tears and i remonstrated with reception although they were sympathetic it is obvious the night club set up is;3
stayed for two nights arriving thursday 23 june â¦ the down side we were allocated rooms on floors two and three the third was a building site lots of dust we were relocated to floor 4 and the room was fine all in all the location cleanliness and staff were great however from thursday till after lunch friday no hot water â¦ not even warm â¦ when we checked in they must have been aware but did not say anything to us when we went to reception to report it we were in a line of others it was clearly impacing on the whole hotel this is a basic need if it had hot water this would have been a four plus rating from me but sorry premier inn it is best to share the problems than take the money and await the dissatisfaction of your customers;3
brilliant location we had to move rooms 1st night due to the noise moved to 28th floor no noise when was great very small room and hotel is dated although staff are very friendly and helpful the tick tock rest is great hotel could def do with makeover massive down side was not getting deposit back stayed 1620th december tried to contact hotel a number of times via email and phone no replies or even got to speak to someone they took 633 for these 4 nights today i actually got through on the phone and spoke with ramona collado and she was great there was a fault in system and had charged instead or card put on hold this has now been returned ramona was great and was nice to act talk to some one and for this to be fixed straight away;3
while the staff were friendly and attentive to our requests for assistance the hotel appears to be relying on its history as a very large major hotel in new york the rooms are quite small we were advised at reception when checking that no rooms have a king bed we had to do with a queen bed for the 6 nights we stayed there was no fridge or teacoffee making facilities in the room there was only one chair that could be used right up next to the bed if one of the two of us wanted to watch tv while the other one had to sit on the bed the hotel foyer and hallways on room floors are dated and need brightening up;3
the hotel is very big not new but very confortable big rooms breakfast is very american lots of sweets cakes i dont like fruits and cheese was terrible good for kids nice pool and very near universal they have starbucks inside hotel for expresso coffe;3
firstly i found the staff on reception to be quite short and clearly uninterested in the guests the only people that were warm and helpful were christopher and yuri the rooms were very tiny and the heating seemed to be on constant they charged for absolutely everything which was very dissapointing the shower had no curtaindoor which made the bathroom as small as it was to be soaked all in all it was close to many of the tourist locations but the hotel could have been so much better now dont get me wrong we didnt stay much in the room whoch is just;3
we arrived for a late checkin at the hotel and the staff was helpful and patient as we sorted out some technical issues the hotel room was small but thats a pretty typical new york city sized hotel room the room had been updated and we appeciated the laminate flooring the bathroom had some minor issues but worked just fine when it had to we would have appreciated a second bar of soap but thats pretty minor the hotels location made up for any minor defects in the room minutes from the subway line about 10 min walking to the high line and with the gardenia deli around the corner we were able to get up early grab a bite and hit the city the hotel rooms air conditioning units worked wonderfully we were visiting in the midst of the wonky sept heat wave;3
stayed here with my adult family for 3 nights reception staff are very helpful and apologetic breakfast staff ok but could be better rooms are clean but tired and need updating particularly the bathroom shower skirting boards door frames all need attention rooms on small side but fine if your stay is short breakfast is good if you live the all american small amounts of the healthy stuff is available they had no fruit one morning and when i asked for some i was told the produce didnt arrive the day before really were talking la here not the middle of africa i did complain at reception and the next day we had fruit the gym was not clean again complained 2 days on the trot as nobody attended to the matter on the third day hooray it was cleaned;3
lets start by saying that i know nyc well and that im a regular guest of the empire hotel also the staff is friendly and most of the times they are kind enough to give me an upgrade that said and in order to be objective i have to point out that the renovation they did back in 2006 is fast fading out for example this year the curtains were stained the fancoil grill was disgusting the sink of the bathroom was not working properly one roman blind was not working long gone are the frette linens and recently the occitane bathroom amenities are replaced by more obscure bigelow ones a famed nyc pharmacy all in all giving an impression that the rooms desperately need an update you see it is not that something happened and i was not happy with my stay on the contrary;3
helpful staff but the rooms were a bit dated great location to universal studios and city we hired a car which youll need to get anywhere else one of our rooms had a bad smokey smell pool and whirlpool was basic but ok pool bar closes around 6 630;3
the front desk staff were polite and nice especially pasquale the concierge was patient and very helpful on the 31st of may and june 1st we did not remember his name but he was great unfortunately we did not have the same kind staff when we went to the rooftop bars the bar on the very top was staffed by individuals who seemed very tired or completely disinterested in the clientele the bar one half level below were pretty rude when we asked if we could just take a peek outside each night of our stay a private party was booked so we were not able to take advantage of the peek outside the description of the establishment includes information about all of spaces but does not let you know that it is unlikely that you can even look around speaking of descriptions;3
if you know the pool will not be in service you should let reservation holders know and help rebook if desired this did not happen shame on hyatt i was traveling with a teen and this would have changed out desire to stay;3
i stayed at this place for 8 days while on business everyone at the front desk are top notch and very friendly and helpful the lobby is beautiful in this boutique hotel the rooms are rather small but nicely decorated we arrived late the first night and they only had a room on the 2nd floor since we were staying so long i asked if we could have a really nice room no problem dont unpack completely leave our bags in the room in the morning and we would be moved to a room on an upper floor with a beautiful city view everything went as promised with the move but their idea of a beautiful city view is looking into two 1970s era apartment buildings across broadway from the 9th floor if we knew this we would have probably just stayed on the second floor;3
the room was ok about the same size as other new york hotels i have been in the doormanbellhop service was terrible not that i find opening the door and being greeted a huge deal but when iâm paying for it not leaning against the door and blowing smoke in my face is appreciated the bed was excellent and location would have been better if the station near the hotel hadnât been under repair not the fault of hotel in the slightest overall good experience if you are more interested in being in the city than the hotel;3
you really take a chance at the empire you could get a nice newly refurbished room but the hvac system might not be working and your room looks out on an airshaft after broiling alive and it was march they wanted to bring me a fan while that drowned out the noisy airshaft it did little to relieve the desertlike heat in the room and lets not forget about that showerhead that cant be adjusted unless youre 8tall the same with the makeup mirror thats set for a 64 man;3
i won a 26 hour trip to nyc for a foo fighters concert the hotel was only used for about 56 hours by us but in that time it seemed pretty nice we were impressed by the atmosphere inside it looked nice from the inside and not bad from the outside for you starbucks people there is one next door very convienant for lincoln center and city park we went from florida and were able to see the leaves changing awesome there is a sub station very near so nice too beds were comfortable nice flat screen very dark unless you turned on a light my view sucked and looked into an alley just like everyone says very small bathrooms no fans in them and small rooms shower head was updated and it even had and extra cleaning feature for the women if you needed that shampoo and;3
although hotel was a nice looking nyc hotel unfortunately we had issues when we got to our room it was very hot air was not working i know these things happen but when i called to get it fixed they could not fix it person working front desk dismissed the issue due to this issue i had a horrible night sleep safe didnt work drain in sink didnt work shower had no door overall hotel could have been a better experience of they just do some periodic inspections and fix the issues they did put us in another room the second nightbut air didnt work in that room either;3
we booked a std room smallest room i ever saw in a 4 star hotel front desk was not knowledgeable it took forever for them to find a upgrade room at 6pm rooms were still not cleaned we finally got an upgrade it was much better however we had only bath towels and could not get towels until until the next morning no one answered at housekeeping and the front desk was no help really bad front desk help if you are staying there for the pool it not opened the hrs listed;3
a little disappointed if iâm honest i know itâs an art deco hotel and from 1929 the lobby looks fantastic when u move to the lifts they look worn and old everywhere look freshly painted but over the top of old paint it all just looks well old and not in a good way the room is 2 small for 2 beds and the beds are not double beds we were only here 2 nights so i let it go but i will be talking to our travel agent who booked it;3
booked through bookingcom we expected that we would probably pay alot seeing as we were staying over new years when we arrived we were told that there was a 27 per day facility fee on top of what we had already paid which covered access to the gym which we didnt use and phone calls what we didnt make when we recieved the bill upon checking out it appears that they also added tax to that 27 so it was closer to 30 per night for a 7 night stay that is crazy and increased the stay by alot of money it never stated anywhere that there would be extra charges especially for things we didnt use and they take 315 american off your credit card as security without telling you not sure if that is just an american thing but i thought it was usually around 50 for security;3
very big hotel and rooms are what you would expect in new york small but functional theyve recently renovated and the new touches such as the ipod docking station are obvious well equipped gym but not very well maintained good security at hotel lobby as you need to show your key card before they let you into the lift lobby front desk was a little off putting and did not make a good first impression the young african american lady seems very reluctant to give me my key card when i returned for them after they telephoned me to say that my room was ready sullen unfriendly and totally unpleasant due to this experience i checked out online in my room as i refused to deal with the front desk staff when it came time to leave housekeeping was good and efficient room;3
for years the empire hotel across the street from lincoln center was a seedy rundown venue in those days it deserved the comment i once heard from american composer morton gould i dont mind the cockroaches i just wish they wouldnt charge you double occupancy for them but the hotel closed for a few years was rumored to be converted to condominiums when the real estate bust hit and it was eventually taken over by the world hotels chain and completely renovated it is now clean elegantly appointed and continues to benefit from being across the street from lincoln center unfortunately the renovation did not include rebuilding the rooms they are tiny as are the bathrooms where there is barely enough room to change your mind the poorly designed shower makes;3
hotel was in a good location near subway stations thus quite handy to jump on the train to head to universal or into main la city good value at the rates we paid lots of cheap little shops around the hotel in regards to massage haircuts etc variety of cheap places to eat but nothing fancy around there some of the staff probably shouldnt be in customer service as were quite ignorant;3
chose the hotels rooftop bar to host a cocktail reception for my wedding cant say enough about the staff who ran the reception they did a wonderful job and my guests were thrilled with the location and food the hotel however was not all that it was cracked up to be the staff seems overwhelmed with even the smallest requests and the rooms are really just not worth the prices they charge there are just too many good hotels in nyc to come back to this one sorry empire;3
location perfect when first looked at bedroom deluxe king was perfect but soon discovered was not designed with a traveller in mind very little hanging space in wardrobe because of shelf on which sat mini bar and safe below bathroom was very small with hand wash basin only 3 inches deep looked good but was not functional hook on back door out of reach impossible to get wifi supposedly free in lobby but free at starbucks next door where we had breakfast each morning all staff were very pleasant;3
we travel extensively for work and vacation we arent picky but having a hot shower is a must or at least more warm than coolcold we called the front desk in the afternoon and they said the maintenance man would come he didnt come so we called again later that night he came and said he would need to replace a part the next morning he didnt come the next morning so we called again at night he still didnt come thats the 2nd day on the third morning we called again and then he came he said it was fixed but we felt no difference in the temperature his supervisor came and said this was the legal limit of temperature there is nothing they could do and was pretty rude about everything we have stayed in so many hotels over all these years and we know the;3
stayed here for three nights great position in new york but rather dated and small stayed at westin grand central two years ago and far better hotel bathroom very old not a great shower amazing view of empire state building security in hotel good and helpful staff;3
this is a recentlyrenovated budget hotel in a commercial area of hollywood near the metro breakfast is great if you dont mind waiting a few minutes you can get eggs omelets and waffles cooked to order if youre in a hurry there are cereals variety of breads and sausages that are selfserve coffee tea milk of course breakfast is served from 630 to 1030 the breakfast room is large and nicely decorated the rooms are plain but clean and spacious flat screen tv microwave small refrigerator table and two chairs plus a comfortable armchair near the bed new highend mattress and duvet our bathroom was small and had a stall shower no tub which was fine with us plenty of hot water parking is 22night with tax gated;3
wellsituated hostel in hammersmith rather close to the city centre the double room was spacious but the matress was quite saggy fridge available in the room as well as some kitchenware shared bathroom and toilets were rather new not clean at all times;3
normally i stay away from airport location unless im catching a flight the next morning i decided to stay here had an issue with deposit and not being able to pay cash but the manager was nice enough to resolve this issue beautifull lobby with full bar and restaurant and even a huge cafe room was nice but no fridge unfortunately the pool area lacked a little parking is an insane price of 32 so be warned if you bring a car here the restaurant food was okay but nothing remarkable a very friendly server at the restaurant i enjoyed my stay but would not come back due to the parking fee and lack of nice pool area;3
we were in town for a meeting at the hotel so stayed the night first thing be aware that a queen size bed is ny is not the same as a queen size bed anywhere else we had a queen bed in the small room that was more like a double than a queen second the rooms are small and you can hear the noises from everyone else coming and going in the hall way we did try calling the front desk for extra pillows and got a message to leave a voice mail than they would get back to us within 24 hours also as we checked in we asked where the meeting was going to be held the hotel manager said he would check and never came back out to tell us so i asked the lady who was checking us in who was able to help overall a convenient hotel but nothing very special;3
stayed at the newyorker hotel wyndham it got so many clients however i would like to register my disappointment with the room service it was skipped twice and also done very late comes with a polite notice that bedsheets will be changed every after 3 days or after checking outnot my kind of hotel hygiene finally the queen bed was not queen compared to other hotels but the stuff are friendly;3
my first impressions of this hotel were very low it is messy and not well kept peeling wallpaper and rusty old sinks and the lift was a bit creaky but after a day exploring the city it was the perfect place to come back to and sleep ive just finished uni and therefore have no money but still wanted to see the sights of ny for me this hotel was perfect because i knew that whichever hotel i was going to be staying in i wasnt going to be spending any time there i didnt see much point in forking out an extra â£100200 or more to rent a room that i wasnt going to be in by staying in this place it meant i had more money for sightseeing shopping and eating out which is ultimately what you go to ny for there are plenty of bathrooms on each floor and i;3
wow what can i say itâs right next to universal hollywood literally a 5 minute walk so perfect as for the guest services of the hotel they donât have it we have to pile our garbage outside the room for someone to pick up because of covid they only clean the rooms every three days wow lol so we have to call to get towels to for the room too this is place is unreal what a joke;3
ok to be fair i often stay at the waldorf when in nyc occasionally the marriott this is the first time ive stayed in an off brand hotel and i was not impressed the lobby was dark and uninviting the elevators made you feel lucky to arrive at your floor and the room was not much bigger than a standard walk in closet ok the rate was cheap and the locations was very good i may even stay there again but definitely keep your expectations in check;3
i traveled into nyc for business through penn station and this hotel was a perfect location for that trip it is just across the street from penn station and has a subway entry just outside the hotel the rooms were very old with multiple layers of paint obvious my room had peeling paint on the shower tiles the beds we just okay more firm than i like there was no refrigerator in the room nor vending or ice on my floor i did have a beautiful of the empire state building if you spend a lot of time in the room this may not be the hotel for you i was in the room to change clothes shower and sleep so it served my purpose well;3
for years the new yorker has been where i stay when i fly to new york preparatory to walking across the street early the next morning for the adirondack train to montreal im now rethinking that this was my first stay since it became a wyndham and some of the problems arent wyndhams fault to list the ones that are first i was walking to the elevator when a guy behind a desk asked me if i knew about the free breakfast which started at 9 i told him i had to be up earlier and he suggested i change my train reservation not going to happen i was then given a hard sell for wyndham resorts which i didnt appreciate the room was fine but and this isnt wyndhams fault construction suddenly started up making it very hard to sleep it stopped a 5am next problem might;3
couples stay for three nights loud neighbors that were complained about but nothing was done to fix that it seemed they stayed loud all three days of my stay not sure if this is common in all nyc hotels but they will charge you an extra 150 for incidentals that may need to be paid for during your stay when they held my credit card i did not know that they would automatically charge you 150 even before you had done anything that would warrant any incidental charge still waiting for that 150 to come back into my bank;3
having read the reveiws of the astor i cant say i was looking forward to staying there however we had no problems at all and actually enjoyed our stay yes our room was small but it was clean with fresh towels every day the bed was very comfortable and the tv had no spanish channels it was quiet apart from some grumbling from the radiator no traffic noise or garbage collectors shouting at 3 in the morning as encountered on previous visits staying in midtown staff were friendly but we only found out on the last day that teacoffeerefreshments were available along with computer access in the basement the location of the astor suited us but i think if it is your first trip then staying closer to the attractions would be better it took us 1hr 30 mins to walk to;3
the empire hotel is located just next to lincoln center and all the great cultural institutions there it is also reachable by public transportation the subway a 1 3 line is just 50 meters away the lobby makes an good impression the reception desk and check in is managed professionally and and customers are treated usually well my room had been a standard room to the inside not to the street still it is quite noisy but what else would you expect in new york you hear still all ambulance cars but also every door in your hallway all water shower and toilet form your neighbor rooms and the heatingaircondition device is extremely loud the room is ok quite dark but you will find all you need it is all very practical the furniture is made with very cheap;3
very well located and connected with helpful staff and enhanced security measures though for a 4 stars hotel i would have liked to have a breakfast option not only at the restaurant but included or at least a minibar in the room also in my room double queen with a view the closet was extremely small and the wall mounted safe in the closet made extremely difficult to use even for one person in the room in the area there are cheaper offers with more room amenities here you pay for the history of the place glorious past indeed;3
the rooms are small there are no full sized closets sometimes no drawers lighting is poor no outlets bathrooms are tiny easy to flood the showers expensive but steps to lincoln center and thats why we stay there;3
me and my husband stayed here for three nights 810 august 2017 we booked a king suite with jacuzzi bath tub room 136 and our first impressions of the room were very good the jacuzzi bath was great and the free shower gelshampoosoap etc was quite upmarket compared to other hotels ive stayed in the suite had a small kitchen area with coffee making facilitiesmicrowavefridge all in good working order the sofa and chairs in the room were extremely comfortable and a nice touch with designer cushions on the sofa the decor in the room was really lovely although the lighting was pretty poor in the room despite it being double aspect there was lots of space in the room with nice tiled floors although the floors could have done with a clean as walking around bare;3
i had a very quiet stay which was nicethe bed and room were clean comfortable i did not get a room with a view which is fine but for what i paid i should have needs some updatingoverall not bad;3
this is in the ideal location for exploring nyc with empire state madison square and broadway all a short walk staff were friendly and helpful though its a bit like being at grand central in the lobby our room was more than acceptable but definitely a bit dated that said for city centre ny it didnt cost the world and was comfortable and clean theres a great diner tick tock attached which is perfect for breakfast and really popular theres also a good italian at the other side of the lobby which serves great food given the price and location id stay again but it would be good to see the rooms being updated a little;3
this is a classic old nyc hotel in a terrific location rooms are typically small and a bit tired but well cared for i arrived early for checkin and my room wasnt ready no problem but i came back when told to and it still wasnt ready twice more i came back when told to and the room i was supposed to get had been given to someone else if you are in manhattan for business or the night life and need a handy place to sleep this is a very good place for that;3
we chose the ameritania because of its location we had stayed at another hotel a couple of blocks away at the beginning of our cruise and wanted to be closer to the ed sullivan theater these two hotel rooms were roughly the same price but there is really no comparison the hotel room at the ameritania was âall bedâ nothing like the picture on their website we had an interior room with the ugliest view everand couldnât open the window because the ac noise was intense we were constantly bumping our toes on the bed legs because there was no room to move around at all and absolutely no room to put our luggage this room should not have a king sized bed in it the best part of this hotel is the staff all were really helpful the gentleman who took our luggage up tried to help;3
first off i dont know what these people are talking about that think the staff is unfriendly or unhelpful i feel like they did a pretty great job considering definitely didnt seem like a staff of people that completely didnt care or shook down old ladies that being said pros the area one block from the 96th stop that is a convenient stop to get anywhere further downtown also there are some barsrestaurantsdelis in the area some things closed a bit early for nyc but there was always an option the staff i didnt see any problem with them at all i thought they were quite friendly and helpful the only thing that upset me off was the attempted up sell of a quiet room with things that worked wifi for an extra 60night i get that they are just;3
we stayed here for 6 nights over the thanksgiving period the hotel is in a great location round the corner from macys and a block away from madison square garden you can pretty much walk to a lot of places the hotel has 2 restaurantdiners next door which are convenient the hotel itself is very popular and busy but the rooms are slightly outdated on our first night we were upgraded to a bigger room but unfortunately the bathroom was very outdated with no bathtubshower instead just a walk in shower however the hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming driss at the front desk was exceptionally nice and changed our room the following day we stayed on the 31st floor and albeit a smaller room we had a great view of empire state building the room is more updated and;3
the empire hotel offers a very central and convenient location we were able to walk through central park to a number of destinations including some of the larger museums the boat house restaurant and central park zoo across the street we were also able to visit the lincoln centre for some free outdoor opera movies the rooftop terrace was also a very nice place from which to enjoy a morning coffee or an evening drink before heading out for dinner the room itself was a little tired and less than ideal the bed was rather hard and uncomfortable we did decide to splurge and spend our final two nights at the tump soho that luxurious hotel offered a real contrast to the empire hotel but the cost was significantly more;3
i am surprised in the year 2017 wifi is not free in this hotel every coffee shop and cheap hotel has a free wifi these daysi said i am hilton honour for points the receptionist manager said it doesnt count as i booked through the internet and not directly through the hotels website she gave me wifi though as i complained and said because i am an hhonour i asked for a room with a view she said she gave me the best in that category and otherwise i had to pay an additional fee i went to the room and there was a bad smell and view of highway and i could clearly hear the highways noise there was complementary bottles of water in the room i went back to the receptionist brought my concerns and she gave me another room although she had it at first place and did;3
hotel itself is lovely however do not book the lead in category rooms they are the size of a cupboard no joke area lovely and walk able to times square however next time i will check sizes of rooms this hotel is the new kid on the block with the young and beautiful heading for the hip roof top bar guest list only and flanked by bouncers if thats thing great but was not for me i would stay again but would 100 upgrade room type to ensure bigger my 6 ft husband had trouble getting in and out of the bathroom it was so cramped;3
i had such a strange experience at the jane on the one hand i encountered some very courteous staff members the cafe was great super clean bathrooms and the location was ideal really so many good things then theres the other hand bedbugs i understand theres an epidemic in nyc right now i saw the billboards but i would feel remiss in not letting people know ahead of time after i discovered the problem the room they moved me to for my remaining night was immaculate fine but again i just have to let you know keep your eyes peeled and your fingers crossed for one of the clean rooms;3
hi all we have recently stayed at the new yorker the hotel has character and charm reminding you of a old 20s themed hotel from a movie check in was ok mohammed was very helpful as we arrived an hour before check in be warned as it is a joke the nice mandatory facility fee facility fee which includes wifi which is fine as yes is nice to have wifi whilst away but this also covers use of the gym gym why do i want to go to the gym whilst i am on holiday if i would like to use the gym there should be a fee for this service i can also in my 3175 per day use the buisness centre to print and use the computers which i did not and do not need to use whilst on holiday so basically i paid 3175 to use the wifi which is very expensive wifi wyndham are laughing at all;3
it was a family visit to universal studios first time for the kids and we thought staying in hilton is always a pleasurable experience but this hilton didnt live up to our expectations booking was made on hilton website and it did not tell us 1 breakfast is not included 2 theres no executive lounge upon arrival the room was not ready and inspite of being a hhonors gold member didnt get room on time or any extra perks i was given breakfast coupons for two and the check in clerk didnt bother to mention that kids breakfast has to be purchased only when asked again on the second day i was sheepishly offered discount coupons but since the breakfast was pathetic for vegetarians which is a first for me in any hilton worldwide i did not bother picking it up later;3
you got exactly what you paid for the room was cheap so our expectations werent too high the location was great just off broadway and not more than 2 blocks from the subway or bus the room was very small and basic but in saying that it was clean it wouldnt be my first choice for a couples getaway but it was ideal for us as we were going for a night out on the town staff were friendly and overall we had a good stay;3
beds are super hard hot water took forever to come onup to 10 minutes of running the water plug for fridge was attached to a light switch so i inadvertently turned off the fridge and ruined the allergyfriendly food i had brought all wall sockets didnât work room only got serviced fully once we had to empty our own trash and request fresh towels ourselves location though is great doormen were super kind and congenial there is coffeemicrowavecoffee downstairs but only found it on our last eveningeven though we asked front desk where closest coffee was;3
it was a nice stay but there is some wait on the lifts the staff seem very friendly especially on arrival the diner has very nice food and you do feel secure with all the security around the upstairs corridors seem old fashioned and could really need a makeover dont use the tour bus machine in the lobby it doesnt sell tickets which i found out when i arrived at the bus and was told i had to go the bus depot which was a queue for an hour;3
stayed here over july 4th 2012 traveled alone and this is my favorite neighborhood in nyc i felt safe walking by myself got a good deal on bookingcom room was small but had everything i needed staff was very helpful would definitely return to days inn broadway;3
the location of this hotel is very good you have shopping and entertainment right around the corner the rooms are small so if you are planning a long stay expect a small space but that didnt bother me i would say the service is good until i left the hotel the door man forgot to pack one of my bags and i had to take a taxi back to the hotel to retrieve it 30 dollars and almost missing my flight later i still have not received a call about the matter i just got a verbal sorry from the doorman well after the hassle of driving and spending money on cabs and almost missing my flight i didnt feel that this situation was handled correctly even after calling the manager i have yet to receive a call this has definitely affected my stay at the hotel;3
the foyer and exterior of the hotel look great but our room was tiny and very shabby the bathroom though definitely deco style was clarly original but this is no reason for it to look like it has never been given any attention and it had a very stained and chipped bath cracked tiles and just felt grotty the bedroom was functional but missing basics such as a second bedside table and a real lack of space to leave luggage or to set up the ironing board i know that new york hotel rooms are compact but this was something else lifts were quick though and the tick tock diner offered large portions and great service however the biggest issue was that upon checking in we were informed there would be a daily service charge which hadnt been flagged to us by the;3
first of all this hotel is worth it just because of the location subway station with lines 1 2 and 3 in just one block is just what you need basically in new york you dont even need to be in the city center to have easy access to places it is more important to be near a subway station the hotel looks oldish inside but who cares the elevators really are as slow and at times difficult to get into with all the other guests waiting but that doesnt really matter the city is so hectic anyway so we didnt mind the waits by the elevators also the wifi was really slow in the evening when everyone else was also using it but who needs internet when there is so much to see in the city however the bed was comfy the bathroom is spacious and clean and the room was cleaned;3
service wasnât the best room ok but not incredibly functional no water in room for purchase or otherwise pool service was horrible iâd go elsewhere overall just a so so experience pull out bed in room a twin iâve never even seen a twin pull out sofa bed before didnât have hot water one day in entire building one air conditioning unit went out in room just not an overall great experience for the money;3
my boyfriend and i couldnt help but laugh when we opened the door to our bunk bed room we expected it to be small but not that small we could hardly get our bags in and close the door behind us i slept in the lower bed and it was very hard i ended up having the extra pillow under my back to make it more soft good thing i was tired because of jetlag having this said it was a smart clean and cosy room you even get a bathrobe and slippers the shared showers and toilets are nice and clean the location is in meatpacking district is perfect close to great restaurants bars and other nice areas west village greenwitch soho you get to borrow really cool bikes for free and we biked almost all of manhattan which was a super nice experience connected to the;3
the beds are only full not queens it was very uncomfortable for our family of 3 the location and service was excellent;3
i am so disappointed that this property charged to hold bags after our checkout and until our pickup for our departure from the cityâ that 5 pushed me over the edge and i will be leaving negative reviews on google and trip advisor i booked a queen view roomâ there was no scenic view of ny as promised in your website the view in 3340 was of the guests in the rooms across from us we were in the armpit of the cornerâ the room size is misrepresented in the pictures on the website and the room was so cramped that i hit my knee on the heater every time i attempted to exit the bed and maneuver my way around the heat unit to the bathroom and of course there were no amenities such as complimentary coffee in the room or lobby if i were staying for more than one night i;3
i booked this hotel for two nights as a treat for my husband as hes a big fan of art deco architecture unfortunately the grandeur of the hotel exterior and reception area does not continue into the rooms ours was extremely small considering the price tag we couldnt even open both our small suitcases on the floor without being stuck the fixtures and fittings in the room were fairly pleasant to look at and in keeping with the deco style however they felt very flimsy we also had a very small tv with a decent selection of channels the bathroom felt like it hadnt been changed since the say it was built which was stylistically nice but not at all practical the shower was diabolical the toiletries provided felt very budget hotel the walls were also very thin;3
my husband and i stayed here on valentines day because of its close proximity to lincoln center we arrived about 130 pm and knew our room probably wouldnt be ready until the 3pm checkin time the man at the front desk asked for our cell and said theyd call us when the room was ready we went out for a stroll through central park and around 3pm started to head back to the hotel we never received a call but assumed the staff didnt call because we knew checkin was at 3 we planned to go back to the room relax for 30 minutes and then shower for our 5pm dinner reservation when we went to get our key from the front desk it was approximately 310 we were told our room had a problem and we would have to wait 15 minutes more i was highly annoyed because the man;3
okay all new york hotels are small i get it however when you cant get in the room and walk around once youve got your suitcase in the room you start to wonder if youve made the right choice the one thing i will say about this hotel is that it is original as in it hasnt changed since the 1920s which is amazing really the layout hasnt changed it has been repainted even the tiles in the bathroom weird and it still has all the original features were they much smaller years ago possibly but for todays average couple youd be hard pressed to do the exercises you promised to do on new years eve to lose those extra few pounds anyway the location is good quite central and all within easy walking distance of the main attractions price wise okay food;3
came here for a weekend stay with my husband and our three year old daughter no big complaints about the hotel customer service is good and our room was nice and clean however i was pretty irritated that they charged us 10 to have a microwave in our room in order to heat up our daughters milk and they even made us put down a 100 deposit on it in case we damaged it even though by the looks of it that piece of crap microwave probably didnt cost them more than 20 we are hilton honors members so at the very least they shouldve waived the 10 charge i have never had a hotel charge me for a microwave to heat up childrens milk they should really be ashamed of themselves for that one the hotel is definitely convenient to universal you can take about a 1015 minute;3
my girlfriend booked this hotel through trailfinders for my 30th birthday and it got off to a great start when our room was upgraded to a deluxe double room pasquale on the front desk was espeically helpful the room was a good size for nyc although the general decor was a little tired we had a great view of the lincoln centre and it is within walking distance to the lincoln centre columbus circle subway the heating unit in our room unfortunately was a little noisy and we had to turn in off at night to sleep also the wifi was not working properly for our stay which was a little annoying as we had to go to starbucks located next door fortunately for their free wifioverall we were generally happy with our stay but there could have been little improvements to make it a;3
overall an average stay in the hotel the location is great if you need to catch a train from penn station the room was a typical nyc hotel room smallish but ok for two people the only issue we had was that the bed was very uncomfortable there was a significant dip in the middle of the of bed we didnt bother complaining because we were only going to be there one night it did make for an uncomfortable sleeping night additionally the bed felt on the small side for a queen size bed i would have thought it to be a double sized bed other than that the service was fine the hotel did have free wifi which i had no problem connecting to however my husband was never able to log on even after speaking with someone at the front desk;3
wow just below our expectations locations is however brilliant convenient location close to all major attractions eg the empire state building times square excellent for tourists to save time the room was not so great very congested for a couple service was okay could have been friendly anyway i would recommend the pizza shop right opposite to the hotel extremely delicious and economic survival have a pleasant trip;3
good location close to central park columbus circle times square the staff is very friendly and serviceminded the hotel needs an upgrade the rooms were poor bathroom worn down and no door in the shower it was not possible to adjust the temperature on the ac had to plug it out bedause it got too cold the lobby and the lobby bare were very nice so was also the roof top bar although the stairs up to the deck on the roof had not been cleaned for several years it seemed the rooftop deck has also got a pool very small but still a pool in nyc big plus even though the rooms were not that nice i think that this hotel offers value for money in this area of nycmanhattan;3
the hotel is in the best possible location right next to madison square garden and a metro entrance which makes moving around very easy we even walked to central park which was only 30 minutes away on foot the room was quite small though and the bed and pillows had seen better days some of the staff were very nice and helpful but others could really improve their manners with guests it was also freezing cold in the lobby especially and corridors caught a cold from coming to the august heat in the street into the hotel;3
read all the reviews and thought it sounded cool the room was actually bigger than i expectedit is nyc after all but the goods news stopped there heat was not controllable its either on or off and the engineer turned it off but we had to turn on the air conditioner to be able to sleep and the ac was a ferocious noisenot fixable the front desk staff was too into talking to each other to spend any time expeditiously helping guestsfrom help finding starbucks to finding a gym off site no work out facilities on site to getting a taxi to late check outit was all too much trouble sigh so although it was only 350 for the night it was not worth it a bright note the cafe g is open all day and the food is quite niceservice good;3
i was very disappointed it was not worth if its price no microwave available to warm up any food and no coffee in the room rooftop service was one of the worst when you need a servant you had to go look for one yourself when you placed the order it took forever and they kept coming at different time the best service was the towel guy handing the towel and picking up after everyone and cleaning the pool area so that it didnt look so bad;3
upon registration we were given a room with a loose window on the upper floor sounded like a tornado coming across the space when i called to complain was told the entire building was that way my husband complained and we were moved do not let them try that with you;3
we came for a short visit to nyc just 3 nights morningside inn did the job perfectly we rate it 3 one for great location one for fantastic comfy bed rock hard one for friendly and helpful service its very basic shared bathroom it has seen better times too and could do with some fresh paint unreliable hot water shower handle fell off when in use internet signal very poor and slow speed overall ok well priced city option;3
this hotel has good prices but you have to fit in a small cabin where you just lay your body on the bed and put your luggage beside you my room was extremely small but the biggest problem was that it was so hot during the night july and when i turned on the vent it was so noisy i couldnt sleep even though i would come to this hotel again but probably not during the summer why it has a very nice location just few meters from the hudson river the hotel staff is very friendly helpful and the atmosphere in the hotel is very welcoming i used also their bikes which are for the hotel guests available free of charge but bikes are not in a very good condition so you better be careful while using them anyway i have enjoyed a short ride by the hudson river;3
the location and front desk are wonderful rooms are small and dingy the bathroom is water logged the room also needs more light it was a dark and depressing not to mention smallish room and could benefit from some ceiling lights;3
got the hotel on priceline with name your own price desk help was okay nothing great but nothing had to say the lobby is very nice compared to the rooms they spent way too much money on the lobby and not nearly enough on the rooms the room was clean and no issues there the restroom was actually quite large by manhattan standards even when compared to much nicer hotels they safety is questionable the windows open all of the way and the radiator heater may not be safe with children all and all its 4 walls and a clean bed;3
you get what you pay for at this budgetpriced hotel dont expect any more than that good price small room but so are most nyc hotels nice lobby but the rest of the hotel could use a remodel and freshen up;3
facility charges dont make sense feels like a tricky way to up room price and not clear during shopping for a hotel room be prepared to pay more as you check in out love the location yet the room didnt have much room to move very small it looked bigger online when i made the reservations;3
great location great restaurant but rather indifferent service the room was unbearably hot and my daughter became ill and it took some time to elicit help and a solution also the concierge was rather unhelpful;3
your room though wellappointed is very small particularly the bathroom and you charge for in room coffee that makes it very inconvenient and unwelcoming wwe have traveled all over the world and the usa this is the first time we have encountered this;3
and so the empire is better than its reviews including the three stars i have given it one review said the empire is shabby that would be the first thing to come to my mind but it is not all accurate i have stayed at the empire twice and both time i have had an updated room that was very nice the common areas are what feels shabby there are four elevators and i can never remember a time when they were all working there are four individual controls for the four elevators and you are never sure which control operates which elevator thus when the hotel is full you will have a long wait for an elevator the location of the empire cannot be beat across the street from lincoln center it is perfect for attending events there there are dozens of restaurants of all;3
this hotel is a decent hotel do not expect perks and glamour you will have a decent room no thrills no frills just a nice place to lay your head the breakfast buffet wasnt all that great but the service was good youll also enjoy their wifi;3
central park west73rd and broadway nyc i read the reviews that mentioned the terrible sleeper sofa not possible to sleep on but since the review was published a while ago we assumed the owners would have repaired or replaced it by the time we stayed here in late june not so my spouse and i plus a teenaged son stayed in this apartment for 4 nights and days in the executive suite which indicates it accommodates 3 people note it does not the sofa is a twoseater so you cant sleep on it without using the pullout sleeper function the mattress was torn not to mention stained with rusty springs sticking out of the fabric that would likely cut you on the legs and thighs although hed had a tetanus shot recently our son still could not sleep on it without;3
a legendary hotel in which all the equipment is really old and used we have repeatedly received bad information from the hotel staff at the reception desk about the reward program and eventually did not send us all the points we were entitled to according to the staff regulations there is one version of the reward program at the pay desk then by email this information does not apply and the money paid for the accommodation can not be accepted for credit points there was odor in teslas basement the best experience was with cleaning and concierge which really helped us organize the program;3
itself the hotel is in good place all sightseeings park are on foot distance what cuased me to be disappointed is that from my credit card the big amount was charges for some expenses in the restaurant on roof top and in mimibar but i have never been in the restaurant and nothing taken from minibar this is very frustrating and disappointing you feel yourself like your money are stolen and you can not do anything so even now after around three weeks i have not received my money back and even do not know will i receive that or now pay your deposit by cash that is more secure never by your card otherwise after check out you will have to prove that it is not you to spend money somewhere in a hotel;3
the position is excellent the hotel is 50 yards from a subway station leading in short time to midtown manhattan it is located in a quiet and very pleasant section of upper manhattan it is surrounded by nice familiar restaurants where we ate 3 nights in different places inside unfortunately it really needs some works the carpets are very old and worn up the furniture very essential and out of date on the other side the bathroom is spacious with a bathtube and good shower the staff is kind and cooperative ready to give indications to the tourist in a few words very good position but could be made much more comfortable;3
the hotels location is great its close to restaurants not far from penn station times square central park and several subway lines the hotel itself is starting to show some signs of age as there were renovations being done during our stay as part of a promo for a movie premiere we stayed in the hotels supposed best suite for 3 days and 2 nights the suite was nice and accommodating however if personally paying 800 a night i would expect more from hotel accommodations the suite offered a semiprivate bedroom with en suite the door to the bedroom did not have a locking feature and did not close all the way while the room came fully stocked with a wet bar and snacks consumption use of anything would require an extra charge eg evian water 10 peanuts;3
great location average room spacious king suite but bed was very hard and window was broken which allowed a lot of outside noise and smells to come inside it was never fixed during our stay bell staff was very friendly and helpful lighting is a little dark in rooms and hallways food in their restaurant was delicious;3
great stayrooms need some updatingmaintenance early check in and late check outmuch appreciatedstaff were great rooftop lounge was not open but would have been great for nightlife and the view of area;3
the first room supposedly a superior king was small and the bath was ridiculously small the ac was weak but we went out to dinner and returned hoping it would be cooler it wasnt i called the desk they sent up an engineer who said it was as good as it gets he recommended we be moved the night manager showed us another room handicapped but cool we went to pack and then he called to say he was moving us to a suite since it was late and we had been inconvenienced the new room was very comfortable the bath was still small but better service by the night manager saved trip he hotel is in a great location be sure to have the french toast for breakfast;3
we stayed at the empires jrsuit between the dates of nov1026 th the hotels location is a great plusthe room was clean and well maintainedthe bed was very comfortablethe bathroom was good size and in good condition we were happy about the big screen tv in our room with decent number of channels sometimes we just wanted to stay in our room and rest although the reception quality of the channels was not always goodmaybe an adjustment would have helped our primary concern with this hotel was the house keeping service almost every day something in our room was not replacedwe needed to keep on calling the house keeping service on the phone almost every day for missing fresh towelstoilet papersoappillowsetcwhich was very annoyingsomebody needs to contol;3
our family trip to nyc for the first time was amazing but lets talk about the hotel it is an older hotel do not expect any clamor or glitter the hotel smelled old if it was damp so i purchased a couple of room refreshers for the rooms pick some up at your dollar store before you travel the rooms are small and cramp as well as the bathroom and the carpet looks as if this has seen better days the important questions are would i stay here again yes why the location and the price the location is fantastic a few blocks walking to times square two blocks up is central park and columbus circle also across the street is the lincoln center catch a free concert the subway entrance is also across the street across the street from the hotel is a nice sitting area with;3
nice and central location on manhattan but very noisy either from the acventilation units outside or from the ac units in the room with the ac on in the room there more noise than in a modern airplane friendly staff and clean room;3
first off the room we booked online looked nothing like the room we received upon check in also to add insult to injury we received a room in the basement of the hotel were it was very unattractive and noisy the ac unit next door kept us up all night i latterly felt like a mole person in the basement lol however when we complained to the hotel manager he was more than happy to oblige we received a huge discount on our room stay free parking comp and 50 off the sunday brunch i would consider coming here again in the future excellent customer service;3
we were allowed to check in very early thank you the hotel certainly doesnt feel like pther regency hotels its new and comfortable but a bit basic rooms are big walls are thin and i was aware of every plane taking off included breakfast has great continental options but the eggs bacon etc arent the best shuttle is frequent and easy;3
lovely attentive staff but the hotel itself was disappointing dark communal areas small rooms noisy location none of the usual hotel room facilitieswifi coffeetea maker etc cleanliness of the toilets was also disappointing shame;3
this hotel is ideally located for universal studios and city walk both being a 5 min walk up the hill a free shuttle is available but seemed pointless it is also a 10 min walk down the hill to the metro stop which takes you in to hollywood citywalk is a great place to shop and eat out and universal studios is a must the room was just the right size and was nice and clean the staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful in particular the concierge desk who helped us with a number of enquiries i only had two issues with the hotel 1 the cost of everything is very expensive parking is 20day which seems a bit steep to me and the internet was about 8 per day both these things should be included in your room rate in my opinion we also ordered breakfast;3
i have now stayed at this hotel 4 times i find the staff to be v kind and helpful all of the city is easily accessible from this location either by bus or subway it is also much quieter compared to the apt bldgs in the area on the days you check inout they will keep your luggage in a locked room so you can still have those days to be luggage free;3
small rooms poor air conditioner great location and seems to be a popular hotel the bathroom in my single queen size was cramped you cant close the door while seated on the toilet the shelf where you had to put your toiletries was over the toilet so you had to be careful that nothing fell of the shelf the sink drainage was very poor so it was easy to overflow if you didnt watch it;3
we booked as part of a package which was good value we were staying 8 nights and were very disappointed at the first sight of our room which was small this seems to be what queen means and didnt evevn have a wardrobe however when we asked to change this was done with courtesy and no fuss indeed all staff were excellent at all times the new room was just as small and ugly but did at least have an adequate wardrobe it is the only hotel really near to the lincoln centre and the metropolitan opera just over the road but the downstairs bar and upstairs restaurant suggest an entirely different clientele we found these spaces unbearable in their brash noise and slightly sleazy edge fortunately new york has enough to offer not to need to stay around the hotel very;3
you obviously have your reasons for booking to stay here and the location is very good and yes it is conveniently close to universal studios we stayed here because it is close to my family first the good news rooms on executive floor are spacious very good view from high floors are wonderful very good the bed is comfortable very good the linens are good the bathroom amenities are pleasing peter thomas roth swim area is adequate my granddaughter loved it on to the bad news arrival poorly recievedthey were shambolic after a transatlantic flight that displeased btw car valet service is slow food offering is dull weak bathroom is uninspired;3
we stayed two nightsnext time it will be a different hotel in a better part of the city it is an older hotel in a not so great neighborhood the parking lot is gated to keep out the homeless who live in encampments on the sidewalks outside the hotel we were disappointed to be notified when we checked in that parking is an additional charge 30 a day and that their is no free breakfast because of covid19 at other hotels we stayed at a minimum provided a bagged breakfast of muffin juice and a granola bar they should update their website to inform potential patrons of their current conditions the fountain which is in the back is not operational even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door housekeeping entered our room and it frightened our daughter who was in;3
overall the hotel was ok a few things kind of threw me off a little upon arrival the guy at the front desk couldnt even muster a hello when i asked if this was were to check in his first reply is well you are way too early to check in when i booked the hotel i had already requested an early check in to hit universal studios when it opened at 9am the guy did what he needed to do to find us a room and says theres a 25 early check in fee there was no mention of this fee when i called to book but at this point we just wanted to drop our bags off and hit the park our room was just ok nothing special there was no mini fridge in the room which i found abnormal in todays world another thing that drove me crazy was no hand towels or towel rack in the shower yes;3
i recently stay 6 night in this hotel with group of my friends i really like the location the mail staff are rude if you ask something with him he replied i do not know the female staff are ok and polite the internet do not work in this hotel this is the poor internet service i found in my 21 days in usa the towel which they provide us every days is really old one and was damaged on the corner and some time whole in the middle this is funny i arranged the taxi to jfk airport from the hotel gave us good price but taxi driver says we have to pay the highway tax which is 8 usd extra on the way luckily i had some cash;3
room was clean good service just 10 minutes walk to universal studio great view and best sea food buffet at cafe sierra only 2 complains i had are 1 location of buffet line is a big mess food are line up at the walk way guest who try to check in have to walk pass the hungry guest who try to get the food at buffet line draging luggages bumping with hot food was not convenience at all they should move buffet line to other place that not obstruct the walk way 2 shower head in the room is very cheap stuff some hole are clog and water pressure was slow for 200plus per night i expect better shower head which not leaking and dipping all the time;3
the hotel location is good but very poor service for the price they charged us there was not even a coffee machine in the room and small bottle of water was 750 it was less than 1 in the shop we went there for our honeymoon and even though i let them know they didnt even congratulate us and gave us the smallest room in the hotel when my wife complained they changed our room to a bigger one;3
hotel is in a perfect location just around the corner from madison sq gardens and 10 min walk from towns square room are clean but in need of modernising staff are always friendly rooms can be quite noisy but i have always found this in whatever hotel i stay in in nyc good wifi beds are comfy;3
the stay was just ok we had issues with the air conditioner not working properly on more than one occasion and i noticed when checking out that my sheets had holes in them beds were comfy but small and not for tall people and the rooms are very small bathroom needs more counter space because there is none best thing about our stay was jeffrey the doorman he was very kind courteous and very very helpful both with checking in and checking outhe took the time to store our luggage because we arrived before check in and he went over a map of all the must see attractions and their locations around the city he also arranged a ride to the airport for us when we checked out a true asset to the hotel;3
if you have back problemsthe bed was absolutely horrible the room faced the bathrooms of another building it almost seemed that because the room was discounted quite a bit that we received an inferior room;3
fun vintage hotel with out much in the way of amenities poor wifi felt like being in a wes anderson film rooftop bar is fun with good views central meat packing district with short walk to subway and bus routes;3
i booked the empire for a onenight stay because of its proximity to lincoln center i arrived early after catching a redeye from la i wasnt able to check in that early but the front desk arranged for security to store my computer and ipad and my other belongings including a fulllength gown with a train that needed a very high rack so it wouldnt wrinkle to be stored properly if only my room would have been as great as the service i think room 806 has mildew the back of the bathroom door visible when you sit on the toilet stool looks like somebody pieced it together the directional handle in the shower did not work properly although someone from engineering showed me how to manipulate it there were no wash cloths so i had to request them from housekeeping which;3
room was on 23rd floor very cold and noisy there was no view room could do with up dating also kitchen smells in the room staff very helpful and friendly and great location shame we were disappointed as this was our first visit to new york city;3
yes great location very comfortable bed windows actually open stunning view of lincoln center if your room is on the frontupper floor good service at front desk good bartender easy metro access no if youre on the 10th floor be prepared for the night club one floor above to throb away until 2 am or so wifi costs 13day unless you complain about the throbbing night club as doesinroom coffee yup kcups are provided but at 3 a pop no ice bucket or machine room service is prompt but two eggs a slice of toast potatoes juice and coffee will set you back 36 bathroom is tiny and is hasbeen swankywornmoldy but offers good water pressure and a nice opportunity to practice your popup camper bathing skills just put a towel in the sinklette and dump;3
booked with some trepidation due to the mixed reviews but have learnt to take some of the reviews with a pinch of salt however on first impression i was disappointed with the empire the standard queen room was tiny with hardly any space for luggage or clothes storage it was also uncomfortably hot the only way to combat this was to have the antiquated ac unit on full blast which sounded like a jet engine including speed variations sounding like take off even this struggled to keep the room at a comfortable temperature on second impression though there are some good points we got the room at a decent discounted rate the staff and maid service were very friendly and good the location is good for central park and the subway the hotel is decorated very nicely and is very;3
stayed here for a few nights in julygood points ensuite room safe neighbourhood tv in room excellent air con close to underground and restaurantssupermarkets points for improvement clean sheets every night pretty sure they are just sprayed with air fresher friendly staff who can answer questions rather than come back tomorrow and speak to total cost to be paid on arrival includinging tax updated beds and mattresses like the title treat this like a middle of the range youth hostel;3
i stayed in a queen room with a view and the room was reasonably sized however quite dated and the bathroom had aged and needed some attention half way through the holiday i turned on the bath tub tap and brown water was coming out of it i called reception and his response was to let it run for fifteen minutes and see what happens throughout the holiday the water was not totally clear but was not as bad as it was when it first happened however i felt that the staff member was not approachable to solve the matter the maids were very good throughout the stay and every staff member on our floor 29 would say morning to you and have a good day which was nice the elevators are very very very slow you could be waiting up to five minutes in reception and then when in;3
this hotel is located in quite a central place with easy access to everything through the subway rooms are nice and clean a bit on the expensive side though we booked with breakfast included and we were really disappointed with it only a voucher was provided to an inhouse place which simply offered a juice glass coffee or tea and 2 toasts croissant or bagel probably the worst breakfast we have ever had in an hotel;3
great location for nyc just a couple of blocks from macyâs and next to penn station not a lot more to say rooms were nice but do need updating hotel did not offer much else like i said the location is perfect but for the price i would have expected better rooms and amenities;3
i have been to nyc many times however my husband and daughter had never visited so i chose ameritania for our stay in july 2019 the hotel is very reasonably priced for the location itâs a 5min walk to times square radio city music hall and central park rooms are very small but theyâre clean and the beds are super comfy i donât think i would stay here again but if youâre visiting nyc for the first time spending a couple of nights here would be easy to do;3
iâd seen the new yorker many times on holiday sites and hotel booking pages but never visited previously location wise youâre at the rear of madison square gardens so pretty central and itâs easy to access both my office and most of touristy manhattan the hotel would once have been very grand indeed but has certainly seen better days the reception sorry lobby is spacious but with few check in counters for some reason the lifts elevators are guarded by security but they do helpfully point you towards the right set on your first visit and can also guide you to the gym basement level if needed my room was spacious with a dual aspect a rarity in any major city the bed was comfortable but overall the room was again a little spartan the furniture will need to be;3
stayed here for 5 nights and was centrally located for all the main sights and close to bus stop for hop on hop off routes we finally arrived at hotel about midnight after long day travelling and nearly as long on bus from jfk tip if you can fly into newark less traffic that route to city centre we were upgraded to a room with a view looking at the empire state building and madison square gardens room had 2 large beds 2 comfy chairs and desk not enough power outlets to charge electrical items there were even 2 in bathroom bathroom was very small and dated but clean and lots of hot water and good water pressure diner next door good for brekkie though not cheap but what is on nyc have to pay 2 per bag to leave after checkout and then another 2 to reclaim later most;3
i read several reviews on the empire to understand what i was getting a lot of the comments are true and accurate the empire is a busy hotel and centrally located near columbus circle access to the subways is within one or two blocks our room was on the 5th floor away from the elevators there is a nightclub on the roof so a room on or near the 11th floor could be noisy didnt go to the nightclub once inside the rooms are small bathroom even smaller no shower stall door so water will splash inevitably the room was adequately clean could have been vacuumed more thoroughly it was a little dusty ac worked in our room many posters complained about their broken ac nothing to report but cool uninterrupted air we could have been lucky hdtv with cable;3
the hotel itself is very nice i had a large comfortable room which although it faced some major freeway i think 101 but i dont know the area was quiet comfortable bed large wellequipped bathroom meeting rooms were good and i very much appreciated that the break areas were all naturally lit and have high ceilings too many hotels have dark depressing break areas nice outdoor seating area comfortable pool area with hot tub wifi worked well and is free for members of hhonors now the downsides the elevators were really really slow one of my colleagues who was on the 10th floor was walking the stairs because he got tired of waiting every square inch of the common areas inside and outside have cheesy music playing since i was there in december it;3
hotel was clean and beds were very good we had two rooms with children next to each other but no connecting doors arrived during a time where there was a large buffet in the lobby area next to the restaurant lots of good looking food choices but really poor placement of the food people wanting food fighting for space with people walking through arriving or leaving with luggage it did not appear that there was an activity in the ballroom perhaps that would have been a better space to place the buffet sleep was interrupted at 1245 am by inconsiderate neighbors had to call security at 1 a m as noise escalated they did respond promptly noise stopped but we were awake for awhile there is a good fitness room which i visited with my granddaughter it is;3
very dated but has all you need for a base rooms big and very clean staff were excellent and the breakfast buffet was great the chief will cater to whatever you want cereal and bagel s also availablethere is no bar and although it advertised happy hour it never materialised;3
when guests are checking out dont ask them to only leave a 5 star review on trip advisor after they have not had a perfect experience because you want to keep your high rating and any thing less than a 5 will hurt your business this was very unprofessional and the reason why i am now writing this honest review yes the staff are lovely the service is good the food is ok and the riads public areas are well kept but upon entering our room fleur dorange we found 1 it was dirty and unclean see the images 2 used disposable slippers had been left as new 3 bathrobes were damp not dry and fluffy 4 bathroom seemed to have a very large water splash mark on the wall but we think it was some sort of oil as it did not dry and could not rub off after 5 minutes in;3
hilton la universal city nice lobby but unfriendly porter im talking about one in particular who left us unattended and was handled a personal phone call was surprised some staff dont smile lift is too slow and stops in most of the floors so its always full no robes or slippers in the rooms no free water bottles the hotels highlight is its location and the convenience of the shuttle bus that takes you to universal studios back and forth breakfast is good but you pay extra charge of its not continental breakfast but the staff there are friendly although there are few waiters for the whole restaurant i would come here again if i was going to the universal studios because of the location although not too impressed;3
when in nyc you want to be in the centre of town and this hotel has definitely got the location 2min walk from macys and 8 blocks roughly from times square on a map it looks fairly close to central park it took us about 40min to walk it the hotel has free wifi and offered to hold our bags as we get there before check in so was able to drop them and go off into the city to explore the room itself was really quite dated we had wall view the elevators are like something out of the 1920s big brass buttons and many floors so getting from the top to the bottom took a while when we kept stopping at each floor to pick up people we were on floor 27 so was quite quiet having said all that we didnt spend much time in the hotel as we were out all day and evening so i;3
after booking our stay at days via the net i decided to read up on some reviews i know should have checked it out first upon reading the entries about cockroaches and poor service i was put into a state of panic the reality im happy to say turned out to be completely different i have certainly stayed in plusher venues than days however we were more than happy with the service provided by pavel and the desk staff the room was cleaned and bedding and towels changed daily we were looking for somewhere to sleep while we spent the rest of our time on vacation lets face it no hotel is ever as good as home and we did not expect it to be this hotel has had a bum rap from some of the reviewers and i would simply say this is a nice friendly hotel not the ritz;3
we had an executive double room and it was large for a new york hotel room the beds were very comfortable and very clean the bathroom was very small and the shower was odd as you had to be physically in the shower to turn it on and of course the water was ice cold loved the tick tock restaurant attached to the hotel best pancakes around;3
we stayed here for 4 nights as a couple firstly the location is great 5 min walk into universal city walk and can access most freeways easily we had a corner room on a high floor which was great as we had some great views the pool area is also nice the jacuzzi especially its open until 12 at night which is fab now for the not so good parts 1 28pp for an average buffet dont eat here for your breakfast there are much cheaper and better options near by 2 the lifts yes they apologise for them but they are really slow we even got evacuated from our bedrooms in the middle of the night due to a fire on one of them no one was hurt but the hotel staff didnt deal with it well no one kept us informed and we were down in the lobby for over an hour without a clue;3
the empire hotel was my go to place to stay in the city in the late 80s and early 90s right across the street from lincoln center and close to the beacon theater and central park south the location cant be beat when i decided to get tickets to see a show at lincoln center it was a no brainer to book a room at the empire i knew ahead of time that valet parking was 60 and i opted to utilize that service the doorman and the front desk staff were pleasant and efficient the lobby looked fine as did the bar but the stair case to the left of the bar going to the mezzanine level was under repair and what ever solvents they were using on the job had a very strong odor and was irritating to my throat we made our way to our junior suite on the 7th floor and i was a;3

ups awesome location this is a lovely safe neighbourhood that i felt totally comfortable coming back to even very late at night also incredibly cheap room rate yes the rooms are tiny but unless youre over 62 or claustrophobic this shouldnt be an issue excellent free wifi the only noise issue was the rattly old airconditioner despite the club in the basement downs almost all servicerelated room partially cleaned once in three days stay no fresh drinking water left after checkin no clean towels entire stay no bath mat kind of an issue in a shared bathroom when the crappy sandals they give you dont last one walk down the hall rude unhelpful service at the front desk seriously kid youre a receptionist in a cheap hotel lose the hipperthanthou;3
we chose this hotel for a 1night staycation because of the rooftop poolwhich only a handful of nyc hotels have the pool deck is quite small so go early if you want lounge chairs the service on the roof deck was good staff members were frequently walking around taking drink orders upon request we had a relaxing afternoon but were disappointed that the pool was shaded and also not heated so it was freezing management if you read this please heat the pool we booked a standard room that supposedly had a queen bed it was definitely a full not a queen the bed the bathroom and the room overall were so smalland thats coming from nyc residents i would suggest future travelers upgrade from the standard room if possible the location is excellent for;3
our family of four two older teenagers spent the first half of spring break at the hilton universal city the hotel is in easy walking distance to universal studios and the city walk area and easy driving distance to other area attractions warner bros hollywood etc we found it easier to walk to universal but younger families may want to take the free shuttle the location is great and makes up for the hotel being a bit dated in terms of decor carpet wear etc the elevators were being upgraded at the time of our march 2016 stay and the wait times were a source of shared laughter with other guests the staff we met were very helpful and prompt we had the complimentary continental breakfast which was fine for our family of relatively light breakfast eaters as;3
this hotel was nice with particular reference to the breakfast facilities and the shuttle bus worked well i associate hilton with high quality yet i feel this didnt measure up to other hiltons i had attended;3
the architecture and design of the hotel is beautiful however the size of the rooms doesnt match the price i first booked a queen size room but when we checked into the room there wasnt enough room to put our luggage and walk around the bed at the same time the closet was just a space in the room blocked off by a curtain and you couldnt close the bathroom didnt have enough space for you to hardly turn around in a circle the assistant manager and front desk clerk was helpful in showing us a larger king size bedroom nevertheless the design of the bedroom is more on a boutique contemporary level with spa design bathrooms the major flaw about the bathroom is that the shower only has one door thats right one door therefore when you take a shower water will;3

having read some of the reviews i was a little anxious about this hotel but when i arrived i was pleasantly surprised you have to remember that this is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for and thats why i rate as average however this could very well be an above average budget hotel as my experience of this type of accomodation is limited i booked a three bed room with private bathroom after i booked through a third party i emailed the hotel and asked that they confirmed my booking and within 12 hours patrick replied which was very reassuring when i checked in the receptionist was very pleasant as were all the reception staff the room was clean with crisp bedding and clean white towels on arrival for me that was all i required as my intention was to see nyc and;3
i know manhattan is expensive but my experience there has been if youre willing to pay the money youll usually get something nice not so with the empire hotel this place is scrappy it really really needs an update it felt like the whole place was a bullet hole with a band aid slapped on it window sills with painted over rust pits rotting bathroom doors also painted over pealing wallpaper lots and lots of it oh and let me tell you about the missing shower door i go into the bathroom to take a shower and notice that weve got no shower door half of the shower is exposed to the bathroom i call the front desk and am told that all the showers are that way and that its a design flaw what now i know why the bathroom door is rotting from;3
some minor inconveniences helpful friendly staff although they were slow at some things great location although they lacked some things like atm in lobby because they were ânearbyâ no selfserve ice machines had to wait a long time an hour and many calls to the front desk to have ice brought to room quiet room in my opinion rather garish decor in hotel;3
i recently stayed 2 separate nights at the hyatt regency lax the rooms are quite nice good wifi pleasant staff i wish i could say the same for the food i ordered room service chips and salsa since the dish i wanted wasnt available the chips had been microwaved which made them taste like cardboard made of corn the salsa was a watery mess it was taken off the bill fortunately the next morning i ate breakfast in the restaurant and the pancakes were excellent the next night i stayed i went to the market place and got the cold noodle salad it had some cucumbers and carrots and didnt taste like it had a speck of dressing so get this if you like plain boiled noodles three bites and i left it there i expect hotel food to be overpriced but this was inedible i;3
my room was a bit worn and warm there didnt seem to be a way to lower the temperature which was set at 72 the room was also very dark without enough lighting the dã©cor of the hotel and rooms i can only describe at resembling a bad 1970s porno really tacky the location is great near the subway lincoln center columbus circle central park i stayed here about 30 years ago and remember it as sort of worn then but with a more old new york feel to it not sure what happened staff were very pleasant and helpful lots of lounge space to meet and have a drink;3
stayed here over the weekend check in we relatively quick even though there was a queue when we got to the room it was looking a bit tired could do with a bit of a make over couple of things that werent quite up to scratch towels were small and toiletries shampoo etc werent replaced during our three night stay hotel has plenty of history and its well located just not quite what we had expected;3
the property is in a great location and even better if you have a street view we enjoyed our time but were met with some silly issues like lack of certain amenities like a working phone in the room it was satisfactory over all;3
my husband and i spent one night at this hotel in early october ill give you the good the bad and the ugly about this place first the good location across the street from central park doormen and desk clerks were friendly very affordable no bed bugs the bad no thermostat in the room it was very hot and we had to turn on the window air conditioner to cool the room no refrigerator in the room very small rooms old hotel the ugly the place needs a facelift the bottom line if you want one of the best hotel prices in ny and can put up with a tired no frills place to lay your head this place is for you my husband and i said one night was enough for us not a comfortable room to hang and relax for a few days;3
when you get to the hotel it looks ok however step out of the elevator and you will start to get scared the hallways looks very old they definitely need to be updated room size is ok but beds are very uncomfortable and even though hotel claim to be smoke free you can detect smoke odor in the room some staff members are very nice and others well being this a wyndham hotel i expected more;3
i especially liked the location of the empire hotel it was close to everything restaurants shows lincoln center central park and many other places you just got to see the staff was very helpful especially daniel wh helped me with my bags and cab needs the rooms though and the shower area is small you wont get a free breakfast here but theres a good strabucks around the corner;3
i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights the room is as you would expect in new york quite small the bathroom was very old fashioned the bars attached to the hotel were very good the hotel is across the road from madison square garden and 10mins from times square the walk to times square there is a lot of homeless and people on substances but if you ignore them they will ignore you;3

we stayed here for 4nights for a girls night the hotel is in an ok location the reason for 3 stars is the service when we checked in early they said that they did have a room available but it would cost us 50 to get into it ive stayed in hotels all over never heard of that my sister called the reservations department and they told her that that is not true a fee should not have been charged also to hold our luggage they charged 5 per luggage as we didnt use anything at the hotel the 29 a night was also pointless not like vegas where your using a pool gym etc the rooms are very outdated;3

location of this hotel is great particullarly if interested in broadway shows the hotel staff is very helpful especially when checking in out hoever the room we had even on upper floor with nice view was just a bit on the small size but even over looking the size of the room it was difficult to overlook the size of the bath room which appeared to be dropped into the room as if it was a small converted closetagain many plusses to this strategically located up scale hotel but a bit pricey for the accomadations;3

i booked this hotel in january 11 months before our trip as a birthday surprise for my wife and let them know it was a special gift for her we arrived on 23 december and the room we were given 2129 was awful tiny grim dark however when we asked to change julia who is still training went more than the extra mile to provide us with a much bigger much more comfortable room 2830with a fantastic view of the empire state building thanks so much to her for this it completely changed our holiday the hotel itself is a bit tired very brown a new lick of paint would make a huge difference but its a great old art deco building lots of history and in a fantastic location and the staff are great very helpful particularly julia and samira the tick tock;3
im really torn about my experience at the jane first impressions were great we arrived very very early and hoped to drop off our bags and they actually allowed us to check in jose helped us with our bags and the doormenbellmen were great throughout my stay the room was tiny but anyone who read reviews ahead of time would be prepared for that the room was cute the bed was comfortable enough and there were some great details tv at the end of each bed slippers and a robe for the bathroom the bathroom was kept clean and besides a few times when i had to wait for a stall it wasnt an inconvenience sharing a bathroom the area was also great easy to get to the subway and easy access to other places by cab the negatives the room was freezing there is an ac unit;3
the hotel is in a good location in soho walking distance from katz deli its a small hotel and its good for what you pay for dont expect thrills and frills our room was small run down but the bed was fairly comfortable bathroom was clean and with all amenities you need if youre looking for an affordable place in the east village to just sleep and shower then this is your place;3
we arrived at the hotel after a long flight from the uk there was a long queue waiting to been seen it went down fast the lady at the desk was very nice and asked if we wanted a room with a view or a bigger room we have but no view we went for the bigger room we made our way up to our room did not get any help with our luggage cannot remember what floor we were on but it was very high up we found our room at last we were told we could have a big room when we got in the room was dull one very small window looking out at a wall yes we were told large room no view but this room was tiny dark old fashioned the bathroom was not good dripping tap all night was not like a hotel bathroom cold did not look like it had been looked after old fashioned shower not toilet paper in;3
we stayed in a twin room on the third floor the room was really small but had a good size wardrobe fridge and a table it was clean and very warm the toilets were right opposite our door which was very convenient the location is also good the only down side was the noise you literally hear every single door closing on the floor especially the bathroom and kitchen;3
this is a 3 star hotel directly across from the lincoln center and 3 blocks from columbus circle 15 min walk to times square 1 block to central park surrounded by good restaurants the staff is great professional and friendly the decor of the hotel can be described in a lot of ways eclectic odd bizarre ugly rooms are nyc small although comparable to the competition its not great value for money but not bad either you just have to get your head around that in nyc 200 doesnt get you the same as in a lot of other places some details of the finish were shoddy the bathroom door had been repaired with drywall mud or wood putty and not sanded as had a large section in the main room not terrible just not quite the quality of details i would expect;3
this was our second time staying at this hotel and worse than the first experience we stayed there in early november and although it was in the 60s outside in the evening the heatingcooling system was on heat only and so we could get no cool air the room was tiny a queen bed room and stuffy the only way to get fresh air was to leave the patio door open but since our room was on the ground floor that was a problem i cant sleep if its over 60f in the room the location is very convenient to the 101 freeway hollywood studio city sunset and santa monica boulevards getting anywhere in the la metro area is relatively easy for la they do charge extra for parking but the rate is reasonable for la and the parking lot is very secure and welllit there is a;3
great locationvery calmpolite staff and excellent cafe but a real problem is with the the climate control especially the heating system that probably dates from the early 1900s during my last stay this month i was so cold i had to sleep with my winter coat on what was really disappointing was was that i paid 300 plus for a room that was barely heated 60f and was not compensated for a really miserable night of sleep;3
hotel rooms are small and bathroom was tiny some features such as slow elevators 2 were actually out of service show that this is an old hotel in need of further updates front desk is very responsive and helpful however;3
the front of the building had scaffold up which is a little off putting when you first arrive however the entrance and lobby are beautifully decorated and give the wow factor reception staff very friendly and helpful the rooms are large however the bathroom was tiny and very outdated missing teacoffee making facilities the roof top bar was a little shabby and dirty the pool was closed and yet said open till end of sept the location is very good for enjoying the sights of new york and is close to underground stations and cafesbars;3
the hotel is in great location room was ok for the size for one person my only complaint was the front desk people was rude and not all there;3
i wouldnt stay here again we arrived with a car full of luggage to unload and there is no loading zoneyou have to double park on the street they had no cart or help for unloading this is an apartment building where some of the apartments are rented out for short stays so you cant expect the same amenities youd get from a hotel we went through hotels for reservations and we plus 2 others guest who arrived when we did didnt get the type of rooms promised we complained and they were able to switch us but one family had signed up for a 2 bedroom apt and ended up with 2 studios we got a studio that slept 3 there was a queen size bed and pull out single bed sofa which was very thin and uncomfortable to sleep on it is very small for 3 people the studio for 2;3
2 minutes walk from central park right next to the lincoln centre no breakfast included but theres a starbucks right next door and a supermarket next to that clean rooms and helpful staff nice rooftop bar didnt get a chance to check out the gym too much site seeing to be done but apparently its newly renovated;3
reading other reviews of this hotel i was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised yes the hotel is a little dated and not the cleanest however it was adequately clean and housekeeping came in everyday the location was excellent and very easy to get round the city from some of the staff could do with learning a bit more about customer service as some werent all that friendly however this is just a small negative this hotel is great for people who are on a budget like myself so would totally recommend it;3
the hotel is very well located it is close to madison square garden and pen station with access to the subway system the hotel is huge with around 560 bedrooms our room for 3 people was small and the beds were also quite small the bathroom was in need of an update and had leaky taps and shower the tvon demand system didnt work properly but the rooms were clean the aircon was very efficient security is good everyone entering the lift area has to show their room key there is a bag storage area available it costs us 20 to store our bags on the day of departure we had breakfast in the tick tock 24 hr restaurant which adjoins the hotel the food and service there was first class;3
with so many amazing options for places to stay in nyc this is not a place i would choose to stay again macys is right around the corner but we were always wanting to be closer to rockefeller center or times square for shopping and dining getting an uber was a big waste of time and money in the winter months when everything we wanted to do was too far to walk in the freezing weather the roomsso tiny i paid 200 per night for a tiny dated old room with one queen bed to share i have never seen a one bedroom room with a queen bed it should have at least had a king we had just enough room to walk around the bed but with our 2 large bags on the floor the closet was not large enough to lay out one bag we were very cramped there was a tiny window with view of a;3
it is located in the heart of manhattan so very easy to access everywhere the personnel is very helpful the room is not that comfortable since it is too small the hotel is very old and should be renovated although the it is not allowed to smoke in the rooms our room was smelling cigarette;3
just providing a nice large comfortable room does not justify a place to be called a hotel it should have a proper 24 hr coffee shop a 24 hour room service more than one restaurant to justify charging a hefty room charge service means a customer after a long flight does not have to stand in a q to check in the reception is short staffed the dont understand difference between a credit card a debit card and a cash card arriving late from san francisco due to a delayed flight all that the hotel could offer was a tasteless soup;3
myself and 3 friends stayed there for 4 nights at the end of feb we were aged between 2325 and werent fussy we were only looking for somewhere to sleep and leave our bags after reading the reviews i wasnt looking forward to it when we got there we were pleasantly surprised the room were tiny but clean and warm and the bathroom was nice the bed was fairly small too but very comfortable we asked on the second night for a smoking room and we came home to find they had moved everything for us great the lift was very slow i nearly gave myself a coronary climbing to the top floor the radiators did bang very bad a night but we copped on after the first night and turned them off going to bed on in the morning which worked the room was always warm it was about a;3
i want to like this hotel its beautiful inside and so close to penn station but the service is not up to par a very nice gentleman checked me in then called me to make sure my room was ok i said it was in the morning i found that all of the bath towels were hanging on the doors hook i naã¯vely thought they must be clean and served there by the maid when i put one in my face it was immediately apparent that they were dirty i dried off with a face towel and hoped i wouldnt get sick i did not i also found a room key on a pedestal though i reported it to two managers it never disappeared from that pedestal in four days i went to the reception desk and spoke to a manager he printed a sheet and said an investigation would ensue and that id;3
clean well placed hotel in chinatown value for money located in the chinatown district of manhattan definitely worth a visit to chinatown and little italy to experience the vibrancy of new york;3
the location is wonderful the staff very helpful and the price in december reasonable however we had to change rooms 4 times due to the immense smoke odor in this âno smoking hotelâ needs vast updating;3
this is the hostel i usually stay in when in london when i first stayed here maybe 56 years ago it had recently been renovated and was the best and cheapest hostel better than all budget hotels too in london now its starting to need a new renovation especially the private bathrooms still better than most hostels though but they have nice comfy beds and all linen and towels included and an inroom fridge which is really good since they dont have breakfast and they have no full carpets âºï¸ which i find disgusting to have in a hotel and there has been something new every time i get there the reception area has been changed a cafã© is added and has been expanded and so on i just wish they had 3beds rooms as we are usually 3 friends going its just a couple;3
the setting is very special and the view from the bathroom is wonderfull the room is very small and narrow as if your in a 3th class cabin of an old cruise ship but convenient the staf is very friendly and helpfull the room has no view and the barrestaurant doesnt really match with the setting and the atmosphere of the hotel could be coster;3
this hotel is about 20 minutes of brisk walk from 46th street times square and the subway station is just around the corner for you to take a train to any place in manhattan slightly expensive the room had a good air conditioner music system tv microwave and minibar empty though did not see a restaurant though ie no breakfast helpful polite and friendly staff;3
a little disappointed if iâm honest i know itâs an art deco hotel and from 1929 the lobby looks fantastic when u move to the lifts they look worn and old everywhere look freshly painted but over the top of old paint it all just looks well old and not in a good way the room is 2 small for 2 beds and the beds are not double beds we were only here 2 nights so i let it go but i will be talking to our travel agent who booked it;3
location is quite good to upper end of city kind of a nice balance between being close enough but not in the absolute chaos that is ny booked off internet place generally looks a bit tired they clearly used a wide angled lens the room was extremely small cramped and pokey heatingac was semi broken had two settings too hot or too cold had to sleep with window open at night to have reasonable room temperature which made it noisy pool didnt open till end of may although i dont think this was indicated at time of booking shower dial didnt work so could only use overhead shower toilet blocked while we were there internet costs were a real rip staff were always friendly helpful and very professional have stayed in better places in ny at around the same price;3
stayed here just recently to be close to universal studios staff were friendly and helpful cant really fault them at all however the property is showing signs of its age the bathrooms have been renovated at some stage but they did not replace things like the bath they only coated it with paint and now that is peeling away the elevators were the worst i have ever experienced waiting for an elevator that never comes is frustrating push the button and it stays on for 10 seconds then goes out but no lift ever arrives the staff had to ride the elevators and select floors otherwise people would be stranded once you actually got in the elevator they were extremely slow and rough bouncing at each floor the parking was 24 a day which is a little steep but convenient;3
i stayed at the hotel last week everything was fine until when i hired the car i went to the front desk to ask about the amounts to park 1511 1715 the receptionist told me at 26 dollars i said i had seen 18 dollars a day my agency mistake it was then that the same was very uneducated with me very rude so i asked his name he said it was ali so thanks to this man i never stay in the hotel again i have trip to los angeles again in a few months and im going to look for another hotel same for my friends thank you;3
for 470 per night you think they would give you a drawer to keep clothes oh excuse me this is new york find a better value;3
the hotel is located perfectly for a stay in new york 34th and 8th very easy to get to from the airport if you do the train right next to penn station the hotel lobby looks amazing checkin was fine hotels in new york have a very varied selection of additional taxes that can come as a surprise my room was on the 19th floor small a bit dated but clean and comfortable no view housekeeping staff were very friendly there is a 24hr diner attached to the hotel tick tock ok what you expect from an american diner wifi was ok needed to log in each day i had roaming on 4g so didnt really need wifi checkout was fine and the hotel will keep bags for a couple of dollars if your flight is late in the day;3
clean room and clean bath room the place is near subway supermarket and easy find halal food near to central park and hanson riverside park small room no ac and no tv for sleep and bath only;3
great location small clean and well decorated rooms dont expect to find space for large luggage expect impersonal service and to confront a line of people waiting to go to the roof top bar upon your return to the hotel very trendy lobby which is always seemed to be crammed with fashionable types but hey youre in the greatest city on the planet;3
i stayed a week at the riverside studios at the end of last summer and the least i can say is that my first impression was rather negative the pictures on the website are incredibly deceiving and give the impression of a real gem at the door of manhattan well lets make it clear it doesnt look anything like the website oh well maybe the outside entrance does in some way kind of once inside i was quite taken aback by the apparent bad temper of the giant at the check in rather impressive unpleasant and making you feel rather unconfortable it all relaxed quickly though after agreeing on some imbroglio on my booking next surprise the room lock didnt work and we therefore had to wait for the housekeeper to fiddle around with grease and a flourish of tools;3
location is the main reason the hilton los angelesuniversal city ranks 3 stars in my perspective as hilton honors hhonors diamond member that regularly stays at conrad and hilton properties in se asia itâs a superb location for universal studio hollywood visit bar none their rooms are nice renovated but suffers from structural maintenance problems with slow bathtub drain with high room occupancy and bathroom sink drain pipe replacement which was fixed during our stay the room bed is on the soft side which was another big negative with my bad back i end up sleeping on the sofa not the sofa bed which was firmer that the bed as the best night i slept the other main reason for the 3star rating is the room maid service needs improvement to pay attention to dirty;3
the hotel is beautiful from the outside the inside is old and small this may sound negative but i would stay here for the second time the location is great and the central park is across the hotel;3
we spent 5 nights at the ameritania at the end of our honeymoon in august the staff is very nice above all mr julian at the front door the room was clean but too small i know we had a standard room and we didnt ask for any upgrade since we didnt spend much time in there but i would suggest to make them a bit more comfy the wifi is free only in the lobby this is something they can work on since many other hotels in the area give it for free also in the rooms cocktails at the bar in the lobby are delicious and the bartenders are very sweet and welcoming the overall experience has been good so i would suggest this hotel for the position and treatment not too much for the room size but you can also ask for an upgrade to a superior room;3
we were looking for a hotel that was close to family that we were visiting in la the hollywood hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly we had a room with 2 double beds microwave refrigerator wifi and tv the beds were very comfortable if possible get an inside room we were on the street and it gets pretty noisy at night a hospital is very near by and the ambulances can get a bit noisy the daily hot breakfast was a delightful surprise the hotel is just a brief walk to public transportation which we used several times;3
this is an older hotel and like much of ny my room was tiny fine for one person but if my husband had been there wed have had trouble the roofbar is nice as is the lobby bar which is popular and lively the breakfast was not good buffet at 25 was way overpriced for luke warm food and mediocre coffee and baked goods skip it drinks in the bar were good though;3
i stayed here on a recent visit to nyc although the hotel was not very modern and facilities were basic it was fine for my trip the bed was comfortable the shower was the perfect temperature and the heating worked well we were unable to connect to the wifi for the first two days of our stay but after informing the front desk this issue was fixed front desk staff were very kind and helpful lifts need updating though would stay again;3
ive stayed at the empire at least 30 nights over the past 212 years primarily on business and ill stay there again pros location location location perfect for upper west sidemidtown westacross from lincoln center many great restaurants within a few minute walk bigger rooms can be very comfy price relative to other nearby hotels is usually very affordable cons not really a businessoriented hotel caters more to the tourist ie nonrepeater crowd checkin experience can be extraordinarily frustrating read takes too long even for repeat visitors staff isnt generally the warmest ive ever receivedparticularly the front door can be a little overwhelming when theres an event or frisat nights when the club upstairs is crowdedits;3
we throughly enjoyed our trip to new york though the room was very small it was clean and comfortable we were so busy seeing the sights we didnt spend much time in the room we would stay here again;3
this is a very nice property that is within walking distance of universal studios and the city walk the surrounding grounds of the property are beautiful and its location on top of a hill is unbeatable the view from our high floor room was magnificent the public areas are tastefully designed and clean checkin was quick the staff was friendly my only gripe was being told to pay 8 bucks more for a buffet breakfast when as a hilton honors diamond member it should be included for free as it is at other hilton sister properties also the elevators were quit slow for a building that has 25 floors the reason i gave the property only 3 stars is due to the fee for internet access i never understand why hilton must gouge their customers to use the internet when sister;3
good price for ny but you get what you pay for super small room albeit fun so fine for a jetlaggy one nighter but would not recommend you book for any longer great location for checking out the area and fun staff popular night spot so only book if you plan on getting stuck in you will hear it weather you like it or not;3
we stayed here for a week in november get room 1230 view to the broadway room clean bathroom very nice but we didnt had hot water so they have to fix it which they did immediately no breakfast and you have to pay for internet and printing which should be included if they charge so much per night also when we payed to use the pc and try to print out they just tell us sorry but the internet doesnt work at the moment we had a package delivered to the hotel a day later we left and asked to please send it to our address they send it back instead of send it to me overal nice room unfriendly stuff ok location overpriced;3
i had a room with two queen beds the room was small with little space to move or unpack a desk and chair could hardly be used because they were too close to one of the beds requested and received a luggage stand so that i would not have to keep luggage on top of a bed bathroom was roomy and clean bathroom window did not close properly which i reported to the desk but nothing was done to fix it during my stay decor in lobby and room is dated and there were signs of water leaks on room ceiling room was quiet upper floor facing away from street location very convenient to midtown and multiple subways staff very polite and helpful very decent accommodation for a short or mediumlength stay 5 days convenient to a starbucks and other dining options though the area;3
we arrived after a really long day out to finalise checkin and they wouldnt accept my credit card because it still has my maiden name on it i was left in tears waiting in the lobby for 45 hrs until we could transfer funds from another account in an overseas account the porter rod was lovely and gave us some bottled water and apologised for the delay we understand why we werent allowed to checkin however every other hotel we have stayed at 6 in the last fortnight had no problem accepting my card as it matches the reservation this seems to be a rule kept stricly by this hilton from their manager who has them following this rule to the letter we were made to feel like criminals as you are only blue members and there is a lot of fraud with online checkins if;3
well the hotel has a great location thatâs for sure restaurants everywhere columbus circle â­ï¸ only a short walk central park a few blocks away from and loads of people watching the hotel itself is a class âbâ hotel with smaller rooms no mini bar or facilities to speak of a small bar was visible in the lobby but;3
lets start with the good staff its an art deco kind of place the interior of the lobby and the restaurant are fabulous the staff are great and the concierge chris is worth his weight in gold we ordered a standard room and it was small so small we couldnt both fit in the bathroom at the same time and we had to walk past the bed single file it was tired and could do with some love but it was comfortable we stayed 4 nights and went to dc returned to the hotel on our way back for 3 nights and our room had a leak from the ceiling they fixed the problem really quickly moving us to a superior king suite which was luxurious compared to the standard room overall if you have a good sense of humour the hotel is ok its located close to central park and 5th;3
the staff we dealt with were nice kind friendly and helpful so thats a plus the hotel is in a perfect location the room wasnt exactly ideal i mean it was okay but couldve been better the lighting isnt great the light fixing casts a sepia tone over the room it could be brighter to open the window gives a view into a rundown building the view was awful but i didnt come to new york to look out a hotel window so that wasnt too much of an issue there was a fan outside which was constantly making a loud noise thankfully i was able to zone it out to sleep theres a comedy club near by which is so loud but thankfully it stopped around 11pm wasnt so happy about the room only being cleaned once during our trip due to covid every other hotel ive stayed;3
i decided to stay at astor on the park to see what its like instead of staying at my usual haunt of the days hotel on broadway astor on the park has a great location just like days hotel its in a safe quiet neighborhood directly across from the amazing central park and steps from all of the major subway lines on the corner is a nice deli with nice folks and if you walk up to the 100s and broadway you can find plenty of good restaurants and a cute dive bar called tap of the keg drug stores and banks are all within walking distance so the location is convenient to say the least the exterior of the hotel is nice and the lobby while very small is welcoming the hallway is super small and slightly alarming but i hardly heard outside foot traffic the rooms;3
we stayed here for 2 nights as we were visiting universal studios and hollywood the hotel is in a great location for universal and we realised it was actually easier to walk than get the free shuttle the hotel room was ok and whilst i appreciate they are sprucing the rooms up it was very tired and the price tag is very high still we found the pool area quite small and there were not many areas to sit we were a bit disappointed as we were trying to get some milk for our young son to drink and no one could help us we hadnât been able to stop and get any we presumed the hotel would be able to help as we hadnât had a problem in any other hotelwe first of all tried the small shop in the hotel which didnât have any we then got directed to peetâs which charged 4 for a;3
visited new york for my daughters 30th there were 4 of us all adults for 5 days check in was easy staff very friendly i was a bit disappointed with our room decor tired very small and really dark but clean which is the main thing as it was only to sleep in the hotel is walking distance to times square about 20 minutes 10 minutes from central park there is a lovely roof top bar if you want a view with your drink would recommend for a short visit;3
our family of 4 stayed in the new yorker hotel in june of 2016 first the good the lobby photo is accurate the revolving door lobby and staff help to transport the guest to the nostalgic 30s 40s 50s the hotel is located near madison square gardenpenn station subway access 2 blocks from macys legendary department store from our room the empire state bldg was clearly visible beds were comfortable temp control was good cleaning staff were mostly invisible but very good relatively close to time square all of these things made the stay pleasant the bad being from the midwest the value of the roomtocost was not a plus we paid 220night through expedia this room in the midwest would likely be half that but it is new york the bathrooms left something;3
nice hotel good pool the breakfast is ok but the chefs hugo and jose are very kind and always smiling and make good omelets and waffles only one thin we had a extra guest eating breakfast with us the hotel charged us 40 wich i my opinion was 20 to much;3
they looked unhappy with my booking via expedia they discouraged me upon my request of adding my hyatt membership number on my reservation now i am seeing the reward point 37 for my two nights stay;3
when we first walked in i thought we were in an old creepy museum its very dark and dreary the rooms on the other hand we nice the beds were comfortable and the room was clean the shower didnt have doors and they were skimpy with their towels no bath mat either the water ran all over the floor the bathroom didnt have a fan in it either and it made the room steamy the roof top bar was a very young crowd and the music was very loud the hotel is very close to central park and in walking distance to subways etc;3
overall customer service was good although they do not know much about the public transportation system positives our room came with 24 inch tv which was really nice also it came with a microwave which is also very convenient it has a pool too bad it is unheated and located outside by the parking lot last it is located relatively close to a metro station about 1 â½ blocks and a rite aid negatives there were some faults with the room one the refrigerator in our room doesnât work it stayed at the same temperature which was at room temperature no matter how cold we set it the room would be cooler than the fridge our box of ice cream turned into strawberry milk two our shower did not work correctly it was either scalding hot or ice cold the screw;3
i went to this hotel in this last summer for 4 days i expected a bigger room but it was ok i stayed with 5 people in the same room but i think it was enough for us it is a pretty good hotel considering that is in new york it is near to the subway station and there are plenty of grocery stores in the neighborhood i highly recommend this hotel if you want something ship and fine i did read some comments about the noise but it wast s very quite but also not strong enough to didt let you sleep by the way it has wi fi and it works fine;3
while the rooms are very clean they could be updated the decor is really bad there is no tea or coffee making facilities bathrooms are modern the only good point the windows are not double glazed we used the window as a refridgerator could not sleep with the cold could not recommend to friends;3
i have stayed at this hotel numerous times and i usually have a good experience in the past i have not had towels in my room upon arrival but for the most part the visit was great the staff is always friendly the hotel is quiet most recent stay was not my usual stay the staff did not greet me it was busy at checkin and when i arrived in my room there was left over food in the fridge from the previous hotel guest i ordered room service on thursday night and when i was eating the chicken it had a funny taste i ended up being sick all weekend with food posioning from the dish i ate on thursday in the past i had returned items to room service for the food being the incorrect temperature at this hotel;3
i have waited a few weeks to review on trip advisor as i have completed 3 other reviews including the hotels own review and the wyndham review and was hoping to get a reply from my feedback nothing to date so they have not attempted to defend themselves and have obviously accepted my comments on arrival we queued for around 20mins to be checked in we booked via expedia and had completed their room preference questionnaire but these are pointless as the last 3 times we have done this the hotels claimed they had not had any requests from expedia at check in we were informed there was a daily facility charge for the use of the gym and high speed internet warning there is no choice we had 2 rooms so were charged twice 150 i did explain that we were on holiday and would not;3
great renovation of the historic lobby outstanding location next to penn station good quality bedding and towels small room typical for new york but incredibly dark with one window and view of hvac stack second room in a row with this same depressing feature;3
ive stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during my visit to universal studio actually the location is the only sale point below are the pros and cons pros 1 very close to universal studio 10 mins walk 2 the hotel faciliy is modern and abundant 3 easy parking cons 1 staff was not that friendly 2 actually it is a quite crowded hotel given so many tourists anyway if i go to universal studio again i will stay in this hotel;3
we had stayed here ahead of an early morning flight a year ago and really enjoyed it the decor is modern and the hotel was clean with great sound insulation from the airport so we decided to stay here ahead of an international flight out of lax however this time the ac was extremely loud and rattly and the room was showing some wear stains on the couch light switch being loose for being one of the more expensive hotels near lax we would have expected more the one saving grace is frequent shuttles to and from the airport;3
this was our 2nd visit to the hotel we were disappointed with the room it was tiny the room should have been for 1 persons but 2 of us in the room no bedside cabinet having to use window ledge to put water etc tiny bathroom its ok for just sleeping very disappointed esp after 1st visit;3
we stayed three nights in the jane last week and chose the hotel for its location and price as we hadnt realised how expensive accommodation is in new york we wanted to be in manhattan and to be fair the hotel is in a brilliant location on the border of the meatpacking district and west village and within walking distance of loads of places to eat and drink it was a good base for our stay the history of the hotel is interesting and the decor is really original so that made it fun however the pricequality ratio is very off we chose the bunk bed room simply for the lower price and make no mistake it is absolutely tiny we could not open two suitcases at the same time in the room and had to have the very loud air conditioning on all night otherwise we would have;3
the hotel is within walking distance to universal city and the universal walk they do have a shuttle service if you dont want to walk the room was clean and the qween bed was very comfortable for my wife and i good choice of hotel to stay at when visiting universal city we stayed there last weekend and got to enjoy all the beautiful women auditioning for the pussycat dolls the mtv music video awards was also at universal city that weekend;3
i got a pretty good deal on this hotel on priceline express however they didnt tell me i would be paying 60 more for the ridiculous resort fee seriously what does this get me my wifi was spotty and not worth 30night at least throw in some free water or something so i have no issues with personnel front desk was friendly bag check friendly though again charging to store my bag is really nickel and dimeing when every other hotel ive stayed at is free the rooms are tiny thats fine i wasnt there for more than sleep and a shower but thats where the problem comes in the bathroom was incredibly dated and didnt feel clean the water kept dripping from the faucet in the tub no matter how much i tightened them time for an upgrade id say oh and i had a;3
first impression of the hotel was excellent great view and what not first thing that was annoying was the location of the parking elevators and lobby poor planning we took the elevator to the lobby but the parking garage elevator goes up to the event area which there was a huge wedding going on so we had to walk through all that to get to the lobby only easy way in is to valet parking was 28 for the day we arrive to the counter and gave them our confirmation for 2 rooms we booked these rooms 3 weeks in advanced one room was not available the desk staff said it is a mess and they will call housekeeping to go clean it something which should have been done earlier since check out is at 11am we checking in at 4pm plenty of time so they only gave us one room key;3
the lobby and security are nice as you walk in the hotel is dated and needs some serious renovations i think some of the rooms have been upgraded but since i had a dog with me so thankful they accept pets i was put in a room that was very old no coffee pot dated and extremely small;3
we stayed in nyc for two weeks this summer mostly visiting friends but wanted a few nights with a pool in a good location so our boys who are 6 and 9 could take a dip to escape the heat entrance and doormen were very lovely and welcoming great lobby and a good start to our stay we were given a very nice room overlooking the street with a slight view of central park and lovely buildings opposite bathroom was smallish but nice enough the pool however was disappointing we all laughed out loud when we first saw it as it was much smaller than we had anticipated but was happy enough and not overly surprised as the hotel seemed good value for a pool and the uws location annoyingly however the pool had such high levels of chlorine that after half an hour on day 1 our eldest son;3
here for three nights when visiting universal a great location to stay if you want to be close to universal the breakfast was great with plenty of choice on the standard buffet offering with the opportunity to upgrade for a hot selection everyone who interacted with us at breakfast we found to be warm and friendly rooms were large but sadly we found evidence of a previous guest in the room ie the cleaning standards were not the best we did report it but there was really no improvement during the time we were there;3
i picked this hotel purely for location and for that it didnt disappoint essentially walking distance to most places and in between 123 and ace lines on the subway i trawled bookingcom until the rate dropped by 50 and then booked about 23 weeks before arrival the room was tiny and pretty crap but as we were on a high floor the view was great we only ate in the tick tock diner on the last morning for what was essentially brunch but the food was great and reasonable once is enough for me wont be back;3
pros visited for our honeymoon last year and they gave us a bottle of champagne the lobby is gorgeous with so much character the rooms are lovely they do a chuck bass cocktail for gossip girl fans great location cons very expensive the room the items in the room the bar the pool is tiny the hotel was very busy in the evening as they have a rooftop bar we had a cockroach in our room but they did upgrademove us quite quickly and offered to help with our luggage staff were ok but not overly friendly terrible wifi overall i was quite underwhelmed we visited as part of the gossip girl tour and perhaps i should have just left it there and stayed in our other hotel for the whole honeymoon i wouldnt return;3
location was excellent but selling point is roof top pool area which was closed and looked run down libby area in need of refurb v small room with no view and barely working shower some staff were surly others were reasonably helpful the staff seemed a little battle weary;3
i stayed at the empire hotel from 30th march to 5 april 2016 beginning with the positive the hotel is very nicely located near the lincoln centre and columbus circle the staff is very pleasant and helpful and the breakfast certainly very nicehowever there are a few flaws which i must say surprised me the cupboard has a shelf running its entire length such that you cannot hang a coat or a suit without the bottom trailing the shelf this makes the shelf less than useful i am surprised that there is a charge for making coffee or tea in the room the shower strangely has no door meaning that even angling the head you cannot avoid splashing the bathroom floor the hand shower does not work something apparently true in a number of rooms as we were a large group staying;3
be mentally prepared for what you are getting into a really really tiny bed and room with a noisy fan personally i felt buried alive bring your own flipflops the cloth ones provided by the hotel absorb water in the shared bathrooms staff are nice;3
ok letâs start with the positives a comfortable bed with good views from rooftop friendly staff with locality reasonably close to the sights not so positive we arrived to be told upgraded pleased yes but from early evening found out we were the room next to lift shaft room 801 fyi this was ok days 1 2 as we were so tired slept through anything but after that the lift shaft got really noisy room was very small with no view except of other dirty rooms pidgeon dropped windowsillsair conditioning was great but dirty grates and old paint rest of the room was freshly decorated the hotel in professional photos looks classymood lit but in reality is dark and dinghy with stair carpets dirty and with a musky smell to them obviously its an old hotel;3
backround info i visited the astor during peak season early october when most of the moderately priced hotels on manhattan were already booked i booked my room for 5 nights on wwwlmtclubcom where all they had left was a 2 twin bed option for 155night since i was traveling with my boyfriend i asked lmtclub to put in a request for a single bed preferably king or queen i also made a point to call the hotel a week before my arrival to remind them of the arrangement the staff sounded willing to put in the request but said that it wasnt a guarantee the hotel when we arrived the small hotel lobby was very busy with many international travelers it definitely has a hostellike feel though it is a hotel when we checked in the woman at the front desk informed me that we;3
we stayed for 4 nights the highlight for us was the free breakfast really good selection of hot and cold food we had a king room which was large and comfortable it came complete with a fridge and microwave we had a showerbath in the bathroom however i know other rooms have just a walk in shower which we would have preferred but it wasnt a problem the location was very handy if you didnt have a car as it is a couple of minutes away from the metro and around a 5 minute walk to a bus stop housekeeping did a great job of cleaning to rooms and we left our ipods in the room and they were neatly put away when we returned the reason why i have scored this hotel only three stars is down to not having anything in the area to do in the evenings we did go down to the bar;3
hotel is run down and needs renovation also they cannot accommodate a feather allergy we were told at the front desk that this 40floor hotel has never encountered someone with a feather allergy and could not provide featherfree bedding featherfree room is a standard checkbox and in my customer profile as a request at both hilton and marriott hotels but apparently the wyndham has never heard of such a thing front desk staff did commit to sending housekeeping up in the afternoon to try to see what they could do but they never showed superior customer care could have overcome the tiny room with the rundown bathroom but it was not to be;3
the staff are extremely pleasant and helpful and its in a good location near columbus circle they have a validation agreement with icon on 63rd that will shave about 20day off your parking if youre driving unless you want to pay the hotels 70day valet fee the bed and pillows are comfortable however its one of those hotels that looks nice at first glance but upon closer look its a little shabby the internet was unreliable enough for me to use on my phones hotspot instead the fridge was nowhere near 40 degrees no coffee maker in the room the bath needed a solid vacuuming hair in the corners and the grout needed a good scrubbing with bleach the shower system in the bathroom was broken but still usable the controls were loose the drain cover was not;3
i agree with bella f about the unexpected extra charges to my credit card for the amount of time i was a guest quite a surprise but they were deleted promptly upon checkout another hidden cost is the charge of 3 for each cup of coffee one makes with empire equipment in ones own room tacky i was amazed at how inexpensive bella fs room was my room was more than double her cost i can only caution prospective guests to check prices for this hotel at various times because they do have specials i would like to single out nick at reception most of the reception staff seem to have been taught not to smile however this was not true of nick he was helpful and friendly the hotel indeed has a great location and the door men are consistently great my room was;3
i paid in advance for 2 rooms on their website most hotels give you extra incentives to reserve online priority rooms shoe shines etc however we were given two rooms literally the size of closets facing another building i realize its a very old building and thats nyc but i learned my lesson here i could have saved lots of on a discount website but paid hundreds more for no reason at all hair in bath tub and no room service was a surprise too;3
for new york this is an excellent choice if you want to be within easy reach of almost everywhere thanks to the very good subway connections and still pay a reasonable price the rooms are somewhat shabby but clean and the staff is very friendly;3
while i always enjoy the âold new yorkâ feel of this hotel the hidden facility fees put a damper on my trip especially since they refused to put it on the company card that booked the trip without 19 authorizations and a spare kidney better to just raise the room rate and be transparent with guests the 30 per night doesnât bother me the principle does poor form wyndham;3
the picture on website is actually the back door to the parking lot the front door on vermont makes the place rather unappealing i had booked a room in beverly hills but was offered a deal to use the hollywood hotel instead hotel itself is clean and room was comfortable and spacious huge shower neighborhood is so so at night short walk to metro however we arrived at hotel about 2 hours early and front desk would not offer any kind of early checkin and had no place for us to store bags while we went for dinner;3
there were call girls working the rooftop bar and clients smoking pot on the rooftop bar and in their rooms reported to reception and cleaners sent up with air freshener spray to little effect also had building work constantly in reception area room was tiny far too small for family of four and nowhere for the suitcases staff were ok and bar staff friendly but they do work off tips all in all not a stresee free break;3
the good you can walk from terminal 1 southwest in about ten minutes the staff is great the quality of food is very good good wine list not so good the decor reminds me of what a clubhouse in a mobile home park might look like it looks very cheap and isnât comfortable the bar is very awkward feeling cold modern and unwelcoming the bistro food area was very confusing window shades a blackout and drape are controlled by two hard to use chain pulleys trying to figure out which is which and then place yourself in the right position to raise and lower the curtains requires an associates degree in cirque du soleil maneuvers the tv wonât turn on unless you put your key in the slot near the door when you enter i had to call about that since it was never;3
this hotel is located within walking distance from central park and the 96th street subway station the staff were helpful the rooms are outdated but ok for an overnight stay there is no parking at the hotel;3
great hotel and friendly staff but if jet lagged brits who cannot party all night the disco from 12 midnight to 4 am is an ordeal the staff could at least provide earplugs or put you at the front of the hotel for the thursday friday saturday disco experience unless you are out there of course however we would return but armed with ear defenders because it is a special place near to the hudson river park and the village;3
the hot water was tepid and i could not regulate the air conditioning i brought this to the attention of management and the problem was not resolved the location to lincoln center is excellent the bell and desk service is very helpful the room is comfortable but a little dark and not well sound insulated;3
if youre expecting a luxury hotel on the upper west side days inn isnt for you if youre looking for affordable lodging in an amazing neighborhood this is the place pros location location location room is decent size and price cons doorman smokes nonstop in front of building despite nys 20 feet from door law basic cable only on tv elevator slow but its a good halfprice less than any other decent hotel ive found in the city and you dont have to share a bathroom;3
renovations were taking place in the entrance foyer so it was bit of a mess when we were there check in staff member was awful she was extremely unwelcoming and unhelpful which was really disappointing hotel is about a 5 minute easy walk from universal studios and universal city walk which if full of restaurants and shops there is also a shuttle bus that runs between the total and universal city walk our room was large with a great view of universal studios the beds were very comfortable and amenities were good;3
we have 3 members of our family who have birthdays in november my sons my moms and mine so the 3 of us plus my sister and my moms bestie all came to go to universal studios our hotel was in walking distance which was great and if we didnt want to walk they had a trolley so fast and easy for us the room was big we got 2 queen beds and there was 5 of us we all slept comfortably and even with one bathroom we were all able to shower and get ready on time 4 women and 9 year old boy we loved the shower i dont think there were enough out lets though as well as mirrors in the actual room i strongly suggest that you bring your own if there are more then two adults the roon was set up great and there was plenty of storage we had a mini fridge for our drinks and snacks for;3
brian the fd supervisor checked us in he needs a new uniform jacket as his current does not fit him correctly our room was on the 7th floor with a great viewi have attached a picture from our room we checked in late but found the late night room service very helpful as we traveled across country all day the food was not very good to be honest very expensive 2 sandwiches cost over 5000 i have come to expect room service food to be priced high but 2 deli sandwiches with a small order of fries should not cost 5000 and not be perfection the next morning we were set up for the vip experience at universal we had a 10am report time for the event we talked to brian the night before and he suggested to arrive about 30 minutes prior which we were;3
i really want to give this 5 stars but there are a few things that prevent that first the good our room was quiet aside from noise from the street outside which cant be prevented the room was cleaned well each day we enjoyed the lobby bar at night the location was great subway nearby not the craziness of times square but close enough to it close to central park as well the room king junior suite was a nice size by ny standards the sofa bed was as comfortable as a real bed now for the bad the boiler was broken for 2 days while we were staying there so there was no hot water i get that this is out of the hotels hands things happen what i didnt like was that there was zero communication from the hotel about it we werent told of the issue until we;3
recently stayed at the empire on a last minute whim trying to get into the city ahead of a snowstorm the last minute price was fantastic but im not sure i would want to pay much more i stayed here two years ago and didnt get much sleep because of issues with noise coming from the heatac system and we also had minimal hot water i had high hopes that in two years some of those things would be fixed and was excited to give the hotel another try however we were up most of the night because of noise from the heater that said the staff is very friendly the location cant be beat to spend time in the park or see lincoln center and there are great restaurants nearby would love to try it again once some of the facilities are updated;3
the jane is in the meat packing district in nyc which is great place to stay because of all its fab shops and restaurants the hotel itself is very cute and but rooms are tiny no exaggeration to say that our closet back home was bigger stayed with my daughter in a room with bunk beds and we had to hang hooks provided along the walls every article we owned so we could stand in the room we could not change our clothes at the same time without bumping the other one into the lower bunk quite comical really we stayed 2 nights and died of laughter every time we got back to the room if your not see the bright side kind of people this is not the place for you if you want relatively inexpensive quirky and a great location then give it a try cool history as well;3
the hotel lobby is nice i booked through groupon so i was given a smoking roomâ¦yuck if you don not like smoke stay away from the 3rd floorâ¦from the moment you get off the elevator it wreaks the room was awfulstained carpets the groupon sale was not worth it the next day they moved us to a non smoking room night and day i would only go back to this hotel if i could call and make sure i was not on the 3rd floor in saying all that for the price i would go back to the 4th floorâ¦but would rather pay the higher prices than stay on floor 3 it was that bad;3
i found the staff wonderful from doormen to front desk to housekeeping the rooftop bar was lovely the room had many amenities including an umbrella blowdryer and refrigerator the location was perfect the bathroom had a fixed glass panel behind the shower head and water ran everywhere so i really didnt want to use it more than once the bathroom sink was slow to drain unless you removed the stopper entirely the pillows were not comfortable would not stay there again as i have had better room experiences elsewhere;3
id give it 35 stars if i could since the overall rating is 4 stars i went for 3 to average it out too many reviews of this place and everywhere are for 5 or 1 star there is not a single thing about this hotel that would prevent me from returning theres also not a single thing that would make this an automatic top choice when staying by lax the good the shuttle service is really excellent the rooms are pretty spacious and higher floors have a nice view i also appreciate that there are sufficient outlets and power ports by the bed the pool is large and if you have lounge access it is spacious and not overcrowded not as good instead of a desk the rooms have a round table with two funky and not so comfortable chairs the water pressure in the bathroom is;3
room was comfortable but in need of upgrade location near lincoln center cant be beat dont get breakfast in the restaurant though hot buffet was cold and overpriced appears the improvements to physical plant are in progress;3
hotel wifi these days is like hot water you dont need to say thank you that its there and a hotel such as hyatt shouldnt have spotty wifi that is unusable at times its like a hotel saying but we have warmish water most of the day the breakfast price is extortionary 31 for a mediocre buffet avoid it rooms are well kept and very well sound isolated so if you need a good night sleep before a flight this can be a good option anything more than that i would look someplace else;3
good location rooms need refurb roof top area a bonus in nice weather 5 dollars fir squirt of coke in plastic cup with loads of ice a rip off if guest at hotel should not be expected to pay this rate with added 22 tip on top most expensive soda ever had come on empire we are paying for stay understand alcoholic drinks should be paid for but not soft drinks no free wifi in room but has it on rooftop again as paying customers we should have this available in rooms;3
this is a no frills hotel on the upper west side we usually stay here when in new york city there is a lot going on all of the time our last visit we had a very nice updated room the wifi is not the greatest but it was acceptable the elevators are small and had to wait at times to ride it the business center is nice but does cost a small fee to use it overall we are very happy with this place we dont spend a lot of time here just for sleeping the price is right;3
this hotel is a great place for the budget traveller who donâ´t want to stay in a dormitory with 11 other people our room was clean and comfortable but not so much more than that a big plus to the hotel manager who followed my wife to the supermarket some blocks away in the late evening just so she could feel safe and i could stay in the room and watch nba;3
wonderful location funky lobby mostly great staff good value for money loud grumbling ac in two rooms where we stayed terrible internet service tiny bathroom small and cramped toilet shower sprays water all over the place some awful staff payforview tv never worked in two weeks loud club on top floor what could be a great hotel smack on lincoln center is a rather rundown hotel with tiny rooms most of the staff is extremely helpful empathetic plain nice some others are as responsive as wall paper not bad for the price a somewhat endearing place that could be in much better shape;3
ive stayed here a couple of times now for work trips the property is in a good location right across from lincoln center the rooms are acceptably clean and the room rate is reasonable for new york that is sort of what it comes down to isnt it i stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and second time in room with 2 full beds and room size is okay there are rooms with just a single queen bed and those rooms are very small the bathrooms are tiny and ive had problems with the shower both times that ive stayed there the first time the shower was leaking the second time there was no hot water so i had to take a chilly morning shower there is also only a door on half of the shower which is just a bit uncomfortable the bathroom gets a bit wet i completely;3
we read all the reviews and were quite apprehensive but any worry was quickly dispelled the apartment was basic but what do you expect for the price plus we didnt spend all day in it we were there to see the sights one thing that has been mentioned in previous reviews which we think would be an improvement is free internet and access to a printer to enable booking online for the flight home the apartment block was about 200 yards from 72nd streetbroadway tube station red line and a 510 minute walk to central park and the museum of natural history the area has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from with a range of prices we would thoroughly recommend josies and lanskys it must be reported that cooking would have been a problem as the apartment had only;3
as well known as this hotel is i found it to be old and run down i have stayed at better hotels for cheaper the faucet in the shower was broken the room was old the service was mediocre we asked for more towels and pillows and they didnt bring any tried calling the front desk from our room and no one would answer the phones the hotel is not close to times square it is 10 blocks away not as advertised the restaurant tick tock was horrible they got our order wrong all 4 of us when we complained they gave us a free bottle of water do yourself a favour and book another hotel;3
this hotel was okay nothing special they need to pay more attention to the platform beds and vacuum around the mattress we had no hot water and my husband was having surgery the next morning and would have liked to shower i was looking forward to a bath but no such luck we called the desk and she sent up an engineer who turned the water in and said its getting warm let it run which is what we had been doing;3
look past the fact the hallways and rooms are a little tired this is an older hotel with great access to the empire state building broadway and time square 15min walk subway station to central park 5min and maddison square garden 5min our room had 2 bathrooms and a seperate bedroom with views of the empire state building we had 6 nights and as a family there is a coin laundry 10 min walk around the block in 9th avenue this is a key when travelling with kids;3
we were celebrating our honeymoon and stayed at the ameritania for 3 nights before moving on to antigua the hotel itself is relatively basic with small rooms but what youd expect of a hotel in the centre of nyc location is perfect close to times square broadway central park etc so ideal for tourists our stay started off poorly as we had an awful experience at check in we had booked the hotel over a year in advance and our travel agent had emailed to let them know when we would be arriving 2pm so we had asked for an early check in we had also specifically asked for a room on one of the higher floors when we arrived there was no friendly greeting and the lady told us that our room was not ready and wed have to wait when i explained that an email had been sent to;3
spent 3 nights and found this an adequate hotel comfortable beds lovely clean rooms friendly housekeeping staff and great locationthe front desk and pool bar staff are lacking in customer service skills;3
we were traveling to meet family and visit universal studios hollywood and stayed for two nights since we are hilton gold members we convinced the family members we were meeting to book their rooms here as well and subsequently spent the entire trip apologizing for the poor quality of the hotel we arrived at the same time and while we were assigned a higher floor as is listed as a preference in our hilton profile when we gave our room number to our extended family at the front desk when they were checking in the front desk made absolutely no effort to look for rooms on the same floor i understand that people may join a rewardsloyalty program for special treatment but quite frankly its embarrassing when that special treatment which isnât all that special anyway isnt;3
great view from room but very very very small not big enough for 2 people and no space to put anything on a shelf in bathroom wifi in room very poor not able to connect until in lobby area reception area beautiful but step out of lift to get to rooms and its very old and in need of cleaning and upgrading staff very helpful;3
the hotel location is absolutely excellent and very nice its rooftop with the bar and pool but the rooms are quite old with old pieces of furniture and not as clean as youncould expect in a nutshell price quality is acceptable;3
i was on the 1st floor which normally in the us is ground floor but this was the first floor above the ground floor rarely is a floor that low good in manhattan as they tend to be noisy as so close to the street not an issue here problem i had was i was right by the ventilation shafts my room was literally right be them outside the window noisy and wow what an incredibly ugly view at least there were thoughtfully provided ear plugs on the bedside table other than that room was fine adequate size big bed small bathroom which good shower that desperately needed a shower door to stop a very wet floor the tv is getting on a bit and quite small and far from the bed hotel reception were friendly and helpful same with bell desk bar on ground floor has a nice;3
on arrival we were early so rooms were not ready however they offered to upgrade our room for free if we wanted to have separate rooms rather than interlocking which was fine as these were ready room was ok but needed a bit of updating especially the bathroom the main issues were the noise from the road outside and the cold due to poor windows we had to have the heating on most of the time which made just as much noise as the beeping horns and sirens we were on the fourth floor however room was clean and comfortable beds and the staff were polite and helpful hotel was in a great location 5 minutes from central park and 20 minute walk to times square beware of the residence tax before booking as this is an extra â£25 per roomnight this had been included in our holiday;3
things i liked the most easy to access the interstate front desk was friendly within walking distance to universal always something going on pretty views of the hills beds were comfy and bathroom was roomy also the walls werent paperthin like some hotels things i didnt like maid service down pillows it was hard to get replacementsim allergic parking was ridiculous layout was confusing air conditioner was either really hot or cold and never at the temp it said it was definitely for families with kids it was expensive for what you got but what isnt in la the only problems we ran into was that the maid would change our towels everyday even if we hung back up we were trying to be ecofriendly since there was a drought going on they kept replacing the one;3
i just stayed at the empire hotel for one evening to attend work functions being held accross the street at lincoln center aside from the very conveinent location and a decent lobby this hotel is not worth the money my 2nd floor room was a tiny cave that looked into an airshaft thankfully i was there by myself bc i cant imagine two adults trying to negotiate moving around that room at the same time without one of them walking over the bed other details or lack thereof in my room included a nonexistent alarm clock a wine bottle in the mini bar with a label that reflected the fact that it had been iced down at least once and the returned to a room tempature position on in the minibar basket and a shower that required me to call the front desk to learn how to operate;3
as early reviewer stated dont listen to the whiners ive stayed at this hotel two times and the second time for over three weeks no its not your 300 a night hotel but my room was clean the availbility of the shared restrooms was fine i didnt have to wait for anyone most people just dont understand the concept of nyc hotels most hotels under 200 a night have shared restrooms if you want an expensive hotel then be ready to spend it but if youre in the city to see the sights shop and enjoy the nightlife then stay here no not all the shared bathroom hotels are clean as this one but im a very picky person and i wasnt grossed out at all here dont stay at the west side inn next door that was gross;3
clean comfortable bed and friendly staff very near the subway and columbus circle and all of downtown walking distance next door to starbucks and 24 hour pharmacy for all you need as well as an atm;3
i returned to the empire hotel for 3 nights in early may thinking that the odd circumstances i encountered while stayng there at the beginning of april were just anomalies that was not the case first the good news this is a great location at the entrance to the upper west side excellent subway connections a block from the lincoln centre easy access on the west side highway from gw bridge the staff are genuinely friendly enagaging and helpful the beds are are great among the best i have found in any hotel anywhere when i checked in was the first hint that all was not well although i arrived at the hotel at 700 in the evening my room was not ready i was offered a smoking room but my wife is hypersensitive so that was not an option i was told that it would take;3
the new yorker hotel is an old hotel that has been renovated the is nicely appointed the rooms are very small there is very little closet space no amenities the bathrooms are very small and there is no shelf space no coffee makers in rooms the tick tock restaurant attached to the hotel has a good menu and the prices are right it is very popular the hotel is in the heart of downtown manhattan penn station and a subway are a block away it is within walking distance of 5th ave the theater district and much much more;3
we stayed at the hotel during a recent family trip to new york the hotel is a step back in time but also tired and ragged at the edges check in was not great arrived at 8pm and didnât get all 3 of our rooms till after 1030pm suspect this was partly due to us pre requesting we were all on the same floor staff were apologetic and we were given some drink vouchers and credit on the resort fee which was appreciated staff at the hotel are friendly including room cleaners always made to feel welcome location of the hotel is great whether you want to go up or down town we walked pretty much everywhere but the subway is well located for those who donât ticktock diner was great portions are large and the staff very friendly a good breakfast to get you going would;3
we stayed here in dec 15 on arrival was a lovely looking hotel we was told we was getting a free upgrade from the check in staff but when we got to our room it was tiny if that was an upgrade id dread to think how small our original room was there was wall paper falling off the walls and the heater didnt work so it was freezing when getting out of the shower my only real issue was with the concierge i feel he lied and conned us into buying tickets for a bus tour he told us it was a new company and could get them for us at a discounted price when going to do the tour we realised we had actually been charged more than if we had bought them off the ticket seller overall a very basic hotel not the best;3
my room was very small and a bit noisy i was on the first floor right next to the elevator room 110 room was quite dark even when opening the curtains to reveal a bank of ac fans the front desk staff was friendly and the location was excellent being right across from lincoln center;3
it was a top location but the room was really small and i booked and afterwards had to pay an extra of 20 usd per night this is beside the tax they could have communicated that better i think it said city view and it was not;3
hotel was nice but my room smelt weird my ac also didnt work and the staff was unable to fix it the staff seemed apathetic breakfast was very expensive shower pressure was pretty good room was clean;3
requested double beds with a view of ny received 1 queen size with the view of a wall the view was fixed but no double beds available got to the new room and the ac wasnt working had to call 3 times and waited over 2 hours when they finally decided to replace the unit after about 20 minutes with the new unit it turned off with the tv jumped a fuse another hour to get fixed very small rooms wont be staying at this hotel again;3
pros location 8 stops on the subway to times square the rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels linen cons the rooms are tiny no kettle toaster or utensils in shared kitchen wifi is very poor and the tvs didnt work work the entire week we stayed;3
close to empire state building madison square garden and lots of other touristy locations bit dated rooms bathroom was freezing because leaking window frames and bad breakfast possibilities mostly nice staff;3
location is great i love that the tickety tock diner in the hotel is open 247 the rooms are clean but very small ive stayed here several times and the line to check in and leave or pick up luggage seems to always be long no real complaints but i wouldnt rave about anything here other than the convenient location;3
there was no hot water in the morning the night before we went to the bar and it is not stocked as i thought it would be no zinfandel no reisling no annisette no zambuka the rooms were ok there was enough towels rooms are very small two people better know each other;3
we spent 14 nights at the new yorker room was clean and bed very comfy we had originally booked a metro double and were upgraded to a one bed shoebox with great views i wonder if the room with 2 beds would have afforded us more space the views werent worth the size of the room room was sooo tiny walls paper thin barely any room to store our suitcases wardrobe so tiny i think if we had coats to hang the door wouldnt have closed bathroom tiny also we found the staff with the exception of housekeeping to be very indifferent and made no effort to be friendly the hotel is in a convenient location but its just not the nicest location i would never stay here or in this part of the city again;3
our room was very small my friends had rooms nearlly twice the size even though we had all paid the same price i suggest you ask for one of the larger rooms when you book the staff in the hotel vary so much in customer service after a long flight we arrived at the hotel to be met be met by a frosty receptionist no hello no welcome it was name fill in this form credit card details heres your room key umyet the concierge especially the lady were wonderful when we asked for directions i loved the art deco features though agree the hotel is tired looking saying that the bar area is modern clean and we ordered some hot nibbles which were lovely the cleaner did a great job and the bed was comfy be warned we booked the hotel pick up;3
a very well apointed property but it has a very limited menu and the selections are grossly overpriced for the value i hosted a national business meeting here over two days and was generally disapointed;3
great location i hammersmith rooms are clean and it has all the amenities however it doesnât feel like a usual hostel your sort of just told your room number an have to work everything else out yourself there is no signage or anything its also very noisy the common shower room is shared by both men an woman which i find a bit awkward but all an all it is ok;3
the hotel is in a good location and on the whole the staff were friendly we were slightly disappointed with the room which was a lot smaller than anticipated and a little tired and for the price did not feel like value for money the lack of teacoffee making facilities was also a negative the bathroom also felt like it needed an update;3
wow this place has no soundproofing if you are a light sleeper or just like a peaceful atmosphere i would not suggest staying here you can hear every voice outside like theyre right next to you and every flush of a toilet sounds like it should be physically in the room with you its so loud the benefit of this hotel is its very centrally located close to the train station and easily walkable to everywhere additionally the lobby is gorgeous probably wouldnt stay here again;3
the usual reception man was a jerk there was one young guy who did a night shift who at least tried to be helpful the tour desk lady didnt have a computer and barely spoke english and was always on the phone talking to a friend it seemed to be fine with the management that she was when we approached to try and book ticketstours we where given the dirty eyes and told that everything needed to be booked elsewhere room was warmed by some device that sounded like it was about tk blow up every night at 3 am a loud blow off sound woke us up floor was soaked around the unit rooms are very old it was the cheapest we could get over new years but that doesnt mean it was cheap location was good;3
we decided to take a road trip down to new york city for the victoria day long weekend we left fri afternoon 5pm and decided to drive until we couldnt anymore lol we finally stayed in some dumpy hotel in syracuse the next day we ended up in new jersey but couldnt find any hotels that were available finally we found the days inn broadway they gave us a renovated room which was really nice small of course we paid 350 for the sat night which we were expecting to pay check in was a breeze but we couldnt check in until 3pm which was fine the guy put our bags in a safe place and we were off to visit the big apple we got a bus tour which brought us everywhere i mean everywhere we say rockafeller center world trade center stock exchange etc etc it;3
room would not cool down to comfortable level using room controls all hotel staff were courteous and efficient but set out room service tray on saturday morning an it set in the hallway until monday morning;3
arrived at hotel just before 10pm on a thursday for a 2night stay luckily we were able to pull the car over in front of a fire hydrant to unloadotherwise there is nowhere to unload my husband checked in and asked where to park as we had been told when we booked that there were several nearby garages staff told him garages were closed now and he would have to find a spot on the street they did not suggest where to go to have the best chance of finding parking luckily my husband travels a lot and did ok driving around in the congestion to find a spot but i could see where this could be a very stressful situation for many if you thought you were going to park in a garage hotel is dated and roomselevators are very small room was clean room info said there was an ice;3
a little bit disappointed with this hotel not very clean and uncomfortably small bathrooms the rooms were big and quite ok tic toc diner was good for breakfast the location was also very good what made us not want to stay here again is the resort fee that is charged for usage of fitness and business center;3
the location was perfect for our visit the room was not in the best of repair specifically the bathroom which may have been recently upgraded but the shower sprays all over the floor and the water damage as a result made the floor tiles loose and the doors and wood were rotting;3
this is a great hotel for someone who is travelling alone because the rooms the majority if not all are for one great location in greenwich just below 14th street the staff very nice and for new york great price i recommend it to anyone travelling by themselves;3
if you are visiting universal studios and are just looking for somewhere close to rest your head then the location of this hotel is perfect its under a 10 minute walk to get to city walk and the gates of the theme park the rooms are clean and the bathrooms are new however the decor is rather dated from the pale green textured wall paper to the brown carpet the rooms are a decent size but the bathroom is small rooms have an empty fridge which is great for storing snacks and water to take to universal studios the pool area is nice enough and the hot tub was good the restaurant at the hotel was rather average but as we arrived late in the evening it was good enough to fill the void the lifts are very very very slow and you are often left waiting for 5 minutes to get;3
you cant beat the location here you are one street away from penn station times square is a ten minute walk away unfortunately the hotel seems rundown and in need of a major renovation it just looks worn out worn carpets cracked tiling creaky elevators speaking of the elevators even though there were supposed to be six of them it only seemed like a few were working be prepared for long waits and once you do get one it will be packed with people stopping at every floor the room itself was incredibly tiny if you are with someone i hope you are very close the bathroom is tiny as well the sink has no vanity and really no space to put your toiletries out they also nickle and dime you for stuff here to check your bag at the bell desk is 5 per bagi gave it three;3
elite benefit not received and no welcome or check in service as explorist member the room is noisy not as advertised the hotel is at good position the shuttlebus is very convenient the hotel overall is not worthwhile;3
this hotel was satisfactory for my needs but i am glad my wife did not come with me here are the positives and negatives to this hotel these are important because the range of what you can get in nyc is wide because i was within walking distance of my business appointments and the price was right this hotel was ok for me positives price location one block from penn station close to msg super friendly staff very clean room plush towels hot water great water pressure free wifi negatives location is on the corner of two very busy streets which means extremely noisy even for nycthe post office is next door so there are trucks running all night no elevator tiny tiny room i had a queen room built for smurfs my outstretched hand did not fit in the sink;3
my family enjoyed our stay at the hollywood hotel we stayed for 4 nights while we explored the town the staff was friendly the breakfast was good my girls loved the homemade waffles every morning but i wish they had a bigger variety of fruit the location was great short driving distance to many tourist areas and super easy to get an uber the hotel doesnt have a restaurant that was a little inconvenient but they do have a variety of local restaurants that deliver to the hotel we order pizza and salad and the delivery was fast and the portions were huge the reason i am giving an average rating to this hotel is because the bathroom really needs an updating the paint was peeling off the wall there is no storage area for your toiletries the shower was small and by;3
pretty good room and clean throughout they were doing some kind of repair work that required the water to be shut off for a few hours in the afternoon the hotel is close to thai town and griffith observatory also close by to other major attractions the breakfast is pretty good but you only get one omlet;3
we stayed with 2 small children to be near friends on upper west side so location was perfect and as other reviews have noted this is a great part of nyc for local shops restaurants and proximity to midtown and transport options the room on level 17 was basic but clean there was a huge outdoor deck that we didnt really use and the single bathroom was very cramped a generous sized person would find it difficult to use the toilet the most disappointing thing about the woogo is that you feel that with just a little attention to detail this could be much better value for money sofa bed was uncomfortable and wouldnt suit adults sheets and pillows were very poor quality and the bathroom soap pinched from a competitor was a unique touch probably would try somewhere;3
im currently staying at the hilton universal city business travel and although there is so far much to recommend it spacious rooms comfy beds the lower floors i am on one should be avoided morning truck noise is terrible i tried to get moved im supposed to be here for ten days but to no avail and now am grappling with facing long week and a half of unpleasant mornings do ask for a high floor if you decide to stay here other minor notes the sofa in my suite was dirty when i arrived wiped it down myself no cell reception in room positives comfy beds super friendly room service;3
had a fine stay at the hyatt very convenient to the airport shuttle was easy to get and it really is close by room was large and clean bed was comfy temperature control worked well restaurant was a good place for my business meetings in the evening big downer was the 35 breakfast buffet was disappointed to pay that much for some eggs and oj also they seem to have a no takeout policy for breakfast so i had to scarf down my food to get out for my meeting in time;3
my husband and i were arriving late and only staying one night so we figured the bunk rooms would be fine plus we stay in private rooms in hostels a lot when in europe they were impossibly small smaller than i expected the problem is not just that they are small but they couldve done a better job with using the space there was a tiny shelf above the door which was about 8 inches deep the shelves could have been bigger to store luggage because if you travel with more than a purse you have to put the luggage on the floor there were hooks along the mirror to hang things though there were tv in each bunk for the top bunk that space couldve been used for luggage if you have back problems to do not take the top bunk bc the mattress is thin and you can feel the boards;3
arrived at this hotel very tired after a very long flight to be told we didnât have a reservation this was booked through a travel agent and thankfully i had my paperwork with me receptionist was very unprofessional and kept saying iâm checking with our reservation team we were losing patience with her so she gave us a voucher for a drink at the bar so they could find us a room this was at 345pm we were still sitting in the bar at 6pm my husband went to the same receptionist again at 6pm to be asked what his name was she gave the excuse that there was delayed flights and they couldnât put people out of their rooms we asked for a manager who was very nice and apologized he put 70 credit on our account for a meal this was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in;3
i wanted to stay within a quick shuttle ride to lax and this fit the billshuttle comes every 10 minutes for a 510 minute ride but the big things forgot my 7am wakeup call the day of my departure elizabeth at the front desk acted like she couldnt be bothered and there were window washers at 8am right outside without notice coupled with the small powered creamer only two glasses provided in the room body wash was empty and candystore like concessions in the lobby with no healthy offerings make this a hotel ill skip next time;3
39th floor nice view but the rooms so small you cant swing a cat and everything smells old and nasty no refurbished rooms here great location though very near to penn station and times square we only stayed one night so i didnt get much service from the staff but what interaction we had was very good;3
this is a lovely hotel our room was very clean and the tick tock diner was perfect for eating and drinks at very reasonable prices the only downside was the noise from outside there seemed to be building work going on all through the night drilling and machinery plus sirens from either ambulance or police cars blaring out even though roads were pretty empty paid extra for a room with a view which looked out over penn station which was a waste of money but didnt spil our break;3
location to central park times square empire state and broadway was key the decor particularly the wallpaper was offensive at best the pool was so small it was unusable and bud of many family jokes the front desk staff was not nice checked in at 215 and room not ready said she would call but she never called i finally went to desk at 700 and they apologized gave us one adult and one child breakfast which we never used the bathroom was the size of a closet i would definitely not go back next time in new york;3
the hotel is in a great location however it needs an update there was no hot water for 2 days which is a major inconvenience anywhere the room was so small it was difficult to fit bags and there is absolutely no closet space the bed was very comfortable;3
by far the best thing about this hotel is the location you are 5mins from macys other great shops and across the street from both madison square gardens and penn station their diner tick tock is also good food all day and night and the quality and price are reasonable the gym and business centre are also fine rooms are a bit hit and missmy sister arrived the night before me and woke up with bites all over her arms chest and back they moved us immediately to another room and say they investigated and couldnt find the cause i have my suspicions the rooms are old and worn but the rate at the hotel is pretty cheap so i think you get what you pay for water pressure and temperature were both good in the room and so was the wifi the hotel is huge separate banks of;3
my family and i spent three nights at this hotel we loved the fact that it was so close universal studios and were able to take the short walk over to the park the rooms were acceptable and clean the biggest frustration was that only two elevators out of five were working this resulted in a long line and a long wait for the elevator and when the elevator finally reached our floor7th it was full and we would have to wait for another elevatorwhich was full we ended up taking the stairs so we wouldnt waste any more time a note of explanation would of been nice to know why the other elevators were not working;3
my husband has been to this hotel on many occasions for events at the rooftop etc but had never actually stayed in the hotel we stayed in one of their junior suites which looks very welcoming at first glance until you start noticing deep rooted flaws once you actually start living in it it wasnât as clean and updated as we hoped which we complained about the hotel were lovely enough to send up a bottle of red wine and two wine glasses to apologise with a lovely note attached which we appreciated the temperature in the room was very hard to regulate it was either too hot or two cold no matter how we tuned to radiators this left me with uncomfortably dry skin and a nose bleed every morning for the entire trip the air was so dry so i had to create my own humidifier with;3
hotel is nice in that it has two room suites and we had two bathrooms suite hotels in nyc are impossible to find so it met our needs it needs remodeling the halls are dark and unpleasant rooms ok but need updating;3
the empire hotel is located just across the road from the lincoln centre and is a great base for walking around the staff are excellent and a special mention goes out to vanessa and eric who really made the new years eve party rock the room was tired and we stayed in room 110 which is right next to air conditioning units which are so loud i had to wear ear plugs apart from that cannot fault it;3
after reading several bad reviews on this hotel i was very nervouse however when i arrived at the hotel i was plesently surprised i stayed for ten days at the end of june begginning of july and i didnt have any complaints the cost is very reasonable the room was of an average size with a fridge the towels were changed everyday and the bedding was changed every other day i found the staff to be friendly and helpful ron especially and its a good location for subway to take you into midtown manahttan etc i would have no problems with reccomending this hotel to other people and think that for the price that you pay you carnt expect any more i can see what people are saying about it being dated but it was clean and comfortable and priced very reasonably;3
a reasonable priced hotel for the night bed was very comfortable one major negative was the unexpected stains on the bath towel quite unhygienic and disappointing didnât bring this up at the time as i found it late and needed to check out quickly;3
we stayed in this hotel it is a total disappointment for us the bathrooms are so small and rooms are very old 2 of the elevators were not working long queue on that the pool is very very small and not like in the pictures the sofas on the pool was really dirty the location is ok and the lobby os nice rest i dont like it was not worthed what we paid;3
this is an older property but served my purpose needed this area and the location at broadway and 73rd cant be beat close to shops food and subway i was with another couple so room became reasonably priced when we split the cost we were able to get a 1 bedroom rate on a two bedroom apartment they only have a few of these with no sitting area which is better than taking a normal 1 bedroom with pullout couch in living area the two bedrooms each had tv kitchenette was helpful couldnt check in till 3 which was annoying but we could leave our bags on check out told them we need to leave our bags for about 2 hours and they wanted 5 eachi complained and they let us just leave them not luxury but would likely stay there again note that the name of the;3
so this is my third trip to nyc in as many years but my first stay at the the new yorker first impression when we walked in was that it looked nice its very central for most things times square is only a minute walk away with macys just around the corner and msg across the road its also right across from penn station which is ideal for the subway wasnt overly impressed with the hotel room was very small and basic with a lovely draft coming under the bathroom door we used the bianca bar a few times not a bad wee bar has a happy hour from 1230 lunch time until 630pm i found it best to sit and get table service if you wanted a drink as the bar staff tended to go mia in the afternoon we used tick tock diner for our breakfast every morning mo complaints breakfast was;3
the dark wood panelling ghostly lighting red carpets give this place an incredible atmosphere that makes it worth checking out i felt like being in the overlook hotel out of the shining so oppressive is the mood in the bar the pretty actress about to star in a horror movie sitting next to me admitted she thought it was haunted and the bar staff heartily agreed there were plenty of spooky tales needless to say it is all fake even the old wooden panelling was or so one staff member told me bought new when the hotel was done up nevertheless the illusion is very real and the owners have done a sterling job in creating the jane that said it is inconceivable why a recently renovated hotel should smell so bad the room i slept in the first evening smelled like an;3
great central location just a couple blocks from central park and walking distance to times square and rockefeller center lots of great restaurants near and a starbucks and little store right on the corner beds were comfortable very small rooms which i hear is common for nyc only complaint is bathroom is super small with no counterspace but in nyc dont spend much time there but to sleep so worked out okay wifi was not the best if your there for a work trip overall good experience for the price;3
disappointed when the private bathroom i reserved was not available when i arrived i ended up sharing a bath but it was a minor inconvenience and the price was changed accordingly room was clean and quiet shower hot staff friendly a step above a hostel with a fantastic location;3
this is my second time staying here having been to the city many many times i am fully aware that hotel rooms are typically small unless you stay in an older hotel but just to reiterate that this room was tiny i was only here for a short stay so we were only in the room to go to sleep at night but there was genuinely no space for anything the beds were just okay but i would not say comfortable overall the place was clean and staff was kind in particular a really great doorman the day of our departure the location is pretty excellent for the upper west side while still being in the hustle and bustle of the city it is across the street from the lincoln center and a few short blocks from columbus circle we stayed here for a great rate;3
we had booked two rooms for a four night stay at the new yorker hotel on arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who offered us two rooms next to each other on the 21st floor the rooms were quite small dated but they were clean there are not any tea or coffee making facilities in the room and after a long day of sightseeing it would have been nice to come back and make a cuppanew york has become quite expensive even the tick to k diner that adjoins the hotel was pricey overall the hotel was fine but it is no more than a three star new;3
we only stopped one night location is excellent right next to penn station and a 1020min walk to most attractions and sights the building interior is classic 20s style staff were helpful our room was on the 24th floor it was small and nothing special and the bathroom needed updating and a better shower for the reputation and price we expected more;3
doubting between the 3 and 4 rating because it was a good hotel for our ny citytrip just some minor items that might not be a big deal for some guests so a 35 for us the location is great on broadway near different subway stations and times square the staff was also friendly at checkin and checkout the doorman jeff was a great companion during our wait for the shuttle to take us to the airport in the end it was an hour late but he helped us by calling them telling us not to worry and taking the time to give us some valid life lessons the hotel itself looks nice and modern the bed was very soft and there was a great shower so everything we needed the minor items that we discussed during our stay we got a very small room i think it was about 3m x;3
no irons available and when asked a staff for help was told âno englishâ a hotel in central london employing staff who donât even speak basic english to be able to help a guest went to a work meeting with an unironed shirt;3
if you get a bunk room know that it is small i have been in ships that have larger rooms however how much time should you spend in your room when you are travelling the place is clean the rooms have a window air conditioner and radiative heat which can cause occasional conflict but a balance can quickly be reached there is no thermostat in the room for the radiative heat the beds were comfortable though after the marathon we would be hard pressed to notice and after the marathon climbing up to the top bunk can be challenging the staff are friendly helpful and eager the other guests can vary tremendously and most of the nights we were there marathon weekend when the club crown came in there was unwelcome noise but it didnt last long the staff keep the shared;3
the ameritania staff was very welcoming among before arrival and during check in i was celebrating my 40th birthday with a friend and they provided champagne in our room to help start my celebrations they were also readily available to answer any questions or concerns during out stay we were even given a great recommendation for a dinner at a local restaurant elcentro rooms were small but well appointed if you are a light sleeper i would suggest requesting an inside room we had a 10th floor room with street view and had to use the hotel provided ear buds which was a nice accommodation in order to sleep i had two complaints regarding the room 1 the housekeepers could use better vacuums there was blond hair all over the carper when we arrived the housekeeper;3
i stayed here for a few days while in london and i enjoyed myself the rooms are reasonably nice with communal bathrooms down the hall the location is excellent 2 minutes walk from hammersmith station easy to get to anywhere in london its a budget place so dont expect too much the location is what makes it;3
i am a long time customer the room i got needs an upgrade although it has a great view the bed was uncomfortable and felt old and the carpet needs to changed and upgraded i was too tired to request a change and it was late needs refreshing and an upgrade too dark the staff at the front desk are great;3
we travelled to new york for 6 nights to meet our daughter from australia we chose the hotel as we had stayed there before and because of its central location this time however they put us in a small double room at the end of the floor corridor it was not clean also for the length of stay no facility to hang up your clotheson complaining to the desk we were told that it would cost 500 to change rooms on saying that it was not acceptable and that we would find another hotel a room much better was offered at no extra charge why didnt they just move us before all the fussalso the hotel was not ideal for a xmas visit as they have a policy of no decorations for xmas;3
when i checked in on saturday at 3pm i requested a room above the street noise and was given a room on the 7th floor not high enough i should have been tipped off when i noticed one of the sundries provided in the bathroom besides qtips and soap was ear plugs as it turns out my husband and i travel with both a white sound machine and ear plugs of our own even those measures were not enough to block out the sirens car horns and thumping house music from who knows where i did eventually get to sleep but the surroundings are noisy the ac controls were not obvious there was no thermostat on the wall nor could we see one on the unit i didnt feel like calling down to the front desk so because i was cold with the air running we simply unplugged the unit note;3
great location just off broadway times square issue with hot water the evening we arrived but was resolved the next day small rooms made to feel even smaller with giant furniture but very clean and functional service good dont breakfast here very basic;3
we stayed here for a couple of nights over the weekend the outside and hall is clean and hotel like we were very surprised the room was also unexpectedly clean and tidy considering the little amount we paid we were not expecting anything fantastic but the bathrooms were just disgusting and nothing can justify that there are 2 shared bathrooms on every floor which is fine with us but people are just disrespectful and dirty after a shower you felt like you needed another one besides that the hotel is very close to times square 10 minutes on the subway and there is a great diner a couple of blocks down on broadway for breakfast wed probably stay again but no shared bathroom this time;3
convenient to lax can walk to the terminals experience was let down but overpriced room and food room was 199 plus tax and i paid more than 10 for two minute noodles chips and a banana phone not working in room and window coverings did not block out light limiting my sleep on a layover;3
stayed here for 2 nights in september with my wife the room was small and the view out the window wasnt great but the bed was very comfortable and i slept well i wasnt too impressed with their shower but the room was clean and sufficient for our needs the hotel was only about a 20 minute walk to times square but close to central park with some decent places to eat nearby i didnt have breakfast here so cant comment on that there was free wifi in the lobby but not in the room the gym was small but ok for a basic workout id stay here again for what i paid it wasnt fantastic but it wasnt terrible either we stayed over the labour day weekend so knew that value for our buck was compromised if you are in nyc for a short time doing the regular touristy stuff it is a;3
we stayed at universal hilton for the location but unless you are driving it is hard to access anything else the staff were helpful but after staying at other places we ended up transferring to another hotel;3
the hotel is basically ok corner room bathroom both spacious and tidy good beds and pillows some minuses â¢ there is a clear âupstairsdownstairs class divisionâ with the wealthy 5 star customers on the upper floors and ordinary 3 star customers on the lower floors â¢ their credit card readers are a bit outdated they only read the magnetic strip on the card not the chip luckily i had one credit card with an ok strip they tend to become unreliable if the card is old and worn â¢ check out is at 11 am but the cleaner knocked on our door already before 9 to see if the room was empty yet and again at 10 oâclockâ¦ i have travelled quite extensively and never before have i had to pay for breakfast and room service in cash in my experience usually hotels charge;3
the hollywood hotel is a cheap reasonably great locationed hotel its in the west hollywood area near vermontsanta monica vermont sunset metro stations its relatively easy to get around on the metro once you get the hang of it its located in between santa monica blvd and sunset blvd we managed to get a deal online which included breakfast hey its wasnt anything 5 stars but it certainly did the job being my first time in la it was a little nerving to get around at night in the area and would feel safer if there was more than 1 person or larger group large amount of homeless and mentally ill residents in the area but this is a whole for la not just the area of the hotel some nice little bars to visit on sunset blvd in town and diners werent too bad either;3
a disappointing start to our 7 night stay when my friend and i checked in we had booked our room june 2017 for what we thought online was a twin room but on arrival was told this was just a â preference based on availability at check inâ check your small print folks the receptionist had zero interest in attempting to get us into a twin room i asked 3 times for her to check or ask if any options were available but she was insistent that the hotel was full although it is a massive hotel with people coming and going all the time after this initial disappointment and lack of effort by reception staff i wasnât sure what to expect in the room thankfully the room was ok we were on floor 26 room 2605 the corridors are a bit dated and shabby but the room itself was ok no;3
i stayed at the jane on a friday and saturday night with a friend while visiting nyc the room is like the smallest room i have ever stayed in also there is this funny thing where the lights will only work when you still this metal rod in a hole in the wall but the bed was comfy and i was not disturbed by noise which was my biggest concern i didnt like the bathroom situation though my section which probably had 2030 rooms only had one bathroom which was coed so basically i would be shaving while some german girl was fixing her hair next to me while some weird old man in tidywhities came in to take a dump all in not a very large space weird the bathroom was wellmaintained but couldnt we at least have separate mens and womens bathrooms that is too;3
the room was so small one of us had to leave the room and close the door so the other person could get out the staff was wonderful and we felt very safe i expected it to be a smaller room since the hotel is so antiquated but we could barely move in the room;3
stayed at this hotel for 3 nights it is superb for location to see all of new yorks major sites the hotel is very dated i know it was the height of modern when it was built however could do with a bit of a re vamp the rooms are very small and the bathrooms are tiny no teacoffee facilities clean though great as your only there to sleep as generally out all of the day and evening the tick tick diner located within the hotel served good breakfastsalthough very busy and waiting time was lengthy tiny bit pricey but it is new york staff helpful enough rooms were quiet as quite high up;3
astor on the park is located at the very top of central park the view of the park from our room was lovely but the hotel was very far from all the fun stuff we wanted to do there is a subway stop 2 blocks south but the c train only stops there during the day there is another subway stop 3 blocks west but only the a train stops there so we had to carefully coordinate our trainsstops this is an old building so do not expect modern features there is only 1 elevator there is a very narrow staircase the rooms are tiny but clean the bathrooms are small but have been updated with new hardware and tile the beds are low to the ground and had very nice linens the room reminded me of a small hotel room in europe there is no room service and the television is limited to;3
the rain was bouncing down as the met opera ended so we searched the net for somewhere nearby where we could enjoy a drink and wait for the crowds to clear the bar at the empire was perfect for our needs a group of dutch marathon runners with infectious laughter were the only other customers and it was a nice atmosphere we would have stayed longer but before long the bar closed so we ordered an uber and made our way back to our apartment;3
second time i have stayed at this hotel but a bit disappointed by the room this time booked a standard double room and got given a disabled room on the ground floor by the lifts was noisy and just felt empty inside the room lacking comfort we expected for the price paid its a great location for those visiting universal studios as you can walk to the entrance in minutes and the staff were brilliant a big thank you to the parking guys outside the reception super friendly and helpful with directions after two stays here i think i would stay somewhere else if i go to visit universal hollywood again;3
the building is excellent and traditional from the period however extra facilities and charges for extras like coffee that are standard in most hotels let the hotel down the lack of welcome pack was unusual i received a key card and directions there was no further contact until i checked out;3
i have stayed in both types of rooms private and shared bathroom of course private is much preferred but the shared bath cabin room was fine the shared facilities were totally clean and noncreepy heads up the cabin rooms are small like teeny tiny small but come on youre in the best neighborhood in nyc youre not going to hang in the room right people the independent restaurant on site cafe gitane is really really good total bonus staying at the janes to blow on better things than the room you probably wont be in anyway its a safe cheap friendly place to crash sometimes thats all you need;3
firstly note from jfk the taxi should only be about 65 we were charged over 100 our own fault but do check hotel has a good midtown location most places of interest are within walking distance hop on off buss about 15 minutes walk check in was fast to our delight we were told we were getting a room upgrade to a view ha ha such a joke 22 floor and the tiniest strip of river amongst ugly looking buildings our room was small for three with two small double beds a bathrooms it was directly behind the elevators so noise all night long no choice but to pay nightly for facilities 22 per night giving wifi gym access would only recommend this hotel for its location note we got immediately nabbed before we even checked our room out to do a 90 minute tour;3
arrived with very friendly reception staff went to room 2715 which was so small no view brown and dark decor dusty and mould in the bath so disappointed we got moved to 2818 which was better shame the furniture is brown and dated really needs to be modernised still no view but apparently a metro queen view room is what i have a wall bed comfy the lifts are always slow i dont think they all work at one time one guy said he was waiting 20 min for the lift thd other day when it did arrive we went from floor 28 to 1 to 30 then every floor down it was so hot and busy the hotel is very dated the hall ways are old fashioned very noisy outside which you can hear all night very surprised you dont even get tea or coffee facilities in the room i personally wont stay;3
donât get placed next to the gym if you want decent sleep had loud banging past 11pm and starting at 6am breakfast was good the room service dinner was ok for the price was expecting better for how much we spent shuttle was very nice;3
the good location lobby front desk attention the bad rooms too small internet expensive and slow poor elevators service poor channel selection on tv 10th floor is noisy when there is a party on the floor above pool is very small;3
this is exactly what it says it is a budget hotel its run down and extremely basic but it works if cost is a concern and you dont plan on spending much time in your room there is no individual climate control and the ac units dont work you can open your window check your room and bed thoroughly for bed bugs the staff is extremely nice and helpful and there are some great bodegas close by;3
my teens and i have just come back from new york where we stayed at the astor on the park from march 5 to march 8 2008 i was so concerned about the negative reviews of this hotel that i tried to change my reservation but it was too late overall the hotel is rated 2 stars and it worths 2 stars rooms and bathrooms are very clean although the carpets need to be changed we first had a room with a view at the back of the hotel awful i asked to change the room and it was done with a bigger room on the 8th floor i recommend that hotel only if you dont want to spend much on your stay otherwise maybe pay a little more to have a better hotel astor is located near the 106th street broadway is on 42nd street;3
the room is in need of updating there was peelingbubbling paint over the entire bathroom door the outlet in the bathroom was loose from the wall and barely worked i had to wiggle and adjust the blow dryer over and over to get it to work there was a sticky substance on the window when i opened it to air the room out also housekeeping left one regular coffee each day it is customary for at least two regular and two decaf coffees;3
stayed for 4 nights with my family at the end of our holiday booked back in feb from the uk and choose a double double executive floor room which was described on the website as spacious with a seating area armchair and ottoman and you would be provided with 2 fluffy bathrobes as my children are 14 and 9 i like the idea of a room with a bit of space and was use to american rooms to be big with bigger than expected beds not in the hilton the room had 2 double beds that were not a lot bigger that the single beds at some uk hiltons a desk for working and a bench seat big enough for 1 in front of the window this had to be moved blocking access to the bed if you wanted to sit on it and not that we really cared but only 1 waffle bathrobe i went to reception to;3
on arriving at the empire i was given a room upgrade to a superior double double or something equally oddsounding in retrospect i think it meant that it had two double beds which was nice i guess but as i was travelling for business and staying by myself the other bed was unused i would rather have sacrificed the bedroom space for a bigger bathroom the room was big indeed to hold the two beds but the bathroom in fact shower room was tiny i am petite but when i sat on the toilet one leg touched the sink and the other touched the wall the shower itself had very poor pressure i am not sure if there was something wrong with it had i been staying longer than 2 nights i would have investigated the complementary toiletries were nice and replenished each;3
decent value for the money good location convenient parking computer experience was poor windows xp and very slow internet i was impressed it had 3 electric charging stations the pool would be an asset in the summer;3
i booked this hotel through name your own price on priceline for 190night and that may be the difference between an average room and a great room the hotel is in a great location on broadway right across from lincoln center and near the subway im sure there are beautiful views especially from the rooftop bar and lounge but we never got there the hotel is beautifully decorated nicely appointed lobby but something things are showing need of a little maintenance like the elevators and the moldings when we got to our room on the 1st floor we got a room overlooking the interior and the kitchen hence the cheap price we were dumped in the worst room but i could deal with that as youre there for the sights not to sit in your hotel room the worst was the;3
this is my first visit to the big apple new york we selected this hotel because of its closeness to most attractions in manhatan the rooms rate is reasonable for downtown new york the only concern is the parking there is no free parking or special price for the hotel parking is a concern in downtown new york the rooms are not spacious and the service is below my expectations i would not stay there again;3
ultra small room and smaller bathroom good location inexpensive no issues other than wifi was so slow my email would not send;3
the customer service was brilliant especially with the help of mohammed but never ever expect a big big roombed or even bathroom for the stay apart from that air conditioning was brilliant towels are well clean is pretty well convience as well which mcdonalds and starbucks are just opposite and cvs are just across the road;3
great location and service prior to staying however room was tiny with no storage space and bathroom was very dated and old again the smallest of rooms the service received was purely on arrival and departure so was acceptable;3
ive stayed here for business three times in 2012 usually two nights each my first stay of the year in february was one of the best hotel experiences i have had in some time check in was smooth and efficient i was given a nice ground floor room with a patio next to the pool as i was settling in to my room i received a fruit basket which was just what i needed at the time and breakfast the next am was great fast forward to september i had tried to book that ground floor room again got a message the night before asking if i really needed a accessible room i called back immediately saying i did not and wanted the same room as last time but no one answered and i left a message when i arrived at the hotel the next day it was clear that no one had listened to;3
quiet neighborhood hotel across from central park we knew we wouldnt be spending much time in the room itself so the size wasnt an issue if you want space to spread out this hotel wont be a good fit but if youre looking for historic buildings lovely atmosphere and a place to changewash upsleep this is a great value parking was easy and free on the curb by the park each bellman met us with an enthusiastic greeting helpful advice and knowledgeable suggestions they offer a bag check for prepost checkout which allowed us to get more out of our time in nyc fun place note they were doing constructionpainting while we were there but the staff was kind and friendly so it didnt bother us;3
stayed here whilst attending a course held in the hotel booked a room with a double bed for 5 nights the lobby was functional but no longer grand for a destination like new york the staff were efficient and very helpful but with a small reception counter only 3 guests could be served at any one time the room was comfortable but cramped the double bed was decent sized and the bathroom sufficient though there was a lack of shelving for basic toiletries like tooth paste and stuff the corner room i was assigned had a very small wardrobe and i was only able to put in shirts obliquely there was little space to place my luggage too as its an old hotel even though the rooms were refurbished the piping wasnt i could here every toilet flush and shower usage from the two;3
we arrived la in early morning the lady not only holds up us for couple of hours until 3pm we pretty sure the room was ready but also give us a street front room besides this unpleasant experience the hotel overall was good;3
clean pleasant staff close to lincoln center silly but they did not have coffee which was annoying told they were waiting for a shipment dah it is nyc also said the bar would be open but it was not what was cool was the bar on the top floor with beautiful views of the city this however was not run by the hotel;3
i dont think this hotel should be so expensive for what it offers there are no upgrades tv are old just regular channels not even basic cable the beds are old springs are sticking out if you dont be careful to getting in out the bed you will get cut or scratched toilets easily get clogged the shower water is always changing staying here is if there are no other places to go the staff are great very sweet always willing to help to bad there not the ones who own run the hotel prices are always competing with other hotels but they dont have amenities so if there is no other place to go then go but if u get something better for the same price or cheaper then go for it;3
the best thing about the empire is its location close to restaurants lincoln center carnegie hall and theater district the hotel is old bathrooms are very small and inconvenient do not take a room with a view of the courtyard;3
stayed here 5 nights in august our stay was at the end of a17 day holiday there were 3 of us 3 big cases and associated stuff needless to say we didnt unpack because there is one tiny tiny space to hang clothes up and 2 drawers we spent the whole of the stay climbing over cases and tripping over various items we were in a superior room beds small but comfy this was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in and we have travelled all over the world there is no where at all to put your cases even the beds go right down to the floor no case stashing under them for those of you travelling with children who can read please check the contents of the tray that contains room service items for you to purchasethis will save any embarrassment when;3
we stayed here from the 1st 5th dec so the first weekend after the christmas lights were switched on therefore ny was very busy the location is very good right opposite maddison square garden with the empire state building at the end of the road macys on the same street and times square around 10 mins walk you can walk to pretty much anything around midtown easy to get to with penn st station nearby where we got the train to and from jfk you can also get the subway to 911 memorialwall street and liberty island ferry the interior of the hotel is not quite as grand as the pictures but is quite nice their is work ongoing and signs on several floors apologising for this but a lot of levels are very tired looking i think we had a refurbished room on the 23rd;3
well small rooms but clean and great location where else can u get a room in ny for less than 100;3
check in a night mare other then that when you finally get to your room i had an updated one it was nice and clean;3
paid extra for city view and early check in there wasnt a room available when we arrived after 1pm and when we did get a room we were greeted by a view of a brick wall if you put your face against the window and looked at an angle you could see part of a great view it is an old property so i expected the rooms to be small and it was the bathroom was extremely cramped with no place to set personal care items the decor was nice the bed comfortable and the room was clean but ovetall the stay was rather disappointing;3
we stayed at the hotel in late august 2014 we travelled as a couple as part of a california road trip good points 1 good inroom amenities free wifi air conditioning empty fridge hairdryer safe iron lots of power sockets 2 spacious room 3 friendly staff 4 its a 5min walk to universal studios the hotel will tell you its a 15min walk and they even lay on shuttle buses seriously in order for it to take 15min youd have to crawl on your hands and knees its very quick once youre out of the building in relation to which see point 1 below bad points 1 on arrival we discovered that there is major modernisation work being carried out for 15 weeks to the lifts this caused chaos we were staying on floor 18 and it took us 20min to get out of the;3
stayed at the empire hotel nyc from 10th july 14th july 2012 taxi cost around 60 including tip from jfk airport bellboys greeted the cab and offered to carry our bags in check in was speedy we were allocated a room on floor 4 next to the elevator i was slightly worried by this but i have to say that there was no additional noise from the elevator there was however from the the large machine which our room looked out onto appeared to be powering the air con it was so loud we thought there was another air con unit on in our room having said that i got a great nights sleep so it wasnt that bad elevators are awful slow and tiny we opted to use the stairs a lot of the time as it was quicker had breakfast each day at eds chowder house was slightly worried;3
the rooms are perfectly pleasant but the wifi cuts off constantly so if youre going there to work forget it theres no coffee maker in the room and very few other amenities its pretty bare bones;3
we went to the u2 concert at msg just a 1 minute walk away and that is the main strength of this hotel the location nearly everything is in walking distance we walked to shows on broadway to restaurants and to many stores for some shopping the room on the 8th floor was very small nearly european style and the bathroom was really too small cruise ship size also because it is an old hotel the windows are not sealed so all the noice from the streets comes in at night some awful drilling going on the last 2 nights we stayed 4 nights and the room and bathroom were clean and neat nevertheless besides the excellent location we would not recommend this hotel;3
first a few positives the location is excellent minutes from two subway stops and directly across from lincoln center also we had a great room overlooking the front entrance on the second floor it was quiet as long as the window was closed but with a lovely view but really this is the cougar of nyc hotels the decor is a bit garish with extensive use of gilt and leopard prints i knew this going in and was fine with it but when you look a bit closer you notice that its got some wrinkles beneath the surface our bathroom was clean but kind of gross in that paint was chipping there were some permanent stains on the door frame and the caulking was tearing apart it could use a little tlc not a smothering of fabrics and bright colors overall a fine;3
the location of the hotel is great if you are visiting universal studio the hotel provides shuttle ride to universal city walk the stay was good overall except the wait for the checkin took forever it didnt help if you were hhonor member they just had everyone waiting in the same line they should get rid of hh sign if they werent going to use it;3
sarah provide a very good service at the check in and were very impressed by the pianist marc bausserman excellent pianist we were very disappointed by the decoration of the room the quality of food at the bar not tasty the service at the bar just the minimum the ambiance after the pianist left a cafeteria where are we definitely not at the 4 star hotel the only 4 stars are for sarah the pianist and the location;3
while the photos look great the rooms do not live up to the hype and are outdated true it is in a good place not far from times square but this hotel and others have started to charge for anything they can get away with most hotels offer free wifi but this hotel not only charges for it the problems i had connecting to the internet in the room were frequent there is a good security in place but i would recommend another hotel that doesnt feel the need to charge you for things that should be included in the room price there is a resort fee per night of 10 then tax on top they will argue you can use the gymwifi and their business centre which is a small room with 3 computers;3
just an ok place to stay nothing more im sure you could do better for the money they put us in an awful room behind reception on the first night and said before we looked that they would move us in the morning it was awful not clean dark and dingy we asked to move the next day and left our bags packed when we returned late afternoon we had a park facing room on the 5th floor which was much brighter everything a bit tired and in need of a deep clean and redecoration it was next to subway stations but location could be better and not much round about for eats and drinks you live and learn but felt safe in the area although would not stay again;3
the hotel is dated and could do with modernising the location is not too bad and it is very easy and safe to travel downtown at any time there are many stores and retails outlets and other places to hang out in the area if you want to stay local there is also a prity good cinema near 84th st central park is walking distance around the corner and is handy if you want to go for a walk the hotel itself could do with a facelift and general cleanup the staff are friendly and helpful our room was cleaned to a good standard everyday without failure i wanted another room because my room was close to the main road and was offered one almost straight away the lifts are slow and i had to go down 6 floors by the stairwell a few times the rooms are a good size and clean the;3
it is an iconic hotel in a great area but in need of a refurbishment and a good deep clean the staff are good but not great wifi was sporadic and breakfast was just ok but for a continental breakfast i feel it was really lacking in choice overall it was fine but not as good as it could be this was a business trip so i wasnt too bothered but i would not have been happy to have paid out my own money for this experience;3
browsing 100s of hotels and still being able to book a room under 250 a night i saw this one and let me tell you its not half as bad as stated here if youre looking for a cheaper hotel in a good area consider it pros both 123 and ace subway lines are around the corner deli and key west diner try pharmacysupermarket starbucks etc too spacious rooms for ny std get a kingsize opposite of central park quiet and safe area free wificoffee clean room nice view no blind walls nice and helpful doorman cons small corridors small elevators yes theyre slow wifi is done by an outside company so if its down itll stay down for hrs depending on a 2gig wifi get the sofitel for mail its fine skype way too slow check out deli at the corner sushibar across the;3
we stayed here for three nights was good enough with a clean room and good service downsides were the old slow elevators and intermittent wifi is fine for a short stay to be very close to the 96th street subway just round the corner which has a quick route up to 42nd streettimes square;3
the price we paid wasnt nearly worth the room incredibly cramped two full beds with a desk and a computer chair that couldnt budge due to the bed being right up against it regardless the location was perfect to where we wanted to go for our evening and days the uber was cheap to get tofro the train station and even then we would have walked to the train station if the weather werent so crummy the front desk was your traditional new york charm so a big rugged but she did switch our room from one bed to two beds because hotelscom messed up our reservation also our heater was set to 80 degrees fahrenheit and we kept turning it down but it wouldnt budge we tried setting it to 65 on air conditioning mode but it kept blowing hot air we eventually had;3
would have loved to have been able to rate this property higher unfortunately there are a few things that important things that outweigh the positives the positives include location to universal studios a clean room that seems to have been refurbished recently the hotel itself is clean and we received a very friendly welcome by the doorman at check in our host seemed to go through the motions of check in rather than a genuine welcome our room was clean and well appointed breakfast is expensive for what is on offer and the person at the front desk at the cafe did not respect that we were reading the menu to see what was on offer and rather spoke over us when we were deciding on our options the host was no better trying to rush us through our breakfast lunch by the pool;3
a standard room was discounted on the company site and rightly so very small room cramped bathroom poorly maintained sticking bathroom and closet doors dripping shower head unplugged and noisy inroom ac unit needed housekeepings attention mixed friendliness at reception attractive lobby area and bar;3
thanks a lot to mohamed on customer service we managed to upgrade our room to the suite which what we wanted the suite had two bathrooms as well as two rooms the downside was the bedroom was a corner room and had windows overlooking two sides of the street hence this maximised amount of noise from the sirens at night but i suppose it being ny this is expected also the bathroom had a bit droughty window and the sink did not drain very well the air conditioner was working ok until one night it stopped and became very cold in the room we managed to switch it back on alright otherwise the beds were extremelly comfortable the best beds ive ever slept in also the hotel is located in the centre of what we wanted to do as it was very close to the undeground station and;3
we checked in to the hotel around 10 pm to be told to wait for more than half an hour since the room was not ready i called beforehand to let them know that we will be there around 10 pm we were given a 60 voucher to avail during the wait but the generous voucher does not help when my old parents were tired of travelling and just wanted to check in and get some rest coffee was not refilled even after asking twice for room service there was no microwave in the room and the room was not well lit the safe was not working when we checked in ambiance in the lobby is very good there is a 24 hour cafeteria for purchasing;3
stayed here one night the hotel room was clean and comfortable and it was great to have breakfast included location is not as great as other reviews suggest good for griffith park and observatory but quite a drive from anything else parking is not free which i would expect to have included 22 we did not realise there was a pool until we were leaving which was a shame the hotel staff could have pointed this out but then we had such an unhelpful and rude receptionist which unfortunately has coloured our view of this hotel i cannot really recommend and would not return there are plenty of other hotels in la;3
great value for money good location very close to hammersmith tube stop beds are comfy and the place is clean and modern reception staff are not particularly friendly a few maintenance issues need addressing in the gents toilets on floor three the flushes werent working in the loos radiator in the room was very hot with no way to control the temperature the window blind wouldnt operate to block out the morning sun good value though at â£40 for a double room in such a good location really cannot grumble;3
the location of this hotel is unbeatable very close to universal studios and downtown hollywood however they donât over a shuttle to universal studios self parking and there is no valet place needs major remolding which they were working on during our stay rooms are very small but the restroom is good size the shower was broken in our room and leaking they fixed it the next morning in way that it is usable but still need change very friendly employees they have a laundry room which come in handy during a vacation in case you didnât pack extra outfits breakfast was horrible very untasted we tried it the first day but we skipped it then;3
my main complaint is the âresort feeâ 22us which is being charged for very standard hotel inclusions such as tea and coffee in room wifi and baggage minding i found out about this at the time of check in this is just a sneaky way of charging more per night for the hotel room i realise that lots of hotels in nyc are doing this but that does not make it acceptable the hotel location was excellent and otherwise the stay was comfortable;3
i stayed here four years ago and feel the hotel has gone downhill the air conditioning unit did not work and the bathroom door was hanging off the hinges however the staff are very friendly and helpful it is in a good location;3
this was our second time staying at this property and this time were were extremely disappointed we paid extra for a courtyard view which turned out to be a view of the concrete building next to us photo included in this review our room was at the end of a hallway that was so dark we had to use the flashlight on our phones to go down it and to hold over the lock so we could open the door the bathroom was a complete joke extremely poorly designed the toilet faced a wall in order to sit on it you had to sit awkwardly no one over 5 feet would be able to sit at it straight on there was no shower door literally there was a joke of a glass panel that covered the back half of the bathtub so when the shower was running the water sprayed all over the floor the sink;3
sonja makes a fantastic omelet best i ever had and she is so nice and funny hotel is quite alright everything you need is there nice and clean rooms pool is lovely nice breakfast nice fitness;3
when we first arrived after 20 hours of travelling we were greeted by a man on reception not a hello how are you it was just next after this it had appeared they had messed up our rooms but blamed it on our travel agents and first come first serve turns out it was the hotels fault and aside from this we had booked over 10 months in advance so this is an unfair comment prior to this i had emailed 4 months before requesting a possible room on a higher floor with a view unfortunately what we got was a level 1 view of a wall luckily we asked to change and miraculously there was a room available on level 3 which was a lot better still the same spec but it seemed a much nicer room depending what floor or position your room is it seems to be the luck of the;3
my friends i are all big gossip girl fans which is why we decided to stay at empire hotel very nice hotel when you first come in the lobby bar area is decorated well reception staff were very slow didnt really acknowledge us just went through the check in process quite robotically we had 2 rooms there were 4 of us in total 2 of us shared a double bed in a tiny little room with a view of a brick wall the other 2 had a huge room with 2 double beds a view of the street buildings out the back considering we all paid the same amount made the booking all together the hotel was clearly not full in the middle of february im not sure why it ended up this way with the rooms but its new york youre out most of the time anyway so we didnt really mind hotel;3
good location and clean rooms quirky but dark rooms and corridors and depressing communal areas air con not effective loved the location and have stayed here twice but the second time was for a longer business trip and felt too long because of overall slightly deppressing atmosphere;3
we just got back from staying here for a week i think the biggest thing to remember is that this is a hostel not a hotel if you are expecting a hotel do not stay here pros the room and the bathrooms were very clean although the cleaner smelled terrible all our clothes smelled like it the room came with a fridge which we were not expecting its in a safe area its 23 minute walk to the tube station and right next to a private school the tube station is great because it services 3 lines so you can get wherever you need to go fairly easy its about 20 minutes on the picadilly line to the center covent garden picadilly circus the pillows towels and linens were good quality cons super unhelpfulunfriendly staff there was never enough toilet paper and no;3
lili is a disgusting woman i dont know how she still works there shes very unprofessional and feels very entitled unnecessarily aggressive even before i even walked up to her and when i checked her and put her in her place to show her you cant talk to me anyhow she played the karen card keep a close eye on her shes not a good representation of the new yorker at all;3
stayed 4 nights found location great as everything we did was via the redline subway room basic lighting not great bathroom quite tired stayed in balcony room over looking courtysrd roon very hot ac didnt work great and couldnt open the balcony door due to smokers and their stinking ashtrays also the first night there was a hissing sound that seemed to be coming from the room next door not a hotel room sounded like hot water unit it had stopped after house keeping had been assumed something turned off next night it was back not loud enough to keep us awake but may be annoying to some people breakfast was basic but substantial eggs limited to one serving boyfriend wanted extra and told no next day i ordered omlet and gave to him all staff were;3
room description not accurate misleading room clean and safe no facilities ie computersbreakfst facilities or vending machine facility as a bit of a scary area after dark staff not very helpful;3
way over priced for the quality they are sticking it to customers because they can staff was great hotel was clean beds were terrible pillows not to my liking but might be fine for others too hard tv was way across the room from the bed and too small for the distance;3
i found this hotel after looking for a cheap place to stay in manhattan it is rundown and has minimal services the hallways and stairways are shabby and the elevator was more hassle than it was worth but our room was clean and roomy and our sheets were not dirty despite what other reviews report the room had a fridge air conditioner sink and tv all relatively new and functional the communal bathrooms are old but basically clean and functional except for one of the toilets on our floor that was backed up for a day but the second one was still functioning and not at all busy the laundry is in the dingy basement and requires lots of coins having said all that we barely did anything but sleep in the room as it is manhattan after all it is a great neighbourhood with easy;3
due to flight availability our family had to spend the night of feb 1 in new york as we were boarding the norwegian breakaway on feb 2 this was super bowl weekend in new york and we felt fortunate that we were able to get rooms the hotel is in the heart of china town and we were thrilled to take advantage of this fact;3
we booked for three consecutive days and planned on one more night two days later since the hotelscom doesnt allow for a split booking we tried to get the one day at the same rate from the front desk when we checked in no dice the room was clean but the lighting was very dim we booked a queen double and it came with a couch and small balcony the bathroom was small and we only had a shower my fiancee prefers a bath the free breakfast was simple but worthwhile eggs link sausage real waffles pastries canned fruit cereals juices milk and very good coffee wednesday and monday nights there is a free comedy club in the bar at least it was free the surrounding neighborhood is not extremely desirable but it is ok walking to the drugstore two blocks;3
overall a nothing bad to say desk went above and beyond used my points so room was free and cant speak on the value the guards at the elevators was quite annoying having to drop everything everytime to show i have a room key before i could pass him good security reason but still irritated me with a young daughter doing the pee pee dance;3
the jane hotel is conveniently located between the west villlage and the meatpacking district all in all the hotel was good the hotel had great cafe at the lobby level i just found the cabin rooms to be minimum 67 sqm size maybe but below the us200 room night price range its definitely the best you can get in nyc;3
me and my boyfriend made out first visit to america we went to new york for new years which was great when we booked the hotel we read the reviews on here which were rather worrying but when we arrived there the place looked small but friendly it was excellent for what we were looking for the rooms were small and quite cramped but we werent there for the hotel and we were looking for some where affordable the bed was made every day and the bathroom cleaned and maintained although the hotel isnt in the thick of the fun there is easy to use transport which we discovered on the second day we first used the taxis but found they were expensive and the drivers were really rude and hard to understand so on the 103rd street there is a subway station its 7 for a day pass which;3
the room and bathroom was clean the only thing is that the bathroom times around the tub needed new caulking;3
i was there overnight for business and only stayed at this hotel as it was close to burbank airport first off the staff was very friendly and helpful good music at the bar and the food was good however the rooms hotel decor and just functionality of the hotel were poor as others have mentioned the elevators were barely working this is an issue they are working on but 20 minutes for an elevator and lines in the lobby for the one working elevator was not ok they did get a second one working but had to have a staff member stationed in that elevator to make it function properly the rooms are old and the hallways etc feel like a dormitory i did see one of the newly renovated rooms and once done this will be a pleasant hotel until they fix the rooms and;3
we stayed here when in town to see a comedy show last december the hotel was the cheapest i could find in a decent area so thats why we booked it it wasok the room was small but of course we were in nyc it smelled a little mildewy but not bad it was fairly clean no complaints really about the room other than it was weirdly humid in the middle of winter the service wasnt great whenever we came into the lobby no one smiled and said hi even if we were the only guests there as was often the case the elevators were awful it would literally take 15 or so minutes waiting for an elevator they were so slow and broke down all of the time once we walked down the hall and saw an elevator just opening and closing when we came back 2 hours later it was still;3
i got to hang out at this hotel recently with friends we had a nice room with cool views of lincoln center the price was right about 200 a night thats pretty good for new york the showers and rooms are pretty clean the hotel needs some updating condition of rooms and hallways a little on the shabby side staff was nice the pool deck with cool views of the upper west side was too crowded the pool is really just a lap pool and the water gets dirty its also a bit of a trek to get up to the roof still id recommend this hotel if youre looking for a place with a convenient location thats not too expensive;3
fine hotel in a great area with proximity to central park dining out and the metro the empire hotel has good family rooms and although very small pool disappointment versus the website a superb and rare pool deck;3
hotel is in a great location our room was 4 hours late and then the room we got had broken air conditioner staff was nice and moved us to another room but it smelled like mildew because the ventilation in the bathroom seems to be nonexistent air conditioner super old in that room too paint in the bathroom is beginning to peel likely due to the humidity otherwise bed was comfortable and staff was generally nice but we would have expected them to be more proactive in resolving the issues which required no less than 4 visitsphone calls to the front desk we did get breakfast comped one day after we asked for it but even that took a long time to get approved by the back office;3
starting with the good reception staff were friendly and informative special mention for mohammed who was friendly professional and gave us all the information we required staff in general were helpful and friendly clean room with a very comfortable bed iron and hairdryer included together with some complimentary shampoo conditioner soap etc nice view the tick tock diner open 24 hours did some perfectly decent food which was welcome when we were jet lagged good location steps from the midtown highlights 34th st penn station tube station on the corner made getting to the museums on the upper east side and getting downtown a doddle the high line just around the corner on w30th and 10th is recommended and an easy way to walk to;3
this is a typical hilton you cant really complain but its not very charming either it is located right next to universal studios with shuttle busses making it even easier we didnt go for the breakfast or the buffet since we found it a bit overpriced but with a starbucks located inside the hotel and universal city located next to the hotel there are plenty of other possibilities;3
we have stayed at this hotel march21 through march 25 the hotel is located near the universal city that has nice city walk area and next to the universal studios hollywood park location of this hotel is really nice close to 101 highway and next to the metro station it provides good access to all la landmarks andor attractions either by metro or car we had a great food selection and good quality food at the buffet 4850 per person it works only on friday saturday and sunday i believe that the hotel and rooms are a little bit outdated at least our room and probably need some cosmetic updates to it carpet needs good cleaning wallpaper fixing our shower did not work properly at all we stayed on executive floor which is on the high floor and had a;3
the cooked breakfast was amazing perfect omelettes by hugo the room itself was nice but had a couple issues slightly musty smell but put that down to constant humidity no instructions on how to use the shower taps never seen taps like those in australia so had to call reception then my husband had to turn on for me as even with 2hands i couldnt pull the tap forward also had no hot water on our second morning took about 10 mins of running the shower for it to finally come through staff were all very friendly and the parking is 20 per night not as glamorous as i hoped it would be for the 1st nights of our honeymoon;3
i stayed here in december with family the check in staff werenât very friendly the room was nice and clean no free wifi or hotspots which is a little disappointing for such a well known hotel donât gets fooled into going to the sea food buffet we were told it was 56 a head once we got the bill it turned out to be about 90 a head that was with 3 soft drinks the food wasnât that fantastic either there was a smoking are which was good it was a seated area out of the way there is a free shuttle bus that takes you from the hotel to universal city which is handy itâs a great hotel to stay at due to the location if you want to check out universal studios for a few days;3
call for towels and other itemseach time it took 12 hours for a response one night the dinning experience was extremely slow the next night it was great internet was not free did like the shuttle service they had available slow elevators which they were working on they did let me check in early;3
i stayed at this hilton while on vacation with my college girlfriends the location was great its right near universal studios and universal city walk its an easy commute to hollywood burbank etc even during the busiest travel times we never had trouble getting to our destination the room itself was large very clean and had a nice view we were on the 5th floor overall we had a good stay but there were a few things along the way that were a little disappointing they werent deal breakers but added upthey lowered my score from a 4 to a 3 heres why we chose to self park to save a few bucks every day instead of using valet its no big deal to park in their garage there are plenty of parking places although my parking card didnt work for the first 2;3
this was or second stay at this particular hilton when we stayed here two years ago we were told at checkin that the hotel was sold out and they werent able to give us the type of room we reserved two double or queen beds we ended up with a single king size bed for my wife and me and our two kids they brought in a single cot but later took it away saying it was a fire hazard so we took turns sleeping on the couch when we checked in this time we were given a room on the second floor two floors down from the lobby it was dark depressing and literally faced the loading dock and dumpsters when we asked to change rooms we were told that we had booked a handicappedaccessible room and that all of those rooms were on the second floorand they were sold;3
despite some negative comments we booked this hotel based on price and location two rooms with different size reasonably clean not very helpfull desk lady not able to get rooms on same floor and no wilingness to look at this for the next day very good location and nice restaurants nearby;3
stayed at hilton to visit universal studios bed was comfortable location to universal studio citywalk within walking distance there is bus service every 10 min until park closes did not opt for the breakfast buffet resulting service was inept waiter didnt ceck on us or food we had to ask where it was when it arrived it was cold order wrong we complained instead of new food it went into the microway was barely warm and did i mention that my americano coffee was cold too expected more got less bar staff was good the night before should have eaten in the bar for breakfast;3
for me while the lobby was impressive the common areas and the guest room at least the one we had did not impress me we opted for the standard view room with a queen size bed 125 sq feet the condition of the room itself was ok but not great i understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic art deco style there is limited closet space and dresser space the room was about a 125 sq feet which is what they list on their website the bathroom was very small with very little space they painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling the shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature there is no mini fridge nor a microwave the common areas on floor 21 were a;3
we booked this hotel via a travel company for our school trip to new york 7th feb 11th feb after reading the reviews on this site i was very nervous to stay at this hotel me and my mates all had rooms on the 9th floor throughout our stay we had no problems with cockroaches and nobody had bed bug bites the rooms got cleaned everyday new bedding everyday too the rooms did get quite warm so we had the ac on most of the time if your looking for a hotel just to sleep in i would recommend this hotel;3
i guess this is not technically a review but wanted to give everyone a heads up the times my family and i have traveled to nyc plenty of times we have stayed at hotel riverside studios it was not a fancy hotel at allbut it suited our needs the room was always decent clean sheets mini fridge bathroom although we did have to share a bathroom with other tenants fortunately we did not experience anything extremely horrible that other visitors did it was a good place to crash at night anyway i was planning another trip out there and was trying to book a room at this place but saw that all of their dates were booked online so i decided to call and see if i could book a room the person who answered the phone told me that they were no longer allowed to rent out;3
maybe we caught the hotel on a bad week stayed 3 nights for business no heat 1st two nights bathroom sink was sloooooow to drain bug sightings in room lobby other cotravelers did not have hot water for 2 days fitness center consists of 3 aging treadmills one broken one malfunctioning the other more suited for walking not running pros staff interactions were pleasant and very helpful great location contemporary decor decent bar all said if they can work out the obvious and correctable shortcomings it would be a decent and recommendable nyc hotel;3
service charming personal but not as attentive and respectful as you can wish for i asked for an extra sheet since it was 90 degrees and i didnt want to use the blanked i had to ask three at different occations during my stay but they never gave me the sheet the absolute downside for the jane room the entire standard cabin was actually smaller than my bed at home luckily i got an amazing wiev over the hudson river but i had to sleep with my blinds open just not to get claustrophobic the room felt filthy like the dust has stuck to its walls and the red walltowall carpet for decades the highlight for the jane location superb location greenwich village with bleecker street is one of my favourite places in the world where you can simply walk the streets and;3
look beggers cant be choosers this hotel may need some work here and there but over all it was a great stay for my husband and i there was a little bit of a leak not sure if it was coming from ac or when we showered but we noticed the carpet did have a bit of a wet spot near the wall that connects the bathroom and bedroom i also would have wished there was a mirror somewhere aside from the bathroom but aside from that the bed was very comfortable the front desk staff and valet people were all gems very helpful and on top of it all my favorite part was how close it was to universal studios and the city walk we spent a whole day at universal studios and it was so nice to not have to drive in that traffic to get to our hotel we were literally on premises we also loved;3
we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights it is in a great location next to madison square gardens and penn station it is a very busy hotel the staff were friendly and some were helpful others not so the rooms were old and worn there was also a lot of noise from the corridors and the surrounding bathrooms it sounds as if the plumbing system could do with an overhaul 5 am every day;3
firstly the hotel is really quite good it provides something in which you get what you pay for the entrance is really quite grand and exotic and i was hoping the rest of the hotel would follow suit however i was shortly let down as the lifts were just so slow and very unreliable when using them the croaky set of stairs soon provided a slow and painful walk up the rooms were not too bad reasonably cramped but with good facilities a reliable alarm and air conditioning provided not the worst ever night sleep the beds werent too bad the next point is the location although the hotel itself does not serve breakfast there are planty of other bakeries and takeaways nearby it also within walking distance of the t american subway and the main street of broadway;3
stayed intown for a convention at the javitz and its great because you can walk right down there quickly the rooms on the other could be disappointing the first room we were in was a tiny tiny box with a ugly bathroom we got switched the next day to a bigger room which was fine so beware of the room size i would say ask for a bigger room if possible say i may have a third party so we may need room for a rollaway bed the rooms are not anything nice so remember that its no dream or intercontinental;3
beautifully remodeled rooms beautiful building nice staff good continental breakfast not a place to be walking out after dark especially alone i was alone on this trip and didnât even feel comfortable driving near it drug users and homeless everywhere i think you may be ok during the day but being single i did not try it also if youâd like to sleep past 630 without doors slamming constantly you should find a different hotel the beautiful heavy doors have nothing on them to keep from slamming loudly they have a sign saying to respect the others but obviously that isnât working they need to actually put something on them all in all it was a great nights sleep until 6ish ð the bed was very comfortable if you like a more firm mattress;3
i stayed there at the first week of october and i can say it is a good hotel for sleeping after a day of strolling around the city beds are comfortable and staff from the front desk is very polite nancy is adorable the rest is pretty much average nothing special few breakfast option cleanness ok location ok there is a swimming pool which is nice but thatâs it even though it is expensive it is the best you can get in la;3
its tough to find a reasonably priced hotel in manhatten we had an appointment and we found a good price for this hotel we used google street view to check out the neighborhood before booking it is semiresidential and near the subway entrance when i pulled up to try and checkin and verify where parking was the doorman was rude and ignored me but the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful and the doorman was 100 better after we had checked in there were plenty of good restaurants around the corner and a drug store next door the thalia theater and symphony space are just around the corner on broadway and we caught a nice open night for artists the room was small with no view and could really use a couple shelves or small tables the heat is from an old;3
we stayed at this hotel last year and the service has changed since last year i have emailed the hotel and as yet have not had a reply we ordered room service was read back the order and when the order was delivered one item was missions when we phoned room service we was told quite rudely that we hadnt ordered the item i said i had and was told rudely again i could have the item delivered but have to pay room service again which i refusedwe asked for the mini bar to be opened twice and it never happened i booked the room on the internet and booked a senior rate but was charged more on the final bill the bar area was laid up early evening for meals so you dont feel comfortable having just a drink its a shame because last year we had a good time at this hotel and;3
great position about 3 or 4 blocks away from subway to catch b or c trains to the top of central park small rooms but clean with nice bathrooms fresh towels and tidied rooms when you return from a hard days shopping tea and coffe availavble in the bsement room but advisable to buy some of your own milk as they ususally forget to buy somethis is handy as to buy breakfast your gonna have to walk a few blocks to get some so helps you on your way i have plenty of designer clothes and toiletries but none were stolen or used etc we did however keep money on us at all times eating before you get back is also a good idea as there are not many places to eat immidiatley close to hotel harlem is quite near but not in the direction that most tourists want to go ie shops etc be;3
this was one of those very big and very busy hotels in a very popular area right next to universal studios where you felt like a number rather than a guest whilst i expected no less than i received a solid no frills service i was left feeling a bit empty by my stay at the hotel our reason for staying here was simply to visit the theme park at universal studios the next day i could see no other reason for staying here maybe this is the reason i feel they can overcharge for food and drink and you have limited opportunity to vote with your feet and go elsewhere dont get me wrong the stay was nice the pool was great i had a really good sleep as the sound proofing must have been good i was just left feeling empty;3
a family of 2 adults were mistakenly given a 3bed room on 1st night booked for 3 nights for 2pax and was informed to move at 1145pm almost mid night due to their own front desk mistake and we refused till we can move out the next morning we were not in the room when our room was opened and a written note was found on top of the fridge scarring us both for invasion of privacy in our absence couldnt sleep till after midnight as room and window faces main road smokers chatting away below loudly and doors banging slamming from any room doors kitchen and bathroom kitchen well equipped oven hot stove microwave except for any cooking utensils good location as bus ride away from westfield shopping mall and shepherds bush and walking distance to nearest subway;3
went to ny and stayed at the empire nice room but the air was barely coming out we were out most of the day and when we came back at night it felt cool we roasted at night no air we opened the windows and because we were in the insideno air flow we went to the desk after two nights of no air and they went someone to fix it it was nice and cool when we came back in the afternoon when we got home that night still working and it died through the night we went to the desk and they called up a maintenance man this is 1230 at night the breaker was out and they couldnt transfer us to another room because they were overbooked by two rooms front desk words but he assured us he would keep checking the breaker and make sure it was on that lasted until;3
great location for our check up to mt sinai lots of nearby places to eat parking garage around the corner at a discounted price check in was greatfast and easyroom was ready early king room was fine bed comfortable and a suite area with two chairs and a desk small bathroom and old faucet fixtures in shower that were hard to use no frills here basic room not even a bedspread for esthetics but bed was very comfortable air conditioner is a window type so its a bit loud but worked fine good room even though price was still up there but less than others in the area will stay here again when need to;3
the location is great literally across the street from the lincoln center and many great restaurants we love being in that area it is less congested than times square yet you are close enough to the shows it is easier to drive to since it is upper west side the hotel itself is in need of updates but with that probably comes price increase the beds and pillows are not really comfortable but the room is a good size and the bathroom is decent great shower we love the lobby bar lots of people watching and great drinks the staff throughout the hotel is excellent if you are ok with an older hotel this would work but if you are looking for a marriott this is not for you we would stay again because the location outweighs anything we may dislike this was our;3
a few years ago i gave this place a very good review after staying in one of the large suites on a high floor planning a trip back to new york to see hamilton with a friend i called the reservation office and talked to somebody personally about booking a suite like i had before she looked at my history and saw where i had stayed i felt very confident that it would be fine to share with my friend giving her the bedroom and i would gladly take the sofa bed because the view was so great and there was a bath off the living area as i had recalled what a surprise when i checked in and got to the room on the 22nd floor they called it a suite but it was really not suitable for two people to share equally it looked like it had been two separate rooms with one door;3
we stayed at the empire hotel during ny fashion week 2011 the hotel was fully booked and very busy they had 3 models greeting guests in the lobby the models lauren brooke and man were very help maybe even more so than the hotel staff they did a great job helping the guests;3
an ok hotel it was disappointing there was no room service although the location was good not too far from the main attractions i wouldnt recommend the metro but found uber a great way to travel;3
i stayed at the ramada hollywood near universal studios for 6 nights in the month of may me and 3 other friends shared a double room and even though we were sorta nervous after reading the reviews online we went ahead and kept our reservation well first of all this hotel really isnt that bad i think a lot of the reviews are a bit on the dramtic side 1 the location yes this hotel is located in hollywood however it is not in the glam end of it i wouldnt call the neighborhood scary at all its just a hispanic neighborhood but we had no problems and ventured out often the metro line and busses are about 1 block awaythe hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots and there are city tours daily from the hotel i would advise buying a map before heading;3
we went to our room 10th floor and when we opened the door its good we didnt like small spaces as the room was so small we could only get around the bed no where to put your luggage and the bathroom was even smaller as the toilet was so close to the built in sink unit you could not sit on properly its a good job we were not big people the downstairs at night was like a cave as the lights were turned down and the bar only sold bottles which were expensive and cocktails so if you want a draught beer go out staff at desk were quite rude but the door boys and conceiage were friendly all in all a place for a stop over and nothing else;3
i think the hotel has a great sexy look nice small rooms but the room service was 70 for coffee and croissants and the pillows were horrible;3
my partner and i stayed here during winter time on a 4 day trip to new york rooms are small but clean and the central heating is nice and warm there is an air conditioning unit fitted at the window which i found a little noisy the walls are thin also and we did ask to be moved at one point as our neighbours were loud once moved we didnt have noise problems the views of central park are gorgeous especially in the snow access to down town nyc jfk were easy on the subway too nyc remains one of my favourite places on the planet and i would consider staying here again the price is good value and beats the crazy prices of other new york hotels;3
hotel has has made an attempt at modern facelift in lobby and rooms looks like its trying too hard to be modern only real complaint with the stay is its in a very busy area and windows do very poor job of keeping out the noise;3
my company was in town for the dental conference and we booked 4night stay for four employees at the normal price many people staying in that hotel got our rooms for cheaper not only were the rooms very small almost closet sized space but when i went to front desk to ask for a double bed room or an upgrade the management and front staff were the worst now i know never to use this hotel to book my employees ever again thank you for the bad experience;3
this was my second time staying at the astor you can scroll down for my initial review i wont rehash the same things that i wrote about it as not much has changed but this time i was in a much less renovated room this room was a little bigger though not by much but less fancier it clearly has not gone through their renovation process it also had a door leading to a rooftop the door was locked from the inside as i wanted badly to climb out to the roof if they could fix that roof and the room then theyd have one heck of a premiere room i took photos of the door and the view this room was in need of new paint and the bathroom was moldy but it was still fine it was definitely a little cleaner i didnt find any hairs they still dont have free wifi cmon;3
i had good expectations of this hotel with its 4 status but i was really disappointed the check in process was slow and although i was prewarned about charges on arrival it was a big chunk of money to pay for 2 rooms for 3 nights still waiting to see if the refund arrives as promised the room was the most disappointing old and dated and not enough space to swing a cat two people in the room with nowhere to store suitcases meant there was no space to move small bed although comfortable and very noisy air conditioning the bathroom was tiny and needed updating a lot of noise came in from the streets 25 floors below however the big selling point for this hotel is its location it is right in the centre of the tourist area with empire state times square and;3
the hotel is in a great location but itâs very outdated especially the bathrooms i donât think iâve seen bathrooms that looked as old as these the single queen room is extremely small also this is a 4star hotel so i expected much nicer and more updated rooms for the cost;3
the most memorable thing about the hotel was that the service staff always seemed to be busy and swamped be it at check in or check out or even a phone call to the front desk which they hung up by accident and i had to redial the staff were always asking guests to wait and they looked understaffed as a result unsurprisingly service was just functional getting an interconnected room meant being able to hear noisy neighbouring guests the room was spacious and decently comfortable the hotel is located about a 10minute walk away from the theme park there is a shuttle bus but it is always full so no point waiting for it;3
stayed here last week the website photographs of the hotel are very deceiving the rooftop pool was no bigger than a bath and the rooms are in serious need of updatingredecorating wallpaper coming off of walls aircon unit rusty and paint coming off of bathroom door and bubbling cracking of the wood the shower in the was amazing though very powerful and easy to use toilets on mezzanine floor were disgustingly dirty so more attention needed in this area arrived at 830 pm and decided to have a look around area nearby checked in at 1030 pm given card key to room and couldnt access room spent ages waiting in lobby for securitymaintenance to fix the door so not a great start very very expensive mini bar they state they will remove items from mini bar;3
lets start with the good shared facilities were always kept very clean location was great for highline greenwich village and not too far from underground bad bunk rooms were so tiny our cases took all floor space aircon was noisy and the room v stuffy without it on felt very claustrophobic;3
confirm that your room will have lighting to see and an outlet or docking station for phone etc lamps and bed tables are featured in every photo onlinealso bathroom was dated and housekeeping left a crib in our room;3
my friends and i stayed 2 nights at astor over memorial day weekend for about 200night at the time the average going rate for a decent hotel in manhattan was at least 250 so we decided to save some money and chance it what i can tell you is you get what you pay for we booked the stay online and got confirmation of a room with 2 double beds when we arrived we were forced in to a room with just 1 double bed as the receptionist said they were overbooked so we decided to camp up in the unacceptably small room on the 7th floor for 3 people while we worked on getting the room we were actually confirmed for ended up being room 702 the doorman was very nice in bringing our luggage up to the room and ended up helping us get the room we needed with 2 double beds the;3
i stayed in this hotel last summer because i got an awesome deal during peak season i paid half of what i would have paid if i had stayed in midtown manhattan though it is not a four star hotel it provides comfort and cleanliness they provide internet access and vending machines there is a convenience store a short distance away the store also serves bagels and sandwiches i was a little concerned about the location before my stay my mom and i found it to be a safe and quiet area we were able to get buses and trains to midtown without a problem honestly i would stay at this hotel again i loved being right across the street from the beautiful central park it is very quiet at night which makes it easy for sleeping i have stayed in midtown and i found that;3
the hotel was ok the rooms are a bit small but we dont spend much time in the room so guess so no big deal beds are a bit hard so overall could have been more comfortable nicole at the front desk was amazing she gets an a paying for parking is ridiculous and should be included in the stay since the price per night is above average already for such a small room;3
arrived at the new yorker hotel and i am very disappointed so far staff at front desk not exactly welcoming or even helpful a touch rude to be honest once arrived told we have to pay an extra fee for the honour of using the wifi phone calls and gym none of which we need but not optional i wouldnt class this hotel as spotless in anyway its quite dated shabby to say the least in many areas and as for the room queen with a view dont bother no coffee machine no fridge unless you want to pay an extra 65 dollars a day lets see how the rest of the week goes;3
the hotel is a few streets from harlem but the area itself is just opposite central park and quiet and we felt very safe we stayed in room 309 and had a view of central park i reckon any room number ending in 06 07 08 or 09 will have a view of the park other rooms look onto a crappy courtyard we were just 2 mins walk from the subway a b c lines we had a double room which was nice and clean comfy bed great shower tv some rooms have a dodgy reception and our room cleaned every day the only negative things were that we could hear the room next door when people are walking around as the floors seem to be thin also there was a wet patch of water coming through our celing on the first night from the bathroom above but we informed reception of this and;3
we stayed at the empire for its convenience to lincoln center however the room was tiny and the bathroom was so small there was nowhere to rest a toiletry kit except the floor the controls on the heating unit were unfathomable my wife and i could not figure out to turn on the shower we called the front desk who said they would send someone up after about a half hour and another call my wife finally pushed on the handle with all her might and it started working really at this price;3
hotel is perfectly located near to central park and major attractions the standard queen room was clean and tidy but very small and right next to the service shutes outside so was very noisy we asked to be moved which we were eventually on the second day of our stay however all standard queen rooms have windows out to the service shutes so all suffered with the same noise conditions i feel this should have been mentioned in the room dsciription as it was quite significant and the rooms arent cheap unfortunately the pool deck was closed for the entirety of our stay too due to flooding the week before and we were not forewarned about this so could not change our hotel choice pasquale did give us free wifi access fonthe final two days of our stay ask an apology for the;3
i was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews for this hotel but i arrived the welcome was good went up to the room room was ok a bit out dated being an old hotel didnt find any nasty surprises good location subway outside laundrymat out the front phamacy and store just down stairs i enjoyed my say there and would stay again the only thing the ac did make a bit of a racket;3
check in check out and luggage collection staff were excellent efficient helpful professional friendly and polite room was very clean comfortable spacious and well equipped location as discovered on a previous visit was ideal for our needs the visit to the restaurant was a huge disappointment it was 845pm and we hadnt reserved a table so had no problem with the 30 minute wait for our table once seated we were left for at least 15 minutes with no assistance at all two waitresses kept wandering around occasionally serving other guests but not busy or rushed and it was impossible to catch their attention without shouting my husband approached the supervisor who not politely in my opinion said they were busy not and doing their best if so oh dear;3
rooms tiny with no space to unpack and very noisy however they were clean rooftop bar and pool closed due to renovations which we had been assured would be done prior to our arrival lobby beautiful and a great location;3
a group of us stayed here on saturday night as a part of my sisters bachelorette weekend we booked 2 rooms and arrive around noon to hang out by the pool our rooms werent ready which was fine because we headed to the rooftop although we didnt reserve a space we did find a couch and a couple tables to take over the pool is very small and covered so the water was cold but nice for refreshing dip the drinks are of course overpriced as are the snacksfood we were told by an employee that we couldnt have any outside food or drinks on the rooftop and that was the last we saw of anyone nobody came up to see if we wanted a drink or food we had to keep going down to the bar to order and get drinks but they didnt hesitate to automatically add gratuity to the tab for doing;3
i would stay here again if only for the location to universal and even at that id look around first check in was very slow and our room wasnt ready we stored our luggage of note when we came back and the porter took the luggage out of storage for us he put it on a cart he just stood and watched me unload the cart by myself then put his hand out for a tip and left the hotel for the park the have a shuttle that takes you to city walk but it is a very close walk about 10 min but it is not an easy walk for many the first long section of your walk is through the quite large smoking allowed area outside the hotel it is disgusting this forces you to go around and walk in the street for a good bit with the cars you walk a little further then have to climb a set;3
a the hotel is little run down very small room but good value comfortable enough with a friendly staff and a great location great neighborhood because of price and location we will probably go back;3
the hotel was clean enough and had adequate accommodations but the price doesnt match what they provide i expected a higher end hotel for what i paid the cost of breakfast was 35 per person which is way too high i am used to having breakfast included in the price of a hotel so this was a steep extra cost to an already expensive hotel also there is nothing nearby to give you options for food it is close to the airport which is why i chose this hotel;3
room is indeed very small service is at good and friendly level water on the room for free but not the bottle sanitary is clean and well working location is very central lots of nice shops and food;3
we stayed here for 3 nightsthe first night we changed rooms as the carpet was saturated and smelt bad also there was a motor of some kind right at our window and the noise was pretty bad that night my friend and i had to share a bed as there were no other rooms we finally got a decent room with 2 beds but it was small water cost 8 a bottle and coffee was 3 a pod bathroom was the size of a closet it was in a great location and we recieved 2 free breakfasts each and did not have to pay for the first night staff were helpful and nice i would stay again if for a short stay;3
the hotel has great location next to central park metro station is 5 min walking the rooms are small and very basic after reading some reviews i realized that our room was one of the worse 211 and actually one of the smallest but since we were busy with exploring nyc we never asked to change the problem was that we were staying in february and it was really freezing and the rooms were not ready for such cold it was deadly cold and only hot shower was saving us though it is worth to mention that the stuff was trying to help as much as they could in those extreme temperatures 18 and so on and provided us with heater but the windows are just an entrance for all the wind and cold the room is so small that you cant be anywhere away from the window and in anyway you;3
if it were not for the worst beds known to man this hotel would receive a 5 star easily we were checked in and out by majid who was the best first impression any hotel could get majid was customer service personified he did everything allowable to support a family with two small children we have been coming to new york city for 15 years this month i decided to quit my job and could no longer stay at our normal hotels if not for the beds this would have been a low cost option perfect location to central park times square and 5th avenue shopping pros location location location around the corner from the brooklyn diner pazza notte the russian tea room and so close to nearly everything cleanish the beds the sinks and the tubs were clean i may;3
good service really bad touristy location i guess thats not bad for the majority of the people choose to see most of the sights midtown to me is extremely noisy scummy and overcrowded aside from the noise outside while in my room on a daily basis the neighbors above were literally stomping and slamming to the point where it would not relent and i would be woken up without being able to go back to sleep i called the front desk and respectfully stated that the noise was occurring a few minutes later a member of their security staff came to my room to verify this and went upstairs to handle the situation the noise was reduced the next day it continued and i didnt want to bother the staff anymore it may be the structure of the place as well but ive;3
we checked into this hotel after a disasterous first night at an airbnb apartment the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel itself a little tired and could do with a good fresh up but the rooms were tidy bedding clean and showers good as we only used it as a base it was fine 10 minute walk from central park and two minutes from the subway no restaurant or bar but very good coffee shop across the road;3
well myself and my partner stayed at hotel riverside for a week although the hotel is tired looking its actually comfortable when we first entered the room on the fourth floor it was a little scruffy dirty marks all over the walls and the floor had not seen a vacuum for at least 34 days but there was fresh sheets and towels and although the shared bathrooms where dirty this was because we arrived late and actually the next morning they were relatively clean either way it was cheap and cheerful the staff were ok although we had very little to speak to them about when we did they were helpful as previously mentioned it is very close to 72nd street which has a subway taking you around manhattan and no sign of bed bugs which i was dreading the room actually grows on you;3
usually the service is seamless and the rooms are clean with everything working however recently there are problems at late evening check in where world of hyatt expedited check in is not available i have had to wait in line behind people with complex problems who take more than a half hour to finish their business while my check in takes 2 minutes at most as a tired traveler with only a few hours to sleep before getting back to the airport this is upsetting on this visit the room was not as clean as usual and the phone was not working;3
we spent a few nights here the promo photos are very deceiving the hotel is very dated it is in need of a serious makeover to bring it up to speed the bed felt like a rock and pillows are flat the power points were loose in the walls and sparked and one just stopped working the elevator is so so so slow and the whole hotel had mothymusty smells although it is a short walk to the metro and only 4 stops away from the chinese theater and the 2 girlsnicole was one at the front desk were always cheerful and very happy to help you get what you pay for;3
very good location in nyc metro station is just around the corner friendly staff that helps walking distance to boardway musical can walk back after shows will certainly come back and stay at this hotel again;3
me and my girlfriend stayed here last summer for 5 days the one thing we could not fault was the location its a great area with lots going on and the irish pub around the corner was brilliant we did have some problems with our neighbours who were very loud all night drinking with loud music the walls are very thin so we did not sleep at all after complaining about this twice during the night nothing was done the receptionist in the morning was a lot more helpful and put us in a new room which was great and peaceful after a busy daynight in new york if you are like us and just want a clean room with all the basics you need to crash at the evening then for the price it is perfect close to the subway and shops and the majority of staff were very nice just cross your;3
the first room we were assigned wasnt clean and they promptly switched our room the second room was clean and perfect for a quick stay in the heart of new york city i would surely stay there again if i had to stay in manhattan particularly at the managers special rate offered on the hotel website the parking garage was a couple of blocks away and offered a special 35 nightly rate for hotel guests a good deal all around;3
the wny is in an excellent location 5 minutes walk from the empire state building we had a view of it from our room also walking distance to times square and madison square gardens and macys is literally a block away central park is a 2 subway ride away on arriving we had to wait 5 hours for our room to be ready and having booked a 3 person room for 3 adults we got 2 queen beds not great when travelling with your 17 year old son and 17 year old step daughter so i had to share a bed with my son complained to reception and was told hotel fully booked nothing they could do bathroom although fully functional and clean was tiny you literally couldnt swing a cat extra charges were everywhere to leave your cases until room was ready was 5 per bag to collect cases was 5;3
we stayed several days at this hotel in february 2013 first be forewarned that photos on the hotelâs web site make the hotel look much better than it actually is although i can of course see the point in hiring a good photographer we both thought that whoever was hired to decorate missed the boat for example the lobby it is a tall and narrow space its african motif and tacky furniture might have worked had the walls been painted in light shades and perhaps by adding large mirrors instead everything is done in severely dark tones rendering the already narrow space appear even narrower the lobbyâs lighting is very poor even at midday so that even just reading the newspaper or a map is a challenge and there is annoying music playing nonstop in short the;3
location is in a crappy part of town rooms were dingy and not particularly clean service was fine and security was in place to get to elevators price not out of line but still with taxes over 300 no fault of the hotel but it was 94 degrees outside which didnt add to the ambience in the area;3
this stay was initiated by a nice coupon the hotel itself is lovely its location is great the room especially the bathroom was on the small side but we had a great view of columbus circle it was well kept and elegant for what we got as a reasonable price;3
the room was adequate it was not one of the renovated roomsold carpeting and the original bathroom;3
super close the universal studios grab a quick snackbreakfast at the coffee shop and walk to the studios in under 10minutes we did with an 8 and 10yearold in tow nice walk through the garden terrace and across a walking bridge there is also a shuttle it is also close for drives down sunset through beverly hills and up to mulholland drive as well as the griffith observatory and hollywood boulevard including chinese theater and walk of fame rooms are spacious clean and decoratedfurnished adequately for the price but require some updating there are few plugin to recharge devices and not a usb socket to be found one receptacle already had 4 or 5 plugs in it hotcold water is an issue in the shower only likely not a plumbing issue but a faucet issue the;3
lili is a disgusting woman i dont know how she still works there shes very unprofessional and feels very entitled unnecessarily aggressive even before i even walked up to her and when i checked her and put her in her place to show her you cant talk to me anyhow she played the karen card keep a close eye on her shes not a good representation of the new yorker at all;3
this is a good basic hotel with a great location id normally rate this as a great budget find but unfortunately i cant give it a good review because of the customer service the door to my hotel room was left visibly open for about 12 hours after it was cleaned until i returned not very comforting to happen in any big citythe room was in front of the elevators so it was easy to see the door was ajar and open anyone could have walked in when i mentioned this to the manager she politely acknowledged that it shouldnt have happened but didnt go out of her way to take my concern seriously compensate for it or give me any reason feel inclined to be a return clientall that was offered was a breakfast voucher for an underwhelming cereal spread there are lots of;3
confusing this is listed as and the sign said abercorn house first impression is things are tight they take cash only wifi 1 quid for an hour the reception is behind glass only two small slots for taking cash it communicates unfriendlinessunsafe area key deposit 5 quidsthe place is inhabited mostly by longterm workers the first two floors have just been remodeled freshly painted and sparkling clean when i was there for four nights there were no construction noise early in the morning although works were still been done on the upper floors this is not the place to meet people a few times i peeped into the tvcomputer room only a couple of unfriendly guys appeared to be workers were there four of the six computers were broken soda machine were broken i;3
we went to astor on the park dec 8th 2012 for 3 nights staythe hotel is located north part of central park on the west side between 106th 107th street facing the parkthe hotel is very basic and need of updating especially the interior as it is a bit drab and datedthe room is small but clean and has the basics tv bathshower but no teacoffee facilities there is no bar or any drink eating facilities within hotel the price for room was very cheap compare to other hotels more nearer to midtown where the shops times square rockerfellas etc are located so you need to either take cab 1015 or subway 225 one price anywhere to get to there we only used the room for sleeping really left at 8am and got back about midnight so room was ok as we spent;3
the location is great the bed and the bathroom were clean yet the floor was really dirty also our room was out on the stairway which the receptionist didnt mention and we had to look for the room for awhile it was really cold at night and we didnt have a blanket or a duvet the problem was the windows through which a lot of cold got in;3
our first thought was oh god no but honestly give this place a chance our room was always super clean thanks to the great lady who clearly appreciates her job and therefor reflects it in her service peeps at the counter were not always super friendly but hey if u know the hospitality industry u will understand why coffee was great and if u are on holiday u are only there to sleep and shower so who gives a cr i give this place a thumbs up for anyone visiting nyc on a tight budget ps great area not to loud but not too quiet either thank u morningside inn we had a great time;3
big international hotel but five people left me messages not one came to me no continental breakfast only a big expensive brunch upstairs on roof terrace when i complained i was told try breakfast next door;3
this hilton is conveniently located at the universal city walk shops restaurants and is on the adjacent property of universal studios hollywood you definitely pay for the great location but the quality of food and very basic accommodations donât support the rate the support staff bellhop valet androom service crew are helpful friendly however the front desk and restaurant service staff are unprofessional and lack service skills iâve stayed here on multiple occasions and itâs consistent;3
recent stay in nyc for business and was put up at this property location lobby restaurants are fantastic rooms are subsuboptimal first extremely small and hard to navigate literally could not open my bathroom door more than 12 way due to towel rack behind it who does that and hallwaysroom were in desperate need of refreshing sink did not drain properly and had to watch to avoid overflow did alert staff butview of times square was awesome and the bed was very comfy allowing a few good hours of sleep following a very delayed flightarrival staff are usual perfectionists expected for this area and quite helpful if you just need a well located flop space this will serve well could not imagine staying more than 1 day in the room;3
the good we did a two day as universal studios ticket the property is a short walk from universal studios and all universal shopping eating areas right outside now everything else the property is showing its age as noted by others the lobby area has some construction going on the elevators were very slow we had change rooms because the shower valve was broken for which no one noted apologized for the carpets are worn and wallpaper is in bad repair the property really just needs to updated and refreshed;3
the positive thing is the location in the universal city walking distance from the theme parks one room was ready the second one we had to wait for about 20 minutes they dont provide bottled drinking water bathroom roped only provided for executive rooms and was not there we had to ask for it the reception staff were good and smiling however the other staff need to learn how to smile the breakfast food selection was very limited and expensive the wifi is not free in the rooms the rooms cost are high compared to the services provided it really not worth the money paid;3
great location rooms and bathroom small in need of refurbishment and a good cleanvery busy area of the city near to lincoln centre good outdoor music venue and close to the park not many places to eat in local vicinity of a reasonable price range all top end price tags major plus for the hotel is their staff all friendly helpful and polite thanks to yuri and holly at reception;3
after reading the reviews prior to our departure i wanted to cancel the reservation i am so happy we didnt as i read the recent posting from oct 16 to the 21 i am truly questioning as to whether these guests stayed at the the same central park tempo apts as we did as the description was an opposite of our experience our apt was on the 9th floor we arrived about 2 hrs before check in and were told there was no room for our luggage in the holding room but our room was ready the apt was relatively clean the hallway was clean with carpets the sofa bed was fine but could have had a thicker mattress and been a bit wider we laughed calling it the virgin bed the shower was powerful the tv great ok the fridge defrosted itself and they cleaned up the water;3
although the hotel itself is nice and offers a great location please beware of the pricing bait and switch where your reservation price is not honored upon your arrival and they present you with a rate increase at the front desk far too late to do anything about ac didnt work and toilet overflowed not a good representation of a hilton hotel of this expected caliber;3
200night is alot but apparently good for nyc staff was great excellent restaurant recommendations and transportation advice bathroom had been recently renovated the towels were clean but worn and torn however these were thicker than some new towels at other hotels the room was dated and small but bed was very comfortable not far from subway and across from central park great little restaurants and cafes were within walking distance there is only 1 small elevator and it is slow if climbing stairs is a problem get a lower floor;3
rooms were extremely small and somewhat outdated i was expecting small as its nyc but much smaller than other hotels ive stayed at in the city with hardly any room to walk around when your luggage is open;3
having read good reveiws about the hotel we were disappointed when we stayed there for 2 nights recently our bedroom was at the back and was described asquiet in fact it overlooked a noisy ventilator and we could see into the bedrooms opposite the small breakfast room had a poor selection of food choices i suppose most people went out on the plus side the staff were helpful and pleasant and the hotel is in a great position for central park and broadway pity about the room;3
i was hopeful that this would be a great experience but the cabin rooms are super tiny i was just one person staying in a bunk bed cabin room and there was literally just a few feet of space between the door my feet and my luggage the bathrooms arent wellmarked and i didnt know this was a hot spot for college kids with a partyevent in the lower ballroom im glad i only booked one night but you do get a chance to be in the west village at a deep discount if youre looking for a place to just drop and sleep this isnt so bad but dont expect the beds to be super comfy;3
tiny rooms chaotic elevators fantastic views incredible location close to subway and hotspots macdonalds starbucks and cvs in front very clean cheap for the zone crowded we were 4 in the room and is difficult to live with that space;3
this hotel is located in chelsea the room where i stayed was really tiny looked like a boat room still it was confortable free wifi no breakfast luggage storage service shared bathroomsshowers were clean and unisex the price is good for new york standards expansive if you think about what you get;3
positives my daughter and i shared a private room with two twin beds and private bathroom with shower room was clean beds reasonably comfortable location in hammersmith was excellent walk to many shops kings court mall pubs places to eat tube station less than 5 minutes walk price was best we could find negatives staff is downright surly and rude be prepared not to be given any information about how to find your room or hostel amenities and you may even get yelled at we were also room is very noisy doors are constructed in such a way that each time they are opened or closed it sounds like slamming doors this happened throughout the night made it really hard to get any sleep also housekeeping vacuums at 8 am in hallway right outside your door no free;3
many problems that should not exist in a hotel in this price category 1 internet access was among the slowest of any hotel ive stayed at really really bad so bad i gave up 2 could hear my neighbors speaking even in hushed voices next door this could be because there was a halfinch gap under the door between our rooms seriously in a businessclass hotel room 3 the thermostat had absolutely no effect on the temperature so the room was a freezer the whole time i was there it just kept cranking out cold air even when i set the temperature super high 4 unlike most businessclass hotels this hotel does not assign rooms for highlevel elite guests like me your status means nothing in getting you a decent room its just first come first served so despite;3
as we booked a room for four adults we were shocked at the tiny tiny bathroomive been in showers bigger than the whole bathroom so it didnt matter that there was no lock on the door as you could hold the handle while seated on the loo the check in was fast efficient and friendly pool was a bit of a hikeacross the car park but nicely shielded with greenery and lovely loungers with abundant towels to use there breakfast was good nice staff and plenty of choicecups were old though and we noticed lots of guests chose to use disposable beakers hotel is well located near the metro for down town or great universal studios all in all this hotel served our purposes but it does need a facelift and modernisation;3
the empire hotel is situated at the most awesome location the location is secret gem across the street for the lincoln center it is northwest of the epicenter of nyc but in the best way possible this location rocks as for the hotel good location priceline gives this 4 stars which is a bit generous 335 at best our opinion but many great features the lobby bar is nice with friendly people and lots of ambiance the rooftop pool bar was too noisy for us old people on a saturday night but ok on off night like monday jazz the bed linens were crisp and the bed as awesome slept like a baby the noise is easily heard for the street 7th floor but only a poblem for light sleepers i kinda like the city noises the housekeeping ladies were a bit amazing you;3
a block from the abc subways so that was handy when we arrived late in the eveningthat said it was not the most inviting lobby butaverage the clerk was polite up on to third floor extremely dingy hallway both walls odor carpeting room tiny with very poor lighting and one desk light had a broken bulb toobathroom clean although the tub constantly dripped all night shower pressure adequate the tub itself was miniscule but it held water at least tv had one channel working only and no wifi in the room even for cellular phone data our connections showed daysinn94 and then it would disappearonly to connect to an adjacent hotel newton but one couldnt use that due to needing their passwordthat is so frustrating since the lobby clerk;3
me along with my 4 friends planned to visit universal studios on our way back from sandiego after good reviews on ta the good price i recommended them to book this hotel of course the name also played a role if you are in hollywood stay in hollywood hotel d the property seemed bit old especially the elevator was like thousand year old the rooms were clean and well equipped and pretty big checking process wasnt very comfortable we were denied free parking which was promised from the hotel booking site and also the extra bed for one friend which was sorted out after showing the voucher wasnt very happy with the staffs behavior bed was comfortable there was coffee maker iron refrigerator hair drier etc were in room for the price it seemed;3
location was great for going to universal city and for using the metro rail to downtown los angeles we parked our cars upon arrival and never needed them again until our departure prices are very high for rooms and for parking;3
hotel has a beautiful lobby and great location across from lincoln center two blocks from central park it has a rooftop bar with a tiny pool and outrageously priced drinks the rooms are very small but its nyc and thats expected the lobby bar featured on gossip girl is very cool looking and there is a constant stream of people traffic throughout overall my family and i were happy and had a great visit to nyc;3
the hotelâs location is very central right across from the street from madison square garden rooms are clean and comfortable unfortunately i found a few staff members to be lazy and rude both times i stayed in the new yorker the transportation manager john who booked cabs for guests spoke to all guests not just me with sheer arrogance upon booking my taxi by card he literally threw it across the counter back at me any small questions i asked were answered with a tone that he was being inconvenienced by simply having to do his job in a nutshell he was full of his own selfimportance;3
i stayed here because of location matched with fair pricing the room was ample enough doormen were friendly and helpful front desk wasnt unfriendly but not cheerful or welcoming room had a major cold draft from the heatac unit heater was very noisy and we couldnt keep a constant temp in the roomalways too hot or too cold bottom line i would stay here again;3
my boyfriend and i stayed at the empire hotel from 26th to 31st july 2015 having booked the hotel in februarymarch 2015 i think we booked this before we even booked our plane tickets now being a massive gossip girl fan xoxo i was so excited about staying here following a week long stay in san diego where our hotel did not cost half as much but wasnt meant to be anything fancy anyway i had high hopes for this place but boy was i disappointed upon arrival the person who checked us in on the front desk was so unfriendly but i wasnt too bothered as i was tired and just wanted to get to the room the room itself was fine except everything had a ridiculously high price tag on it 8 for a small bottle of evian and 4 for some inroom coffee which is ridiculous as;3
we had big reservations about this hotel because of the poor reviews and trailfinders contacted them before we arrived doormen are very scruffy but friendly told our room wasnt ready but they would expedite the cleaning and to come back which we did 5 hours later only to be told still not ready eventually they said it was ready but they had to check it over by this time nearly 7pm we had no kettle cups and saucers or glasses in the room we were supposed to drink the complimentary wine from cardboard cups this took no less than 4 visits to reception to rectify they said they had a no chinaglass policy in the rooms this is supposed to be a 4 hotel took even more visits to reception to get teaspoons and then they bought a dessertspoon and a soup;3
perfect for the traveler that wants to get a feel for the classic art deco hotel that youve seen in all the old movies i believe part of the hotel has been updated unfortunately part of it has not and thats where our room was windows were very drafty and privacy in each room is minimal doors opening and closing in hallways sounded like someone was entering your room deadbolt on door alleved that slight panic each time we had an amazing view of empire state building and enjoyed the very ny style tick tock diner for breakfast off the lobby would stay there again but may ask for one of the newer rooms next time;3
overall all ratings about average rooms small but adequate checkin and checkout were fairly long waits concierge was great location was terrific easy to get around would recommend if you dont plan to stay in the hotel much;3
i enjoyed my stay at the empire as i attended a conference at lincoln center it was so worth the to stay steps away from the campus however the room was very small the bathroom extremely small and the room just couldnt cool down for me in the middle of a cold spell during april otherwise the hotel is clean pretty cozy and very comfortable i stayed by myself and felt very safe too the staff is exceptionally friendly they need to bring the price down on valet parking too and one should not have to pay for coffee pods and i was given a password for wifi but not the name of the network;3
i would totally hook up with the jane every time i was in nyc i love the wes andersonesque regal oddity and unremitting charm of getting your big brass key from the reception and the magnetic allure of cafe gitane i really wish i could handle the tiny rooms and punishing themostats from the moment i looked at it online i was smitten the location is great and rooms seemed adequate i had a captains room which means an en suite bathroom as i was travelling for work i should have thought to ask for a desk that said the room was approximately bedsized so not sure where that would fit the bathroom featured a great shower with nice pressure and plenty of hot water the sink however was so tiny that i kept bumping my elbows on the shower wall as i brushed my teeth;3
worst hilton ive stay at so far the breakfast buffet was disgusting and the food was old the room was mediocre and i was charged for a microwave which was pretty ridiculous i would definitely not stay at this hotel again i would choose the sheraton universal next time;3
hotel is tired but under renovation arrived from australia after 15 hr flight at 930am to be told no early checkin wasnt happywas told room be ready at 2pm room was comfy and looking over court yard ac was noisy turned it off at night alot of homeless around but harmless metro rail has a 7 day card use as much as you like in 24 hrs for groceries walk 10 minutes north on vermont to jons grocery store has all you need;3
description of service the only service offered by the hotel is laying of bed change of towels all services mentioned in the brochure were not there no entertainment of any sorts the public relation is not cordial;3
ok hotel nothing to write home about the elevators werent working my last day there and there were no signs directing you on how to get down to the lobby they were out for at least 6 hours our room keys stopped working twice over 4 days they said they demagnitized but ive never had this problem at other hotels this was especially annoying on the last day when i had to take a second trip down the stairs to get a new key the room was updated but the bed was uncomfortable and the walls were very thin the bathrooms were very small the lobby bar was nice the hotel is in a convenient location and close to a subway which was great;3
no comments as a returned customer i was expecting at least the same service as the previous stays it was not the case room was not refreshed on the second day nor the bathroom the bed was not made the ac automatically shuts off in the middle of the night etc;3
the room 1218 was very small for 3 young adults dark room rubbish lighting with an awful view of a wall and very very very hot and stuffy the air con gave us sore eyes and throats and awful humming noise 247 we was pretty much itchy the whole time we was in the room too;3
a budget hotel but great staff and clean rooms decor in the room was basic but comfortable ideal hotel for those on a budget the hotel is on central park west and 106th so it is quite a way up on the park but take a walk down central park west and enjoy the sites or catch the train from 103rd i enjoyed my stay here it was warm comfortable and i felt safe couldnt ask for more;3
we booked 6 days through agodacom the payment was meant to be made at the hotel when we reached the hotel there was a booking but was told that no room rates were contained in the booking and that we will have to pay a much higher rate there were room discounts on the hotel websites however we later produced a copy of booking information and an email from agodacom mentioning the correct rate however the hotel manager on duty refused to accept it my credit card was charged arbitrary rates for the six days when i went to return the keys before leaving i saw another customer arguing with the counter staff on a similar issue the hotel is in a good location hence use it by all means but be aware of the trick and use a good website and take up the option of advance;3
booked two nights at this hotel on priceline i expected the room to be small but it was much smaller than i expected the bathroom was even smaller and outdated the shower went from hot to warm to cold to scolding and back every few seconds which wasnt really an enjoyable experience the bed was extremely uncomfortable the one great thing about this hotel was the location absolutely in the centre of everything quick 510 min walk almost anywhere and literally right next to the subway they also charge a rather large daily fee for internet business centre and gym;3
just returned from five nights at the hotel the first night was given a room no 1109 that should be turned into a storage area moved to a very nice room for the following nights with the street view as we had requested when we booked six months in advance the room attendants are not very efficient had to call down twice for towels etc as to the room even some of the staff agree that the bathrooms although clean are badly designed as to shower the flat bowl sinks and inadequate shelf space location is just across lincoln center great location close to the subway restaurants and sightseeing;3
small room of course in nyc the bathroom was tiny and a outdated no way to turn on the shower without getting wet and the room worn and even a bit dirty feeling the best parts were the lobby and bar they were nice and staff almost friendly better than a typical low end chain more charm about 350 a night;3
hotel is nice but very worn down as everythign in hollywood ca is ofers a decent breakfast in the mornings before you off to work but the attendant is never on time so you will be late for work each room seems to have its own character and is clean but worn down in structure;3
actully everything was nice location is good lovely bars and restaurants around staff is nice elevator but something with plumbing water in wc time after time there is terrible sound from water coming from somewhere acoustic is low so you cant sleep there is kitchen also just no dishes at all so you cant prepare food or even teacoffe otherwise price is very good for what you get very good that wc is inside room we came from europe adaptation period is longer so it is good if you have more comfort thank you;3
do not come here on a weekend in october unless you can fly on a broom i had a reservation but could not get near the hotel after trying and being locked in traffic for 15 hours i finally called and asked to move to another hilton they finally let me without a penalty because i was hilton honors after the halloween thing was over it became reasonable place i stayed here because it was near my sons house this is best for families who want to tour the universla studio no spa nor any spa services nearby pool looked nice but it was cold and rainy when i was here mostly families and people here for conventions;3
for what i paid i could have stayed in a midtown hotel nonetheless it did its job as far as the location its a bit out of the way if you want to see all of the attractions although its only a short walk to the park there are plenty of places to eat nearby but its a good ten minute walk to the lively bars on amsterdam avenue the room was a bit small compared to what weve been used to but it was okay the reception staff were friendly and helpful although the cleaning staff were a bit noisy in the corridors on a morning which might not have gone down too well with anyone nursing a hangover even so i quite enjoyed my stay at this hotel and in the upper west side area this might not be the ideal location for everyone however for anyone that wishes to escape the;3
great location literally right opposite central park and the stars were really friendly and helpful the room was clean which is the main thing it was a pretty small room but absolutely fine if youâre just sleeping there the bed was comfy and the shower was good the downsides were 22 per night fee for having water and wifi which isnât an option so you may aswell use them there was no safe in the room our blind was broken the ac was constantly clicking and making noises and one afternoon when we came back to rest for a while there were builder right outside our room laying a new carpet so all we heard for an hour was constant banging which you donât expect when you have paid to be there and werenât given a warning;3
we stayed here for a pre christmas shopping weekend in december our room was very small so much so that we kept tripping over the bed legs when trying to manoeuvre around the beds the mini bar in the room was extortionate with a small bottle of water costing 7 we had no view from 9th floor room just a view of a brick wall however the location was so convenient for mid town new york and we could walk to most places we wanted to see from our hotel the bell men were helpful and friendly location great hotel basic;3
comfortable stay but i expected more such as a fridge ice maker machine and some amenities i would stay here again tho if im on a budget small but clean rooms its good for a good nights sleep then you get up and go;3
the astor on the park provides a relatively inexpensive place to stay while in new york city it is close to the subway and provides quick access to most of the city it is located on the upper west side right across from central park;3
we stayed here twice going to and from a trip to asia the shuttles are fine enough the hotel is great looking being newly renovated rooms are very comfortable the restaurant has good enough food but one can go out quite easily using uber the issue i had on both occasions is with the front desk they have a no can do attitude to the point of double charging me for a room as we didnt check into our already paid for room until the morning so they charged me for it again we were flying in from china theyre an airport hotel they should get the concept of irregular time schedules when we checked out the next day at 430 am to catch a plane they couldnt give me the bill because they were running their days billingi didnt discover the double charge until i got;3
clean safe functional no microwave coffee pot minifridge in room i think you can get them for extra fees convenient to subway and penn station excellent bagelmuffin shop across the street hotel employees were cordial;3
first off this place was kinda hard to find we walked past it several times before realizing the industrial looking building was the place we were looking for basically this is a good place to sleep if that is all you need which was the case for us however if your looking to swoon another soul good luck also it should be noted the showers are communal and they automatically shutoff every ten seconds this is really a bugger when your trying to shower at 5am and havent had coffee there are washers and dryers on premises and everyone was really nice it is a two minute walk from the rail which is convenient again this is one of the places you really get what you pay for which isnt bad;3
the location is terrific but i donât think iâd ever stay here again the public spaces in the lobby were nicely done but as as you stepped into the elevator you could begin to see the wear the carpets in the elevators and hallways were often dirty and tired looking as soon as we left the elevator the smell of marijuana was beyond strong this was the case every time we came and went for 5 days ridiculous and made the hotel seem super trashy and low budget the room was very small and showing its age in nyc sometimes hotel rooms are small but with thoughtful touches for storagemaximizing space not here there werenât any places to really hang clothes because the fridge was in the closet a tired looking chair was randomly placed the 2 drawers on the bedside table;3
we stayed for 4 nights in mid july 2017 pluses location and rooftop bar minuses pool and fitness center closed indefinitely and no explanation reason we booked postage stamp size room tiniest bathroom about like cruise ship mini fridge was full of high priced stuff to buy leaving no room for anything you want to stock housekeeping on limited service per front desk our first day but did come empty trash and bring fresh towels when i called and asked did come other days staff was efficient but not friendly all the help acted on edge like they were suspicious of everyone or felt they were being watched will not stay there again didnt eat in restaurant so cant speak to that;3
nice and clean place 2 blocks away from subway123 lines baths are sometimes not clean but it is because of the people a classic hostel do not expect hotel comfort rooms are not big as of any hostel in nyc;3
well where do you begin if you like art deco architecture its fabulous as a hotel it leaves a lot to be desired lobby etcgreatrooms are a lottery allegedly they are still in the process of upgrading roomsi presume we were allocated a room awaiting an upgrade the only description is shabby staff again are a lottery some great others surly at bestthe tick tock diner which is part of the establishment is reasonably priced for nyc is tragic food and service wisethis hotel need to get their act together not rest on their past laurels shame though it is go else wherepswhen checking out no one askedhow was your stayif they had asked i would have voiced my concerns rather than this negative review;3
the hotel was pretty good however the rooms are small we are not satisfied that we got charged for an amount on our creditcard although we hadt consumed anything therefore in the end we are not completely satisfied with this hotel;3
large impersonal hotel only booked because of the location near a flat and i thought that it had been modernised i am sure they did loads but rooms are really quite small as is the bathroom the decor is art deco some nice items service requests are dealt with very quickly areas in the bathroom show age and neglect and corner dirt good shower and very good mattresses staff i guess under pressure from the volume of trade can be on the sharp side i guess they get lots of requests the one real grip is the hotel extra tax on arrival supposedly for wifi pool and unlimited calls it should be in the price as its compulsory they fool you with a lower advertised headline price not good business but then difficult to argue when the hotel was full i wont return and;3
the rooms are very small but if you are travelling light as i was and alone there isnt much need for more room i was worried that the bed would be too small for my 62 frame but i was quite comfortable i liked the funky retro feel of the place bellhops in uniforms stuffed animals in the lobby i wish that the checkin person had said where the shared bathrooms weretook me a minute or two and i was desperate worst thingthe restaurant staff was insulting and inept no more than four other people in the place when i went in and the staff was rude slow and didnt seem to understand the idea of customer service inexcusable i could hear thumping from the club downstairs any louder and i might have been bothered but it wasnt too bad that said i will;3
hotel has clearly been around quite a while but clean neat and orderly very helpful staff excellent location on the upper west side good value;3
i came to the empire hotel because of a conference nearby the location is glorious youre across the street from lincoln center a block away from central park and 3 blocks north of columbus circle and thats about the best thing i can say about this hotel the empire hotel is a boutique hotel that as far as i can tell was built in a time before boutique hotels were trendy the rooms are as you would expect tiny but thats no big deal the bed and bedding is attractive but not exceptionally comfortable surely thats a simple thing that can be changed to improve the room theres a desk and chair two nightstands a wall mounted television and a dresser with a padded top which can serve as seating thats about all you can fit in the room one thing that often;3
after a delayed flight arrived at the new yorker to warm welcome at check in room was basic clean but adequate bathrooms could do with updating had breakfast in the tick tock diner quick and pleasant service dined in biana trattoria one evening service was slow meal average and bar staff more interested in her phone than serving drinks disappointing when we approached information asking how best to get to baseball game guy on information disinterested and said that reminded him to ring his son back and promptly picked up his mobile phone and made a call leaving us stood there we walked away thinking this was very rude overall we enjoyed our stay just a few customer service issues;3
we booked this hotel because we wanted a boutique hotel with a pool location is great close to central park in a lovely area of upper west side right beside the lincoln centrebut after we checked in and put our swimsuits on and rushed up to pool deck we were greeted with pool closed signs when we called front desk to inquire we were told the pool did not pass a test and was closed indefinitely we were not told about this at check in and had four children with us for four days in nyc the hotel itself is tiredrun down and in need of upkeepmaintenance staff are not very friendly with the exception of asst director and director who resolved my complaints about the pool closure i would not recommend this hotel over other boutique hotels in nyc no free;3
we were visiting universal studio for 3 days so stayed at this location we picked out a room through their online checkin process but was disapointed that they assigned it to someone else when we arrived not sure the whole point of online checkin the room were spacious and clean it had large bay windows over looking nice views breakfast and dinner was pricely like most hilton locations valet service and room service was prompt universal shuttle stopped at this location and sheraton almost 15 minutes which was very convenient overall a great location but average service;3
i have provided my feedback please see earlier page average room dark and dingy and toilet smelt when told hotel staff no one advised outcome or if they fixed the problem or upgrade to a different room poor service given the amount you pay for per night;3
clean well kept rooms but the rest of the hotel is tired looking the actual room size is quite small with little room for your luggage so youre always tripping over it all the adjoining dinerrestaurant is poor also having said all that it didnt cost much and i suppose you pay for what you get so i cant complain too much it served our purposes being 2 mins walk from mad sq garden but we wouldnt stay there again;3
everything was fine rr food breakfast choices very good but staff seemed preoccupied with other things they all seemed miserable which is unusual for hotel staff in the us completely opposite to all other hotel experiences we had;3
decided on days hotel broadway because it was cheaper than most other hotels being a bit away from the downtown area in ënyc but that wasnt a problem as the hotel is right at a subway station which is less than 5 minutes walk away the convenience was a huge plus the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood in the upper west side with quite a few eating options and some stores where you can grab a few snacks and provisions the hotel has definitely seen better days though and needs to spruce itself up a bit the double room we got was comfortable and adequately sized with all the usual amenities and working wifi the biggest issue with the room was that the water drained incredibly slowly in the bathtub staff arent particularly friendly but they did their jobs the bigger;3
i stayed here for a long weekend with a friend its in a great location off columbus circle across from lincoln center and just to the west of central park overall the stay was very nice and the hotel is comfortable there are no significant negatives but it just wouldnt rank as better than average entering the hotel you are greeted by the ohsotrendy nyc dark lobby it made me think of that scene at the end from great expectations where you just want to tear down the enormous drapes and let some sunshine in coming from the uk we got in about 1 pm but had to wait over two hours for our room and it wasnt even ready at checkin time of 3 pm and we had to nag the front desk to get a move on oh well we enjoyed a drink or two on the roof terrace its a big;3
very good location in a friendly part of manhattan close to the metro and in walking distance to central park rooms clean and quiet elevator is slow and always with a queue as the hotel is a bit crowded internet did not work for 3 days and nobody seemed to care about it ugly and partly sexistic in front of the elevator on 14 th floor fotographs on the walls price is too high for the standard but thats manhattan;3
i stayed here overnight 5th october 2022 on the way to hawaii you can get a shuttle bus on the lower level of the airport the shuttle bus back stops right outside the main door the hotel is quite modern in design inside i did however find the staff cold and unwelcoming i felt like a number on a conveyer belt with no recognition this only added to my anxiety as i was travelling on my own please make your gusts feel welcome smile at least the room however was amazing and my view was overlooking the airport i could even see the âlaxâ famous sign from my room this was only a base for one night and did the job i found the food and drink very expensive in the hotel so just made an average tasting coffee in my room the room was large with a king bed hard sofa and;3
so ive been to this hotel every year for the last 4 or 5 years part of an event and the rooms are arranged for such so we stay here versus somewhere i may want to try otherwise overall the hotel is fine the staff is friendly and helpful the place is clean and there food was good but the elevators are horrible last year we ended up waling down form like the 10th floor this year we had to literally jump out of the elevator at an unknown floor because it was going up and down not stopping and opening randomly and it wasnt just one time or us all the guests were complaining and i tihnk the hotel knew there was an issue but wasnt really aknowledging it be transparent let us know there is an issue at times wed wait 10 minutes for one of 5 elevators to;3
we had a basic room with a queen bed the room was very small never seen a such a small room i had to step into the shower to close the bathroom door no joke i had checked in late but first thing down to the front desk fortunately they agreed that that room was substandard and gave use a better room for the remainder of our stay thank you pasquale for accommodating my request;3
husband is hilton diamond level we had 2 nites at this hotel for our family the gentleman who checked him in remembered my husband from previous travel trips and said a special gift food platter would be at the room nite 1nothing received we let them know morning of day 2 they said it would be coming up nothing was ever received the room really could have used updating the server in the restaurant for the buffetcontinental breakfast was very friendly and helpful their continental breakfast is all i would recommend;3
the hotel is right next to the central park its right between two subway stops and the area around it has much to offer the rooms are quite small and outdatedbut the hotel repays you by its location there is wifi access in the lobby only;3
very nice situation of the hotel next to times square broadway and central park and the people who are work info there are very line the â«â butâ â» are about the rooms they are very small the bathroom wasnât clean and the breakfast was very very bad no choice no hot meals;3
we had room 2101 the reason i mention this room is because while you hear the winding sound of the elevator i rarelyspent time in the roomasthe hoteliswihin easy walking distance to the tourist spots but our hotel room has 2 beds 2 closets and 2 bathrooms unheard of in nyc it came with breakfast but i recommend that as a pass as tick tock is less than desirable hotel was clean staff was friendly and even though the hotel has over 1000 rooms the staff each day recognized us;3
stayed here for 3 nights in august 2016 it was very much a budget hotel our rooms were very much in need of updating however they and the bathrooms were extremely clean with fresh bed linen every day air con was excellent especially as ny was having a heatwave however the ac unit was old and very noisy had to turn it off at night toiletries are provided and refreshed daily shower water pressure was woeful though the hallways were not air conditioned and did not smell good there was a coffee maker and a good in both the rooms we had booked also free wifi which had a good signal 5 minutes walk from the sway plus some good places to eat close by we were quite happy staying here as we only wanted to sleep here however if we went again i would request a better;3
the empire hotel is in the prime location for lincoln center and central park access and for most of your shopping needs rooms are clean and comfortable check to make sure the elevators are all in service;3
we stayed at the hotel for 4 days in sept of 2006 and the stay was ok but i guess good for the price we paid close to 300 per night plus the hotel is located 3 4 subway stops from times square the staff was nice the rooms were as clean as they could be the hotel is old and dingy but if you have a full schedule it probably would not matter i would not stay at the hotel again because there were some nicer hotels that averaged about 300 per night so the extra 19 or so dollars would have been worth it;3
i was really hoping for more from this hotel the location is great right next to lincoln center a short walk to central park and close to subway stations my husband and i arrived a little early for check in and the desk staff gave us a voucher for 30 off drinks on the rooftop and told us they would bring us our keys when our room was ready which we were told would be by 3pm check in time we enjoyed the rooftop which is spacious with great views although the pool is very tiny not really for swimming however no one ever brought keys to us so we went back to the desk around 345 the room was ready but i would have appreciated the staff bringing us the keys as they had promised the room was well appointed but very small even by manhattan standards only two;3
i stayed at the new yorker while visiting for work when i was younger i used to book rooms for this hotel and id always wanted to stay there as luck would have it the hotel was only two blocks away from where i was taking my course i stayed for 4 nights and had breakfast each morning in the tick tock diner my overall impressions pros location right in midtown i walked everywhere extremely friendly staff wifi was reliable and fast very important as a business traveler tick tock diner was great for breakfast a bit pricey but excellent food cons my room didnt have much of a view unfortunately service at the front desk was a little slow no fault of the workers just not enough of them while i was visiting noisy this really didnt;3
first impressions of the jane are great the staff are dressed in old fashioned uniforms the rooms are very cool all shabby chic but with modern amenities the location is great in the village with trendy shops and bars around the problem is there is a noisy club on the ground floor that we could hear in our room until 3am not cool its unclear what the relationship is between the hotel and club its not even mentioned in the hotel info in the room and the hotel said they could only ask them to turn the music down we went to the club and its great but just not for guests;3
i used to love this hotel it still has a cool lobby and nighttime lounge but many negatives nowwait at front desk repeatedly longi and others wanted a slightly later checkout others were rejected but i was granted extra 90â odd gym is small without mats circa 2000rooms cramped and grout in shower in poor repair;3
i was fine with the accoidations but i would not like my wife to stay here if you are looking to stay for little money this place is great not that many ammenities but close to the subway to get anywhere in town i felt very safe in the neighborhood very upscale part of town i would stay here again anytime;3
stayed here for 1 night great location lobby looks great so i thought rooms would be just as good how wrong can one be the corridors absolutely stink very musty they need a complete refresh livening up the room i stayed in was small and in desperate need of modernising again had that musty smell stop living of your past new yorker hotel embrace the 21st century;3
honestly im torn on this hotel for the location the price was great the hotel staff was all super friendly and accommodating and our room was clean and nice the view from the window was of dirty windows from the building next door but thats not their fault however the elevator took 510 minutes to reach you from any level and when i tried to use the stairs they ended at the second level that doesnt seem to safe it seems like the entire building is falling apart with walls that are bowed out and one of the hall closets was open revealing a collapsed ceiling our room also had a outlet in the restroom that didnt work and when i went to unplug my curling iron the entire front of the outlet fell off our deadbolt also did not lock i honestly loved my stay but was left;3
visited nyc stayed at the new yorker good location staff not keyed up on trips and not very helpful in general tick tock service was poor all they seemed interested in was tips wi fi is free whilst you are checked in but as soon as you check out this is cancelled despite having to wait all afternoon for your transport to the airport;3
we got one of the rooms not yet updated and it was in definite need of some tlc but it was clean and the location was excellent mere steps from the subway lots of coffee shops and delis to choose from for breakfast little interaction with the staff but what we had was fine as others have said the elevators can be very slow and we did keep the air conditioner fan on as white noise but for the price i was satisfied beds were also very comfortable;3
our stay overall was all right we did not have the breakfast in the hotelthere is a place around the corner to get food items for a little less the room temperature was fine and the lighting in the bathroom was good any requests we made were handled quickly and accurately the only drawback was that we had to request housekeeping each day ie we would return to our room around 400 and it had still not been cleaned the only card we had for our doorknob was if we did not want our room to be serviced so this confused us and put us out a little when we wanted to relax after a day of walking around and had to leave when housekeeping came so late in the day otherwise everything was fine the room was clean etc;3
we booked this hotel based on reviews from other reports and we are by no means snobby and are well seasoned travellers but this hotel failed us in every way the rooms were clean but very small with one queen size bed in all the hotels weâve stayed in in the us the rooms have been massive with king size beds that we could cope with but there was nowhere to put anything a couple of bedside drawers and a wheeled clothes horse that looked like it came from a clothing shop shoved into a corner was just not sufficient the hotel dates from about 1929 and looks it the manager said that all the rooms had been upgraded and when i expressed my dismay due to the rusting towel shelf the peeling toilet seat the cracked tiles in the bath the peeling wallpaper and the mildew;3
i paid approximatively 50 a night with expedia so for the price i found this hotel very ok the breakfast was normal eggs dont have a taste thats right the room was ok my internet connexion worked fine i had a room giving on vermont and the windows werent double gazed so sometimes it was noisy the room and towels were clean they did not offer a lot of services i asked for some universal tickets they didnt have any i asked them to print a file for me and they couldnt i had to go to the staples next door to make it the location is good for tourists but way too far the ocean;3
the hotel is in a great position near madison square garden and its easy to get uptown or downtown very quickly by subway the hotel has a history which makes it interesting built in the 1920s our room was small and functional price was reasonable but had to pay extra 22 a day this can be included in booking price shower was unreliable because the temperature varied just adequate although the bathroom was fine otherwise good storage space thin walls so a bit thin and we could hear people outside and in the next rooms we didnt mind because the rooms next to us were quite quiet probably fair value for money considering its situation;3
very short ride from airport we had one day lay over to bora bora and took the oppurtunity to take a lyft to manhattan beach nice half day walk on the beach shopping just typical nice bar near the volley ball courts called the shellback;3
definitely a hotel like no other i stayed in a single with shared shower and bath the hotel is at the end of jane street and is kind of dark inside and outside the single rooms are small and i couldnât get my overhead light to go off it has a musty and old smell the bathroom seemed clean young ladies at checkout were nice as was the gentleman in the restaurant;3
the lobby and room were very beautiful but the reception checkin woman was increbibly rude also since we were on an anniversary trip we asked to be put away from the street if possible or in general just a quiet section we were put in 315 a corner with windows level to the bar next door it was so incredibly loud we could hear the lyrics and bass to every song all night;3
i wanted to give a warning to watch out for the parking at this hotel i paid for a parking ticket from the parking desk at the hotel for the garage right behind the hyatt it was 34 per day for in and out privileges each day when i left the garage i paid 32 each time in addition so the 34 i was talked into at the hotel was a total rip off beware;3
we stayed here for three nights with our children while visiting universal and la we are also hilton diamond members so booked this through their website after reading reviews here location is great proximity to universal itâs about a ten minute walk which our 3 young kids were fine with rooms are ok nothing spectacular not sure if it was due to capacity but no upgrades available for diamond however room was not available by 4 little after but matters when with young kids we had a king sofabed corner room which had a partial barely view of universal service not great you need to ask for housekeeping each day which we had and it didnât happen they even asked for a specific time we prefer but we came back to a room still not cleaned after a long day;3
very helpful staff but hotel itself looking a bit tired lifts are undergoing renovation so the service was very slow but i am sure will improve once completed we had to be moved to a different room as aircon was not working good position but a bit pricey;3
got a great deal at this hotel but was concerned about the poor reviews need not have worried room was small but had the 2 beds we had requested which were very comfortable and clean as was the bathroom lots of clean towels toiletries and hot water pleasant helpful staff not luxury but fine for a place to sleep a way out of the main areas but got great value breakfast from the deli a block down and close to the subway after dark as 2 females we felt safer on the m10 bus which stops right outside great location for central park and our early morning runs;3
our hotel stay was good overall our room was located next to the machine room running the elevator and the noise from the elevator woke me up several times during the night the rest of the room was adequate the location of the hotel was very good;3
good art deco hotel but room small convenient though well protected by security guards who keep asking you for your room key in order to get access to your room busy hotel lobby some rooms face the empire state building very convenient for macys shoppers a good diner is downstairs friendly staff and clean but a bit old;3
the hotel is great location is excellent rooms are small and cold but suitable for what you need but the service leaves a lot to be desired upon arrival i was asked for a credit card for the fees 2 days later i noticed over â£700 has been secured against my card went to reception to complain and they apologised and said it would be rectified 24 hours later another fee of over â£400 taken against my card so nearly â£1200 over half of my spending money was secured against these fees went to reception received an apology and was told it was a error and i would receive all fees back and a discount against my stay which i have to wait for from ba the fees have been returned but its taken until 5 days after my return and no good to me now as i needed that money whilst i;3
my husband and i stayed boutique hotel and loved the ambiance however the hotel manager should learn to speak to the his employees with a civil tongue while i was at the front desk getting my room key he was berating an employee in a tone that was very rude and unprofessional guests should not be exposed to this kind of behavior and it had a negative effect on my stay i am not sure that i will be staying here again;3
i have stayed at this property about 4 or 5 times i live in san diego and my friends and i occasionally drive up to hollywood for the weekend this hotel is a great choice if you want to party in the hollywood west hollywood and especially the silver lake area it is blocks from the vermont metro subway station which takes you to downtown hollywood blvd and even universal studios in minutes the staff is hit or miss there have been times when they have been helpful and others when they have been indifferent dont expect gold star service but i have never had a horrendous experience once we even upgraded to a larger room when there was a problem with our booking at no extra charge the property is a little dated and unspectacular but the rooms are clean and adequate;3
i settled on the hyatt because of the glowing reviews the fire alarm activated in our room because the phone in the room does not work i am forced to take the elevator down to the lobby to deal with this problem my conversation with the clerk informs me that our room is the only active alarm the clerk assures help would arrive soon two staff members arrive and after a quick inspection the maintenance man begins work to diffuse the alarm the staff member floats a veiled accusation of us smoking in the room upsetting to say the least i informed the staff that we dont smoke do not appreciate being accused of violating hotel policy this is very unprofessional on staffers part maintenance diffused the situation with by saying the incident could have been activated;3
honestly wouldnt be a 3 only for some staff not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady door man jeff was so helpful and a great person bar staff gina and javier made our holiday to new york a pleasure hotel rooms are nice but as for anything to do in the hotel rubbish you cannot even relax after a fun day in the city your basically room bound not really much of a seating area there is no restaurant within the hotel all you get is what you see in the picture crap if you need any help what so ever javier is the man to see such a lovely man and actually will be missed by all of my company i was with;3
cheap close to central park and subway nice surprise when we arrived as the person at reception gave us an en suite room even though we had booked a standard room but after first day out we got back to our room to find door open and unlocked thankfully nothing was mising from our room but we asked to not service our room after that we were only staying 3 nights quite noisy as there was a pipe running through the room but for the price i didnt expect too much;3
before we arrived we tried to get late checkout but were told we couldnt do this til the day we were leaving when that day came they said we couldnt as there was a wedding on and all the people were staying on that floor as if they didnt no this before we arrived quarter to 12 at night checking in was easy we went to our rooms and crashed next morning we were awoken with the waiter bringing us breakfast silly us just been woken up thought it was complimentary as we didnt order it nothing was even mentioned later we found out it wasnt free they thought we had ordered it sounds sneaky to me one day we came back to our rooms and on leaving the elevator we saw and smelt this awful vomit on the carpet floor we went to our room and i immediately rang the front desk;3
got to the hotel and there was no one on reception the security bloke called someone in the back room and a lady came out after a few minutes but did not seem at all bothered and not very friendly checked in ok and went upto room there are 3 lifts elevators but are very slow room was decent enough double bed fridge which was a little noisy ensuite tv desk wardrobe with safe didnt hear much noise from the other people in the hotel the location could not be better a few shops small supermarket and subway sandwiches and the subway are just round the corner easily walk to central park from the hotel on the last day we were able to leave our luggage in reception locked up and the porter who did this was friendly enough can recommend the city;3
i had a reservation for a 2 queen room but once i got there they had âover bookedâ and only had a 1 queen room i was traveling with my family when i asked if they had any update options they said they are completely booked and to come back tomorrow morning to see if we can get the 2 queen room when i asked for roll away bed for my daughter since they gave us a 1 queen room it took a hour just to get the roll away bed the next day when we finally got into the 2 queen room something was wrong with the ac it was very loud and was hard to sleep at night i stayed at this hotel a couple times but this had to be the worst experience;3
we stayed in this hotel wich is in a great location the first room we had had a weird smell so they moved us to a better bigger room thanks the only complaint is hidden fees stayed for two days and the fee was 90 i complained but they said this is the fees sooo that was it comeon that does not say in their website or any other place overall good but please let people know what you getting;3
kept me for nearly two hours saying that they have not received the credit card payment i couldnât do my big bus tour because of that was staying only one night in ny hence it was big time lost for me guest service and facilities you canât even compare for what you get in my city dubai;3
i stayed on the empire on december 2011 the week before christmas i was really excited to stay there and got a amazing deal on their for the deluxe king room usd 179 per night i had googled the hotel before getting there so my expectations were high and also because it is feature on the show gossip girl i was wondering it i would spot any celebrities on the lounge what i can say is that this hotel does not live up to the hype its a bit worn out the lobby specially the room was ok cant complain about the amazing king bed amenities were great loccitane ok wireless internet but what made my experience so bad was that upon the time i made the reservation it was not mentioned that i need to make a security deposit when i was checking in i was informed about;3
pros close to penn station close to subway which will take you direct to wtc in one direction and natural history museum in other direction comfortable room albeit quite small hairdryersafe provided good view of empire state building cons outdated furniturebathroom water takes ages to drain in shower your feet end up dirty no coffee facilities this alone drops it down a whole star for me such a simple change no room service etc no bottled water provided in room location feels unsafe see below overall an adequate stay we were here 4 nights i think if youâre just stopping in nyc this place would do you fine but for slightly longer trips i found myself wanting a little bit more just basic stuff that is missing such as coffee making;3
this hotel is well positioned for access to the the activities around the times square it is clean and the staff are mostly friendly there is a lack of information in the rooms regarding hotel facilities;3
not a bad location in hollywood few metro stations away from the walk of fame and dolby theater about 5 min walk from metro car rental service available directly at hotel rooms are clean but the beads are horrible materess definitely needs an update great breakfast loved it if renting a car dont get a hotel parking theres plenty of free parking after 8pm until 8am on the street arroubd hotel and if leaving hotel after 8am just put few dollars in tme meter we parked at 830pm and picked it up at 9am so it cost us 1 parking instead of 2499night;3

went to nyc to see billy joel at the garden which is just across the street from the hotel location is actually pretty goodpenn station and madison square garden are across the street penn station subway entrance is next to the hotel short walk or taxi ride to midtown times square lower manhatten 911 memorial freedom tower battery park etc the hotel staff is wonderful service was just a call away unfortunately we were not offered bell service even though we took a cab there from lga in fact we didnt know they had it until we checked out and asked if someine could get our bags the hotel is outdated and requires upgrades needs nee carpet paint beds etc there was no coffee maker or fridge in the room but housekeeping did bring us one when we asked closet;3
no car needed superbly located for fun at universal studios and universal city metro station the hilton universal city is just a few minutes walk away from both the hotel could use a bit if a spruce up and is showing its age the decor is a bit drab and out dated but is fine from a practical use point of view places to eat at the hotel are limited but with universal citywalk mere minutes walk away theres no shortage of choice room was large with full bathroom staff helpful and friendly;3
there is no more convenient location for work in and around lincoln center this was my second stay at the hotel and i found that the attitude of the staff was a bit wanting this time around the rooms are indeed small but the problem exists in the the fact that the rooms are overstuffed with furniture the bathrooms are dreadful small and oddly lacking in shower enclosures;3
i really do not mind paying for what i get but the value of this property is just not there the checkin desks was not adequately staff and of course no concierge desk to assist with issues i only eat at the restaurant once and it was the breakfast and for a 4 star hotel it was just not up to par judging from the area and the choice of hotels i would not stay here again the first room was worn and had an odor and i had to move the second room was very nice however when the housekeeper would clean the room they would forget to restore things like coffee and towels and yes we did tip it was pleasant complementary internet was good parking terrible;3
stayed for one night at the jane the rooms are very small originally designed for sailors but i knew this in advance very quirky but absolutely fine for a short stay i was however very disappointed by the bed the mattress was so old creaky and uncomfortable that it made my stay quite miserable bathrooms are unisexshared i dont mind this at all but the shower cubicles had absolutely no room for your towel and clothes the food at the restaurant cafe gitane was wonderful extremely high quality price for nyc and this location was excellent value however i dont think id stay there again i would definitely go back to the restaurant though;3
i travel a lot and the services provided internet food concierge was not good my phone basically did not work the wifi was ok but i did missed several calls and text messages because of faulty internet service no snacks or access to bottled water on site the services and customer service wes well below average;3
we have mixed things to say about this hotel the room itself is fine clean but relatively small as one typically expects in nyc but the main negative were writing about is the elevators we were on the 8th floor and could easily wait over 5 10 minutes to get an elevator to stop on our floor while waiting for one we would typically watch as they would just go past our floor without stopping time and time again and when one finally did stop it would stop on every floor on the way down despite the fact that no buttons other than lobby were pressed and what made this more frustrating was that we were at the hotel in the spring and the problem was present then as well we complained to the front desk about it and we do have to say that the manager mr ze who;3
i stayed in the hostel with a friend because it was close to the shepherds bush arena my friend and i shared a double room which cost â£25 each we were upgraded to an ensuite room i assume due to a booking error the room was very clean but basic you had to pay for wifi it was much nicer than a hostel though and the beds were extremely comfy we had a fridge and the bathroom shower was very adequate it wasnt hotel quality but i would pay a few extra pounds for this over a hostel any day the blinds were quite thin so we woke up at dawn also our room was opposite the bedding store and the staff woke us up talking loudly in the corridor in the morning however it was a very comfortable stay and is in a great location if youre going to see a gig at the hammersmith o2;3
i am not a huge fan of nyc so take this with a grain of salt the hotel itslef was ok not super fancy or luxurious the location is very good if you want to be in the heart of things i found the room to be quite small and a bit dated especially the bathroom which made me feel like i was staying at a friends place a couple of things that got under my skin was the noise from the street and the thin walls i could hear everything from the surrounding rooms a bit of a pet peeve for me the other thing was that there were not nearly enough outlets to plug in our things anyhow now that i know i may stay there again but at least now i know;3
very nice lobby and the best location for opera lovers since it is just in front of the metropolitan opera the rooms are very small the bathrooms are tiny and with no doors to the shower hotel maintenance is mediocre if you are not an opera lover the price is too high for what you get pay attention the very popular bar on the roof is not the hotel bar there for you have no privilege as an hotel guest and you will cue like all the rest;3
the shutter was cold and there was no way to make it even lukewarm otherwise the hotel was good location is on a great spot close to columbus circle and easy to get to wherever you want if it wasnt fur the cold water i would give it a great review;3
small room slow and rude front desk employees made service came way to early and were very aggressive to get their work disspite the fact that i was still in my pjs in bed i needed a toothbrush but had to but the smile kit for 17;3
all and all this is a good hotel for going to the universal studios location is excellent walking distance from universal studios and thay also have a free shuttle going to the studios and the pool area is very nice to relax after long day in universal the breakfast buffet is excellent but a bit pricy parking is easy to the garage but it costs usd 15 per night i would have given this hotel a 4 if it werent for one thing we had a nonsmoking room but the room was smelly you could notice that the hotel most likely has not been a nonsmoking property for too long because i felt that the smell was all over the floor too hopefully they can get rid of the smell because what can i say a smell in a hotel of this class is just probably the worst thing you can have also;3
the great thing about this hotel is the place the design in the lobby and hallways are exclusive all though the room i spent the night had water damages in the bathroom and the hair dryer did not work nothing is included in the price not even water pool was close due to maintenance staff was very service minded though;3
no having stayed any where else in midtown manhattan i found the room small and in need of update everything was clean but the grout around the tub was in dire need of replacement very mildewed for over 250us per night i expected more the location was excellent for access to the subway system and for walking everywhere though so i guess that is what you pay for the next time i go to new york i would stay outside of manhattan and just utilize transit to get in and out of town as its super easy to use fast and efficient well worth the unlimited use metro card price;3
impressve looking hotel but a number of frustrations rooms were on the small side which would not be such an issue if they were not stuffed with overpriced merchandise to purchase this left very little surface space no free tea and coffee and chargable wifi totally unacceptable at this price point would not stay again;3
overall average service but the hotel is wellmaintained and clean the concierge was unapologetic about the delay in checking in instead she just gave breakfast vouchers without an apology it was also disappointing the pool deck wasnt open during the week;3
the hotel is decent and well priced for nyc but it is not even close to gossip girl the rooms are very small unless you upgrade to a suite and even then they are not all that big i understand this is nyc but when i say small i mean super small the lobby bar and rooftop are all reminiscent of gossip girl but all can be experienced without having to stay here i would recommend visiting this hotel but maybe not staying here unless you get a really great rate;3
checkin welcome was miserable as flight got in late we couldnt have 2 rooms on same floor let alone next to each other think we had what is called a metro room for 3 people it was very small totally outdated however it was clean beds comfy location was great for penn station sub macys empire state it was pricey for what you got so id look to stay somewhere different if i go again;3
i spent one night at this hotel so i dont feel i can truly give a thorough review but im going to try we arrived a little early to check in but they preregistered us and called us about 30 minutes later to tell us our room was ready we reserved the room through priceline and read that the hotel staff treated you different for using a third party to make the reservation i fully disagree with that statement any staff member we dealt with was extremely nice pleasant and accommodating when we got back to the hotel later in the evening we were given our room on the 7th floor we had checked our bags and asked to have the bell man bring up our bags quick since we only had a few hours to sleep they delivered our bags immediately nyc rooms are generally smaller than other;3
unfortunately this hilton is very tired the lobby and rooms are in need of a renomodernisation the lighting in the rooms was not great the walls between rooms are very thin and and for the three nights we where there all four of us did not get a very good sleep because of the couple coughing all night every night kept us awake the beds where not overly comfortable there where marks and stains on the wall paper some of which couldve been wiped clean we had 4 in the one room 2 teenagers and ourselves the room was standard not a huge amount of space but not tiny either the bathroom had a shower over a bath and a shower curtain i am not a fan of these types of bathrooms and there was a little bit of mould in the shower grout the lifts where ridiculously slow;3
rooms are small i had to remind myself it is an old building beds were very comfortable staff was very nice there arent very many food choices near hotel was always a chore trying to find a place to eat we had to go to times square for places worth eating at restaurant at the hotel was very expensive for what it served;3
small tight rooms staff at reception lack knowledge the concierge desk had an older fella who was extremely rude to both my wife and my daughters mother in law i did not believe it so listened in and found him so rude the diner on corner was great top service and friendly rooms were clean very small bathroom and it needed attention would i stay here again yes but ny is over rated noisy sirens every night plenty to do though;3
the location was perfect i had a room on the 17th floor view of scaffolding and paid the same price as someone with a view of the city rooms are very small overpriced but this is new york exercise patience;3
went to hollywood with 2 friends as it was somewhere i had always wanted to go since i was a teen i built hollywood up so much and it truly was as crazy and as fun as i imagined firstly we didnt want to spend loadsa money on flight and accomadation we found a good package on expedia ramada inn on vermont with air new zealand air new zealand was great ramada was also good however there were a few issues but nothing major 1 the location is fine if you hire a car i couldnt as i am only 24 and you have to be 25 so we spent a lot in cab fares which was annoying ramada is close to universal studios which is great it is also about a 1015 minute drive to both hollywood boulevard and sunset strip in west hollywood if however you are able to spend more money on;3
it was a great experience and good location the staff was very good and courteous on the other hand the rooms are small and very limited area to store your luggage if you are travelling with your family;3
the hotel is well situated near the subway the room is good as well as the beds the batheroom is good except for the towels that are very small room and bathroom are very clean the staff at the lobby is extremely unpolite there is always just only one person there to attend everybody and answer phone calls at the same time it was supposed to be cable tv in all rooms wich is not true they didnt informed us when asked about a computer at the hotel and sent us three blocks away on the last day we found the a room with computers near the lobby you have to pay to use it but it was the same on the place they sent us we needed to print a voucher if not there is wifi you can hear noise from other rooms keys not always work and you have to go down to the lobby to reset;3
my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and we loved it the hotel is perfect if youre staying in new york for a few days its next to central park and at the top of broadway so you can just follow the street to find everything ricky the receptionist was amazing and really helped us out on what to do and where to go the hotel is what it is but perfect for a short trip;3
rooms were dirty toilet visibly stained and carpet very dusty but overall the customer service was excellent and the location too consider introducing breakfast onto the package also give discounts to repeat guests;3
this hotel needs much faster elevators much bigger bathrooms the drain in the bathroom sink was clogged did not drain very well when it was unclogged shower area much to small could not move water had no place to go;3
câmon universal studios it took me an arm and a leg to buy my tickets and then i stood in line for over 2 12 hours for less than 5 minutes of fun really this is what my 619 gets me these days so disappointed if you can avoid parking at their lot because it is expensive 25 for the day metro can drop you off right at the bottom of the hill and uberlyft can drop you off at the front gate to avoid paying for parking donât misunderstand me our kids did enjoy their day trip to universal we just didnât like having to wait in line all day long for 5min;3
i stayed here during a brief trip to nyc overall i was satisfied the hotel is huge which means lots of people coming and going the property seems popular with all kinds of groups both conventions and schools the location is good right at penn station access to the extensive subway system is right there public transportation tofrom jfk is super easy and cheap 775 with the subway a little more with the lirr i echo the comments made by maddykimba the room was nice enough not huge by any means but reasonable by new york standards the bathroom was cramped but manageable the water temperature was erratic scalding or freezing and rarely in between youre constantly trying to adjust the temperature without success there are some renovations going on;3
the hotel is in the heart of the garment district a block from penn station and theres a subway stop on the same corner the new yorker would be a good home base for your exploration of manhattan the staff is courteous and helpful much more than i expected in nyc there was no coffee maker in the room as in the website photos but when i asked they brought me one in five minutes the room was tiny with about three feet on all sides of the bed the bathroom was dingy with stains on the tub and rotting grout in several places the new yorker would be great for someone who only needs a place to sleep and will spend all day out an about in the nearby sights;3
the bunkbed room was very small as visible on the pictures i think two suitcases dont fit gladly we brougt one suitcase and one backpack therere handy hooks and two drawers under the bed but we could only use one of the two drawers because of our suitcase on the floor the room was clean no bedbugs and the shared bathroom as well the shared bathroom was comfortable and sharing was no problem at all therere many bathrooms on every floor the staff working in the jane was very nice and very helpful we felt very welcome theres good wifi internet the jane is well located close to the high line 3 minutes the subway 10 minutes and the hotel is located next to the hudson with the free bicycles of the hotel we cycled the waterfront greenway along the river;3
i had to take an early train out of penn station so the new yorker was the perfect place to stay and the rate was great for a friday night during the summer the front desk got a couple of my requests wrong they forgot to put my sister on the reservation and they put me on the 38th floor despite asking for a room on a lower floor but they had upgraded me to a larger room and the views were spectacular so i cannot complain the room feels a bit old and worn but clean i liked the security at the hotel they were vigilant when it came to checking to make sure everyone who approached the elevator had a key the people who staffed the front desk were friendly efficient and patient so while the room was more on the just okay side why would you go to manhattan to spend a lot;3
i thought the hotel was nice but the beds were very hard and i was there for 4 days so that wasnt good also the bathrooms are small and dont have doors on the shower so that was dumb to me also one of the guest services messed up my girlfriends credit card that prevented her from shopping the way she wanted that was terrible;3
i just want to start by saying i usually stay at the sheraton but it was fully booked for this weekend i booked at the hilton and immediately found the hotel to be larger and with the same great service after the first day though i can honestly say iâm extremely disappointed i saw many adult guests walking around with out masks getting drinks at the bar waking in common areas and never once did i hear any staff ask them about their face covering traveling with my kids made this a bit more difficult if i had known i donât think i would have stayed here at all i understand the state is opening up but we are not there yet and we tried to stay out of the common areas for the same reason we came here because we were going to universal studios universal on the other hand;3
i think it would be hard to beat the location of this hotel the subway is a 2 min walk from the hotel providing access to main tourist sites itâs also not far from times square on foot the hotel seems to undergoing some upgrades i paid for a room upgrade and they offered a city view room on their âexecutive floorâ given the shape of the hotel the view was actually a brick wall however if you stood at the window and looked to the side you could see a few buildings the room and bathroom were small but housekeeping was efficient and the rooms were cleaned daily;3
we arrived at 1330 they said we would have to wait until 3pm checkin time as they had no idea whether any rooms were already available their computer systems were down and had been for 2 days so everything had to be done manually we waited and then tried to check in what a fiasco the line got longer and longer as it was taking so long to check everyone in we finally got a room it was under construction when we got to it so we had to request another evans thank you was very helpful we got another room but when we opened the door discovered it was already occupied so back to reception unfortunately evans was now off shift we asked for a manager i think 4 times and over 15 minutes he never came eventually we were allocated to a suite and all;3
our stay was pleasant but we were also disappointed the windows and walls are very thin so you can easily here all the traffic outside and your neighbors when they talk the location of the hotel is perfect the staff is friendly and the lobby has a perfect atmosphere to relax and escape the busy street nearby the hotel there are multiple restaurants to have dinner or breakfast you can also enjoy the buffet of the hotel in the morning for 25 per person but itâs not really worth it compare to the breakfast possibilityâs around the hotel;3
we were very disappointed with this hotel it was not a hotel but a motel the room we stayed in was very small the bathroom needed decorating there were no catering facilities had to go out for anything to eat or drink;3
this small ish 3 hotel in the upper west side is just fine bed linen is clean and fresh the water is hot and the location right next to 96th st subway station is very handy just dont expect too much and you wont be disappointed our room was small with a terrific internal view of the back of the buildings the bathroom needed a bit of an overhaul and i know the carpets look a bit grubby but all in all we didnt pay too much for a good nights sleep we were there for 4 nights and didnt come across any bedbugs instead of staying in the more business tourist areas in mid town its nice to stay in this rather more residential area where folk are going to their local grocery stores and small shops rather than the huge chain stores of mid town we found a;3
the empire hotel was a great convenient place to stay while on business for one night in nyc the room was a little run down but the bed and bathroom were clean and i slept very well i would stay there again;3
if you dont know la then be prepared to pay a little more to stay close to your main attraction literally a 2 min walk to universal studios is what made this the perfect place to stay did find the decor very dated and only 2 of 5 lifts were working due to some upgrades so the 23rd floor took some time getting to staff were fairly friendly but no free wifi unless you join their clubrooms were clean and neat might shop around a little more next time;3
we booked this hotel because we want to go to universal studios and other places near hollywood it has a shuttle bus to universal studios and back which is super convenient it is pretty close to burbank hollywood and downtown la our room is on the 18th floor and the view from our room is freeway 101 the room is big and there are plenty of room but the bathroom is just so so there is not complimentary water in the room you have to go to the vending machine located in the parking floor to get it one bottle is 3 it is better for you just go to ralph or vons to get a pack;3
rooms are smallno bathand heater wouldnt turn off which meant the room was warm all the time mentioned it at receptionbut they never did anything about it phoned the front desk a few timesno one ever picked up overall it was okay;3
2 mins walk to the subway this will take you to the staten island ferry in around 20 mins and time square in around 10 10 mins central park 15 mins museum of natural history laundry across the road food everywhere grocers just across the road location is tops the area was safe to walk around in at night too i walked around by myself morning and night not a problem female the hotel staff are friendly they were always nice to us and helpful when we asked for advice on places to see and where to go the rooms are far out dated no fridge but reasonable sized bathroom and the biggest bed ive ever slept in super comfy too the room isnt sound proof so that caused for a bad nights sleep on the first night but i got use to it the renos start early in the;3
we found the truth to be somewhere between the good and bad below terrific location for subway connections yet relatively peaceful surroundings the place suffers from too much use peeling wallpaper scuffed paintwork and worn lifts and air conditioning i know that the lifts are safe dont anyone worry on that score they dont sound it though a closer look showed that everything was very clean it didnt look it though the staff were very helpful no buts there and the neighbourhood is great with cheap food on the doorstep we both ate breakfast of two bacon buns with two decaffs for a little under 10 dollars more light and brighter colours would transform the first impressions so we wont return when we next visit unless we read of such a transformation good luck;3
overall a good stay but disappointed in our rooms not what we imagined size and bathroom could do with updating maybe a kettle in the room and proper cups not paper location good not too noisy walking distance to time square roof bar very nice;3
you dont expect a lot for the price per night in manhattan and you dont get a lot the word adequate was invented for this establishment although the tv didnt work and the shower wasnt great but it did the job;3
after swearing the place off for a few years i decided to give it another try the service was much better the rooms are small but if you just need a convenient and comfortable place for a couple days its fine i had booked the hotel through a travel site and paid in advance i like to have the room charges and taxes out of the way before any of my trips i arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or i could pay a 50 fee and theyd put me in a room early ive not seen hat option in a long time i decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as i had places to go and things to do the morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door i expected the 50 plus tax for the early check in i did not expect an additional;3
i frequently stay in wyndham properties and this was definitely not their worst but certainly not among the best overall for a quick 12 night weekend trip this was great very central location easy walking to penn station and other attractions made for a good home base as we bounced around the city and needed to grab extra layers as the night went on otherwise not the greatest experience the lobby was very crowded a time of check in and the clerk who helped us in the specially designated wyndham rewards gold member line was pretty rude and short she gave us quite the attitude even after i told her i was a gold member and using my points for this stay and that i was not in a rush and for her to take her time she then tried to make up for her;3
we checked in about 130 2pm our room was not ready by 4pm victor and jose took care of us and checked our status due to the delay they got some hotel credit and expedited the process to get our rooms thank you;3
pros location shuttle service to universal city walk cons dated only 2 receptionists diamond status nonexistent dusty parts in some areas of the room incomplete amenities eg 1 creamer on the coffee maker shampoos are very tiny no laundry bags no slippers or robesâ¦ expect less from a hilton brand for this location very disappointing as i brought the whole family and booked 2 rooms for the holiday nothing special you are only paying for the location thatâs about itâ¦;3
pros walking distance from the studios or the studio shuttle which picks you up from the front of the hotel cons reception staff who cannot follow clear instructions got charged on my credit card even though i had instructed the hotel that i was paying in cash even went twice to reception to make sure they understood this as i had already exchanged currency i was willing to pay in cash at check in but the receptionist said they have made note of my request and to pay on check out;3
staying for 6 nights with my son we took a fly away coach from lax to union street station which was 10 we got on the red line underground line to vermontsunset station 275 each then walked down the hill to the hotel weâve never been before we are pretty resourceful and we found this trip from lax pretty easy room was ok nothing special but clean was overlooking the car park beds comfy and room service made up our room the air conditioning in the room works well but is the loudest air conditioning unit iâve ever heard microwave fridge and safe in the room some sort of coffee maker but the coffee is horrible pool is clean sun beds clean and towels provided pretty quiet round the pool used the gym which is pretty small with minimal equipment but has;3
i spent four nights there last week i wasnt given a clear ideally printed instruction how i was getting a discount from empire parking as a result i was overcharged it would take me ten minutes to reach this garage located at 303 w 96 st on a couple of occasions i was told at the garage that they were full and then when i was about to leave an attendant would tell me but because youre a good man ill take your car rooms on the 11th floor were more spacious and well equipped than on the 10th the hotel has also a discount arrangement with a local reasonable dinner;3
the desk staff could have been more friendly and eager to help pick up of trash and used dishes could have been faster the bathroom shower was the most complicated ive ever used and not user friendly at all internet charge which is rarer and rarer these days and irritating given the high room rates;3
elevators did not work during our entire stay waited very long for the service elevator upon checking in we were told breakfast was included it was not we received vouchers for 675 for breakfast manager promised to credit me 15 for the inconvenience never did staff was okay but not too bright and security person did not speak english i asked him where the breakfast room was he directed me to the restrooms;3
the location of the hotel is good the stuff were polite and helpful but the cleaniness of the room was awefull the breakfast was meh lot of the time there was no fruits at all to be honest i expected more from this hotel;3
nice staff very expensive everything you only get free wifi if you book directly through hilton but the hilton site didnt give the discount for the room the dinner buffet was 58 per person which is way too expensive when you can walk to universal city walk and have a decent meal at a far more affordable price;3
every staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful our toilet plugged the very first day and they fixed it very quickly our only complaint was the noise outside our door from the hallway at night voices seemed very loud and someone was puking in the hallwaythe second night we were there however the beds were pretty comfortable we only lost a little sleep;3
pretty much standard park hotel big good size rooms and bathrooms great view from the 11th floor hotel bar restaurant reasonably priced for a hotel i assume that is to compete with the universal city walk which is five minutes wall brisk there is a shuttle service but since the walk is as i said 5 minutes though uphill via a bridge we never used it one can take the shuttle down or walk downhill to burbank and the metro where there is also a fatburger an carls junior and a subway you can take the metro one stop to hollywood worth doing downside place is dull and feels pretty isolated not theyre fault also the smell of cleaning fluid everyday after our room was cleaned;3
the initial sight of the reception area a window on the side of a long narrow tatty hallway was a bit off putting i appreciate that having travelled from the uk and being rather tired did not help it is an amaturish sort of set up the two nights we were there we never saw the same person twice in reception they looked to be a series of students making some cash in the holidays the room unce we had exited the small and very slow lift was long and narrow too so narrow that the door struck the end of the bed as we entered the room too was tatty but the bed was comfortable and the room quiet probably because we overlooked a well between the buildings otherwise no real complaints slept well not many facilities but we survived;3
hotel is average but the location is good i dont like the heater in the room it takes 3 to 4 hrs to increase the temperature of the room from 65 to 73 fthere are much better hotel in la to stay at same price i did not try the food in there because there are lot of good options near universal city walk which is 7 minutes distance from there;3
just back from a weekend in nyc and stayed here for the first time i am a regular budget visitor to big apple so here are my thoughts the good 1 location just two blocks away from high line and easy walk to west village cafe etc also a very safe area 2 price i paid 111night inclusive no sneaky resort fee crap which is amazing for nyc and 3 lastly a solid night of sleep even on the twin bunk bed with lumpy mattress with the unadjustableheat cranking window open and ac fan on i did actually get a great night of sleep which lets face it is the most important thing it was a cold winter weekend and hotel was fairly empty so no guest noise to worry about the bad 1 rooms are insanely small all you get in the bunk rooms are four hooks and a couple of;3
we used this hotel for a few days to attend a family celebration the location is lovely very close to central park convenient for good restaurants and other amenities such as the shopping at columbus circle we were prepared for a small room as others have said this is new york but were disappointed to find it rather tired especially the bathroom here the paint on the door was blistered and peeling and the shower screen on the bath was too small to keep the water off the floor lovely toiletries went some way to compensate curiously there did not appear to be an option to reuse towels in the interests of the environment we must have arrived at a bad time as the queue to check in was longer than that for security at the airport and this within days of the;3
i chose the hilton at universal city for one reason and one reason alone location location location ok maybe two reasons tripadvisor gave this hilton a slight edge over the sheraton next door the hilton was walking distance to universal studios which meant we could skip the rental car entirely for our short stay the other benefit was having a home base nearby where we could relax in the middle of a hot afternoon or use the pool as for the hotel interior and amenities it was about what we expected for the 300 price per night reasonably nice but not super luxurious or trendy a little run down and dated in a few areas but clean the staff was very nice and we had no major issues other than the free internet which was slow enough to be unusablei;3
the lines were too long at checkin and to pick up your bag being held much too long a wait you must do something about it;3
my husband our two young children and i checked in at the front desk which was a pleasant experience after reading prior reviews we made sure to booka premier room to get to our room on the 11th floor we had to take a very small and stuffy elevator that was extremely slow and had to walk through a dark hallway maze to find it the room was what we expected nothing fancy clean and working air conditioners which we needed since the weekend was a hot one during our stay we had a few minor issues if we wanted hot water we would have to run the water for at least 10 minutes before getting into the shower the irony is that in the bathrooms they ask you to help conserve water and reuse towels housekeeping would only leave as two towels and we would always have to;3
we were given a room with a broadway view but the windows are were so thin it was like sleeping in the street the second night we asked for a room with a courtyard view and it was even worse again the windows are so thin that we heard the air conditioning noise of all the outdated machines installed in the courtyard unbearable even with earplugs a pity because the hotel location is great but if you want to sleep go elsewhere;3
when you walk in its beautiful lobby friendly staff check in early great so far room on 34th floor not bad look around small but nice go into the bathroom this is what i founded gross got my room change upgrade even now i have a view great right this what i found the first three pictures are from my first room the second is the upgraded one beautiful bathroom a little small but nice heated floors and all but the staff is very nice;3
i found on hall way trays and next i found again exactly at same position carpet was nasty inside of the room the bathroom wasnt clean enough no microwave the hotel has a nice decoration and nice architecture but not enough cleaned like others hotel of same category anyway its was bad experience;3
this hotel is ok undergoing refurbishment work so parts look a little dated our room was clean and decent size comfy huge bed excellent shower only complaint was towels very small surprised as this is the land of large also couple of days no towels left at all but as sson as requested were brought to room desk staff quite helpful dependant on who you got watch out for airport transfer fees from airport to hotel 34 from hotel to airport 42 when i asked why was told that was the cost as hotel is on the upper west side bit out of the way for times square broadway central park etc but once we had sussed out the subway very easy travel tip get a metro card excellent value and two people can share the card if you have never been to usa before be;3
we chose this hotel for our week in new york due to the fact that it looked trendy so we expected very few children to be there and because it has a rooftop outdoor pool something which we find nearly impossible to get in manhattan the hotel was indeed very trendy including the room lobby and bar area the rooftop area had a small swimming pool with nice enough views of the upper west side they also had a small satellite bar on the rooftop as well which seemed to be open all day staff were friendly and helpful our room en suite were very very small and had lots of minibar related things in which we could buy but no tea and coffee making facilities i suppose though that this is not something you can expect in the us the bed was comfortable we didnt see a lot;3
the hotel is beautiful and the amenities are very good very well located and great restaurants and entertainment in the area i booked a standard queen room and it was extremely small two people cannot possibly coexist in this space be careful to ask about which room you are getting when you book;3
this is a fullservice hilton we stayed in a king suite with sofa bed while visiting universal studios due to its proximity to universal it is an extremely busy hotel as such even though we checked in past the check in time of 4pm our room wasnt ready the overall cleanliness of the room was fine except for the bathroom there was hair in the corners of the floor and behind the door and the tray that shampoo etc were sitting on was filthy other than the tray i didnt mention the other issues just to see if it would be cleaned up on subsequent days it was but the tray was never replaced the shuttle to universal came in handy there are some hilly areas to manage and one of us uses a wheelchair so we used the bus often a continental breakfast was included in;3
its a good job theres so much to do in new york as it means spending less time in this hotel room its was tiny it was loud with a view of a brick wall the air con was loud though it was good the bathroom fan was loud and the tv well i felt like i was back in the 90s it took up half the room saying that i strangely kinda liked it it had character and the decor was green my fave colour the room was always clean and made up housekeeping did the best they could with it our room was on second floor so could easily walk up the flight of steps to it when we eventually returned each day the lift seemed to take forever handy to subway and cafes crepes on columbus is very good just a couple of blocks away go there for a good breakfast overall;3
the rooms have been renovated but not a great renovation the shower is falling apart the tvs are old the bed is uncomfortable the closet has a curtain instead of door and the hot water takes forever to come out;3
travelled as a couple for new year the hotel is is located in a great place 5 minutes walk from central park and about 15 minutes away from the shops the lobby is lovely and the staff on the door are welcoming and very helpful the rooms are decorated nicely but they are tiny and have very limited space the rooms are stocked full of food and drink but this isnt free and is very expensive eg water 750 the mini barfridge is completely full but again very expensive there are coffee making amenities but you will also be charged for using these not a big deal but rooms only have paper cups just something i havent come across before the air conditioningheating works pretty well but they are quite noisy and unfortunately outside our window was a yard full of noisy;3
the checkin process was efficient and the lobby presents nicely the disappointment is that this is a hotel with interior rooms that face exterior walls of the hotel only and the view is not pretty water stains from the heatingac unit make for a very unattractive view see photos when i was about to go out for a drink about 11 pm i realized that i could not control the heat it was about 83f in the room i went to the front desk and reported that the thermostat isnt working he told me to try the unit on the wall i did it also was not functioning so i went downstairs again and this time another employee tried to fix it he could not so i was given another room the new room had a working thermostat but the room is not designed for queen bed there was not desk;3
the morningside inn at upper west town has a good location with the subway nr1 it is easy to get to the central parc times square and south ferry unfortunately no cooking facilites as promisedneat;3
dislikes the lack of hot water the roach hanging out in my bathroom all morning the paint peeling off the bathroom door the over priced breakfast buffet that ran out of coffee that said buffet handed me a receipt which reminded me tipping is not included and expected at between 1520 last time i checked if i seat myself get my own drinks and food there is no tip expectedparticularly when they now make 15 an hr likes nice decor large hallways big rooms for nyc otherwise fairly clean rooms great bars friendly staff an added note i got a good price on the room through orbitz which i recognize doesnt buy me the best room perhaps if i had been willing to pay more i would have had a better experience;3
the first night of our stay we were on the second floor facing the street it was so noisy outside that none of us slept well we asked to be moved to a quieter room the next night and ended up in a smaller interior room and it was perfectly quiet boy did we wish we had been there the first night too great location clean with the exception of the lobby bathroom which was in rough shape helpful staff;3
our stay our the new yorker was nice the location was very convenient to penn station and the theater district prices were decent nice art deco rooms tick tock restaurant next door great house keeping very family clean rooms front desk was accommodating but the room was mixed up they sent me a confirmation about upgrading and early check in but i didnt get that room they told me i needed to tell them since it wasnt in system they eventually got us the correct room but did try and charge us mkre then promised check prices and make sure you get what promised concierge could have been nicer he did not help and was sort of rude;3
i went there with good expectations from the reviews that i had read i pre booked a room with private bathroom on getting there i got my key and went to the room i was presented with an 8x8 sized room only on going to reception i was not the only person with the same issue 3 the man on the desk was very abrupt and asked for proof i had booked one and on showing him the booking he got on the phone to argue with i guess the manager the 2 other people asked for a refund but i couldnât do that as i have no credit card etc to pay elsewhere the man said to come back the day after at 11 as a room would be empty by then i viewed my opinion on this saying now iâm wasting a valuable day which i had a very busy schedule to keep to the shared toilet on my floor was blocked;3
the rooms were very small even by nyc standards ive stayed in several others that were better the room was shabby and looked worn the bathroom was really small the sink had a partial wall in front of it so that you had to stand off to the side my husband couldnt even shave in front of the mirror the rooftop bar was great though staff was friendly and helpful;3
great place but didnt have an atm in the hotel which was frustrating cause i had to leave the hotel to find one other than that it was a great place the hotel was located in a great place which was very nice was able to go to central park and the subway was very easy to get to the hotel is is decent shape for being so old would i stay there again yes ive stayed in many hotels in new york and almost all have had an atm there which made it so convenient for me so i was a little disappointed that this hotel didnt have one;3
not really but apparently it could happen at the empire hotel you see they were filming gossip girl in the lobby and in front of the hotel today i had called down early for a 1pm checkout rather than noon and don told me that that would be fine 1pm was the latest i could check out without additional payment i thanked him at 5 minutes after 12 noon the housekeeper ignored my do not disturb sign and knocked i told her i had a 1pm checkout i was rushing now having to go to the post office to mail a box pause and be quiet on the first floor while filming was going on then rush back to meet the 1pm deadline at 1230pm my key would not let me back into my room i hurried down to get a new key paused outside the elevator again with others until we heard;3
we spent 4 nights in this hotel the rooms are nicely decorated but at bit worn out there is not a lot of space to put your luggage but i suppose this is always the case in new york the personnel was friendly and the hotel is very well located to visit new york by foot or subway our main issue was that our neighbours did a lot of noise and you can hear everything through the walls and doors we recommend rooms that are in the upper levels as the ac make a lot of noise in the lower levels besides the noise problem we recommend this place as the bed is comfortable the room is clean the bathroom is modern and the hotel is very well located;3
i guess i shouldnt be surprised about the state of the hotel room since it is in new york but comparing it to other nyc hotels i have to give the hotel an average rating the location was great but the rooms were extremely small they attempted to update the room with the decor but it really did not cover the aging hotel the air conditioner was extremely loud and smelled a little moldy they removed one shower door and the bathroom floor always got wet during a shower there was a bit of rust on the shower and a little mold in the corner the hotel lobby was very dim and all i could think was what are they hiding although the doormen were friendly they didnt make any attempt to help us get a taxi;3
i stayed at the hotel for 2 nights i had a business meeting to go to and mohammed was very accommodating in expediting my check in very nice and professional he is a great asset to this hotel thank you very much;3
the location of this hotel is great especially if you want to attend a performance at the lincoln center which is a stone throw away our room was clean but the bathroom was awfully small no room to move around the room was an interior room good size but quite dark with poor ventilation a musky smell was noticeable the lobby was tastefully decorated but quite dark and a bit run down although the hotel has been renovated i think another more thorough remodeling is neede3d;3
well what can i say my girlfriend and i came her all the way from new zealand maybe it pays to be from far away because the clerk was very impressed and chatted away to us about lord of the rings and nz things anyway the hotel itself was quite small but i wasnt expecting the ritz the room was small but had a great bed and the whole place was clean including the bathroom i think it is a us thing the toilets have such a narrow hole and kept blocking because of us but service was so quick and a guy nicely unblocked it late at night for us and wouldnt even accept a tip really thought this was beyond the call of duty and so polite didnt get his name but think he was the janitor we found the subway stop was a short walk up or down from the hotel and once on;3
we booked this for a 6 night break good location being central hotel room was bit dated and a little on the small side for 2 of us to be expected on the whole a nice hotel and staff were friendly i was a bit disappointed that they charge 5 dollars an item to store luggage for 2 hours they even charged 5 for a rolled up picture in a tube that was slightly to big to fit in bag shame my nice pleasant stay ended in this way apparently there is another hotel that does the same in nyc didnât expect this from a wyndham hotel;3
this is an older hotel across from lincoln center at 63rd street broadway and ninth ave near central park and columbus circle you would stay here mostly for that location at more or less reasonable rates relatively speaking my experience was fine but i can see that others might disagree depending on what they expect and value my single queen room was tiny tiny tiny with an interior view i was traveling alone two people would stumble over each other in that space i am sure the hotel has larger rooms but im guessing they are still small if space is important to you ask detailed questions about room size that said the room was not overly expensive by new york standards so its a tradeoff and the room and hotel had been renovated somewhat;3
not the most comfortable room i have stayed the last few weeks in my latest travels the room was hot and couldnt open the one window i had in the room my shower was missing a door and when i called valet ahead of time and the front desk lady gave the valet the wrong ticket number and i waited almost an hour down stairs in the lobby for my car to be brought to me which delayed me for my appointment that day and for the 72 a night that you charge for valet this shouldnt happen;3
water in tub rustyotherwise okay would never drink that water great location near to lincoln center and the dining room is very nice comfortable bedscheck in never before 3 wish they offered an apple or free coffee;3
i stayed there for one reason and one reason only chuck bass bought it what a let down small room tiny bathroom narrow hallways super slow elevators lousy ac though the bed is nice do not go unless u really like chuck bass;3
room was clean staff was nice airport shuttle was good but sadly poor internet connection not sure we will book same location again for our future staying it could be perfect if internet signal was good;3
location was great about a 5 minute walk from penn station front desk clerk was very pleasant told us we would be in a small room that night but would move us to a larger room for the remainder of our stay the hotel doesnt have an elevator which is stated on the website but we missed seeing the desk clerk promptly helped getting our luggage up the stairs the first room was very small no closet no room to put our luggage had to store it in front of the door our window faced 8th ave and heard nyc traffic all night after being moved to the larger room as promised our stay was very pleasant room was clean bed was comfortable still a no frills hotel but for a great location friendly staff wed consider staying again;3
clean and tidy hotel however some gripes first i booked through bookingcom when getting to the hotel i find that my hhonors membership perks free wifi and water will not be honoured because of booking through a third party that wasnt advertised by bookingcom so disappointed at both big companies as the little man in the middle gets the financial hit have to pay extra money for wifi and drinking water which i find outrageous for a hilton hotel high prices at the bar and a staggering 28 per person per day for a buffet breakfast 18 for continental next i drove here fully expecting to pay the advertised 28 per night parking although that again is ridiculously high for a hotel guest however because my car does not fit in the parking garage 64 i have to use;3
what can i say other than great location the hotel needs a total revamp considering their were 3 adults in a room it wasnt big enough to swing a cat the carpet needs to be replaced very old and dirty didnt take my shoes off in room as it looked that dirty thought creatures might be living on the floor check in was a nightmare considering long journey was not allowed to check in until after 3pm considering check out is at 11 you would think a room would be done by then especially when most people check out early anyway on check out you have to pay for luggage to be kept there if your journey isnt until later admittedly only â£2 but still a cheek we rang reception for tea or coffee facilities which they did send up to our room only to be charged â£20 dollars for two;3
we stayed here two years ago and had no complaints however we were slightly disappointed this trip we were here right before xmas so the rooms were obviously extremely expensive we were put in a room that was so small we could barely walk around the bed though the rooms are modern and funky they are now looking very tired we also had a major problem with the ac in our room we would wake up in the middle of the night in a sauna there was no way however to control the temperature in the room we made a complaint the next day but the second night was no better if we were going to stay a third night i would have demanded to change rooms;3
this place has an awesome location and this 30s feel to it however it has small rooms mine facing into a wall and worh no fridge in it there is also no breakfast and it would use a big refurb as well;3
the hotel is convenient to the upper west side the staff is very nice and friendly the rooms are all different very sizes some being very small there is a row of rooms where the room entrance is in the stairwell the elevators are very small the hotel is clean but the room decorsetupcarpetingfurniture is old and worn the decor isnt consistent in all of the rooms the room that i was in didnt have many outlets something small but because of the limited outlets had to unplug the coffee machine in order to charge my cell phone the hotel is clean but clearly needs renovating it looked like some of the roomsfloors were more fixed up than others;3
arrived at penn station from niagara 5 min walk to hotel 30 min walk to circle line pier 45 min walk to one world observatory 10 mins to empire state rooms okay safe in room good hot water bed comfy but compact room;3
i stayed at the hotel for one night instead of five because they wouldnt let me leave my luggage for one night other than that the rooms are very nice price is reasonable wifi is not free no breakfast;3
i recently stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in september while enjoying all the sites that nyc has to offer and my conclusion meh it wasnt great it wasnt terrible it just sort of existed the location is fine its a little out there but its only a 1520 minute subway ride to all the good stuff the hotel is 3 blocks away from the nearest subway station but it only took a few minutes to walk there were lots of little stores just a couple blocks away in case you need anything the building faces central park which is nice the street was never too busy or noisy my room faced away from central park which kind of sucked but at least it was quiet other reviews have warned about the size of the rooms and theyre right theres enough room for a bed an end table;3
just back from 4 days at the new yorker hotelcheck in was great no probs lady at desk was great quick helpfulroom was on 36th floor with some great views over new york 6 lifts only 2 workingbeing updated soonwitch resulted in queueing long waits especially morning timeso allow more time the room was very small but adequate for time were there the bed was very comfortable clean tidy with good house keeping every day we only slept washed as out all day night we used tic tock dinner for breakfast as it was convenient but tasty with a typical new york menu or what ever you wanted coffee refillsthe hotel is old dated in need of renovation but dont let that put you off the location is wonderful if youre visiting new york city with all big attractions;3
plus 1 excellent buffet breakfast 2 excellent relaxed friendliness of staff 3 nice view 4 bed ok minus 1 difficult location towards city because of position on hill coming back upwards to hotel is not that easy and taxis are difficult to findnot willing to do the short distance only universal studio is very easy to each 2 bedroom a bit worn out 3 basic bathroom with minimal luxury and lack of basic soap products;3
pros the hotel is well situated for sight seeing it is also well priced with a friendly staff and a plentiful breakfast option for not much money cons the room was quite dumpy with a fairly poorly constructed mattress the air conditioner was quite weak the wifi was terrible even the paid option the breakfast was not particularly well cooked or seasoned and vitally the hot water for the entire hotel shut off for almost 24 hours right during shower times;3
i stayed at the empire hotel from dec 31jan 2 the staff was very helpful and attentive i was able to attend the nye rooftop party which was very nice they later had a private party for hotel guests which was also very nice the rooms are a bit cramped but ive stayed in worse places i would recommend this hotel if youre able to stay for a discounted rate because the excellent customer service didnt justify their rates;3
ive always loved staying at the empire the service and location cant be beat i will say that the last couple times ive stayed it feels pretty worn down the dark carpeting and rooms need a refresh;3
on arrival at the hotel the grand foyer is lovely unfortunately the checkin was not particularly friendly arriving at approx 130am we were dealt with in a curt manner and no friendliness from the man rooms are very small and certainly not the photo that was shown in the virgin holidays images as the room was just to sleep we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view no response was received the elevator situation is main issue with the hotel we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning we chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up returning to their;3
i stayed at the new yorker while conducting business in new york the reason i chose the hotel was its location it was a walking distance or a somewhat short taxi ride to the places that i needed to be checkin was a breeze i was hardly at the checkin counter for a minute before i had my room key and was on my way to my room the checkin clerk was very efficient and courteous this was about the only very good thing about the hotel there were supposed to be renovations which have taken place so i didnt expect to be greeted by old stale carpet smell when i got to my floor i stayed on the 29th perhaps the renovations didnt include carpet replacement or deep cleaning the furniture in the room looked ok the room however didnt look 100 clean i could see some debris;3
the good news wifi is free the registration line was short they upgraded my room the room was big the location is close to the train station bus station and subway the bad news parking is 60 per day i forgot my toothbrush before a meeting i went to the front desk for a new one they told me they had them but i needed to go to room and call room service i left for the meeting unbrushed the bathroom was small and the toliet paper roll was akwardly place behind the door they had plastic water cups at night the room was cold the bedspread was thin and there were no extra blankets in the room in the morning i was late for a meeting i came down to check my bags but the line was 12 hour long i walked 1 12 miles to my meeting with my bags this was;3
the empire is flashy upon entry into the lobby but the rooms are in serious need of some tlc i dont think the empire should hire the same contractors to do the building work thoughsome pretty shoddy workmanship no fan in the bathroom means some major humidity problems the rooms are quite small and the carpet is hurting the booking we made through priceline stated standard room with king queen or two double beds upon request and we were hassled when we checked in and asked for two double beds the hotel wanted to charge us an upgrade of 50 per night but we dug in our heels and got it without paying extra only catch was that it was on a stinky smoking floor but the room itself didnt smell of smoke thankfully good location just a couple blocks from two subway;3
if you are obese or clostrophobic you do not want to stay herebut we found this to be a fine little hotel for our visit everything about this hotel is tiny lobby elevator stairway hallway roomsbut it is clean the staff was friendly and helpful and the bed was comfortable the only problem we had was that the window air conditioning unit did not cool as well as we would have liked but we were so tired from our wanderings in the city that we slept great anyway please note that this hotel is not near any famous attractionsbut it is a mere 3 blocks from a subway stop that can take you anywhere and there are many restaurants within a 6 block walk we found this hotel to be charming and quite suitable to our needs sleeping bathing while in new york;3
my staff was not as comfortable due to the small room size and the outdated amenities the bathroom is very small and i ran into the door several times one must step back and to the side in order to close the bathroom door once in it;3
best thing is the chef hugo who made breakfast every morning in the hotel he mad the best omelettes and waffles and was very charming and friendly excellent customer service skills thank you hugo one thing that would be helpful to offer free internet access in the foyer rather than charge so much for 10 minutes access;3
the astor on the park was a basic hotel with minimal facilities ie tv cd player fresh towels daily pay per minute internet out of all the receptionists we met during our 4 day stay not one had a kind word or even a hint of a smile they were rather unhelpful when we asked about money exchange and directed us incorrectly down the wrong street the concierge was friendly but we soon realised he worked on commission based sales of trips so we ended up stalking navy seal style through reception on a morning to avoid him taxis to the hotel were a fortune so we ended up staying in at night with a bed picnic of beer and reeses cupakes the bed was comfy but i think there may have been some health and safety issues regarding the heating the onoff dial was ancient and red;3
visited ny for 2 nights in august reception staff were helpful as was the concierge who deserves special mention for his advice assistance and provision of free maps the hotel is impressive but once you leave the luxurious reception the rooms leave something to be desired i booked two superior double rooms but although furnished to a high standard are small and cramped other reviewers have commented on the bathroom and shower i also found it impossible to shower without flooding the floor i thought the shower door was missing but no it just has a gap a terrible design flaw in any bathroom if it was designed as a wetroom then fine but it clearly was not never mind a cup of tea or coffee always helps not in this hotel im sorry of all the hotels i have ever;3
this is a hard one for me we stayed 2 nights here last week the room was fine and clean so it worked for us but im a bit concerned about the electric system our tv wouldnt work so someone came up to try to fix which ended up just replugging into another outlet as the one it was plugged into was dead this was concerning because there was an extension cord with several things plugged into it including a space heater which we never used the floor had a weird slope to it and the rug had some bare patches the management was extremely nice but the electric issue would keep me from returning;3
reminded them about my aaa discount when i arrived and twice it was accidentally left off my room check in sheet 70 was the difference so important finally after the dork at the front desk made the change i got the discount;3
little rooms no space in double double room old shower its impossible to wash no coffee maker no refrigerator very small wardrobe no space for closes long wait for porter 40 min good location;3
you probably wont get much sleep if your a light sleeper as there is way to much noise to get any good sleep the facilities and staff are adequate and you definitely get what you pay for location is amazing though and really easy to get to anyway you need to go to via the tube station 2 minutes away;3
we really liked the hotel the staff were all fab really polite and helpful it has been so lovingly put back together again the detailing stands out a mile the room was really cute the bellboy uniforms are amazing the bar looks stunning and on and on it has a lovely feel about it and having a cafe gitane there is fantastic although the staff there are a bit shockingly slow i donât think we would come back in winter months again we were in and whatever we did we could never get the temperature right in our room admittedly new york was cold while we were there but we ended up either being so cold we couldnât sleep or so boiling hot and impossibly stuffy that we couldnât sleep it was not a great combination it was a shame because i think just about;3
considering that its now almost impossible to book a decent nyc hotel room for less than 250 us per night i jumped at the 184 rate at a last minute travel website for a weekend stay and the hotel is exactly what i expected for that price its small and despite photos to the contrary not very chic but it was very clean and the renovation id read about was done on the 5th floor where my room was sure its a tiny room but all amenities worked the bed had a fine mattress and good linens and the bathroom was above average the front desk staff was friendly the hotel is just three blocks from a subway stop and since its on central park west cabs are plentiful if you will be spending hours on end in your hotel room this is not the place for you but if you are;3
this hotel was right where you couldwalk to everything shoppingsubwaycoffee shopjust a cozy little place to stay;3
arrived after tiring journey about 345pm having booked two twin rooms and one double for a five night stay one twin not ready and the double was the size of a rabbit hutch complained to staff who blamed the travel agent for booking an express room upgraded to a larger size but cost 284 extra we were given complimentary wifi in our rooms by way of apology all rooms were way past there best decor was old and dated with pealing paint and chipped furniture the wonky blind in our room was black down the edges that said the rooms were clean and the beds and linen were fine dont make the mistake of thinking the water bottles by the bedside are complimentary in small print it states its 8 a bottle purchase the same bottle next door at the drug store for 2 the roof top;3
my friend and i traveled to nyc and last minute added a night to our weekend stay we ended up booking the jane mostly because the price was good and it was available we stayed in a bunk room which was somehow smaller than it looked in the photos but we were expecting small so no big deal the rooms were just more narrow than they looked online when we checked in everyone was really friendly and accommodating the bathrooms were close to our room which was nice truly my friend and i liked the value and vibe of the hotel and planned on returning in the future that is until we woke up the next morning t find someone had been in our room while we were out the night before and they stole out tickets to the ballet so the night the tickets went missing we had gone to dinner;3
excellent location the major reason with price for our selection the staff were pleasant if a little busy flustered when we checked in the room felt a little tired and some areas of the floor we were on were bing refurbished the room was nice enough but felt as if the standard premier inn furniture had been plonked in a room that could have benefited from a more tailored approach we would stay again but will ask for a recently refurbished room;3
this is a hotel where sometimes everything is great or then everything falls apart especially the heat and ac the location works great for me since my work is walking distance from there and a lot of good restaurants around the place;3
good hotel walking distance to universal studios in la its however not a thematic hotel looks more like a formal hotel for conventions check in can take sometime it offers comfortable rooms and service is ok;3
we booked our the suite for our family holiday to nyc which consisted of 2 double beds in the main room and a pull out couch in the living area comfortable beds to sleep in for being a suite i expected the decor and facilities to be a bit better there was no kettle for a cup of tea which youâd think for buying a room for 2000â¬ youâd perhaps get that at least towels and linen provided which was a bonus room smelt a bit damp on arrival the cleanliness of the bathroom was extremely poor first shower i took the curtain was off white and there was black hairs in the bathon the tiles bit off putting and disgusting especially when your in there first night we stayed was a saturday and on the sunday morning room service approached our door and walked in at 650am;3
small room yet clean if you are young travelers looking to save some money and not spend a lot of time in the room it is fine to stay here and then you can also get the bathroom out of the room if you are older couple like parents get the ensuite bathroom and try not to expect too much from the room it is very small tiny air condition yet everything was clean skip breakfast there is a bagel sandwich place around the corner;3
good location for a first time in london the room was clean and tidy the welcoming was quiet cold and unfriendly we enjoyed our stay there even if we barely spent time there apart from sleeping;3
i went with my family during the weekend everything was ok a along as we dont need to speak to front desk check in was just a check in nothing special this guy is bored of his job check out the guy who apparently is the superior gave hard time with the bill i asked him to check out 3 rooms and put everything in the same invoice he said he cant because the credit card if they already charge everything they can transfer everything to appears in the same invoice but this guy didnt want it however he transfer one breakfast to one of the other rooms that still had balance this guy gave me attitude and while i was dealing with him he began chatting with other guests and the other agents so disrespectful i asked him to finish with my check out and;3
stayed 2329 december good location amazing helpf staff as a base it was more than adequate rooms are small and are clean but not sparkling lifts often out of order resturant good but expensive overall we had a great stay in nyc;3
we had visited new york many times and i always wanted to stay in this iconic hotel so when i got tickets to go to a concert in madison square garden i booked it was very good for access to the subway and within walking distance of many of the attractions loved the older style feel to the hotel only thing that let it down was after we checked out and went to leave left luggage i was shocked when they charged us 5 per bag left first time l have ever been charged to leave my luggage in a hotel i have just checked out of;3
a stay at the new yorker is not a cheap experience even with a booking site it was clean but limited no in room fridgeand the room while clean is small with paper thin walls ideal for staying in nyc because of location the staff is friendly and considerate which made the stay bearable if you are looking for a centrally located space with limited amenities this is your place;3
the hotel located in chinatown a good distant from the metro station and everything you can need in the city we stayed there and walk to the 911 memorial took the ferry to see the status of liberty and brookline bridge so we didnt spend money on the metro its also closed the village so if you want to explore down town of the city this hotel is great for it and not to loud for the city;3
just stayed here for 4 nights had room 301 service was good fresh towels every day bed made up wifi worked for me in the 3rd floor even though they admit it might not reach higher than the 2nd no problems even with larger photo uploadsthere is an alternative loungeroom for internet too cell reception is nonexistent though the fridge in the room is nice but i only used it as a table a table and a chair would have been more useful actually walls and doors are really thin you can hear people walk and talk when passing by like they are inside the room luckily other guests were pretty civilized water pressure and temperature is excellent but the shower has only a fixed head i dont like that there is a tv in the room but unfortunately mounted left and pretty;3
as the parents of the bride we had many guests at the hotel and the bridal couple the inconveniences distracted from our enjoyment of family and friends gift bags were not given out to the guests without reminders from myself and my daughter having to continually ask for different keys and then get totally locked out was annoying then we were asked to change rooms when i refused there seemed to be no problem with fixing the lock on the door all my guests were unhappy with the elevator situation the housekeeping staff and bellmen were excellent;3
its hard to write a review on property that is set in a very over priced city heres all the postives the room was clean and housekeeping was very timely very dog friendly i was there for the westminster dog show and it was quite convenient location was very good for all the touristy things as well we could walk to many iconic sites check in and check out very easy now for the negatives even though im trying not to let price affect my feelings about the place it does play a part as the rooms are super tiny not much bigger than a nice size walk in closet tv channels not working and would go in and out not that i was watching much tv but its nice at the end of a busy day to watch a show if id pay 100night it would get a 4 or 5 star but paying over;3
my fiancã© and i stayed here for the night to spend the day in the city nothing fancy there was a hole in my pillowcase ceiling was broken and there was a bit of dust on the furniture however it was the perfect location and the price was great considering its in manhattan nice size room as wellalthough we upgraded to a king room very difficult to find a size room like the one here in the city definitely a perk staff was friendly and helpful a side note the roof top lounge hasnt been open since last year so no roof top access we were so disappointed since it states they had s lounge up top overall it was a decent stay just nothing special but excellent price;3
this hotel is close to many attractions is clean and reasonable and furnished adequately there are accessible units and parking coffee is furnished and there are many restaurants nearby i would definitely stay there again;3
this hotel was very accommodating with late check in the room was nice and comfortable although the ensuite showed signs of wear and tear everything worked no maintenance was required i was given a choice of which room i wanted and that was a nice surprise i hadnt expected the complimentary internet service was good when it worked the system kept dropping out and when i called the it support it was found the server kept putting my laptop into the spam filter and dropping me off when it worked it was reasonable fast the complimentary breakfast buffet was somewhat disappointing there was not a large range of items to choose from and there was never any bacon on offer which i would consider a breakfast standard item the food was cooked well i was hoping to get dinner;3
this was the second part of our la vacaction and having stayed here in the past both on business and pleasure i knew the area and hotel well i did find the staff to be a little on the straightforward side not overly friendly but professional our room was immaculately clean but even with the dnd sign on the door the maid came in and cleaned anyhow for a hotel chain that is supposed to offer complimentary wireless internet and oops bag forgotton bathroom amenities they lacked i did get my high speed internet but it came with a price tag and no oops bag doesnt that dock qa points although the neighborhood isnt the best we didnt feel unsafe and even made use of the metro subway to spend the day at universal studios beats the parking costand walked home in;3
this hotel has a great location in midtown with plenty of dining nearby the staff is lovely both at the front desk and especially the doorman and the lobby is nicely decorated great beds thatâs where it goes downhill for me the rooms are tiny but itâs nythe issue is lack of space in the bathroom carpets i would be afraid to put bare feet on and no place to put luggage if you have a lot i stayed twice in a two week span first while the rooms at the front have a street view itâs noisy with no way to adjust temperature the second time on the 9th floor facing a brick wall it was quiet and i had the ability to adjust temperature there is a gym but itâs dated and smells dingy donât bother this was booked by my company and i didnât pay for it if i had iâd have;3
our room was so small we couldnt lay out our luggage properly room was hot no way to control temperature and wifi is the room is extremely expensive and un reliable great location and the staff were very friendly;3
small room major construction going on outside of my window outdated interior room bar downstairs was the best part of the hotel good location across from madison square garden close to trains front desk checkin was fair not very personal security was around and checked for room keys in evening i wont be back;3
i already answered this question staff were wonderful was not happy that i was charged for my room b4 i checked out and without my permission to do so this put my card over the limit and then i was charged again when i checked out saying that the 500 would go back on my card in 45 business days this card was to be used exclusively for my trip and the charges put on by the staff checking me in caused my card to be over the limit and i could not use it for shopping in new york the last day i was there;3
ok this depends what you expect out of a hotel firstly when you arrive after travelling some distance from the uk at a hotel and your room isnt ready and they dont know when it will be ready fair enough weve only had the room booked for some time and you are told you will have to wait ok thats kind of fine but when you ask for somewhere to freshen up get changed etc you are told there are toilets upstairs hmmmm not exactly the warm welcome we were expecting so off we went to the toilets to freshen up and get changed thankfully pasquale became available on reception who was far more helpful and managed to get us an idea of when our room will be available thanks pasquale the reason for the 3 rating is this hotel is its location or it would have been;3
this hotel is a mixed bag convienent to lincoln center and all the things one would want but everything is a la carte the bed was very comfortable and i slept well the room is super small by even nyc standards and it is cluttered with things for you to buy you even have to pay for your first morning cup of coffee 3 in the keurig provided virtually every space is covered with things it was almost impossible to put my ipad anywhere to work every outlet has somethign plugged into it so it was difficult to plug in devices unless you wanted to sit them on the floor one word of warning about the lobby bar they put a 20 fee on the tab and then still have a line for gratuity i almost missed it all in all this was an ok stay i travel a great deal and this;3
i only stayed here 1 night on my way to fly back home i would of liked to of stayed here longer i choose the hotel as i was seeing a show at lincoln centre before i left friendly people at check in room very nice and quiet location was great to get up and be in central park early now the 1 negative i had to call down and ask for someone to come and remove a cockroach from my room it did take 10 mins for someone to come i stood on the bed and tracked it so i could tell the guy where it went im not a fan of spiders so this was a huge problem for me however i have to understand that it certain places you get cockroaches we dont in the uk i was on the 10th floor so no idea how he got there i did mention to the woman on check out that i had a cockroach and she was;3
stayed 12 nights and spent a few days in an upgraded room with a view of chrysler empire state and madison square pros delightful service from checkin and security staff fairly easy to get a free room upgrade a lot of ppl complain abt the resort fees but i think itâs convenient i had made an online purchase for tickets that didnât get through so i didnât hesitate to make an international phone call to my credit card company i also had to make an amazon return so i was able to print out the return bar code from the business center it eased me of the small anxieties i get when travelling convenient location can walk to most broadway shows chelsea markethigh line super close to madison square garden which is great if you donât want to wait too long in line at a;3
we spent two nights at the hilton universal city overall the experience was pretty average but it does serve a purpose our experience was slightly marred by the fact that we turned up and theyd lost our reservation then charged us a higher rate than wed originally been quoted they did put us in a lovely room with a great view of the studios and the hills and its very convenient for visiting hollywood but all in all its a fairly soulless place and very expensive too you have to pay for parking on top of your room room service and telephone calls are extortionate and you have to pay for breakfast as well it all adds up to a pricey trip;3
though the room was pleasant and clean the ac was weak at night the room was a bit noisy the only morning coffee provided was a minuscule urn of coffee for all hotel guests in the lobby finally i had to request an extension cord to plug in my laptop by the cramped desk;3
we stayed here in may for a week as we got a good deal for hotel flight with our airline we really loved it and for the price it was good value although not without its faults the hotel has a cool interior and is well located you really feel you are in a new york hotel the lobby goes from nice and quiet to really chaotic it seemed a popular choice with holidaymakers the concierge staff were always great and very helpful with tips on where to go in the city some of the reception staff were a little on the icy side yes you lady with the long brown hair our room was a lot bigger than i expected nice and clean really liked the design and lovely bathroom too it was an internal room though and we were overlooking an internal courtyard if you can call it that with a;3
my wife and i stayed in this hotel while on holiday in california for a week the service from the staff was good they were very helpfull the rooms were nice and spacious nice size bed but the bed we had was very skweeky the hotel was neat and tidy the location was ok but it would depend on where you would be sightseeing we had a rented car and went all around la so the location was ok there is public transport close if needed overall for the price we paid it was value for money we had free wireless internet access and it also included a nice full breakfast which is one less worry trying to find a breakfast place each morning;3
the staff was awesome from check in to check out friendly funny patient couldnt ask for better the room however could use some tlc plate covers missing paint chipping rust in the shower stall the bed was comfortable but everywhere we looked we thought how sad i bet this was a really nice place in its day the neighborhood was a little sketchy but then it is hollywood;3
good location for people who do not drive a car and prefer public transport most staff were very friendly and helpful michel g for instance but unfortunately some were not interested at all a russian girl who works at the reception was not interested in our questions and spent around 10 min talking to some russian guests staying in the hotel whilst other people were waiting to be served we asked for directions by public transport but the answer from her was to get a taxi and when we said we would still like to use public transport she looked at me as though i cannot afford a taxi the over person at the reception almost sure he was russian too when asked for directions just said he does not know where it is and that was the end of the story could somebody please;3
so disappointed new york has been on my bucket list for yearsroom was teeny tinyour view was of windows directly opposite usð tiles in bathroom dirtylifts an absolute nightmarewaiting for ages staff sosothe doormen outside were the most friendly and helpfulwould not return;3
this hotel is expensive because of its central location right across from lincoln center the first night 3 of 4 elevators were out the battery for my remote died and i couldnt get the coffee maker to work moores was a rather pricey breakfast spot but the personnel were polite and served quickly i had to cancel one night and they did not charge for the missed night my room was quite small especially for two people but it was quiet;3
the breakfast was pretty great thanks hugo the rooms are not bad and good comfy bed i think it stated the pool is heated and it wasnt but the pool area is nice and great to relax in however i am giving a lower rating based on the following what really annoyed me is the house keeping im not talking about the room cleanliness but the lack of following directions i am the type of traveler how does not need my room to be cleaned everyday which we requested i hung the little sign indicating no house keeping and since we did no request anyone coming in i did not put anything away assuming no one would come in when we returned our stuff was moved so that the bed could be made and i happened to leave some change on the counter which the housekeeper took assuming it;3
we stayed here for 3 nights at double room with private bathroom room and bathroom was quite large and clean bed was uncomfortable and door at hall was noisy and woke up us all night location is very good near bus station tube stations and many shops and nice shopping centre tkmax poundlandprimarksainsburys room include fridge dishes plateforkknife and spoon cup;3
was minutes from lax and car rental place view from our floor 12 room was looking out over the city planes landing and taking off was quite a spectacle and quiet with the sound proof glass in our room hotel is very modern and clean we stayed for a week convenient because it is 20 minutes to hollywood beverly hills and beaches and many other sites shuttle that runs 247 to and from the airport so we had no worries of transporting back to the airport at 5am nice pool access parking was a nightmare all over la and pricey downsides to our stay was a reservation issue that was resolved immediately by the managers and you will have to pay for parking valet or otherwise every time you get in or out of your car no included breakfast or coffee even hotel restaurant is;3
my husband and i stayed here for 4 days it was around the corner from subway and short walk to central park we did have to change rooms after the first night because of the loud noise coming from the scaffolding that seems to be on almost every building usually wouldnt bother me but it was literally outside our window they were nice about the room change and gave us an interior room nothing special about the hotel as far as amenities go but we just needed a clean place to sleep at night and this place did the trick;3
i stayed here recently with my daughter check in was good staff were very pleasant and welcoming our room was a queen room on the 23rd floor it was small but appeared clean and as we didnt intend to be in it very much we were happy with it we went out for dinner and then decided to have an early night as jet lag overcame us we had been asleep for about 15minutes when we were woken by a very loud noise which was ongoing sounded like a large amount of water pouring onto the wall of the room i have never heard such a loud noise in a hotel room from something outside of my room we decided that we couldnt tolerate it phoned reception and were allocated another room on the 29th floor we werent particularly happy at having to repack and move but had no other option the;3
decent bar small rooms clean although tired good location but rooms near road are noisy room was either too hot or too cold very hard to control bathrooms are tiny and in need of repair although clean;3
stayed for 4 nights this month october 2011 good price booked through expedia and got a great rate for fairly last minute upon check in the reception staff were extremely rude to the point where they did not even make an effort to greet you awful awful service they did however allow us to check in at 10am when check in isnt normally until 3pm so that was great breakfast was basic but good and was included in the price of the room decent size room and very comfortable beds bathroom amenities were fabulous shampoo and conditioner very close to the nearest metro station about 3 minute walk strangely the hotel didnt have a do not disturb sign for the door so we had to tell housekeeping not to clean the room they ignored the request and did it anyway which;3
stayed during the blizzard of jan 2016 room was nice flat screen tv with hd channels really liked the roomy walkin shower a few downfalls is it took water about 58 minutes to get hot such a waste of water also the internet connection was not that great glad duane read downstairs and manhattan diner as well i would definetely stay here again subway stop right across the street 96th st station;3
in general terms the hotel is good especially in terms of pricelocation however it feels some somehow dated it has some very specific points that may annoy some guests hotel amenity restaurant it has two not what you would call inviting one is like a cafeteria the other is more upper scale internetfree wifi it gives free wifi to guests normal speed front desk not so good customer service it took us 12 minutes to check in a bit slow you will notice sometimes you come out of your room and there is i kid you not a line formed by around 100 people smoke free hotel yes hotel room air conditioning a bit loud cleanliness very good however big detail everyday when we came back the room smells weird it smells between cigar and coffee;3
after reviewing places to stay in nyc and looking for something different fun for my boyfriend and i we decided to book at the empire for a weekend getaway upon the mediocre unwelcoming checkin at the front desk we decided to head up to the rooftop for drinks until our room was ready great rooftop and relaxing atmosphere however when trying to talk to bartender he seemed more attentive to his coworker then actual guests once our room was ready we were disappointed from that point onservice was unfriendly the room itself was disappointing and looked run down and overused i took photos of mildew and chipping paint in the bathroom peeling wallpaper and what looked like water stains on ceiling i would definitely rate it below 3 stars and not worth the moneyon;3
small rooms great location no hot water to shower in the morning clean property friendly staff price was a bit higher than other hotels but the location is great went to a hockey game at msg very convenient close and great food nearby;3
checked in at 9am was told my room would be ready at 4pm so we left our bags with the valet went to universal until 415 and the room was not readythey said it was going to be 10 more mins so 30 mins later the room was still not ready after 45 mins we complained was finally given a room got to the room the key didnt work room was clean except carpet stained near nightstand nice size bathroom front desk staff needs better training in hospitality;3
stayed for 3 nights for a conference held in this hotel in april i had a conference discount for my room maybe for this reason my room is concise no coffee machine no water the washroom is small but still ok you dont stay inside when you are in downtown new york its within walking distance 10 min to broadway;3
first the good very reasonably priced minimalist but very well thought out rooms clean shared bathrooms although surprisingly few of them but i did not have a problem in the morning nice cool restaurant and bar to hang out and even one of currently the hottest clubs in manhattan on the first floor service was fine the bad for two days they had network connectivity problems wifi is fine but no internet many people complained the response was either uhuu or my it guy is resetting the router hours of no connection or constantly dropping connection and be aware poor cellular signal in the rooms i have verizon and to add insult to injury first on the list of amenities on their site is free superfast wifi i suspect this is a usual state of affairs at;3
i stayed in the hotel for 2 nights the sheets wasnt clean and it looks like the place needs a full renovation i stayed in a single room and i couldnt open even my handbag like a normal person the towels wasnt that clean and i could hear anything happening around even when the person next door entered the bathroom there is a microwave and an opportunity to cook in the floor few people did use it and my room had a smell of a kitchen the whole day no shampoo in the bathroom and two small pillows was given only i would recommend the place only if you are on a small budget;3
many of the rooms have connecting doors which let in a lot of noise from the next door room i asked to change rooms but could only get another room with a connecting door however i could also hear the people on the other side of me at times not my favorite obviously this is a hugely busy place and staff are always busy the concierge was enormously helpful and perfectly excellent and assisting with all my needs the front desk staff are efficient and less than friendly on arrival no one offered to assist with my suitcases in fact after a greeting they purposely leave you to manage your own suitcases this is not the friendliest of arrivals that i have encountered you get the feeling that they are so busy that their clients are just another number on checking in i;3
hotel is very stately not sure what was going on but folks seem preoccupied with work i saw at least 6 hotel personnel in lobby not one engaged my party with a smile or a welcome passed several folks in hallways not one said hi service just isnt on par with the stars without the hospitality this is just an old mt box the competition is too strong to compete on points room was nice n spacious for a ny hotel when you wash your hands in the bathroom the water comes out with force and hits the stopper and splashes right on you too funny place is nice and close to msg my view out my windows look into a hole if you cant check in then plan to wait 2540 minutes in a line to check your bag this line was a constant thing think you might have figured this out by now;3
we stayed for three nights at the hotel and it is what you pay for it is in need of some modernisation and some fix ups cosmetically the rooms were well worn but the bathroom was beautifully clean with some lovely clean white towels the bed was extremely comfortable much better than some higher priced hotels i have stayed at with my husband the room however was very very cold i had to ask for extra blankets as i was shivering however i do have to mention in the hotels defence that the weather was freakishly cold however most of the cold was blowing in through gaps in the window and i really do think the hotel should look into getting these draft holes fixed staff at the hotel were faultless concierge very friendly and helpful as was the nice lady who arranged;3
you get what you pay for location is fine super close to red lines and several places to eat we saw rooms on floors 810 several family members staying in different rooms and all were fine didnt see any curling carpet others complained of clean bathroom clean sheets etc halls are narrow and warm since ac is from window units in each room no big we werent there to hang out in the halls key west was not that good id recommend only for snacks and drinks not for an actual meal whatever you do dont ask the hotel to call a cab for you they call a car service that charges more than double what the city taxis charge we were appalled and dont make any long distance phone calls 22minute knowing all this id stay there again if i couldnt find;3
looks very impressive as you approach on the the street inside it has some old world charm but not as much as you expect from the outside we had a coffee and snack there from their snack bar and sat in the foyer the light feature and ceiling are fantastic it is in a great location but is probably noisy;3
not many affordable hotels in the area the room was decent sized room was clean but the bathroom was rough around the edges kind of a sketchy area but the parking 29day was fenced in and secured the staff was much to be desired not rude but could care less would i stay here again not if there was a better option;3
we got a room for four people and it was really big for a new york hotel bedroom it had two bathrooms too one in each side right next to the beds two i was frustrated a little bit by the fact that there was not a mini fridge in the bedroom nor a proper closet just a place where you could put your luggage and hang some clothes with a small vault i hated the shower i dont know if it was only in my room but the water was very weak and most of the time mildly cold the hairdryer they provide is a joke but the room in itself was very good very clean very proper the beds were very comfortable the concierge service was a little bit frustrating i needed cotton to remove my makeup and they didnt have it and didnt make any efforts to help me find a place where;3
partially renovated therefore some rooms updated hot water for shower iffy hair dryer did not work lobby furnishing shabby walkable restaurants transportation good staff helpful friendly;3
this hotel is located in east hollywood and is suitable for families visiting the area we stayed one night here and it was just ok the rooms were clean however there was an incident at the breakfast buffet that left a bad taste in my mouth a young mother with several children sat at the table next to us one of the children spilled juice while the mother was at the buffet station getting their food i told someone working in the dining area about the spill and he ignored it not only did he walk past the spill countless times but even after having it brought to his attention he did nothing at least put up a caution wet floor sign or something or better yet clean it up anyone could have slipped on it not to mention the children had to sit in that mess for their;3
the heaters were making loud clanking noises all throughout my stay there sounded like there was construction going on the toilet was always making flushing noises when no one had used it the shower arm wasnt working i called the front desk several times but no one answered the location was good but it just seemed like there was too much going on;3
on reading some of the reviews of empire particularly on the commercial websites we had high hopes for our stay at the empire perhaps our expectations were too high but at best i would put empire at average even for new york standards the rooms are very small windows rattle and allow considerable draughts the bathroom is very cramped approx 4 foot square and lacks any ventilation no complimentary water on arrival very small bottle priced at 7 staff were helpful avoid the 60 a night overnight parking parking lot at back on west 61st around 15 skybar was mostly closed for private parties and was also restricted due to a snow storm iâd say the bar is overrated in any event handy bar in downstairs lobby hotel is in a great location good selection of tv;3
when i checked in the front desk clerk advised me that i had somehow booked an accessible room when i booked my vacation through southwest airlines he advised it was best to book directly i advised i was ok with this but if he needed the room i would be ok with switching he said that to switch would cost more i said no thanks and kept the room i had paid for he kept reiterating that i should always book with hilton sort of sounding like i had done something wrong that i got an accessible room without needing it which this was not done on purpose that was the one that was booked for me the room was only different that it had handrails in bathroom and extra space as for the room it was comfortable and clean my only complaint was that there was no clock i found it;3
this hotel was very basic but the location was good with helpful staff location close to subway station for getting around and across the road from central park it was low cost and i guess you get what you pay for but our room was fusty and the radiator leaked and made a loud banging noise throughout the night we were there for 3 nights as a break from visiting relatives in boston so didn t spend much time in the room;3
impressive lobby checkin was quick but not very welcoming room was on the 22th floora bit small for the 4 of us 2 adults 2 teenagers but this is new york after all bathroom was a bit small too but with nice historic details and a good shower nice view of new york very close to penn station which was why we chose this location;3
we booked the new yorker based on the location that it had right on the 8th avenue next to madison square garden perfect location and great area to be in the front desk team was great and very helpful same as the concierge that helped us with maps and booking an airport shuttle we paid for a room with a view and we got one but that is where the fun began corridors look a bit shabby doors are still the old ones and just painted on top in a very cheap way room is extremely small while in the pictures on the website it looked at least to say huge so dont be deceived the ac was blowing right above the bed which made both me and my girlfriend extremely sick it was extremely cold in the room so you had to keep the ac on heating on the windows were not taken care of;3
spent one night prior to a tour hotel modern and clean but very close to airport room overlooked an airport car park and pool area very noisy and smelly from aircraft fumes if you want an airport stop over it is ok but nothing nearby so stuck in hotel unless you have a car;3
very good location and the staff are pleasant and friendly the rooms are small basic and a bit tired and our corridor was a little noisy as was unfortunately put in a room across from the ice dispenser machine the tick tock diner downstairs was great for breakfast wifi was also very good all in all good stay but have stayed in better city break hotels in new york;3
i have been using this hotel as our base to visit our grandchildren for years the elevators are very overdue to be replaced there are 6 elevators which if they work well would be enough for the building but each one runs so slowly if it is running at all that you lose patience the rooms in general are very nice clean well kept and the restaurant has very friendly and helpful staff i just wish i could go up and down without a hassle;3
this hotel is basic in need of modernisation the rooms are a good size but the bathrooms are poor the hotel is not centrally located however its well located for buses metro links it is only 4 stops on the metro to central hollywood where the chinese theatre hall of fame is located the staff at the reception were really friendly helpful breakfast was included however basic with long queues for egg station as only 1 cook on the 3 days we were their they ran out of pastries each day;3
i stayed here for two nights to attend a business conference being held there i have stayed at many hilton hotels over the years and this one had one of the slowest checkin process in addition the elevators were extremely slow they were under renovation one morning we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our dish to be delivered to our table during breakfast when asked when our food is coming the server stated that they were extremely busy and did not offer any appology the fitness room was extremely small for the hotel this size it had only two treadmills and a few other equipment when i reviewed my bill that came in via email i noticed that there was a breakfast charge that did not belong to me i had to call and get the charge reversed by providing the ticket;3
the new yorker a wyndham hotel has a convenient location in midtown however my friends and i found the room to be quite small there was limited space for three people to move around in and at one point the water in both the sink and shower was brown in colour;3
very noisy front desk staff not overly informative due to noise terrible for sleeping outside noise very clean but extremely small beds were comfortable but on low floor and all we heard was hooting and hollering throughout the night;3
the location of the hotel is perfect walking distance to central park the lincoln centre the main shopping areas the rockefeller centre and the empire state building the cocktails at the bar were also very nice and we had one every evening in the luxurious bar area before heading out the rooms unfortunately did not live up to the standard we were expecting we moved rooms on the first night as we were right next to an air conditioning unit which was very noisy i understand we were in central new york and it was bound to be noisy but this noise was unpleasant the next room we were in was on the 9th floor which was absolutely fine until i found a cockroach on the sink whilst getting ready the staff of the hotel were great and tried their utmost to sort things out for;3
stayed at the jane for halloween as i wanted something a little fun and different from the bowery sister hotel rooms were spacious wellequipped but definitely felt a bit budget the downsides are no room service no lifts and no door man to help you up the stairs with your luggage and bed is not all that comfortable no luscious feathery duvet here lighting is low so not great for doing any work its not the kind of place where youd want to chill in your room i had a nice balcony which was great on the positive side the staff were very jolly and helpful it is a cool hotel and in a nice quiet residential street the bar is amazing and the highlight of the hotel worth a visit even if you dont stay here i realise that it the price reflects the;3
the hotel is far from the attractions the room is ok but work in the hallway with painting and terrible odours was bad the hotel has only bar and restaurant occasionally and not during our stay the breakfast was very good;3
my sister and i visited her son and needed a place to stay we chose this place because it was around the corner from his apt i was disappointed in the size of the room and i really shouldnt have been being it was in nyc the room was super small and not much room to even open a large suitcase it was clean and the queen size bed slept pretty good and the bathroom was good sized the deadbolt on our door was broken and we told the front desk so we told them and they were aware of it there was peeling of paint and wood on the bathroom door along with cracks in the walls only one elevator serves this 9 story hotel and not more than 4 people can comfortably fit in it with a couple pieces of luggage so there will be a wait one of the few good things i can say about it is;3
this is one of the most affordable hotels located adjacent to msg and near times square and the empire state building the single rooms are quite tiny so if youre traveling as a family i would upgrade to a double room given its location to tourist hotspots expect a lot of crowds the lobby and restaurants are packed at all hours of the day the service is average but all things considered it is worth experiencing the historic hotel;3
the actual name of this hotel is confusing on this website it is called a days inn but in actuality it is just a days hotel nyc i am surprised that a wyndam properties would have a hotel of this shoddy interior space i read some reviews that mention some remodeling on the upper floors maybe the lobby is next old hotel old smelly lobby old room small room no curtains just blinds so street light seeped in we had a double bed for two of us butroom did have coffee maker tv wifi ironironing board and the location cannot be beat lots of restaurantsbakeries close to subway the reception staff was very patient and helpful and provided luggage storage we stayed just one night and i guess i would stay again if just for one night with the right price and if;3
we stayed at the new yorker from the 28th november 2021 upon arrival we found the hotels position to be perfect across the street from penn station opposite madison square gardens and just a few minutes walk from macys and the empire state the check in procedures are easy and simple however with a hefty 300 holding charge when we reached our first room all i can say is how disappointed i was having requested a to have an especially impressive room the room was tired poorly lit and decorated in a terrible shade of brown there was one tiny window which offered a view onto a brick wall back to reception who could not be more helpful and into a new room 2926 immediately better much bigger window much more light and the view was incredible straight onto the;3
we were on a long weekend break with our family and had booked a family room the location is great at walking distance from penn station macys empire state building and 5th avenue staff is friendly hotel has the old grandeur though could do with some refurbishment family room was quite spacious beds rather narrow and bathroom a bit small though sufficient;3
good hotel central location rooms reasonably clean comfortable beds would stay again close walking distance to everywhere quite rooms enjoyed my stay nice view from the window you can see anew york city;3
we stayed here after driving from vegas for our universal studios visit the next day rooms were comfortable if not a little tired and would benefit from an update we had dinner in the barlounge area very dated and dimly lit our server was very polite and efficient however the food was pretty average and we didnt finish our meals despite these few hiccups this hotel is in a great location for a visit to universal 2min drive and we would stay here again for that reason;3
room smelled like mold bed was very uncomfortable service was good location is good but the price you pay did not match the quality of the rooms breakfast was extremely overpriced id have to say i would not stay here again;3
we stayed here for four nights the staff was very nice so friendly room was clean and bed was comfortable i just wish we had known about the construction before booking our stay i was tired and stressed the first day we arrived and i really didnt appreciate having to hear pounding and vibrating drills ugh oh well next time ill make sure i ask my husbands complaint was that they did not make it easy to get coffee in the morning had to wait until 600 am which was 800 am our time;3
spent 4 nights in the new yorker with my small family and the reaction is mixed to be honest an old style art deco hotel in a run down area in the city reception was brusque and jot too welcoming eventually our booking was found and we got room key clearly there is a need for a lot of security due to surrounding area inhabited by a disturbingly large amount of homelessness room was small as expected in ny and needs updating beds were poor bathroom very very small diner attached to hotel was welcoming friendly and food service was decent hallways and general areas of hotel needs a facelift but was still packed with peoplemainly people going to gigs in msg across the road dont think we would stay in this hotel or this area of ny again which is a shame as its;3
not on par with other hilton hotels stayed there twice in one week different weekends young gal that checked us in the first time was great and friendly she was a trainee and appeared to be of asian heritage i only mention this so hopefully she gets credit for a job well done since i didnt catch her name next weekend linda checked us in and was anything but helpful the guy that checked us out on the 2nd of april was trying really hard to be nice but you could tell it was a chore and it appeared to take all his willpower as others have mentioned elevators are sooo slow ever had to factor elevator wait time into your daily itinerary here you will my daughter left here camera in the room and when we got to the lobby she decided to go to universal without it because;3
its nyc so average most other cities this hotel would get a poor review front desk staff was friendly and helpful location is great ideal for morningevening runs in central park but the room was a bit filthy refurbishment should be considered in particular the bathroom was in poor condition cleaning not too impressive but not unacceptable either bed was clean and comfortable;3
so i will start with the positive pros truly walking distance to universal studios many places claim to be and arent this is honestly an easy 510 minute walk clean nice beds and linens surprisingly nice pool given where it is i was surprised that when at the pool all you see are trees and the hotel no cars or other businesses cons i could clearly hear the next room especially in the bathroom by clearly i mean i could have participated in the conversation rattling pipes constant pipe rattling noise no matter the time again clearest in the bathroom although the room appeared to have been recently upgraded there was a strange rusted pipe see photo in the shower and the soap dish was falling off the wall why is there only one towel;3
i wasnt surprised by the small rooms the jane doesnt pretend to be something its not ive stayed in other shared bathroom places and this was by far the best i wasnt all that happy that the shared bath is coed but it was clean and the showers were quite fine there were a few seedy looking characters around the hallways but not a deal the staff was over the top friendly from check in to the bellboys the woman cleaning the bathroom on sunday and the elevator operators the restaurant was crowded but fun on sunday morning dont plan on a 5 star youll get pampered place its on the cheap but a good place to sleep;3
be forewarnedthe elevators are super slow they have 5 but when you call the elevator only one comes at a time and during peak hours it can take forever to get to and from your room this hotel is a bit dated so i guess the elevators are old too could use an upgrade i came down to universal with my two kids on a whim and thought it make for a fun getaway upon arrival everything was great there was a bit of a wait during checkin we arrived around 130pm we got an upgraded room with the universal view great right wellas we went up to our room we put the card key in and it turns out the room was already occupied how crazy is that we have stayed at many many hotels all around the world and this has never happened to us very;3
i stayed here on the 20th of june for a few nights i was very worried as i had booked this hotel by mistake and read the reviews and how bad it was and desperately wanted to change hotels but i couldnt i just had to grim and bear it to my surprise this hotel is not nowhere as near as bad as some people are making it out to be i will not exaggerate anywhere in this when i write this upon arrival i was greeted by friendly staff who seemed like they wanted to help but i couldnt help but notice the very obvious scent of cigarette smile looming in the seating area of the lobby this was quite concerning as they emphasized how this hotel was a nonsmoking hotel not a great first impression of a hotel we were quickly checked in and proceeded to our room i was on the 3rd;3
great location even if not going to universalbut pretty average accomodations had some issues when checking in due to a split reservation points which took the front desk staff quite some time to figure out how to put us in the same room during the whole stay so kudos to the lady who took care of it staying over the xmas weekend probably explains some delays in service during breakfast to my surprise diamond members cannot get a full american menu but just a restricted series of items eg bacon and eggs had to ordered as extras at 10 each probably wont be coming back and opt out for other hotelbrand;3
we arrived at 1 o clock to be told it would cost to check in early but that she would do it for free didnât really understand this as the room was ready all i can say about this hotel is that itâs very average good location however our room was absolutely tiny run down bathroom and air con that didnât work very well on check out we had to pay to keep our bags in the hotel whilst we went out for the day hadnt we paid enough if i returned to new york would probably pay more to stay somewhere else no other issues apart from these;3
this hotel is very basic it is great if you are coming to nyc as a tourist and plan to be always out and never in your room this is a very old nyc building that as others have said does need fixing pros cheap basic amenities cons no cable super small room bed is not that comfy;3
great location close to the hudson river park west village and downtown second visit not as good as first this hotel is getting very tired and could do with some updates the staff are not particularly friendly and infact ignore you where possible our first two nights were quiet but friday and saturday meant we were overwhelmed by the beats from local clubs and screeching cars awful and sleepless;3
the abercorn house is a quite basic hostel in hammersmith but with plenty of single rooms very close to the tube i was on the fourth floor which appeared to be all singledouble rooms there were two toilet rooms and one shower room toilets were sometimes not left very clean by visitors the showers were only just ok the room was cold and the hot water not very powerful there was nowhere to store dry clothing no hook on the door for example other than over the top the door which does not go to the ceiling â this might be a bit disconcerting as i think the floor was mixed there were no segregated toilets or showers although there were only 4 showers the floor had 5 kitchens each with one or two electric cookers oven rings microwave oven kettle and in;3
the hotel is great location is excellent rooms are small and cold but suitable for what you need but the service leaves a lot to be desired upon arrival i was asked for a credit card for the fees 2 days later i noticed over â£700 has been secured against my card went to reception to complain and they apologised and said it would be rectified 24 hours later another fee of over â£400 taken against my card so nearly â£1200 over half of my spending money was secured against these fees went to reception received an apology and was told it was a error and i would receive all fees back and a discount against my stay which i have to wait for from ba the fees have been returned but its taken until 5 days after my return and no good to me now as i needed that money whilst i;3
hotel is well placed our room was plenty big enough with two bathrooms very pleased that the aircon was efficient without being overly noisy despite the complete lack of a view and the hotel feeling a little dated would probably stay here again as it was very reasonably priced we didnt spend a great deal of time awake in the room;3
first of all the location of this hotel is excellent its situated in vermont a quiet neighbourhood and 15 20 minutes to universal studios paramount studios and the airport we did venture outside a few times and found it to be safe and had no issues there is a small convenience store opposite which was handy for beers and snackss but to other than that you need a car to get to places its located near to a large hospital so there were sirens going past all the time so try to avoid the rooms located over the main road and side road we had issue with ants in the room we left our left over takeaway in the bin and woke to find ants having a field day so we left the bin outside the room which was left by the cleaners for 2 days so any food left over was thrown;3
firstly the hotel is not new at all it could have been renovated and modernized slightly but the old feeling is still there namely on the elevator interior of the room and bathroom the room is not that big as it is expected for most of nyc hotels however the location is excellent as its located near macys shopping avenues restaurants and 24 hour convenient stores staff are mostly excellent you are required to show your key room whenever you want to use the elevator upon checking in i found the receptionist just wanted to get the job done too quick not too friendly and informative;3
i have enjoyed the banquet facilities here for many years for an annual even that i attend with my family due to the fact that its a celebratory event i have nothing but fondness for the hotel although the banquet is very bare bones this is no fault of the hotel establishment i think that its just a budgetary issue with the organization we celebrate with that being said i imagine that if budget was no issue and the hotel pulled out all the stops it would be grand the hotel is very nice and classy with a friendly wait staff i have not stayed in the rooms but i would expect them to be very nice considering the location and the decor of the hotel lobby and banquet hall;3
my wife and i stayed at this hotel from 10131015 and we found both good and bad things about the hotel the hotel apparently is an old prewar apartment house that was converted into a hotel first the good 1 the hotel is welllocated its on the upper west side and right near a subway station that goes downtown to the theatre district etc 2 for manhattan the prices are relatively reasonable and 3 our room was fairly large again by manhattan standards and clean and the bed was comfortable now for the bad 1 it was hard to get hot water the staff stated that this was because the pipes were old and 2 for some reason there was no chest of drawers or anything in which we could store nonhanging clothes well thats it;3
as others we chose this hotel for its proximity to the universal theme park you can walk or take a shuttle bus the elevators were extremely slow and it was not clear exactly how many were actually working once you finally got on one you stopped at many floors along the way down to the lobby the rooms were relatively quiet and ours had a fridge the regular cafe was under construction so the lobby bar area was being used as the dining area but the construction noises across the hall were quite loud and we found the menu a bit odd we had coupons for the continental cold breakfast and felt there were plenty of choices meats cheeses smoked salmon scones bagels yogurts cereals etc without adding all the hot items of which there were many if one had to pay;3
my party of three adults girls week away stayed at the universal city hilton between april 2128 location the hilton was convenient to universal studioscity walk by walking or free shuttle it was also convenient by car to some activities we had planned in hollywood and burbank however if you are planning anything at or near the beach it is a long drive and there seemed to be traffic at times one wouldnt consider rush hour checkin checkin was smooth and the bell staff and valet were very friendly and helpful our luggage was brought up very quickly and the bellman also filled our ice bucket room judging from the hotel floorplan and building shape it looks like our room 1855 was among the smallest on the floor and after having two double beds;3
hotel is dated and in need of an upgrade but it is not bad overall doormen are so friendly and helpful best place to stay if you are going to the opera its virtually across the street from the front doors;3
i have stayed at this hotel several times and i would like to put at rest anyones misconceptions about this hotel it is not any kind of extra nice place to stay at all it was and partly still is a rooming house or as they are known in nyc an sro single room occupancy building many of the people at this hotel live there permenantly and have lived there for many many years the rooms that are being rented out are rooms that are becoming vacant as the permenant tenants leave the reason there are still permenant residents living here is that it violates nyc rent laws to evict certain people depending upon their living situation age etc so whether you have a nice room or a bad one more than likely depends on how the person who lived there before it was a hotel;3
stayed at the new yorker on first impressions it looks dated but it is very retro when you read about the history of the place you get why it looks like it does although the landing corridor and lifts section looked like a scene from the twilight zone or the shining bit spooky our room was small but ok for us the bathroom again small and needed updating we booked this in april 2018 and a month before coming we paid for my mum and son to join us there room was on the front and was masive with a smaller room off the bedroom for storage you had views of madison sq garden and down the road the hudson river it was a very busy hotel there is a diner attached to it called tick tock and we loved it and did breakfast every morning there the beauty of this hotel is its in;3
the room was small but clean and relatively quiet given the location two attached restaurants were convenient the service was not great i checked in and when i had problems with my keys i was required to lug my bags back down to wait in line at the checkin station again they reran the keys which worked fine the first time i tried them but when i returned from running an errand the keys did not work again i had to wait on security at least 10 minutes to let me in he confirmed my keys didnt work and suggested i get an escort to my room every time i left i ordered room service and stayed put;3
no tea or coffee in the room a basic item that is available in rooms all around the world hotel has a great history as can be seen in the lobby of past guests we had a std room having came here from a big room in vegas this room and our friends room was not big enough to open 2 suitcases in at the same time it was clean and tidy and the aircon worked but extractor fan in bathroom did not and where the room was so small its not very nice to be in after using the toilet especially if you have had a dodgy 1 hotdog off the street corner;3
during our stay we lived on the wyndham new yorker hotel in the middle of manhattan i was very excited to visit this hotel based on picture and information ive found on the internet when we arrived i was a bit confused the hotel is rather old and not what i call up to date i was also a bit shocked about the fact that there was no ordinary breakfast restaurant at this hotel only a small diner where you could buy traditional american dishes for breakfast the placing of the hotel was rather good short way to the times square empire state building macys different shopping etc but due to the very high price i was a bit dissapointed about the hotels condition on the inside;3
we stayed at the empire hotel over the weekend and on sunday morning the hotel had no hot water it is impossible to say anything positive about a hotel that cannot provide guests with a hot shower;3
flew in from chicago illinois for a business meeting stayed here for only 1 night the room wasnt the greatest stayed 2116 needs to be updated lots of small dents in the wall felt like a motel not a hotel however the staff was excellent i wasnt feeling well and they gave me a later check out and the security guard danny gonzalez was absolutely extraordinary very well mannered and attended to all my needs if i stay again i would only come back because of how professional and friendly the staff were;3
good localization fair price but they charge for parking and extra eggs in the breakfast to leave thebags is no practical very noisy hotel and no options to have dinner cost benefit is ok only this room is fair;3
standard queen room is extremely small details like dents on walls holey sheets poor furniture design to store guests clothes that stay more than 2 nights old carpet oldnoisy not working air conditioning system;3
this is a good hotel its being refurbished and it needs doing although it good its showing its age hence the work be aware we were on the 35th floor with a great view the room was fine but dated but heres the thing monday to friday there was constant drilling really loud drilling which started at 10am till 5pmbut this didnt really bother us as we were out mostly but if you wanted a late sleep in your going to be unlucky dont bother with the tick tick dinner food was awful and over priced but as i said the hotel is okay and well placed for everything;3
we enjoyed the location as it was a block away from central park the bed was very comfortable and the room had a good selection of drinks and snacks however they were rather overpriced the recently reopened rooftop bar was brilliant and staff very accommodating the decoration of the lobby and restaurant are great just need to spread this to the rooms now for the bad bits i had put in two requests to the hotel for a room with as good a view as possible due to the nature of the trip which was a surprise proposal to my partner unfortunately neither of my request were answered and we were put in a room which looked directly into a space within two buildings not ideal the room happened to be quite loud due to all the aircon units on the adjacent building unfortunately the;3
we went to see a concert at hb and the hotel was convenient to the shuttle we got to the hotel around 1 pm check in was a little slow but ok when we got to our lovely room it was quite warm tried to adjust the thermostat but it did not seem to work we then called the front desk and they said they would send someone up he arrived about 30 minutes later he said he would have to go down stairs and do some adjustments and left the room very warm we had to leave for our concert without the ac being fixed and when we got back the room was freezing without any success in adjusting the temperature we hoped to get a room where the ac worked correctly but apparently there were none available this was my only disappointment with out stay at the hilton because we;3
we are seriously thinking of going to another hotel in the near future it is not the staff but the rooms the empire needs some major renovation and i would not recommend it to anyone it is expensive and the quality of the rooms should be up to par not be overcharged for basic amenities;3
the hilton at universal city is a weird combination of great and not so great the rooms although a little dated where very big and comfortable with great lighting very clean and comfy beds the restaurant is ok but the buffet is way over priced and do not be taken by the glitz of the all you can eat seafood buffet the food was not that good and unless you eat a huge amount of food the 4400 price tag is not a great value the seafood at bubba gumps on city walk was much better just a few minutes walk to universal and the city walk the city walk offers food entertainment and shopping it is a fun way to end the day the true shinning stars of this hotel are the bell service desk staff these men and woman are friendly and happy to share their knowledge of la;3
swift visit for work and stayed at the hilton lovely stay rooms were clean and spacious staff very helpful and food was a good standard despite being on location at the park it didnât feel overly full of holiday goers;3
pros i rented a cabin for an amazing price cool old world hotel and friendly staff everyone really was very nice from concierge to doorman to cleaning staff cons didnt pay much but i would have hoped hot water would be included in the package showers were icy cold tried calling the front desk multiple times but lines were jammed maybe other guests complaining had to buy dry shampoo so i wasnât completely greasy for my conference;3
i booked a night online in octobernot too cheap but good considering london prices and location was a sort of discount for last rooms available i arrived thereat first glance i thought it was a 34floors buildingthe hall was ok with a sort of bar where you could buy drinkssandwichesfruit and some food the men at reception were cold i didnt mindbut i was with 2 heavy suitcases without lift or any help from stuff it was very hard to climb 3 floors room was ok there were even glassesplatesfridge on the floor i found 2 kitchens unluckily they were empty a part from a microwave not usable as someone stole the revolving plate in it i tried a bathroom with 2 sinks and a few toilets and toilets were disgusting a part from toilet itself if you opened a window;3
the best thing about this hotel is the location the rooftop pool lounge area made the stay tolerable because it allowed me to escape my cavelike room i dont mind small rooms but the dampness of the air and the lack of natural light in the room resulted in my feeling i would have thrived better as a mushroom my colleague on a higher floor had the same complaints her courtyard view room allowed her to see the window of the hotel guest in the adjourning wing of the same hotel a view similar to mine the desk staff and concierge displayed very helpful and professional behavior and i appreciated that btw bring your own kcups or buy them in the shop on the street just outside the hotel entrance or pay 300 per cup of coffee or other hot kbeverage plus;3
i stayed in this hotel for 7 nights the service provided was good the only problem was that my room had a walk in shower i preferred a bath instead the room was very nice and well furnished with mod cons the area is ok but the hotel is not near universal studios the hotel taxis and the room phones are overpriced the staff was not helpful with the directions for the near by places they always recommended the hotel taxis if you ask for directions to get to a certain place i liked the waffles for breakfast;3
the location of the hotel is fantastic if you like to be on the upper west side its across the street from lincoln center the rooms are lovely but the detail work of the housekeeping and maintenance needs improvement the showers are set up strangely so the water gets all over the floor a good once over is in order for the upkeep there was also a smoker or someone smoking on my floor consistently throughout the 3 day stay i called about it twice but nothing changed not that nothing was done they were responsive to my concern but the situation did not resolve they also are not associated with any frequent user program;3
booked 7 nights here to celebrate our wedding anniversary so booked a room with a view on check in we were told the room had a fabulous view so imagine our disappointment on entering the room to find a view of an office opposite the room was also quite small staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay as hotel is also very well located with easy access to metro and many areas on foot;3
nice location very close to central park only issue was our rooms bathroom the maintenance of it eg caulking of the walls and around bathtub was very bad the back half of the shower doors seemed to be missing the condition of the bathroom made the overall hotel room feel really cheap and allowed to be rundown;3
great bartender quit rooms decent gym great housekeeping staff the room service order taker ruined the experience very poor customer service and 0 apologies for their mistake that made me wait for a simple salad more than 15 hours the wine i ordered with a couple of ice cubes on the side arrived with no ice cubes and the duck salad without duck;3
ive stayed at days inn hotel broadway last year and decided to stay this year again this hotel is a very good option if you arent a very demanding person it is well located close to the subway station 2 stops to times square 10 min walk to central park varied dining choices in the neighbourhood you must bear in mind that the hotels rooms are small and the furniture is completely old fashioned plus the hotel has only one elevator for staff and guests on the other hand the rates are resonable and the staff is friendly and very helpful;3
our stay was disappointing the management staff were good though vey dark space to stay in standard rooms have a view but small and very noisy suites are great size but in the middle of hotel so no view terrible bathrooms i didnt know there was a restaurant and bar on first floor until day 3 looked nice location birmt far from mid town ok if you like walking a lot but fine if youre happy to use taxis;3
the good point to mention is that the hostel was clean bedroom corridors kitchen and shower was clean although the last one smelled sometimes toilets were clean the majority of the time too the location of the hostel is good too however the doors dont isolate against noise at all you can hear every footstep of the whole corridor when someone else opens the door the door of our room vibrated therefore the room was very noisy moreover there was no chair neither a table in the room the hot water in our showers did not work 2 times the shutter in from of the window was broken too i know london is expensive however i cant recommend the hostel;3
good value this close to downtown room was adequate travelled uptown by metro every night no problem no facilities so eat out and bring your drinks in some good places to eat close by in china town or little italy;3
nice hotel but they seem to have changed their culture to get the most out of guest be careful at the front door the bell hop who gets your bags out of the car will not be the same one to take them to your room so you will need 2 tips just to get the bags to the room if you dont take them yourself if you get a room with breakfast read the fine print it is only the continental breakfast it is a 10 upgrade for the warm food part of the buffet also the view that is promised if you dont ask for the park side you end up with a lovely view of the freeway;3
the room overall was good a lot of reviews complain about the size but its a good size for nyc and you likely arent spending a lot of time in your room anyway the location is close to subways which is good but its very crowded as you are right near madison square garden the walls were paper thin though and i could hear the tv next store at all hours plus its a big hotel so you are always waiting a long time for crowded elevators i had a great hotelscom price so it was worth it but i wouldnt choose it again;3
great city location the new yorker is in a fantastic place for exploring and getting around the city situated right opposite penn station and maddison square garden and a short walk from times square and hudson mall and piers hotel staff were friendly and professional and hotel clean but although itâs an old hotel with lots of history it needs a bit of an upgradepaint etc looks tired but bed comfortable and being the city that never sleeps it was well received after a long day on our feet no tea and coffee in rooms but a coffee bar in lobby and the tick tock 24 hr diner too good choice of breakfast and meals and also a mcdonaldâs and starbucks right opposite hotel although plenty diners and bagel shops on each corner too;3
i had a room that was combined from two smaller room into one by nyc standards it was large prior to the merger they must have been two phone booths it was an older room but still in the art deco style that dominates the lobby of the hotel overall it was clean slightly run down but an enjoyable change from the normal corporate hotels i normally stay in id go back when the price was right;3
i visited the quality hotel between the 9th and 13th of march 2005 with my collegeprior to arrival i was worried about what the hotel would be like because i had read a number of bad reviews however upon arrival our group was greeted by the door man he was very pleasent and told us where the best places in new york were the room i shared with my friend was clean the bed sheets were clean and the room was tidy the bathroom was accaeptableexcept for the mould that was building up on the bath seem the room had all the basic ammenitys such as a phone table safe wardrobe tv a lamp and a hair drier the beds were cleaned every day and the room had being vacumed except for the edges they could have being vacumed better the carpet could also be re fitted the lifts were a;3
i stayed in days hotel for 3 nights with my daughter and i am very pleased as it was perfectly clean great customer service great value and excellent location i felt like home and will stay there when i go to nyc again thank you;3
great rooftop pool amazing location poor room quality hotel clearly was having issues with the air conditions in the rooms which made sleeping uncomfortable room was extremely hot love being so close to central park lincoln center and a short distance from theatre district;3
the location is fine if you are wanting to be near the airport which i did as my business trip was 4 days in and out and did not want to be bothered driving to the car rental and airport on departure day i had a very clean room with a partial runway view on the 5th floor the room was sound proofed so i did not hear any airplane noise thankfully if you have the atc app on your phone the lax atc for runway 24 l r is lax tower north i actually sat there listening to the tower clear jets and watched them immediately depart as well as land very cool stuff the fitness center is on the top floor and overlooks the entire airport which was also really cool the pool looked beautiful as well big and clean nice lobby with a restaurant that i stayed away from for reasons you;3
location is the best to central park lincoln center about a20 min walk to rock center lots of shopping and restaurants nearby price was exorbitant1400 for 2 nights in december no amenities in room no coffee no room service rooftop bar is nice but costly daughter in fordham so great locationwill not stay here once she graduates;3
although i loved the historic hotel and its has been renovated very nicely the service is below par the good location is central and less than two blocks from penn station which is great if you arrive by amtrak it is a historic hotel that has been very nicely renovated rooms are very small but nicely done price was very reasonable for manhattan the opportunities for improvement i arrived at 930pm and was told my room wasnt ready never had that happen at any hotel ive stayed in before after 4pm and this was 930 the front desk clerk suggested i check my bags and get something to eat and my room should be ready by then when i asked how long should i expect for the room to be ready she said 90 minutes meaning i wouldnt be able to got to my room until;3
as far as nyc hotels go itâs ok clean and friendly gym is tiny and outdated the internet is fast the bar is expensive they tell you they have free snacks 46 which means fruit and very plastic mini muffins generally meh;3
the hotel and room met my needs and fit nicely into my limited budget the staff were friendly and helpful the room was clean could use some sprucinging up though such as some paint and new lamp shades;3
the new yorker has a fabulous location in midtown close to the subway and a great number of the âmust seeâ nyc sights itâs architecturally stunning and the trattoria bianca bar and tick tock restaurant have great ambience and are reasonably priced however we had two real issues with our 4 night stay last week first was that due to the hotel being full the room i had booked and paid for was ânot availableâ despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all the second was that the concierge tried to charge me 130 for tickets to a game at the garden that i actually paid only 54 at msg box office so unfortunately i have to advise that if you choose to stay at the new yorker donât think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid;3
my husband and i stayed here for 4 nights from 2529 october hotel itself is fine the room was great if not a little dark we had an alcove room on the 17th floor with a view of the freeway nice and close to citywalk and universal of course and if youre feeling lazy theres a free shuttle to use as well otherwise if you dont have a car it can get expensive catching cabs checkin was fine bell staff porters and doormen all fantastic as were the servers and housekeeping staff definitely felt well looked after had room service a couple of times food is really good very generous portions could never get through it all the concierge staff were mostly good but we felt we were taken advantage of by one when asking where we could go outlet shopping it was suggested;3
cold water for two days no pool access and not advised of this to arrival still waiting to hear back from manager despite requesting on numerous occasions requested brides room to be cleaned before arrival of makeup and hair however this was also not done great location;3
the hotel looks beautiful but yiu can never judge a book by its cover its a good location just below universal studios it was a little pricey and the roomservice was terribleoverpriced crappy food the staff was less accommodating when it came to needing a hair dryer or fixing an overflow toilet i would never stay her again;3
as most reviews mention the empire is directly across the street from lincoln center it is also close to the subway stop at 66th is surrounded by good restaurants and has pleasant staff but if if werent for these very positive attributes my rating would be even lower than it is our tiny sweltering unbelievably noisy deluxe room made good sleep impossible although we enjoyed the view of lincoln center the street noise was an unpleasant counterpoint and although the street noise was less than when we stayed here 2 years ago this time we asked for a quiet room and were put on the 11th floor high above the street the pounding and thumping from the rooflevel bar bombarded us deep into the night other concerns were the glitchy wifi in the room 1295 per day;3
stayed one night at this hotel because it was directly across the street from lincoln center where we had show tickets the staff was great and check in was fast and easy unfortunately when we got upstairs to the floor we were staying on the place was not as appealing as the lobby the wallpaper is dated and way too busy our room was small expected with a view of someone elses room across the way so we had to keep the blinds shut the room was stuffy and try as we might we could not get the ac to make a difference the unit was old and could not keep up with our needs i will say that the bed was very comfortable and the place was clean;3
i have stayed at this property many times in the past and have always had a good experience this time however was a little disappointing reservation system was down when we arrived and the front desk was checking people in by hand k cup coffees in our room were 300 each which is crazy expensive the air conditioning in our room went out for the night they brought us up a fan to use very disappointing nights sleep;3
we booked this hotel last minute on hotel tonight there werenât a lot of rooms left room is dated but dark which ensured a good nights rest bathroom is tiny hotel staff is very helpful even though they couldnât help us with a larger room to accommodate my children we had never stayed here before but itâs not bad if our options arenât available;3
we stayed here overnight on 523 as a part of my birthday present upon checkin we arrived a little early 330345ish for a 4pm checkin to give a little cushion for parking and traveling delays but was told we couldnât check in until 4pm so we waited no biggie we had a 430 dinner reservation so i asked if there was a restroom to use so i could at least change and freshen up so we wouldnât be late i was given a key for the rest room and went downstairs while i was getting changed there was a loud knock on the door and someone was yelling security i finished changing and opened the door to a man questioning me and told i was being watched on camera and why am i in this bathroom i explained about our room not being ready and we traveled hours to get here i wanted to change;3
had to ask how to turn on the ac would have liked to see small deskhutch chairstool for my laptop notes had to pull dresser over and sit on edge of bed staff was accommodating helpful though this was probably a more rundown place in the past but they appear to be making efforts to upgrade things i would stay here again;3
standard room was very small but cozy ac was to noisy to left it running when we were in the room shower should have a door to avoid moisture accumulation despite that through pool and deck was awesome and the location is just perfect near central park and time square;3
we spent 4 nights at days inn when visiting new york first the goods the hotel is ideally located on broadway being close to central park the subway and other attractions there is a good cafe on the corã±er bar on the street we found the hotel tired our room left a lot to be desired rusty radiator broken sockets drab very old crt tv with poor reception staff were obliging when we needed to ask for several improvements the shower was good as was our bed we made the hotel work for us using it as a base to only sleep at there is no food or bar facilities which we found locally for the price we paid we expected better our ranking is a 25 out of 5 being ok anne stephen sheppard;3
just returned from a very enjoyable 6 nights in ny hotel basic but very clean staff generally helpful good quiet part of town but only 10 minutes from mid town manhatten by subway central park on doorstep a great antidote to downtown frenzy local area seemed typical nontourist new york very mixed plenty of local delis and grocery shops but a fair walk to any proper eating places though broadway around columbia university is cheap and buzzy about a mile away seemed safe and friendly though very top of the park a bit iffy only real gripe is heating and plumbing antiquated radiators with only two settings too hot and off first night kept awake by horrible intermittent bubbling and buzzing sounds from the radiator eventually we went down in our nighties and;3
advertised as a boutique in midtown nice location for tourists and to get around booked through their site two beds on the 8th floor unbelievably small bathroom not enough room to turn around staff courteous worst restaurants in midtown stay away just not above average in any way price was in line with nyc but very few amenities would not stay there again the view was an airshaft;3
on arriving at the new yorker hotel my initial thoughts was wow check in was quick staff friendly we was on floor 22 in a room with no view and very drafty windows i had to put 3 pillows at the bottom of the window to stop the draft the rooms decor was dated but clean the cleaners do a good job tick tock diner was good n staff friendly not cheap to dine but then no where in nyc is cheap to eat same as the italian with in the hotel the hotel is central and a good base to stay in the city wld i recommend this hotel yes the only gripe was the windows we booked with bookingcom n paid for the hidden charges as a whole price and was cheaper so we wasnt stung with hidden add ons;3
nice looking hotel room was not clean noisy ac overpriced for what we got great proximity to universal studios i will stay there again when going to universal studios may2014 but this time i will book in advance to secure a better rate notify management of my reservation and disatisfaction issue to make sure room assignment is upto hiltons standards;3
i liked the hotel it is in a great location however it did feel oldlike it needed a refurbishmentits not very modernmy toilet in my room was designed for a child it is walking distance from most of the city tours and amenitiesmadison square garden was around the corner no a bad option for centrally located hotel;3
very small closet with no space for womens dresses or coats very noisy room with outdoor air conditioners also view brick wall sink was stopped up and when i reported it i was asked three times for my room number location is great but price very high;3
fantastic location a block from central park clean funky rooms as this is a boutique hotel room and bed were on the smallside but staff were very helpful particularly the concierge refrigerator tv and safe probably suited to younger peoplecouples;3
good location on the upper west side right round the corner from 96th street subway which takes you into times square in about 5 mins the hotel itself looks nice from the outside and foyer the staff of what we spoke to them seemed lovely they room we were in was an absolute st hole the windows were taped shut the curtains wouldnt close the carpet needed to be replaced and the wallpaper was something out of the 70s the beds were comfy thought and it was clean its a semi decent hotel for a manic few days in nyc and you need somewhere to sleep we wont be back though;3
transportation shuttle was very nice and hotel is bright and airy our room was also wonderful and quiet with a view of the airport great bed and shower buffet breakfast was a real treat our checkin process was not good desk staff were not helpful with their issue that was surprising as hyatt service is usually outstanding;3
the location is great as only 23 mins away from hammersmith underground and therefore there are shops at broadway and a good selection of restaurants near by upon arriving at the hostel approx 7pm there were a few people sitting outside that had obviously been drinking and could appear intimidating to some i had booked a twin private room for myself and niece as it had said on website that only over 18s could stay in the dormitory so was a bit surprised when i was questioned as to who my niece was how old she was etc upon telling them 16 my passport and money was thrown back at me and i was told i had to have her parents permission for her to stay there with me so after a delayed flight of 4 hours to get to london i had to phone her mum get her to email the hostel;3
older hotel in a good location right by lincoln center and a subway stop route 1 train there are some nice restaurants within a block as well as a movie theatre across the street i booked via priceline for 1 night and was alone so the tiny room was adequate for me but certainly not for a couple the room was clean with updated decor and a good heating system but i did have to get the low water pressure fixed and lighting is not good if you need to work at a desk lobby looked great but there was a bad odor around the elevator bank on the sunday i checked in it was gone monday when i checked out but ive not run into that issue before at a big hotel net i would not seek out this hotel but its certainly adequate with a good price deal;3
the lobby looks great the staff is terrific the restaurant serves a great breakfast the elevators are fast the bed was comfy only thing that surprised me was how small the room was not much space closet small no problem for a weekend stay i think it might be cramped if you had a week there;3
stayed here with some friends for a reasonably priced girlfriends getawayand we were scared its hidden on the second floor of the building with no obvious signs check in occurs in an actual apartment turned office elevators are slow as molasses keys are used not card keys and we stayed in an executive suite located on the 10th floor which was under construction walls were thin but i am a heavy sleeper overall it was small but clean and made with updated materials pergo flooring marble tiles in bathroom nice kitchenette counter beds were pretty uncomfortable with no mattress covers you can feels the seams of the mattress through the thin sheets location was great right near the 12 and 3 subway it was decent and tolerable for a short visit;3
good for a solo business traveller that gets a deal via priceline otherwise if you are paying full price youll probably be disappointed my room was small and had a strong chlorine smell the doormen are creepy not made for the job my room was right next to elevator but thankfully i didnt hear them even when the very loud inroom ac was off;3
the staff at the hotel were helpful and welcoming a special shoutout to mohammed at the front desk who checked us in for his friendly demeanour great service and helpfulness the room was clean and good sized for new york but lacked soundproofing the bathroom has virtually no shelf space the furniture especially the bed has seen better days and was noisy just tossing and turning on checkout we also had the surprise to learn that facility fees were charged per day instead of for the duration of the stay despite us not using any of the amenities worse though was the baggage stocking fee on the day of departure which just seems greedy after ive just spent hundreds of dollars in that hotel;3
this was a nice hotel but a bit dark and the decor was dated and a bit worn the staff were helpful and friendly but the elevators lifts seem to be either not working or broken altogether the hotel was not far from central park which made up for it we went with my daughter but we were on different floors miles away from each other not a bad hotel but would consider trying somewhere else next time just to try somewhere different and prehaps a bit more brighter;3
clean and tidy however linen and towels were not changed except on request and the hot water kept running out mid shower the people were pleasant and great value for money however considering itâs a very well located hotel;3
im somewhere between admiring and hating how such small rooms were handled at this property the theme is certainly appropriate and you gotta give points for creativity i guess bottom line is this place is too expensive for what it is paid nearly 100 a night for a room that was so small i couldnt lie down in it widthwise if i tried and im short the mattress on the teeny bed was better than expected although no mattress that small can ever be considered comfortable nice pillows rooms include towels and washcloths mentioned only because many shared bathroom hotels dont tv with builtin dvd player clockradio with old ipod dock only a fan thats good for drowning out some noise a large mirror on one side of the room and an overhead shelf that runs the length;3
rooms require renovation particularly air conditioning and bathrooms internet was fast the restaurant was closed and i was not informed of that when booking would have been good to know as i am a room service sort of person the bartender was very friendly and helpful;3
i spend loads of time in hotels for work and can honestly say there is nothing wrong with this hotel the location is fantastic to start with the rooms are clean the beds are small but comfortable the waterpressure in the showers is good and the staff are friendly its a massive hotel with very little eye for a personal touch;3
a few friends and i stayed at the ramada for 3 nights the neighbourhood isnt bad at all apart from a few homeless people our room was excellent very clean beds were comfortable we had a fridge and microwave although we didnt spend a lot of time at the hotel it was perfect for our needs its great location for getting to la dogers stadium and also staples center its about 10 minute drive to the kodak theatre the breakfast was standard as well cereals toast etc overall i would recommend the ramada inn;3
i stayed at the empire hotel for work for a few days great location near lincoln center 2 short blocks to lots of subway stops lots of food and shops nearby beautiful rooftop bar with great views of nyc the rooms were very quiet i never heard anything from the hall or other rooms the cons were that it was pretty pricey for what it was i mean i know its nyc but still the rooms shouldve been bigger also when i checked in the only room they had to offer me was a smoking optional room really people still do this and in nyc the land of anti smoking and sugary sodas the room stunk bad i cant believe the hotel even allows this so they switched me to a handicap accessible room which was larger but had a weird shower not a big deal also my biggest;3
my wife and i stayed here while visiting la and its a very pretty hotel but park your own car is 28day room is over 350night dinner buffett for two is 110 a drink is between 1015 next door at sheraton is about 23 as much wont make that mistake again;3
the rooms are tired though clean upon arrival during a five day stay our room was not serviced at all we had to go down for fresh towels and refreshing of consumables the bedding is poor quality and well worn the beds are just ok overall there is little service at the hotel its just a place to stay that is very handy for universal and la sights disappointing and wouldnt rush back;3
great location for 5 nights but first impression was not a nice area to be in easy walk to theatres and time square and empire state building recommend a hop on hop off bus tour to get orientated didnât realise you had to ask for a fridge in room until we were unpacked and canât even make a cup of tea bed was very comfortable the kicker was 5 per bag to store when checking out and the resort fees per day for nothing what a rip;3
very disappointed by the pool and outer deck pool is like a large bathtub water was very dark and murky was the primary reason we chose empir for the rooftop pool spend alittle more and stay somewhere else;3
smells of smoke on some floors and rooms very outdated needs an uplift but clean and great location was there for my 50th birthday and didnât get off to a good start due to having to change rooms due to smoke smell;3
it was a nice place to stay the subway 1 2 and 3 stop is right in front go check out the brown stones free parking since family live that way but you have to read the signs the parking garage is 35 a day plus tax we paid around 80 to park since parking is hard to find;3
everything was fine the room was tiny but clean had a great view of the met wireless was horrible only one of us could connect to wifi access point and even then getting to the internet was spotty at best;3
this hotel is situated right in the heart of ny and within walking distance to metro station and penn station it offers pretty generously sized room in regard to a ny standard which could need a little update and conservation but the views are beautiful the room was clean and offered everything you would expect to find the staff is very friendly and the stay was overall very positiv and i would recommend it;3
my boyfriend and i used hotwire to book this hotel and after reading the reviews on tripadvisor we were worried we were pleasantly surprised this hotel is not that bad for those of you who want upper three star or four star accomodations then this hotel is not for you you get what you pay for however if you are looking for a clean hotel that is accessible to many of the hollywoodlos angeles sites and doesnt cost a fortune then this may be a good choice it is not fancy but as i mentioned it is clean and parking is safe and cheap 9day for los angeles the noisy nightclub mentioned in the other posts was not an issue for us even though we stayed on the first level the breakfast but once again you get what you pay for breakfast is free it;3
location is excellent we arrived early and the hotel was able to hold our bags until checkin time later in the day when we did arrive back at the hotel the elevators were not functioning and our room became a 12 story walkup with bags happily that was the only time we had to walk up the stairs the 1995 residence fee was expected but still seems unusual no other hotel has ever charged me a 20 residence fee cleanliness was okay do not eat the continental breakfast this hotel charges 12 for a bagel and coffee or whatever you might grab breakfast offerings that are complimentary at comparable hotels;3
very disappointing start to my birthday celebration my sister and i were put in a really pokey room not much bigger than a cupboard couldnt even put our suitcases down to unpack them even the door to the room was smaller than the rest along the corridor the dã©cor was very dark and dreary as in fact was the rest of the hotel very gloomy evidently the room was booked by the flight centre thru gullivers travel hence the tatty room they evidently book the cheapest rooms in all the hotels so make sure you dont get a room booked by them thru your agent fortunately the hotel eventually upgraded us to a larger room on 11th floor for the rest of our stay but on the whole did not find the hotel particularly good at all they could not even tell us the rate of tax;3
hotel is 5 minutes walk from universal we were a party of 9 two families and stayed for 3 days unfortunately we had a long wait to check in the hilton honors line as we are honors members when they finally got to us they informed us since we didnât book though hilton we booked thought bookingcom we do not get any benefitsï¿¼ we were understanding about not receiving the hilton points although we asked if we can just get the perks such as bottled water coffee etc they informed us that is not possible later that day the family we were traveling with informed us that they were able to get continentalï¿¼ breakfast even though they booked the exact same way we did we went to the front desk and requested the same treatment for us the manager on duty khetera pretty;3
convenience is the biggest selling point if youre planning a visit to universal studios we got an exciting view of hogwarts castle the hotels lobby is a little dated we didnt try the hotels food but there are lots of options around the area theres a shuttle to take you to the park pretty standard clean;3
quite well situated near madison square garden however the hotel is rather dated being quite art deco but can also be seen as a positive feature as some hotels are quite clinical looking today with little character for what you pay a night the rooms are very average with no teadrink facilities meaning you have to venture out whenever you want a drink etc or visit the adjacent dinercafe there is a separate italian or mediterranean restaurant bar accessed from inside the lobby which is operated independently and we found this very nice there is also a diner on the opposite side of the hotel which is adequate for most people i guess staffwise most are friendly and helpful but it has a high turnover of guests with no personal service as such would i stay there again;3
pros fantastic location clean rooms 2 bathrooms tho paid extra for this large room good security comfy beds cons rooms are freezing despite heating rooms are very noisy and you can hear voices from the next room and their shower and taps running we were woken up every morning around 630am by the shower in the next room 5 charge per bag to leave your luggage if you have a late flight 75 quote for late check out not enough seats in the lobby for people waiting to leave;3
i have stayed on and off at the empire hotel over the last 30 years only because it is across the street from lincoln center each time i stay there i remember why the last time i said i will not stay here again;3
my husband and i were celebrating his birthday and fathers day we booked the empire hotel via united rewards so i expected certain downgrades for this reason i had read prior to arrival that any bookings here in the reasonable prices had pitfalls when we checked in they tried to give us 2 double beds though my reservation was listed as a superior queen they tried to tell me this was an upgrade but i explained that we were on a romantic stay and 2 beds was not preferred so they put us in a superior king we learned soon enough this was a handicapped room with a horrid view of the interior of another building the bathroom was bizarre no shower curtain no privacy and the water flooded the entire bathroom floor the shower head leaked so it was squirting water;3
the room was big and clean and the best partits within walking distance to universal studio its a little bit pricey but i guess you pay for the location weve stayed at sheraton beforehilton is definitely better;3
room was pretty good tv didnât work couch had stains and walls were thin so bring ear plugs or a white noise machine donât check in early if you get an email saying your room is ready unless you want to pay a 75100 fee other than the fee itâs good enough if itâs a quick trip where being by the airport is important;3
i most always try to see a silver lining but so far our stay here has not been good 1 id phoned ahead by a week confirmed our stay and me toned that our flight would arrive close to midnight so our checkin would be very late we had prepaid via priceline lo and behold our purchased nonsmoking king was no longer available when we arrived we were out into an old nonsmoking full bed room and i spent most of the night praying for no bedbugs the carpet was filthy and pulled away from the tack board 2 we were told to leave that room in the morning checks our bags with the bell captain and return after noon to get our king room we did so and then returned at 245 pm checked in and couldnt get into our new room housekeeping was still in there we were;3
this art deco classic is well maintained but is in need of some major up dating although clean the color schemes are dated the carpets are clean but are of a different era or two function food for large crowds is passable luke warm 10 seat round function tables are too small for 10 adults to sit and eat a full dinner good location close to penn station and madison square garden;3
was there for 2 nights for a small conference i can only speak about the room i stayed in but it was tiny no closet no iron or ironing board no tub just a shower lobby area was modern and had several people milling around some staff spoke poor english chowder house restaurant was good for lunch;3
i have found writing this few extremely difficult as the location of the hotel and the price were both absolutely amazing we stayed for seven nights and the room was large and comfortable the restaurant was good for both breakfast and dinner and most of the staff were extremely friendly to be honest if it wasnât for the point iâm going to make next i would have given this hotel five stars we decided to go with housekeeping each day as we were staying for a full week this worked really well for the first four or five days but unfortunately one of the days when we returned at about 6 pm our door had been left on the latch so it did not shut properly this meant that our hotel room had been open to anybody passing by for the whole day this is a serious security breach i;3
the hotel is in a great location close to central park the lincoln center and subway stops however we were charged 670 for a bottle of water we used in our room and you have to pay to get wifi access so take that into consideration if staying here rooms were clean and staff were friendly;3
the location is the biggest selling point its literally right behind the london eye we even had a view of the river from the side the staff are fantastic too and there is a free left luggage facility for guests the breakfast has a good selection and the dining room is nice the family room was huge almost too big because it felt half empty of furniture but still a great size for a family cleanliness let them down uneaten chocolates on the floor dirt in places it felt clean enough to use but just dont look too closely we had a few annoying issues here though the bed was not the normal premier inn bed it was smaller and harder it looked tiny against the large bed frame thats built for their normal size beds the mattress was firm and the pillows were so;3
great location if going to lincoln center attractive dã©cor small rooms and weird bathroom setup nothing complimentary not even a cup of coffee we were never told anything about a concierge at checkin so we got no help from one had to ask others locals on the street where to dine if not for the close proximity to lincoln center we probably would not stay here;3
if you want a hotel with your own bath for under 200 a night in nyc this one is it a subway ride from the busy downtown area remember to take the c during the day and the a local at night clean friendly on the older side with a small but working elevator rooms are very small but workable ours was quiet on the back of the hotel great little place to eat and pick up snacks on 109th just a few end blocks down;3
this was my first time in nyc i was slightly disappointed when i saw the hotel it was clean we couldnt operate our heating on the 1st night froze the 2nd night was like a sauna but the 3rd last night was a good temperature the heating system is noisy the bathroom extractor is noisy on one occassion we did hear other occupants using their shower if youre not planning on spending too much time in your hotel this is perfect at a good price close transport links to downtown manhattan a fabulous cafe around the corner for breakfast the bed was extremely small i slept closer to my friend than i would have liked the hotel just needs to be brightened up a littlemodified it will be an ideal spot sadly we had a very poor view just a brick wall more;3
bathroom poor design with no shower door wifi and coffee in room should have been free like most hotels closet rod too high for me at 5 feet tall housekeeping was excellent cleaned all glass surfaces every day;3
dont mind the smoke in the hallways rooms are really small but clean share bathrooms are clean as well about 7 blocks from the nearest subway not noisy at all and the neighbourhood is not bad at all i wont mind staying here again if i am on a budget;3
november 2022 hotel in great location right next to penn station with easy access to subway and walkable to many restaurants and times square area lobby and communal areas are well kept and spacious however we booked a single queen room and were really disappointed the room was clean but both bathroom and bed area were worn and very outdated noisy overnight as well with loud guests in nearby rooms if you get a cheap price then this is fine but accommodation standards in the room we had was way below expectations for price we paid;3
i spent 3 nights in morningside inn and id recommend this place for those who would like to explore manhattan and are looking for a simple but cleantidy place that provides the basic needs for a traveller it was easy to arrive in the hotel from la guardia airport as id never been in manhattan before this trip i just followed some google maps instructions and could reach the hotel because it is located between 110th st cathedral pkwy and 103th st metro stations the only thing i didnt like was the shared restroom as i had my reservation done via agodacom i had no idea about this however this was not a big deal wifi is free but needs to improve sometimes it was really difficult to connect in a few words a good affordable well located place to spend;3
just returned 6718 from 6 days stay the hotel this was our second time at the hotel and it hasnât changed much over past 15 years first impression is good as it has a very nice lobby the hotel is well located being within walking distance of times square empire states building grand central station and macyâs penn st station is across the road and there is a mcdonaldâs across the road which is very useful for a quick coffee in the mornings the rooms are clean but small and very dated they are badly in need of an update we didnât eat at the hotel as it was very expensive and there were other places close by which were better value in summary we would stay here again for the location rooms however are not the hotelâs greatest selling point but this wasnât a;3
we do not generally stay in hostels but i decided to book this place as a one night stop over to see a show at the apollo which was in walking distance we had a private room and bathroom and i have to say it was very clean and bright unfortunately there was no tv and they were single beds but it was better than i have heard other hostels to be;3
this hotel gained fame from gossip girl but its age is catching up while i was there 2 elevators were down which was bad since the hotel was full the lobby area is dark and while that can be charming in this case it was not bathrooms are also awkward as the shower door does not cover the shower opening and one cannot shower without getting the whole bathroom wet the bathroom was so small there was no place to put a makeup bag or shaving kit however staff was lovely and there is a happening barpool area on the roof;3
first time doing a review here goes good points great locationfriendly staffgreat roof top bar and poolbad points small bedrooms ridiculously tiny bathroomdrinks expensive even for new york decor dark brown unless you are used to living in a cave you will struggle to see even though we had a great 4 days i would not recomend this hotel oh one more thing be wary of the people selling tickets outside the empire state building dont buy a vip ticket they say you will wait one and half hours a lie buy ordinary tickets;3
i agree with all the other positive reviews but i dont think i would stay here again the first room i was given reeked of cigarette smoke as did the hallway i was on i asked for another room but they could not change the room the first night fortunately they switched me to another floor on my second night and the smoke odor was much less the hotel says that it is a nonsmoking building but there seems to be a problem with tenants who are holdovers from before the building was a hotel but whatever the reason if people are smoking in the roomapartment next to you and the whole floor reeks of cigarette smoke the hotel is not a nonsmoking hotel there also are no noticessigns for the hotel guests informing that it is a nonsmoking hotel and i can see;3
its not easy to review this as we had both good and bad experience with this hotel the overall experience is good friendly staff perfect location next to subway and central park good value for money ok size rooms but i cant give it more than 3 points due to the placement of the queen bed rooms when we first arrived we had booked a queen size bedroom we came straight of the airplane and the clock was 4 am in norway so we were tired our room was on the 5 floor but when we entered the room it was a big disappointment the noise in the room was dreadful outside the window there was some kind of ventilation system running full speed i can truthfully say it was the worst night ever on a hotel so tired and unable to get a full nights sleep because of this ventilation;3
you absolutely need to be sure this is what you want yes the survivors of the titanic stayed there yes they have bellhops in fancy uniforms yes everybody is friendly and helpful as far as they can but i stayed for four nights after a six week trip through the southeastern us with 20 different hotels behind me and actually ready to go home i think its important to know that for the review this was not the worst stay i had but the most expensive for the return the location is nice but in considerable distance to the next subway be prepared for a few minutes walk up the jane st to 14th stations of the red or blue lines there are a few small coffee places and restaurants around so its a good place to for discovering the village and the nearby meatpacking;3
this hotel is in agreat location with plenty of restaurants and shops close by and the empire state building is within easy reach as is penn station upon arrival we were very impressed by the lobby area although it was always very busy i think passersby came in for a cool down because the air conditioning was very good we were checked in very quickly by a polite member of staff as it was my wifes birthday and our wedding anniversary during our stay i had already emailed the hotel and asked them if there was any chance of an upgrade when we were checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a larger room with a view of the empire state buiding we were happy about this and also glad as the room we were given was not that large and i wouldnt have;3
so ill start by saying the hotel has tons of potential but it feels held back because of the price you pay for the location the bathrooms are very cramped and noticed odd smells the beds are way more firm than expected and overall it was a good experience with everything except the actual room;3
we stay here because its across the street from lincoln center but im increasing annoyed each time we come our room on the 11th floor is so hot that we have the windows wide open during a snowstormapparently a feature of many 10th and 11th floor rooms from discussion with other guests in the elevator and while the hotel is not overpriced they charge you extras at every turn 12day for wifi with separate charge for each deviceie you need two subscriptions if you have laptop and tablet inroom coffeemaker but you get charged 350 for each kcup the shower requires an engineering degree and if you use the handheld you still get a constant cold drip from the overhead which you cant avoid because only half the stall is glassed in with no shower curtain;3
poor value overpriced did i say poor value and overpriced from the quality of the accommodations to the breakfast buffet to the dinner menu to bar drinks to the parkingdid i miss anything oh great location near universal and city walk;3
i love the empire its been one of my fav hotels in nyc since the 90s the lobby bar and service overall are spectacular but the rooms really need some tlc they are just weathered the hotel is in the perfect location to explore upon check in we asked for a room with a view as it was friends first trip to nyc they did not disappoint and we had a very nice view on the top floor the doormen and front desk staff were top notch i do feel like they nickle dime you a bit though but that is common in a lot of nyc hotels i do think for the room price you should get bottled water the minibar prices are higher than any other hotel ive ever seen in my entire life i was also surprised to see service automatically added into our drinks tab in the lobby bar then a;3
i stayed here for 3 nights it was very close to the subwaymetro and was great since i didnt rent a car free wifi was fast the bed was very comfy and the rooms were quiet good value for la;3
the empire hotel is obviously neglected and rooms in need of renovation the bathrooms are in a poor state and there are various signs of wear the plumbing is in a poor state our toilet seat was clogged and both the sink and bathroom faucets barely worked the staff gives mixed messages in terms of their willingness to provide service some are helpful and some just ignore clients otherwise the hotel has a great location which is very important;3
we recently had a holiday booked to new york city with 12 nights at the empire hotel nice hotel however the main aim of our stay was somewhere with a pool close to central park even though our travel agent spoke with the hotel only a couple of days prior to our stay and told them we specifically chose this hotel for the pool they failed to inform that the pool was closed indefinitely;3
if youre going to universal studios this place is convenient but im not sure its worth the price the universal sheraton is also next door and there is a shuttle that runs to both properites and the park and i believe they are slightly cheaper the staff at the hilton was very courteous except for the first person i spoke to at the desk when i first arrived at the property there is a buffet and table service available but again fairly pricey we ordered room service and the staff was great but the food was just ok nothing special actually my son didnt like the food so he didnt eat much the room was ok we had a corner room which i expected to be a little bigger but not bad overall the hotel was ok but ive stayed in nicer hotels and paid less;3
my husband and i stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of may 16 the hotel is in a great location in a fancy neighbourhood and the lobby looks quaint and interesting however the room that we booked twin cabin was the smallest room i have ever seen it was about the same size as a train cabin with two bunks and barely any floor space there were a few hooks alongside the mirror on which to hang jackets etc but nowhere to hang up our creased travelling clothes it was very clostrophobic and extremely difficult to get changedready in for two people as our bags occupied the only floor space the bathrooms were clean but there are very few showers for the number of rooms per floor yes it was cheap compared to other hotels in new york but it was a very frustrating;3
stayed four nights was allocated a room on first floor air con units right outside window romeo gave us complimentary breakfasts so it felt churlish to complain superb location one little tip we required tranport to the cruise port at bayonne new jersey the concierge quoted 124 we asked the bell boys and they got us a limo for 80 including tolls and tip;3
let me start by saying that this hotel is in the perfect location there is a near by subway which is 2 stops from times square very easy to use and i would recommend buying the 32 metro card as itâs great value for money and valid for 7 days there are lots of things around the hotel there is a corner cafe right opposite mcdâs mini supermarketpharmacy and much more the hotel was ok itâs nothing spectacular if youâre looking to spend majority of your time in your hotelwhich i doubt that you will then this hotel isnât for you but if you just want somewhere to sleep and freshen up then this is perfect the staff are very friendly and very helpful when asked about recommendations etc it is a little outdated and could use a big renovation and it is old fashioned the;3
i will begin with the negative aspects of my stay at the empire then finish with the positive after staying in new york for a week already in midtown i decided to spend my final week on the upper west side to be closer to central park and to have a less touristy feel i had booked the hotel on expedia and was required to pay upon checkin i was welcomed with no issue and my credit card charged i was given no receipt nor was asked to sign anything to show the amount that had been authorised on my card which didnt bother me however some hours later after checking my account balance it appeared that my card had been authorised for an extra 600 than what i was paying for the room i went downstairs to discuss this with reception and was bluntly told that there was;3
id like to give this hotel a 35 really you cant beat he location and it has genuine historical charm which i love the rooms are small but nicely decorated and clean it has a european feel but several inconveniences detracted from our stay the inroom ac was super loud and difficult to moderate the ac was non existent in the hallway and elevators in 90 degree heat and high humidity thats a problem to make matters worse the elevators were slow at least the ones that worked and crowded we attended a wedding at the roof top restaurant the ceramic floor tiles in the lounge and dance floor were loose and uneven making walking in heals and dancing a bit risky overall i enjoyed our stay and the price was reasonable for central park west accommodations;3
i would not recommend this hotel for families with children to start there is a 17 a night charge for selfparking the evaluators from the parking garage go to the lobby floor then you have to walk through the buffet line to get to the checkin counter if there is a wedding you have to basically walk through the wedding to get to the elevator if they havent blocked off the entrance the shuttle to universal studios comes by every 1520 mins but if there is an event going on plan on waiting longer you can walk to universal s but its across a very busy street and up a steep hill not convenient for small children the rooms were clean the bed was comfortable but decor was standard and the room had a terrible smell there was a refrigerator with pay as you use;3
i was happy with the stay until we checked out i paid 160 for a luxury suv to get to the airport and was sent a mini bus and was far from luxurious dont use this service and stick to the yellow cab;3
the location of the hotel was brilliant in times square we were given a tiny room to begin with reception explained to us that the room was small and if we didnt like it we could change the next morning already this didnt bode well before we got into the room we booked a standard room but were told we had booked an express double no mention on the site of an express double well they were right we couldnt even open our cases together in the room it was that small also noise from the lift and fans outside moved to a larger room which was better alot of noise from the street outside when in the room the hotel is nice enough and the location is good hotel had scaffolding around it overall nice hotel but would stay somewhere else if we came again;3
this is a decent place to stay the rooms are quite small there are no coffee machines in the rooms there is no shuttle service i had difficulty accessing the internet the daily mandatory surcharge of 20 plus tax offers little in terms of services all of which are included at no additional cost from other reputable hotels even with the surcharge all that is offered for refreshments is free coffee in the morning free water yay and tee in the afternoon and a minimal selection of happy hour snacks my room was not able to get nbc new york on the tv which was very surprising lastly there were zero cups or glasses in the room this makes it difficult to use the bottled water to take meds;3
it was a very small room in a very large hotel the room had one small window that faces a brick wall everything in the room was old and needed to be updated i felt like i was staying in an old closet;3
great location can be expensive because its across from universal city within walking distance high demand area so you pay for the convenience remodeled hotel lobby shuttle to universal city available for free nice buffet breakfast daily wonderful buffet on weekends in evening with seafood and many choices including desserts galore rooms have great views of the valley 20 minutes to hollywodd blvd walk of fame and 30 minutes to beverly hills 20 minutes to downtown los angeles with light traffic rooms are outdated but comfortable the hotel has a nice atmosphere and a beautiful entrance;3
staff was very niceupon checkin we were told i had a second reservation however it could not be found which 3rd party company with that they offered an upgrade to a king suite very spacious in compared to most hotels in manhattan after spending about 45 in the upgraded suite we noticed the air conditioning wasnât working and it was very uncomfortable in the room maintenance guy said it was shot and they changed our room however no more king suites we were not happy but the queen room did have air which was better my husband complained some and they gave us each a drink voucher for our inconvenience over all the place is nice close to subway and central park quiet part of the city and away from the touristy areas the lobby is really pretty and the bartenders are;3
the hotel and rooms are very clean the front desk staff and bellmen were very nice and knomlegeable the security can use some serious work i was only asked once in passing if i was staying at the hotel upon entering and was never asked to show a key anyone can walk right into the hotel and get on the guestroom elevators the hallway lighting outside our particular room 415 was very dim almost dark the rooftop bar service was terrible had trouble getting a seat on the outside patio when the patio was near empty and our waitress had to ask us twice for our drink order she also neglected to place our appetizer order so we cancelled that we had planned to have dinner at the hotel but after receiving terrible service in a near empty bar we went elsewhere;3
its a great location and the rooms were very big in nyc terms but the room was dark as is the lobby and theres not much about the hotel that stands out as exceptional the ac unit was unplugged when we got there and we had to call housekeeping who knew that ac units have t be plugged in in a 400 a night hotel then it quit working all together the second night we were there leaving my wife in a puddle of sweat by morning;3
very nice staff let us have late checkout room was warm could not get it to cool shower balanced that out by not getting hot small room a little noisy i have no other hotels to compare it to i would stay again seems to be a good deal;3
we chose the hilton universal because it was the closest to universal studios on the map the map did not lie we were so close i have no idea why people used the shuttle we were at the park front gates with our 8 and 10 year olds within five minutes it is the location you are paying for the checkin process was great the doormen were extremely friendly and helpful as were the ladies at the front desk the room was quiet but the shower was the worst i have ever encountered in all my travels the water pressure was nonexistent it did not matter how we adjusted the shower head this was one aspect that made the hotel not worth the price;3
arrived with very friendly reception staff went to room 2715 which was so small no view brown and dark decor dusty and mould in the bath so disappointed we got moved to 2818 which was better shame the furniture is brown and dated really needs to be modernised still no view but apparently a metro queen view room is what i have a wall bed comfy the lifts are always slow i dont think they all work at one time one guy said he was waiting 20 min for the lift thd other day when it did arrive we went from floor 28 to 1 to 30 then every floor down it was so hot and busy the hotel is very dated the hall ways are old fashioned very noisy outside which you can hear all night very surprised you dont even get tea or coffee facilities in the room i personally wont stay;3
stayed one night to attend an event at the metropolitan opera ny positives excellent location to lincoln center it is directly across the way best part of our stay price very reasonable would have loved the check out the rooftop bar heard it is amazing but ran out of time room is well decorated but dark and small but hey itâs new york the smith restaurant is nearby and is a great place to get drinks and eat negatives the front desk girl tells us that two bottles of water in the room are complimentary what she doesnât tell us is that two little bottles on each night stand are complimentary and the ever so slightly larger bottles that look identical to the small ones are 5 i walk in the room start drinking a bottle of complimentary water and;3
i obtained a fantastic rate for at this hotel a short stay in new york i had stayed here before and knew what to expect location right on central park 3 blocks walk to the subway it takes about 20 minutes to get to midtown staff are helpful but the hotel is tired and in great need of refurbishment as a place to lay your head fine no inhouse breakfast facility but there is a deli inn the same block;3
this hotel is a really good base for sightseeing in new york easy walking distance from times square macys hop on hop off bus routes the staff were very friendly and helpful the rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds and excellent showers downside they were very small the hotel suited our needs perfectly but if you are looking for a quiet hotel with a degree of luxury then this wont be for you it is an incredibly busy hotel we would like to return to new york and would definitely consider this hotel again;3
on our trip to the big apple we had more people show than expected and needed additional beds our original hotel was out of rooms so we scrambled and called the days inn next door they had a room available and gave us a good rate and then the desk attendent directed us to the web site for additional savings 20 when we checked in there was a nice lobby but the upper floors and rooms were a bit dilapidated the carpets as other reviewers have mentioned were in bad shape we solved that problem by laying down all our towels and made a walkway around the room for what we paid it was worth the nuisance the staff was friendly and the location is great the green line 123 metro is a stones throw away it was nice to pop up on 94th and be so close;3
very well located the rooms are dirty and the feanitures are too old you should to clean up before enter and if you will spend a long time there maybe will be a good ideia buy your oun pillow and mettress;3
fantastic to be across the street from lincoln center actually like the feel of the lobby rooms are quite tiny but acceptable bathroom is minuscule rooftop bar transmits noise directly into 11th floor rooms to the point that fixtures in the room vibrate elevator unreliability impairs ability to exit the hotel at a predictable time but im not trying to be overly harsh because the proof is in the pudding i would actually return to this hotel;3
my original hotel was closed so i had no choice and the booking agent sent myself and my aunt to the new yorker at short notice what i will say is this hotel is in a great location a very short walk to macyâs broadway and msg and the subway is directly outside the hotel on entering the hotel it appeared very grand with lovely art deco design but i was in for a shock what is labelled 4 star on a website is no where near it 4 star for location there are plenty elevators but only one or two appeared to be working resulting in queues and cramming not ideal with covid restrictions when we exited our floors the carpets were very worn and the corridors dark and not welcoming i was initially several floors below my aunt and had to ask to be moved to same floor which they did;3
well i was very excited about staying in this hotel as you may or may not know it was the main hotel in gossip girl i stayed in the empire for 4 nights i arrived late on check in and was giving an up grade which was a great start to my cheeky holiday i got a king sized room with a front view window overlooking the lincoln center like i said in the title the location is quality you are 2 mins well in and around walk from all the major tourist attractions shops and bars the hotel itself is very costly you have to pay for everything there is no such thing as free wifi i had to pay for 3 days wifi in the hotel which cost me around 29 the room was great it was spacious and well decorated but i was afraid to touch anything in case i was charged in the room was;3
card holder should give the right for of use of purchases i was wronged by my daughter and your procedures by allowing the video purchase i did not give the full purchase rights to my guest my visit was fine however the what is more than disturbing to me is the fact know that my daughter was just staying with me she lives here in nyc has a hard time in life she is not allowed on my credit card cards you really ought to give a personal code for the room credit card holder to allow a purchase to go thru some adults are not adults to be trusted i am waiting and loving on my daughter i came to nyc with my church christ fellowship i paid my own way i have not yet opened my bill i was told that she rented 2 movies one of which was so not;3
very clean hotel great location to universal we were not staying there for universal but this was the best price offered pool and hot tub were soso hot tub was dirty and full of leaves and tree debris and only a few jets were working there are hardly any loungers so if you want to lay in the sun thats not really an option only chairs the hallways are freezing cold almost to the point of unbearable there was construction going on so bar was in a temporary location and didnt really have an extensive wine supply didnt eat at the restaurant considered it however that night they were having a buffet and that was 60 per person we have two kids who dont eat very much so paying that for four people kind of turned us off;3
it is a normal hotel of new york small rooms but the beds are enormous and comfortable the position is strategic because near to the metro and in front of central park i have slept in this hotel for 5 nights in a very cold period and unfortunately there was a problem to the heating the last 2 nights the laborer is kind and helpfull;3
stayed here during e3 expo week with a group of work colleagues mainly because other hotels closer to downtown were booked up but it did have the advantage of being right next to universal studios and city walk so there were plenty of food and shopping options when not working room are very spacious and are wellappointed if a little dated decor wise everything was clean and the beds comfortable there were plenty of toiletries and a coffee machine and good coffee provided in room gym was also reasonable and had everything you might want for a reasonable work out but it could have been a little larger pool was also a good size and well maintained food was especially good for a hotel of its class with a great breakfast buffet and good alacart menu in the evenings bar was;3
tick tock dinner staff were very pushy just interested in getting their tips even asking telling you to tip 20 ate in there twice had enough so found another dinner a block away staff there nice not pushy much better food there than at the tick tock room in hotel small;3
from the websites pictures and itâs location donât be fooled it is very average it is in need of a major upgrade ie the decor bathroom etc however when we left it looked like it was getting a fresh lick of paint the staff are amazing so helpful however the rooms are where itâs let down due to the way the ac has been fitted to the windows thereâs gaps which leaks in daylight therefore the room ends up freezing our shower had hairs in it when we arrived and the hot water for the shower was non existent we had to preheat it by letting it run for a good tenfifteen minutes before entering and it the temperature was just about bareable also the windows i guess are cheap single glazing as the noise felt like the traffic was in the hotel room with us but i guess itâs;3
this hotel is right across from universal if you are going to the park its perfect you can walk to the park or the hotel has a shuttle we walked and it took a little less than 10 minutes the staff at the hotel were all very nice check in and out was easy i requested a higher room floor prior to getting there and we got a room on 9th floor corner which had great view of the city and universal the rooms arent too bad but the hotel itself needs an upgrade kinda outdated the beds were soft and the room was clean the elevators are slow but i think they are addressing this there is a restaurant on site the breakfast buffet was good had plenty to chose from staff is nice there our breakfast was included so not sure on the price the dinner menu is expensive the;3
pros there were two gentlemen working the front desk who were very friendly and professional i had to switch rooms after my first night more on that later they had me leave my luggage with them behind the front desk when i left to go sightseeing in the morning when i returned in the evening i was able to pick up my luggage and my new room was ready another time they were very helpful and let me use their front desk computer and printer to print my mets tickets from stub hub hotel is in a great location if you are using the subway it is a 60 second walk to the 123 subway station and only a 510 minute walk to another train line that lets you off right by central park you are only a 1530 minute train ride from all the major tourist attractions in manhattan the;3
i had a good experience with this hotel we stayed 3 nights in a triple bedroom it was clean the employees are very nice and helpful the location is good very close to the metro and in a multicultural neighbourhood with easy access to laguardia airport by m60 bus but dont expect anything fancy it is an old building with shared bathrooms and internet is not working in the room you have to go in the lobby or basement;3
i was very excited to find the jane and be able to potentially use this as my ongoing hotel when i come into nyc ever couple of months the good most of the staff was very friendly and attentive you could tell that customer service was an important training from management the location is excellent its just below meat packing in the charming west village the ace subway is just a few blocks away on 14th theres a dag supermarket also just 2 blocks away plus the high line bike path charming streets restaurants chelsea the village and all of lower manhattan are not far its great to feel more local and not near midtown the rooms beds and bathrooms are all very clean it seemed the shared bathrooms were cleaned a few times a day each room has a tv alarm;3
great location very safe rooms are small and air conditioned barely worked had to call for a fan to circulate air the elevators are extremely slow and 2 were not working apparently the hotel provides miles per stay but was never mentioned at checkin or checkoutvery poor customer service;3
overall it was a decent hotel considering that it is in the city and youre paying a pretty penny for it i expected a bit more there should have at least been milkcreamer and sugar in the room for the coffee and tea since you had to pay for the coffee also we could not get internet in our room even though we paid for it overall it was a decent stay the hotel staff were all very friendly and accommodating and the roof top pool was pretty good and great to use on a hot day;3
the rooms at the empire are small and in need of updating and rooms on the 11th floor are miserably hot with no solution we moved to a lower floor quiet and clean we could only get internet in the lobby although no prob using internet on the phone friendly knowledgeable staff;3
ive been staying for 6 nights from1128 to 1204 and what i have to say are the following 1 every hotel rooms in nyc are small so lets face it we dont need to much space to sleep only if u want some space you should go to 5star hotels and pay much more 2 my room was at 8th floor and felt little old but who cares every day was clean and bed was very confortable so after walking by the city during 12 hours i only wanted a good bed and i got it 3 bathroom also small but hot wã¡ter anytime towels and tissues well provided and clean 4kind staff who let me check in at 10am out there was freezing and my flight arrived at the morning and they kept my luggages untill i took the cab to airport at the night so what i paid for this hotel is pretty much fair the;3
my daughter and i have just returned from a short sight seeing break to new york this hotel met all our needs we had a twin room on the 5th floor yes hotel could do with some tlc room comfortable had teacoffee maker paper cups but this was fine bath filled quickly with hot water didnt use the shower old style radiator heated room quickly once turned on but hissed a bit so didnt leave it on overnight great base only 25 mins away from subway quick route to ny centre great value and staff pleasant enough;3
we stayed here when we visited the empire state building so the location was perfect and very convenient the room was a bit small even for nyc hotel but the staff was very friendly and accommodating we were able to see the top of the empire state building from our very small window but it was a beauty to see at night the showers need a little more pressure overall it served the purpose;3
selection of food was limited mostly over the top fancy food it needs some everyday food more staff and a much better location for the bar in the lobby next to the entrance is where it is located when there is a great round penthouse with all glass walls for a fantastic view but the bar is not there;3
location excellent arrived at midnight and i was quickly checked in i arrived to my room which was correct unfortunately a brutal aspiration noise from the climate system of the building on the side makes it truly difficult to sleep the blowing noise is so brutal that tomorrow i will leave the hotel and will look for a proper place to sleep if you chose this hotel make sure your room is not on the back of the building unless you plan to go out at night hard and sleeping is not relevant;3
our room was nice and clean checkin checkout were relatively pleasant and im happy with stay overall however do not come here and expect to use the pool for relaxing it is full of rowdy kids from early morning to late night parents dont care and seem to just be happy that they dont have to deal with them i really think the hotel should have family hours maybe morning and adult hours maybe afternoon around the pool area we specifically picked this hotel because we were hoping for some chill time around the pool but that was impossible i even overheard one kids telling another that he went to the bathroom in the pool;3
all in all the place is nice and well located however the room was really small which wouldnt have been a huge problem if we could open the closet properly this wasnt possible because the door hit the bed and therefore we couldnt open it more than 13 uncomfortable other than that the bed was excellent we liked the hotel and its history and finally it doesnt deserve all the bad comments i read but they really got to fix this closet issue;3
stayed at the hotel for one night as it was close to the universal studios i was told it was a very nice hotel and when i arrived everyone was extremely helpful however when the concierge assisted me to my room he demanded that he gets a tip the concierge stood in my room and rubbed his fingers in my face to give a hint for me to give him a tip for him to do that to a guest is very rude and shouldnt be tolerated at all i do give tips to people who deserve it but they should not be forcing you to tip especially how the concierge demarnded the tip i would be happy to talk to a manager about this;3
rooms are aged to my opinion towels had better days staff is helpful shuttle to universal runs every 15 min coffee shop closes at 2pm if you come for one day id take something in la and drive to universal studios stay near is nice but doesnt give you much;3
the room was fine there was a bit of problem trying to get the hot water to come up we wasted a lot of water15 min we tried several rooms and the hotel staff was not very nice to us;3
the location is great right by central parkcolumbus circlelincoln center the hotel itself is mediocre at best the rooms are small and the bathrooms are especially cramped we also had a rude encounter with the hotel staff when we arrived there was coffee sugar etc and a coffee maker we would make coffee everyday however we noticed that the housekeeping wouldnt replenish the sugar bar etc when they cleaned the room everyday we called down to housekeeping to ask them and the lady on the phone said its not their job if you want it replenished you have to call ummm sorry maam i dont know which hotels youve worked at but at any quality hotel the housekeeping replenishes things in the room usually everything from soap in the bathroom to coffee to snacks in;3
this property is a hostel but wasnt listed that way the room was extremely small but had a small private bath it was listed as having a hairdryer and coffeemaker which were not available but the place was quiet clean and air conditioned it is located about 6 blocks west of the northern end of central park and was only 3 blocks from the nearest subway it is definitely more for younger people just wanting a place to spend the night;3
the empire hotel is in a great location walking distance to many restaurants and central park however the air conditioning system was very noisy and i didnt get a great nights sleep also there were no coffee making facilities in my room my colleague did have a keurig in her room but was told the hotel was out of kcups;3
i guess for the price and location it want too bad the place was not great with filthy soiled and torn carpets on the landing the rooms were not much better but at least the noisy air con worked the shower worked and the bed linen and towels were clean and fresh there was a turkish deli about 100 yards up central park west road which was handy for free wifi and great coffee and food the hotel is straight across the street from central park and is handy for the underground station on 103st about a 10 minute walk in downtown direction turn right as you leave the hotel just use the blue c line and make sure you go downstairs once through the station ticket barrier and follow the signs for downtown on the level below the staff were very helpful and couldnt do;3
5 night stay myself young adult daughter after 6 nights in midtown we enjoyed a more residential location however did not find it peaceful at night as front street facing room particularly on saturday night conversations from bar across the road sounding like the people were beside me in bed but then again new yorkers are not known for talking but rather yelling so used my ear plugs at this hotel the hotel is very dated however rooms are being upgraded i had an upgraded room offer via email but did not view until after checkin unfortunately was not offered during checkin so disappointed with that i suppose i couldve acted on this but chose not to the room q deluxe suite was good size bed comfortable clean unfortunately carpeting felt dirty under foot shower;3
i am not familiar with other hotels near the airport yet this seemed okay the rooms are not very functional for those who are business travelers the chairs do not roll nor can the height of a chair be adjusted;3
just returned from an amazing week in nyc stayed at the new yorker for its great location and accessibility to everywhere this is where the hotel scores really highly with penn station right next door and easy access uptown and downtown hotel itself is iconic with some beautiful art deco features in communal areas but rooms themselves are very basic and the general decor could do with updating staff are amazing and helpful but the hotel looks to tease out additional fees at every opportunity 22 per room per night taxes to use wifi tv and gym whether you want to or not plus 5 per bag for hotel to mind your case from checkout to pick up time on the plus thereâs an amazing restaurant linked to the hotel called ticktock thatâs open 247 and is the epitome of an;3
on arrival at the hotel the grand foyer is lovely unfortunately the checkin was not particularly friendly arriving at approx 130am we were dealt with in a curt manner and no friendliness from the man rooms are very small and certainly not the photo that was shown in the virgin holidays images as the room was just to sleep we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view no response was received the elevator situation is main issue with the hotel we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning we chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up returning to their;3
i had internet access in the room for a total of about 30 minutes on the first night of a 3day stay spent about 40 minutes on checkin with just one party in front of me and shared my room with at least two seemingly drugged cockroaches the location of this hotel is extremely convenient and some of the staff members were very friendly;3
looks very impressive as you approach on the the street inside it has some old world charm but not as much as you expect from the outside we had a coffee and snack there from their snack bar and sat in the foyer the light feature and ceiling are fantastic it is in a great location but is probably noisy;3
highly priced for what i got view from room was terrible internal next to wall some staff excellent others horrible great location lost electricity for 20 hours but they managed crisis well water not available one day;3
for the fairly reasonable price i could tolerate a few of these things but together they added up to a disappointing experience cramped guest room and bathroom view of rusty mechanical equipment in a deep pit between buildings mindnumbingly noisy air unit in the room wifi charges except in lobby and a couple of other places 31 including mandatory tip for two small gin tonics in disposable plastic cups on the pool deck facility needs cleaning or repair in some places on the plus side my wife had a much better experience here about 2 years ago so your luck may be better the rooftop deck is a nice place to sit but go elsewhere for drinks location is excellent for central park broadway etc price was good;3
we were very concerned after booking a room and then reading the reveiws should we cancel left it too late anyway arrived tired and ready for sleep i was worried that i might find a cockroach in my bed but was told by my friend to be more positive so how was it lift and hallways seemed dirty and smelly which did not give a good first impression but room was fine ok the carpets had seen better days but we had clean sheets and towels every day bathroom clean with plenty of hot water shower over bath very powerful staff great subway conveniently close breakfasted at the key west diner every morning fast service and friendly staff i had never been to new york before and decided my money would be better spent in the cut price designer stores than using;3
we just got back from our fatherson trip to new york and our stay at the astor on the park i have to say i was a little worried after reading some of the reviews however i was pleasently relieved when we got to the hotel i wont say its fabulous but i will call it sufficient at the price though you cant beat it 145night as most people have suggested you dont go to new york to stay in your room in all honesty this hotel is not a place you would want to spend to much time in your room the rooms were tight to say the least but we had a double bed room there was enough room for two double beds a tv and a small cupboard for your clothes there honestly was not a whole lot of room to move around the rooms would be very crowded for more than three;3
excellent location for me comfortable bed and de luxe room the regular room was really bad clean nice bathrooms room well serviced elevators only one out of 4 went to my floor;3
the location of the empire hotel is fantastic right by lincoln center easy to get everywhere and as we have friends on the uws even better so that was one of the main reasons we selected it another reason we chose the hotel was because it had a rooftop pool and as my husband was going to be in meetings for the three days we were there at the end of may i figured id be using it a lot sadly not even though it should have been opened by the end of may the bad spring weather had delayed the pool opening it opened the day we left that was a big disappointment the room we got was small common in ny dark and with the worst view ever we were in the well directly overlooking and just above all the ac units and piping the noise level from the ventilation;3
if youre interested in staying at a pretty place with a fancy bar and celeb sightings this is the place for you if you are looking for a well laid out stress free get away look elsewhere everything at the empire is attractivefrom the wallpaper to the pretty lighting the bar is comfy and the rooftop is super swanky the sink is way too shallow to brush your teeth and wash your face within 2 minutes of each other the towels are thin and sparse the showers glass wall seems to be placed on the wrong side of the shower head there is no way to avoid getting the floor wet i imagine that the ceiling of every bathroom has a water stain from the floor above the elevators seem to come on a first come first served basis so youll see them go past your floor a few times;3
i stayed here two nights because i needed to be in close proximity to the upper west side my room was maybe 300 sq ftit was clean but incredibly tiny front desk was extremely strict about my check in time being 300 even though they had ample rooms available and i had arrived at 230 i waited in the lobby until 315 before re approaching as the front desk staff had said they would call me when my room was available they never would have called i went to the rooftop bar which was empty at 6 on a thursday on the weekend it was clearly quite the club spot but i was so disillusioned with my thursday experience i chose to go elsewhere it is adequate if you need to stay on the uws and clean but i would not expect much more than that;3
this hotel is a short walk to universal studios and is very well maintained however all restaurants are very overpriced breakfast buffet 23 and the rooms are small good pool area but hot tub is not hot our main problem was the management as a long time diamond member i expected a good room but got a terrible one that was so small it ruined the trip i was also told that nothing on the exec level was available for several days but the next day two of my acquaintances checked in and got rooms on that level in short we were constantly given the runaround as managers did not seem to know the status of our booking or the room availability;3
much more youth hostel than hotel compare to european standards incredible high price for very poor noisy room air condition was so loud that could be switch on only for short periods no chance to sleep with but to be honest it was the cheapest hotel we were able to find in manhattan and rooms were clean and acceptable to stay there if you do not expect too much it is ok with good position for exploring ny;3
the location of the hotel is wonderful if you plan to attend an event at madison square garden if not its a taxi ride to attractions good restaurants and shopping the lobby was bustling with travelers and the lines were long at check in we had to check our bags since our room was not ready and we waited in a long line to retrieve our luggag once the room was ready our room was small but clean it had a small living area with a sofa desk and television along with a coffee maker the bedroom was small too with a very comfortable bed and mattress there was construction and scaffolding outside our windows so we kept the drapes closed the bathroom was adequate but the low pressure shower head with little warm water was unpleasant i dont think there was heat;3
we stayed here again in july and before we went we got an email saying they are changing to wydnham we didnt like the hotel this time it was different grotty and not as nice smelling as usual;3
we booked this hotel as my birthday treat for our last night on holiday after 2 weeks staying with relatives in the states expectations were high given the price and the photos we didnt mind spending for a little bit of luxury and were very much looking forward to this we arrived in nyc at 7 am that morning and went straight to the hotel to presumably leave our bags with concierge and head out for the day luckily there was a room available and we were able to check in early this was so very much appreciated the check in staff were pleasant but not really welcoming or friendly i know it was early in the morning but a smile would have been nice we were in room 1144 or 1141 so up to 11th floor and into our closet our room was down a little nook which gave;3
the jane is in a great location nice staff good bar and cafe but if you intend on getting some sleep take earplugs the room doors in the hallway open and close all night the frequency of this increasing due to shared bathrooms also because there are so many doors in the hallway due to tiny rooms it seems worse;3
i wrote a very positive review of this hotel three months ago unfortunately things have changed the elevators are still limited to two rather than four and especially in the morning they can be very crowded and slow if youre like me and want fresh air in the room check ahead and ask for a room where the windows openif you can call an inch or two an open window it took hours to finally be given a room the same size as we had upgraded for which also had opening windows in fact it didnt happen until the next day the hot water pressure especially in the sink is almost nonexistent for what it was it seemed pretty overpriced i know its nyc but even so they charge extra to have a minifridge in the room for the stay no one opens the front door for guests and;3
rooms we were in very noisy outdated ac units rusty noisy and very big rooms and hotel very dark quoted swimming pool on roof was more like a large bath very disappointing staff were helpful when changing rooms;3
we stayed at the hotel the week before christmas visiting universal studios we were upgraded for a fee to a great corner room on the 19th floor overlooking the studios however the view of the park was probably the highlight of our stay there were several minor issues which ended up accumulating to a point that wed look elsewhere if we need to stay in the area again the hotel is enormous the lobby was under construction and it took us a while to find the front desk to checkin the entire area of the hotel once you come up from the parking garage seemed deserted zero ambiance they could at least place some arrows on the walls to direct the patrons the staff was courteous and friendly no issues there the food was extremely overpriced we had breakfast at the;3
my fiancã© and i stayed at the ameritania for 4 nights just recently during thanksgiving and black friday the location is brilliant as it is in the heart of times square when we arrived we were informed we had an upgrade to a bigger room which was nice however upon arrival the room was small and the viewthere was no view it was of a courtyard with no natural light i decided to ask reception for another room with no sunlight i was offered another room which was a standard room to then arrive and the room was even smaller the windows of the room had 2 massive cracks with tape on them and the room was not in the best of conditions i asked again and due to the time of year there was no other availability so i stuck with room i was given the rooms are far too small;3
public spaces are much nicer than the very small hotel rooms the rooms and bathrooms need updating our shower dripped all night could use a deep cleaning location of the hotel near lincoln center columbus circle and many restaurants males it very convenient bed was super comfortable;3
i have wanted to stay in the jane because of its historic significance the survivors of the titanic stayed here the hotel is old and has wonderful decorations reminiscent of a bygone era the doormen were very friendly and helpful at one point i needed a cab and didnt realize that required them to run down the block to hail a cab since there was construction in front of the hotel that limited traffic checkin was easy and the front desk staff were friendlythe hotel has an elevator the rooms are small i brought along a 6 foot long charging cord for my cell phone and it stretched the length of the bed at the foot of the bed are shelves that are only a few inches deep therefore if you are over 6 feet tall im not sure you will fit in the bed the room felt larger;3
i stayed at this hotel with my wife 5 nights at the beginning of june the location was perfect for me but that is the only reason that kept me there for the full 5 nights the hotel is located close to lincoln center and just across the street from central park west rooms are clean but very small and a couple can hardly stay together in the room bathroom is tiny and not comfortable we made the mistake of taking the breakfast one morning and it was very disappointing;3
cons this hotel really needs a renovation the lobby furniture was scuffed and ready to be replaced the corridors to the rooms are narrow and twisting the rooms are small and the carpets just dont seem clean the bathroom is okay but the handle on our bathroom door was defective and we kept getting locked in the room pros the staff were very helpful and the check in was swift it is conveniently located and not expensive;3
five stars for location the crossroads of the upper westside across from lincoln center steps away from the subway with connections all over manhattan buses galore rooftop bar with gorgeous views staff pleasant and helpful room small but adequate and very clean which is of utmost importance to me pj clarkâs right downstairs one of the oldest names in pubs in the city restaurants galore;3
stayed here for 2 nights while in the city the room and hotel looked nothing like these pictures the place was old and run down the room was the size of a shoebox too terrible i wish i had taken a pic the bathroom was old too it looked like the tile had paint over it to cover up grime the beds were old and hard as rocks the reason they didnt get 2 stars was because the staff was very friendly;3
the staff was a bit difficult gave myself and my friend the run around based on our international credit cards and eventually told us that they werent needed anyway this whole process took about two hours as they assured we would need to go to a bank to get it sorted in the end the rooms were tight tight tight as others have said but the bathrooms though shared were nice as was the location fun nightlife as said by others also the doors slamming also previously mentioned;3
it used to be that booking a suite meant a spacious set of rooms on a high floor 3840 and included a kitchenette but whern i arrived this february i was given a small set of rooms without kitchen facilities on the 7th floor witjh no view at all and barely any natural daylight i was moved once a better room became available but even then i had to give up my current room before the new one was available and was told that i would have to move the luggage myself the staff are generally helpful and the hotel had to cope with a revolving door and half the lifts being out of service i had booked here for several years in succession prior to this so overall i like staying there but now i have to at least conisder alternatives;3
we stayed in a standard double room and it was very clean but quite small not much storage space but it was adequate for our 5 day stay bathroom was small but had a great shower public areas large and comfortable a must is the tick tock diner joined to the hotel open 24 hours and the food is good surprised that there was a 10 dollar charge each day for wifi but that includes visits to the business centre and the gym;3
the property was very nice however the charges for incidentals were higher than average and the charge for the bottled water that comes in the room just seems like a bit much other than that everything else was fine;3
just returned from a visit to washington and new york where we stayed at the empire hotel for five nights the location is very good close to central park and the columbus and lincoln metro stations the staff at reception were friendly and efficient and chris the concierge was extremely helpful at advising about places to visit and how to get there his advice on the best bagel place midtown was spot on the downside of the hotel is that it is rather dark and tired there is a preponderance of dark browns both in the rooms and in the lobby which can become rather depressing especially when your room looks out on to a central well and is overlooked by other rooms our room was rather small but probably similar size to other similar hotels in new york where space is at a;3
lets start with the negatives the hotel rooms do feel a little outdated with all the lamps ect the hotel and rooms were not to bad the only real issues we had were the air conditioning systems being extremely loude to the point that sleep was difficult and it wasent jus our room no 315 it was everyones you could hear whenever an air conditioner had been turned on one of the most uncomftable things would have been the hotel elevators they took about 3 min to get up 3 floors and are are out of date needing to be retested and certified witch i know in australia is illegal to operate an elivator to the public witch has not been recently tested however im not to sure on the los angeles government the positives the checkin staff were great also very helpful whenever you;3
i have mixed feelings about this hotel the hotel itself is very nice old could use renovation but very clean and had a welcoming feeling all the times while there from bellmen housekeeping and overall i great feeling in the hotel location is awesome housekeeping was awesome i called for extra coffee in room since i forgot the â come back later â sign on the door and our coffee did t get refilled they were there with them shortly and very nice about it now the check in is a way different story i requested an early check in if possible i work in business and know itâs not always possible but we make our best for our guests got to the hotel at 1030 to find out that our requested suite is not going to be available before the earliest 6 pm;3
firstly the positives beds comfy and pillowâs comfy good location for sights thatâs about it room is tiny really not big enough for a family of 4 i slept in bed closest to the window and there was a cold draft noisy i know that i should expect noise from the streets as in central manhattan shouldnât really be subjected to hearing next door flush their toilet or turn their taps on and off for a family the room is just not big enough so if there are more than two people in your party donât consider this homeless people loitering outside with some investment it could be really lovely but itâs shabby and dated my daughter said she felt like she was in the hollywood tower of terror;3
booked through expedia and we were only there for one night and were not expecting the red carpet we got in late and left very early the neighborhood was beautiful and quiet for big city we were a bit north of the touristy area but a train a block away did a non stop drive to the times square area the hotel was not too hard to find and had a bit of a sterile appearance the front desk had a minimal school like desk and the staff was more interested in clock watching than serving i was to leave my credit card info with them and was a bit hesitant about that but it all worked out the room was okay bathroom was clean but tiles chipped and so on dont expect to get an extra towel or special treatment unless someone happens to know where they are kept and someone;3
great location very close to universal and centrally located to hollywood and santa monica etc the pool area needs to be updated they were in the middle of doing a renovation on the dinning room so they moved the breakfast buffet outside and they still charged 28 for a breakfast buffet some of the food was cold so the next morning i just ordered from the regular menu and they wanted to charge me 7 for a hot tea that is ridiculous i was disappointed by the quality of this hilton hotel and i have stayed in alot of other hilton hotels before;3
we had a room booked 4 nights after sleeping though night 1s with gnats in 3 different places in the room we were switched to a new room the next day the new room had heat problems the ac needed to be on but was stuck on heat the fridge was left empty no coffee machine and places to plug in phones by the bed were never brought in in exchange for my daughter and i sleeping with gnats for a night we were moved to a different room and given 4 extra water bottles i donât think 6 in free water was enough i think the 1st nights room should have been refunded;3
the empire hotel is in a very good location being at a walking distance from central park and broadway however the hotel itself is nothing special the rooms are very small although clean our room was on the 8th floor facing the internal courtyard and there was a constant noise day and night coming probably from the heating system breakfast is not included you can go to the rooftop buffet for an additional 24 pp but there is a starbucks literally round the corner it was not a bad stay but i wouldnât go back to the empire if i visited ny again;3
iâd seen the new yorker many times on holiday sites and hotel booking pages but never visited previously location wise youâre at the rear of madison square gardens so pretty central and itâs easy to access both my office and most of touristy manhattan the hotel would once have been very grand indeed but has certainly seen better days the reception sorry lobby is spacious but with few check in counters for some reason the lifts elevators are guarded by security but they do helpfully point you towards the right set on your first visit and can also guide you to the gym basement level if needed my room was spacious with a dual aspect a rarity in any major city the bed was comfortable but overall the room was again a little spartan the furniture will need to be;3
overall the hotel was expensive but that is expected for ny the rooftop very nice view we had 2 drinks only and price was 40 bathroom was not comfortable couldnt figure out the shower set up and the sink was designed with not much space between the faucet and the basin;3
this hotel located five minutes away from los angeles metro station however there are many people approach other people around metro station which made me feel insecure and wont recommend person who consider to stay at this hotel alone you will feel insecure when you walk back home by yourself in the dark night hotel staff seems not knowing the stuff well and not welling to help guest overall its just a hotel for people to stay highly recommend people who stay in this hotel have to be at least group of two people;3
im unsure if la in general or universal city is crazy expensive but we paid a lot for what we got breakfast isnt included and is an average buffet considering you pay 18 per person for it wifi is not complimentary weird when most places have wifi as standard now we switched rooms as our first was right above a generator and delivery bay and no signal the room was a bit bland but the beds comfy and the bathrooms were nice;3
i loved that we were able to walk to city walk to restaurants but hated the condition of hotel very dark old rooms old furniture refrigerator on the floor not up to hilton standards this hotel is loud 24 hours a day with slamming door not that its hotels fault just rude guests the airconditioning does not work properly in all rooms we had 3 room one room it worked perfect housekeeping staff does not speak any english they have no idea what you say to them therefore no help parking is a 10 minutes from most rooms also on the weekend they have a huge buffet great but it where you try to go to parking in the hall and literally you can barley walk without getting shoved around very bad planning the only great thing about hotel is location and some staff i;3
when we first arrived at the empire we had to wait for another guest to be dealt with at reception who was complaining about needing maintenance work done on a faulty shower at the time i wondered if that was an omen then it was our time and after asking for as quiet a room as possible we were offered one on 11th floor on getting there we were shocked how the room smelt of a most unpleasant chlorine smell presuming it was associated with the air con we returned to reception and asked for an alternative we were then offered one on 4th that didnt have such a stunning view down broadway and towards central park straight away we noticed it did not have a mini bar and we like to use such a thing or fridge to keep our fresh milk cool to go in hot drinks back to reception;3
the beds were comfy decent tv decent wifi and next to a metro station what more could you want maybe rooms that didnât look like a 1960s blackpool boarding house maybe air con that didnât sound like it was made by boeing maybe a hotel where they knew what a paint brush was maybe bathrooms without cracked tiles and doors which close a restaurant a very tatty hotel but absolutely fine for someone just to sleep;3
i stayed at the empire hotel for 1 night i was in town to see an opera at the met the hotels location is fantastic its right across the street from lincoln center the hotel itself was very chic almost too chic for me checkin took a little while but we had just come with a big group and they handled us as best they could the room was fine the bed was very comfy and there was enough closet space for my outfit the bathroom was a little funny the shower didnt have a full door it reminded me of showering in a french hoteland not in a good way the room also didnt have many light sources it just had the entryway light the light inside the bathroom and a lamp on the nightstand but it was wellstocked and included earplugs by the beds im guessing to combat;3
the empire is next to lincoln centre and near central park and columbus circle thus a very good location for music and operalovers the hotel is rated 4 stars but is in our view more towards 3 stars dark small rooms filthy dark corridors non functioning elevators expensive breakfast 35 but definitely not worth it so most guests went to starbuck in the same house no free wifi in the rooms12 per day however sometimes it was available free in the lobby and of course always perfect at starbuckâ´s hopeless reception which charged incidentials incorrectly to wrong rooms which caused a lot of anger and efforts for the guests the bar was ok;3
hotel is very interesting with its past history and previous guestsbut the daily extras are a bit steep compared to others in the vicinity location is excellent and staff friendly our room was a bit small and the view wasnt exactly anything to write home about but i guess what you pay for;3
i stayed for 6 nights would have changed my reservation if id realised how far away it was i dont mind walking or using trains but not at night so i had to use taxis each night i was on the 9th floor in a room outside near the stairway difficult to get my suitcase along the narrow passage way the room was reasonably clean but in need of repair especially the bathroom the bed was comfortable and the room big enough for one but would be a squeeze for two if you want ice be prepared for a trip to the 11th floor as that is the only ice machine overall not too bad but very overpriced as i saw other hotels that friends were staying in which were much cheaper and offered better location and facilities;3
beds are very small upon arrival the doormen were extremely friendly however reception staff were a little cold paid for hotel well in advance and were left with a bill of over 100 dollars on the morning of us leaving for âservices and feesâ not satisfied with the behavior of certain staff;3
i stayed at wyndham new yorker hotel for a long weekend in nyc very positive is the location of the hotel close to penn station with good access to the metro and lirr to jfk airport as well as to uptown and downtown the hotel itself is a very busy place with queues at the checkin and at the luggage storage the wyndham rewards desk was always closed when i was in the lobby anyway the staff is friendly and trying to keep waiting time short the rooms are clean and the sleeping comfort is good unfortunately the standard rooms are very very very very small so that there is even no space for your luggage traveling with two adults this could be a little challenge the bathroom is clean an functional although its time for renovation to get back from the 1990s as;3
i booked this hotel before i read the reviews on tripadvisor so after booking the prepaid rate on their website i considered myself locked in the arrangement and was expecting the worse given the number of negative reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor especially just a week before i had booked although i will probably book elsewhere next time it would be because this hotel is uptown the only two flaws i would comment on are the dirty carpet flooring and curtains in the room but everything else was acceptable it was hugely surprising to find a coffee maker and hair dryer in the rooms and mini gym as well as internetfax facilities around the back of the lobby i had a 3night stay at this place consider this hotel if youre on a tight budget you want to be;3
due to a sudden bereavement this was not our originally booked hotel as it wasnt available but location of the newyorker is brilliant our window overlooked madison square garden couldnt have been better for the subway it was just at the side door and the main penn station was across the road our time here had unfortunately been cut down by a day but we got here and the staff at the hotel are all excellent from what we experienced anyway it is definately art deco in its furnishings but rooms were lovely and clean comfy bed and nice big tv your not in it that long anyway would definately consider it again if on location alone;3
we arrived at the empire hotel on the 25th apri i know that the hotel had been informed prior to us arriving that it was mine and my twin sisters 40th birthday on the 26th maybe on the hope that we might get an upgrade on the room but those kinds of things dont happen to me but there was nothing at all said no complimentary drinks nothing when we checked into our room i told my husband to not even unpack and requested a better room i was in new york i dont want to look out of the window straight at a brick wall fair enough it was changed prompty and although the rooms are very small no wardrobes or space to put your cases we were happier with it when my sister checked in she was in the same position but they did not have a new room for her she was;3
500 a nite and we were never in our room great location to the park but this hotel charges u 30 a night for parking and an extra 35 for a roll out bed wasnât aware of this when we booked it if i had to do it over again i would of never spent this much;3
nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff certain parts of the hotel including the rooms felt neglected drinks prices were expensive for the location and quality personal opinion location is reasonable for access to all parts of manhattan;3
i first stayed here in november 2017 with my sister we arrived to the room about 6ish from newark and i had a bad migraine the view from the window was lovely not the empire state building direction but still good room was small but most are in new york there was a tv with an ok range of channels on a bath in the bathroom as welcome too i really liked stayed here itâs close enough to times square penn station subway is right outside itâs next to maddison square garden too and there is a 24hour diner at the bottom there are fees to pay at the end for the facilities regardless of whether you use the facilities or not and if you donât want to be caught out i would use the resort fee checker before booking any new york hotel in february 2019 i returned with;3
we did not choose this hotel but were sent there when there was a mix up with our hotel booking service this hotel was clean and the service was good staff were pleasant the lighting and decor were part of the styling of this hotel it is a fairly standard four star hotel in a good location room service menu was limited and expensive there are however a number of restaurants nearby you have to pay for wifi which is unfortunate but you pay for each device which gets expensive you also pay about 3 for a cup of tea or coffee in the room the minibar is one of the most expensive i have seen again there is a starbucks and duane reade just a minute away so you can stock up on necessities there the room was extremely small and the beds were very firm which would be a problem;3
hotel is conveniently located near restaurants bars and a starbucks around the corner hotel staff is friendly and helpful and checkincheckout was quick and efficient wifi surprisingly fast for hotel wifi rooms are relatively large by nyc standards bathrooms are in need of major repairs andor cleaning but overall not terrible;3
stayed here for 4 days with my son the location is fantastic very close to the subway and many great restaurants the neighbourhood is safe and relatively quiet it is nyc after all we stayed on the top floor in one of the newly renovated rooms which was really nice and contemporary linens were new and very clean the only downside is that hot water runs out at night and that the staff at this hotel is not friendly or helpful at all if you just want a clean basic room this is it;3
i was staying at the astor last week for my first trip to new york and must admit i was a bit worried by all the negative reviews that have been posted on the first night it seemed like they were all coming true the whistling radiators nowhere nearby to eat but then after a good nights sleep the beds are clean and comfortable and a shower the showers are really nice here i felt much better and then set about exploring nyc and its then you realise that the astor is an ok place to stay once you learn how to use the subway and explore the city the astor becomes a really nice base there are two decent cafes two streets behind the hotel there is a grocery store nearby and of course the hotel is right opposite the park which is lovely in the mornings but most of;3
the hotel is located in midtown manhattan perfect location for all activities the downside ist the noise so even though we were on the 8th floor the noise was quite disturbing additionally to the street noise theres a loud elevator sound every single time the elevator stops on your floor rooms are very clean and well equipped hotel staff and especially the doorman are very friendly and helpful room was always clean and had an ok size for a midprizerange hotel in nyc so overall an ok hotelbut be aware on departure when you leave to the airport they offer you their own limo service that costs you 10 more than a yellow cab it even takes you longer because theyre trying to save money by avoiding tolls;3
great but not so great on short notice my wife and i decided to travel from la to ny to attend my brothers birthday and 60 wedding anniversary after checking out several hotels in the timeâs square area we decided on the empire hotel adjacent to the lincoln center located on broadway and 63 street when we arrived at the hotel around 600 pm saturday evening i was taken by the exotic furniture style simulated tiger skin chairs and odd shaped couches at check in i stated when i booked the room i requested a very quiet room as i was a light sleeper actually i prefer quiet to view the clerk informed me that the hotel was fully booked and he would see what he could do the bellhop escorted us to the 11th floor room 1120 the room and bathroom were small after placing our;3
we spent 4 nights as we arrived to the big apple the checking in was very fast we arrived to a quiet small double bed room which the beds where very comfortable how ever the was badly furnished and the maitanence wasnât good itâs a good thing we only had to sleep in the room and not stay in it more than we should all and all great location 8av 34 th street but a very average hotel;3
we stayed at the empire hotel for one night during our honeymoon in april to our delight we were upgraded to a suite in the top floor that was simply stunning with two bathrooms walk in wardrobe and a huge living room we could not believe our luck and the views on to lincoln centre were just the icing on the cake oh but the drawback it was right underneath the hotel barclub and the music did not stop banging until 3 oclock in the morning making it impossible for us to get any sleep we had to get up a 4 to catch a plane we asked for earplugs but these only blocked some of the noise staff were helpful and brought us the earplugs quickly and free of charge i would recommend this hotel but only if youre young and want a dance club in your room or if you can sleep;3
the hilton is good for its location if you have a family want to walk to universal you have to factor in that if you have a car its an extra 24 a night to park at the hotel try request a view of the city or over universal on a higher floor we didnt its closer than the sheraton if you have smaller children the breakfast is pretty average the staff are very friendly though;3
we were recommended this by trailfinders it is central and the upfront costs are reasonable however the whole affect is shabby and very much not chic even the door men who were pleasant were unkempt the lobby is gloomy the service there ranged from helpful to indifference depending on the person the rooms are small but it is ny but cleaning is good the bed was comfortable but the bathroom was miniscule and the shower got everything in sight wet the room safe failed but the overwhelming thing was the notion of extra unwarranted cost make coffee with the machine and pay 3 dollars wifi is 10 dollars a day in the room the chowder house provided good food but nearly 100 dollars for 2 soups a drink and 2 appetizers it is good for a central position central;3
many hotels have facility fees now but when i booked directly with wyndham these fees were hidden my reservation receipt clearly stated total for stay 34867 charged 41026 at checkout explanation i received via email thank you for contacting the new yorker a wyndham hotel customer care regarding your concern when booking on the web site for any wyndham hotels resorts inc property there is an optional link in blue on the pay page which is the second step of the reservation process where you can click to get a complete break down of both the room rate individual tax charge amounts and cancellation policies including any deposits or fees it is here where it lists the facility charges of 3408 per night plus tax ridiculous;3
the location is great very convenient to subway station and shopping room was clean and bigger than i thought it would be now the badthe beds are really hard however the pillows are great staff is friendly but i was given terrible directions by people at the information desk twice the bathrooms are really small a bigger person would honestly not be able to navigate these bathrooms they charge a ridiculous 5 per bag to store your luggage if you arrive early or have a later flight on top of that a rather high resort fee that as far as i could tell only covers wifi;3
this is kind of an odd property sort of like a time warp its located within walking distance to universal studios and citywalk which is very convenient the hotel itself has a heavy asian influence and feels sort of stuck in the 80s its in some ways kind of opulent but not what id call chic and modern the rooms provide good views ours was to the north we had a king alcove room which cost extra but provided a ton of space the room had a big thick carpet and was a little dated but in very good condition i just think the dã©cor could use a refreshthe walls in particular very dark the sheets and towels were actually amongst the highest quality i have encountered in a hotelvery soft and thick the bathroom was very large and the shower worked;3
ok so i think hotels in america lack the quality of standard we are used to in europe and this is why id say this was more like a 3 star the reception area is pretty with the big chandelier etc but when you get up to the floors with the rooms you realize this needs major updating even some paint would be good the receptionist told us he had given us a nice room it was pretty much of a brick wall was not a view so not sure if he was joking or not the room was clean beds comfy etc has a safe tv etc the hotel is in a good location could walk to see most sights 10 mins from time square close to madison sq gardens loved new york but next time id maybe try a different hotel;3
its too bad that we had a number of issues during our stay here because the hotel had some nice features and is located conveniently for us my first issue was with the parking i was told one thing at check in another by the parking attendant and then had a confrontation with a third staffer at the front desk who gave me a totally different story my second issue was with the hotel rates i got a nice reasonable rate by booking online through tripadvisor when i went to check out the rate was considerably higher and even though i had a printed copy of my reservation they refused to honor it i will be taking this up with my credit card company thirdly they use the same tiles on the floor of the shower stalls as on the wallsthey are so slippery that i slid and almost;3
nice place great staff cool restaurantbarbut i couldnt sleep the constant noise of the heavy doors closing was too much there is a door every eight feet as its a pod hotel i am a heavy sleeper but;3
first impressions set the tone when i checked in early in the day not expecting my room yet and the registration clerk tried to upsell me early access to a great room for 50 cash only i declined and checked my bags as i had a day of work meetings and didnt need the room until later little did i know that id be downgraded for having declined when i finally returned to claim my room key i was surprised to find id been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home it had a lovely view high on the 35th floor which i appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold very cold even though the thermostat was set at 72 i could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the uninsulated painted over bathroom windows the bed;3
the hotel has a perfect location specially if you are visiting universal studios the place is clean rooms are spacious the staff are great but if you are an international traveler please not that the hotel room doesnt have a usb charger and if you asked for power plug to be compatible with the americancanadian wall sockets they dont have it;3
the jane lovely building quaint small rooms but just lacked the ill definitely be back spark the rooftop bar is cool but very often closed and the downstairs bar is pretty but always seemed to be closed for a private function also if im being truly lazy its quite a walk to the closest subway especially when youre laden with luggagewhich has just broken a wheel staff on the other hand were great;3
the location of the hotel and the lobby are the positives of this warn out tired establishment elevators creeky rooms with oppressive heat i was one of a group of 8 staying for 3 nights and all concurred on this problem rooms clean and attractive but the limited space on the desk and the frig is taken up by the items for sale 78 for a bottle of wine;3
the hotel is within working distance for universal studios eating dinner in the bar area was less than stellar because of poor service and quality of food cold and few food options the room was clean but the bathroom sink was cracked and the one mattress bed had weak support but we had a second queen bed in the room that we used;3
they falsely advertise free wifi the wifi is free in the lobby but they asked for a charge of 10 per device per day in the rooms after what we paid for the hotel i would have expected it would be included in the price of the room room was very small with no natural daylight the bathroom door needed some attention as the paint was cracked the lobby was nice but the rooms werent as nice didnt have any issues with rooms not being cleaned like many other people the location was good its right next to central park and we were able to walk everywhere location is the only good point id give to the hotel;3
too old room bathroom and very noisy hotel ac and street its not what you are looking dor when zou go in nyc the location is great and front desk very helpful the bar is great but expensive the water in the room cost 8usd which is just not acceptable;3
the lobby has a nice lounge feel to it with the dark colors and high ceilings staff was friendly during check in which went smoothly the rooms are small which is very common in nyc the room was nice looking and was comfortable the bed and pillows were okay as far as sleeping goes the ac was okay and kept the room pretty cool nice location due to its proximity to fifth avenue and central park this hotel is right on par with the many other average hotels in nyc;3
overall accommodations were good staff checking us out were more welcoming than when we checked in i really liked the location of the hotel to universal studios and the shuttle back and forth to the park that is the main reason i chose this hotel the room was very clean and staff at the doors were friendly and very helpful;3
the room was well furnished but had a few quirks for instance no exhaust fan in bathroom water took a very long time to get hot ac was very loud and did not maintain a consistent temperature pillows were uncomfortable breakfast at the hotel restaurant was awful all of the staff were wonderful the pool area is very relaxing there is a shuttle that runs to universal every 15min and its only a 10min walk if you miss it;3
very friendly staff very small 5x7 rooms unbelievably unique bar id complain about the prices if it werent for its location if your not ready for small small spaces with big big prices then the west village is not for you overall the jane was a good experience;3
we go to this hotel every 2 months as is closed by our business in upper west side there are hotel options available sometimes empira is just too expensive for what its offers rooms are very well maintained but the interior rooms without view are not for us elevators is a painful experience wait and wait and stpos in every floor even there is nobody waiting the sunchronizing has to be improved but the hotel is very nice facilities bar and employees are very friendly;3
great location my room was tiny but very calm housekeeping staff very good concierges very very bad actually i dont think there are any overall service quite poor at the front desk except one guy who was helpful;3
the location is the main reason for staying in this hotel itâs right across lax and thereâs an airport parking right behind the hotel the room service breakfast was delivered on time and very tasty the check in service was quick and somewhat personal but the service at the lounge was bad i understand that people could get grumpy during rush hour but i thought the guy behind the bar should at least hand over the menu nicely when i approached not toss it at me with a poop face like i am bothering him room could be cleaner and use at least nonbroken sheets this hyatt regency doesnât really have the âregencyâ quality among other hyatt regency iâve visited;3
second time staying here while visiting family in the area the fact that it is convenient to universal studios is a plus but does not figure into our reasons for staying here consider this a revised review from last years entry overall this is a nice property but the construction in the lobby area not disclosed when we made the reservation through the hhonors website is a bit disconcerting the peeling wallpaper in our bathroom was another little detail which detracts from the overall experience not peeling in a trashy way looks like it was never properly glued on in the first place indicating a lack of attention to detail which might be a common thread in a lot of other reviews of this hotel biggest problem was the internet connection it took 20 minutes and a;3
great location tired rooms that need major updates to be clean old carpet old decor sagging mattresses this was probably a gem in its heyday that is now in need of complete redecorating and overhaul of hvac etc;3
we literally just stayed here between flights since it was close to the airport the staff is very welcoming and nice the room is okaybut once again i am a very picky hotel person especially when it comes to the bathroom there was no hand or bath soap so we ended up having to call for it which i found a little odd as this is probably the first time i have ever had to request it in all our travels the great thing about this place is it has a 24 hour market place for food and drinks which is perfect if you have an early or late flight or just need warm milk for the baby;3
stayed here for 5 nights nice sized clean bedroom no frills if you want somewhere comfortable to stay at reasonable cost then this place is fine the staff are helpful our fridge was not working and it would have been nice to have a kettle in the room;3
small room clean and was affordable close to subway to get to see broadway shows coney island across from central park would stay there again perfect location in new york city staff was helpfull;3
we stayed recently at this property it is functional but nothing amazing due to its proximity to universal studios the prices are high and so are the food outlets but this is what you expect good 510 minute walk to universal realistically or use the free shuttle bus pool area is small with limited provision of sun loungers good location if you want walking distance to universal otherwise nothing amazing about hotel 28 tax car park fee per night;3
we were over the moon when we were able to book this hotel on priceline for less than 300 a night during the holiday season the building is grand directly across the street from lincoln centerand steps from the subway the decor is beautiful the rooms are nice and standard size for nyc the staff is efficient and professional there is also a nice lobby level bar with seating on two floors and a very happening roof top club lines around the corner well into the night i really wanted to love this hotel if only someone had paid as much attention to the sound proofing as they did the decor we checked in on a thursday we were given a room on the first floor one up from the lobby at 330 am friday morning i just couldnt stand it anymore the street;3
we just departed if youâre looking for a quiet hotel donât stay here windows are paper thin and street noise 24 hours mattress on bed requires replacement shower was great and highlight of stay room generally stuffy and required noisy aircon to be on most of time drink card a joke 16 for 2 happy hour drinks and we got one free and then as weâre leaving a staff member gives me a card asking i mention his name even though he did nothing for us suggestions 1 given the price of a room offer a free drink or âsomething complimentary as a sweetener inducement to stay there again 2 staff smile a little more and do something to endear yourself to the customer;3
while looking forward to our stay at the new yorker hotel i received at least 1 email a day for 2 weeks upon confirming reservation online each email provided offers for upgrading my original booking additional cost for upgraded room additional cost for early checkin additional cost for late checkout and package additional cost for early checkin late checkout this was concerning as i did not consider changing original booking for a 2 night stay turned out additional costs were billed regardless of my attempts to ignore as facility fees taxes were added for use of wifi room rate that i booked was for first night only second night was significantly higher this information was not disclosed at checkin however it appears if i paid attention to fine print;3
the hotel is in a great location and the room was very comfortable room 961 had a great views but was a little dusty and there was a used dixie cup under the bed also the closet doors had smudge marks on them my check in experience was the worst ive ever had my husband booked the trip for me and put the reservation on his business card when i got there no one offered to help with my bags 2 suitcases and my arm is in a splint the lady at the desk was atefah and told me that they could not take my husbands card because he was not with me yet they told me to have the card at time of check in even though the room was in my name and card was in his since the card was a debitcredit card i could go to the atm so i brought all my luggage over there and proceeded to withdraw;3
the best thing about this hotel is its location and proximity to public transportation the hotel itself is historic but needs an update particularly in the bathrooms we had booked three standard rooms two with queen size beds and one with two twin beds the rooms with a queen size bed are much smaller than the ones with two twins in this hotel it really makes a big difference the mattress and pillows are not the best ones forgot to take our own pillows with us and none of us 6 altogether slept very well the bathrooms are very tiny outdated and have no space for your things unless you want to keep them on the floor the staff were friendly enough;3
having stayed here a few times with family and friends i must express continued disappointment with a change in management the empire hotel asks for tripadvisor reviews so here you go this has become a nickel and dime hotel which used to be a new york sro with minuscule rooms that the only flat surface is littered with revenue generating trays which are removed only after a fifty dollar fee says a lot about a hotel you will get dinged for things you never consumed they charge for the coffee in the room as well it is a mess yes it has an amazing location but there is no excuse with the way it is being managed the hotel is showing wear and tear and the shower will be a crazy experience where you will not feel comfortable or get clean my shower nozzle was broken;3
be sure you have the bell person wait will the a c fan comes on to see if you donât need to change rooms in order to sleep well or even hear the tv if cleanliness is important iâm not sure this is your first choice;3
it is like dead end of the park location and it is pretty big park when you are planning to use underground ok if you go with taxi better just pay more for hotel closer to time squereand you can walk around room is tiny even smaller then it seems on photo because it is filled with your body d and if you are twonot much space for luggage air was so dusty l dont know if its hotels problem or whole ny is just one big dust binpeople say you dont spend much time there so it doesnt matter how nice room you gettrue we came always after midninght or 2ambut then you need to feel comfyl just couldnt breath and my astma was bit problembefore we came was ok my man is healthy and couldnt stand that dust too so l didnt sleep well and we spent all days walking;3
i spent there only one night clean shared bathroom outside the room in reality was dedicated to our room only while the second room was vacant good price and excellent location close to cp and metro;3
although the new yorker is classic and iconic it is also very loud i know itâs not the hotels fault that the city of new york does their road work over night but it was very loud all night concrete saws jack hammers and dump trucks literally right outside my window my advice would be get an inside room or pay the extra cost to get very high;3
summary beware of service fees when booking checkin and during your stay great location not a hotel comfortable small apartments in nyc this is not a hotel it is a group of sparsely furnished apartments that rent like a hotel daily weekly etc the building also has permanent residential apartments so you ride the elevator with tourists and locals together as long as you go in with these limitations in mind its a great value i grew up in the neighborhood and this place is in a great location as advertised i liked having my own little upper west side apartment in a prewar building preww2 that is highly coveted in nyc i have a 2year old and there is a great playground nearby on 76th in riverside park fairway is around the corner on broadway;3
great location near times square and central park however there is no double glazing on the windows and the noise every night from police sirens and ambulances not to mention people in the streets below meant very little sleep i guess this is new york and you expect some noise but not being able to sleep means next days sightseeing is accompanied by a lot of yawning;3
this hotel is one of those only in new york kind of places barely adequate generally room was clean refrigerator worked bathroom ok had a nice view north to the east end of the nave and the crossing of cathedral of st john the divine there were safety issues however door on street is open all night 247 anyone can enter the hotel be sure to keep door to room locked when inside two of the major elevators were broken for weeks but one does not travel to nyc to spend very much time in hotel rooms if you dont mind the consistent bad situations i mentioned then by all means stay here its very convenient to subway broadway irt taxis delis etc;3
i was skeptical about this hotel considering its pretty much located in the armpit of a freeway right next to the airport airplanes taking off just blocks away surprisingly the hotel itself was quiet as for the room however even after requesting a quiet room twice once over the phone and once upon arrival we were given the room right next to the icevending machines and the elevators plus we must have been near some vents or something because we could hear our neighbors muffled conversations all night the cherry on top was the mysterious tapping sounds we heard starting at dawn that kept us awake and confused for hours as for cleanliness and decor it was nice and modern but not amazing the hotel is also not easy to access as its circled by oneway traffic;3
initial check in was fine only to find that the pool was under refurbishment the pool was one of the reason we chose this hotel the shower door was missingbroken meaning that the bathroom flooded whenever we used the shower we reported this to the front desk and they replied with its designed like that really they offered extra towels so that we could mop it up the blind was broken not working meaning we could not darken the room at night resulting in bad nights sleep and modesty issues we reported this to the front desk but they ignored us and failed to fix it no complimentary wifi in roomwanted to charge 10 bucks per device per day maid did not refresh coffee machine podswe called reception asking for pods and were told 3 bucks per;3
i was here for the weekend for an event i travel frequently and stay at many hilton properties around the globe first the good the staff are friendly and really try hard very accommodating food at breakfast good servers on top of it self parking is the way to go but almost 40 a day valet almost 48 if i remember beds and pillows good now the bad the carpets look and feel dirty the showers need updating very old and have the handheld nozzle water got scalding hot ac grate was full of dirt and looked moldy we couldnât move rooms so many events that they were full remember this is right against universal so great for families close walk also but also loud not a place to stay if you want quiet;3
we paid a lot to stay here and i was disappointed with the size of the room the bathroom was certainly 2 star the bed was lovely to sleep in there was a lot of noise from the street and from other hotel guests the staff were nice a friendly and the place was very tidy we had no view to speak of but the hotel is in a prime spot for touring;3
the closest hotel to universal there is a shuttle bus to universal but its really not necessary as its so close stayed on the executive floor but there is really nothing that special about it there used to be a lounge but it was cut out astoo many friends of guests were using it according to one of the receptionists nothing to do with cutting costs then they could offer internet as a perk but i guess it never crossed teir mind to ffer it as a perk to the exec level 17 for self parking or 22 for valet yup a couple more extra charges and heres where it gets strange you get coupons to have an ok continental breakfast which you can upgrade to a more comprehensive one its really weird how you sit in a room next to the main breakfast one in a separate breakfast;3
we were able to get an early convenient check in and parking was discounted my first night room was not for me it was very small with a small closet was only place to fit clothes this was expected but the location of the room was in the middle of the hotel with no window to the street extremely stuffy and dark we tried for another room and they were able to accommodate for the next night this room was much roomier the amenities in the room were great and we did have a promotional free wifi the hotel itself doesnât have much no vending machines or restaurant so stock up there is a bar lounge that was very quiet and is only open in the evening the location was perfect a walk to the park and a walk to times square conveniently a step out for a late night snack;3
stayed here for the second time for a 5 night visit the bedroom is in need of an upgrade especially the bathroom which looked very tired bed was comfy though and the location is great staff at check in were nice but others we encountered security guard and especially the lady with the toilet key were extremely rude i get the new york abruptness iâve visited the city too many times to remember and have experienced it all but the staff here are just rude;3

just wanted to write some good reviews re this hotel my sister in law and i stayed here for four days in june its really a great hotel for the money we got there is the metro right there and teh bus is at the door step which is very great also almost all the buses go to vermont street which is the street the hotel is on so it was very convienient our room was very clean bed was very comfy we had a microwave mini fridge coffee maker the pool was good nice and relaxing and the breakfast was the same every day but we still enjoyed it there was cerele fresh waffles eggs sausage croisants bagles toast jams cream cheese fruitso for free it was worth it i wouldnt walk around the area at night but than again i wouldnt walk any where in la at night;3
number 1 on our list for wheelchair accessibiltypool hot tub both have lifts front deskrobotic like curtesy travel employees bar staff they rock assisted us beyond expectations when we go back we will stay there but soley due to the above mentioned;3
the hotel rooms and corridors are really tired and aged and could do with some updating the check in process was truely painful and inefficient there just arenât enough staff and it took 10 minutes to check in it wasnât terrible but there are so many better hotels around;3
i called the hotel beforehand to ask if i would need to bring a vaccine card since im from out of state the the women on the phone told me that would be against hipaa for a business to ask about that that is not a true i had another issue about a lost item and the man at the front desk had no advice to give me and kept bothering the poor security guard room was fine not the cleanest place ive even been but good enough for midtown new york convenient to penn station and the amtrak station;3
we stayed for 3 nights and the end of a us trip the location is great on broadway so you can walk to central park and times sq or take the subway to other areas the a train goes direct to and from howard beach for jfk really handy the reception lobby and mezzanine are really cool and the staff friendly its also the place where people hang out as the wifi is free everywhere else it is charged by the day we had two rooms a street view and an interior ask for an exterior room as the ones that overlook the service courtyard do not get much light and have noise from the service vents the rooms are similar in decor but the interior rooms are smaller and lack the coffee maker the aircon in both our rooms was noisy but effective the interior room suffered a;3
after reading the reveiws on here i was wary of what i might find ect but i was pleasently surprised the hotel was clean loved the location as it was near little italy and the famous katz deli where harry met sally the most fantastic food i have ever eaten and the subway was pretty much opposite the staff were lovely bit of 70s decor but was absolutly fine people are far to picky for a budget hotel will be coming back xx;3
overall the experience was fine the room could have been cleaner my room had two beds and both had sand in them the bathroom had quite a few left over strands of hair on the floor and in the shower stall and the bathroom door had no lock whatsoever the hotel is not in the best part of town i dont think i would feel comfortable walking around at night the daily parking fee is 24 which seems a bit excessive the breakfast options are terrific though with a large assortment of pastries drinks cereals and best of all an omelette station with a chef ready to prepare you any variety of eggs overall i think it is worth it if you can get it for somewhere around 100120night;3
the room on the third floor was very noisy from the street the window was very hard to shut the most of the elevators were not working the food was very good and at good prices service was very good they had plenty of hot water;3

stayed here for 6 nights in october and chose this hotel due to its proximity to the javits centre and the nycc that we were visiting but possibly wouldnt stay here again if returning to ny for a holiday the pros its ideal for madison square gardens and hammerstein theatre which is next door javits centre only a 10 minute walk away subway station practically outside and great shopping like macys 5 mins walk away aswell as the empire state building all night pharmacy opposite the tick tock diner connected to the hotel is one of the best diners in nyc and open all hours theres a steak and cocktail bar in the basement and another italian barrestaurant which is very popular and reasonable we stayed in a deluxe queen room which is basically a double the room was;3
just visited here recently oct 2008 enjoyed the stay fab location visited empire state building went to a show or two young frankenstein mamma mia all within walking distance etc hotel was bijou but fitted its description perfectly smelled of cigars throughout tho;3
as you walk in the foyer is nice and gives a false impression of the rooms we booked a suite as there were five of us and it was nothing like the photos it was very much in need of a renovation to make matters worse they were building on the balcony and that would have made it a lot better the door to the bathroom wasnt working but someone came and fixed it for us there was a bedroom with two doubles and a small lounge with a pull out sofa which had a very thin mattress on it the wardrobe was tiny for five people and there werent enough hangers it was quite clean but there were lots of signs if wear on the walls and carpet it wasnt quite what we had expected and as i said nothing like the photos the positives however are the location it is practical;3
the location is excellent right in the middle of everything the building has character and history but the way the place is run is not customerfocused they add a facility fee to the nightly rate without telling you instead of a concierge to help you with your trip they have a sales desk to sell you vacations the front desk has a long line at check in and check out the lobby is unkept and crowded with people waiting for their room and theres a laundry room in the basement but it isnt for hotel guests its for a hostel it doesnt have the same level of service or commitment to customer satisfaction as most wyndham properties in this price range if you are looking for good service youll be disappointed if you can handle minimal service and you want to be walking;3
tired hotel good location for lincoln center and central park activities noise from traffic is a bit much very difficult to use the pool and exercise room slow elevators this hotel needs some tlc and remodeling;3
great location very very small room 125 sq ft for one queen bed not even enough floor space for our suitcasesi had to use the small desk next to my bed for my suitcase my husband used the closet for his suitcase but there was no light in the closet we asked for a bigger room but it would be an extra 40;3
so disappointed new york has been on my bucket list for yearsroom was teeny tinyour view was of windows directly opposite usð tiles in bathroom dirtylifts an absolute nightmarewaiting for ages staff sosothe doormen outside were the most friendly and helpfulwould not return;3
hotel and staff fine hotel location excellent however as a business traveler i tried to check in 35 mins before the 3pm check in time and the hotel wanted â£10 i refused to pay i accept if a room is not ready and thats not a problem but to try and charge â£10 for early access 35 mins is just annoying and would seem to be pis way of making additional money on a room perhaps in future and given check out is 12pm and i normally vacate early i should insist that pi dont access the room before 12pm to clean unless they agree to give me â£10 for letting them have that early access more annoying when i returned to ci i had to queue for 25 mins given the number of people now checking in it was ridiculous;3
hotel is clean very well located in manhattan the shower system is really old fashinoed and not so convenient my room was really noisy due to outside system woomen front desk were not friendly with expeditive quick answer maybe i was not lucky;3
it used to be that booking a suite meant a spacious set of rooms on a high floor 3840 and included a kitchenette but whern i arrived this february i was given a small set of rooms without kitchen facilities on the 7th floor witjh no view at all and barely any natural daylight i was moved once a better room became available but even then i had to give up my current room before the new one was available and was told that i would have to move the luggage myself the staff are generally helpful and the hotel had to cope with a revolving door and half the lifts being out of service i had booked here for several years in succession prior to this so overall i like staying there but now i have to at least conisder alternatives;3
this place was ok for the five days we stayed there except for the fact that the ac system is pretty weak dirty and noisy and we melted in our room wifi only in the lobby overall an interesting place with a communal vibe with guests from all over the world sharing the internet and their stories with each other as well as the chatty reception employees;3
we had heard about the small rooms but our first room was too small to even unpack 2 bags so we ended up upgrading at a price they did give us a suite with a great view it felt very safe its an older building but it was clean;3
hotel was under construction not a huge deal but wasnt notified during reservation room was very clean new carpet our view was nice we could see harry potters castle it was about 75 can fare from airport im sure there are cheaper options look into lyft while in la staff was friendly safe area;3
this art deco hotel has interesting public areas but our room was very poor with a tiny en suite 8th avenue around the hotel leaves a lot to be desired the tik toc diner and the trattoria were reasonable but overpriced close to penn station so if youâre travelling by train perhaps itâs ok;3
staff was nice room was small tv channels not so great but then again we were out in city a lot only two towels to the room kept asking for two extra staff had no problem getting it for us no vending machines staff sells soda and water in the lobby convenience store very close for snacks traffic quiet mta orange line subway nearby used it everyday to get to city next time ill request king size bed instead of queen walking distance to italy i will most likely stay here again;3
ive stayed there once before and i probably would again but i havent slept that little for a long while the room was just the right size and the bathroom was nice and clean but onceyou tried to sleep in the room nomatter what time you really couldnt because youd hear everything from your neighbours in the next rooms over to the fire doors in the corridor slamming shut if it werent forthese doors i wouldve loved my stay there;3
first impressions of this place were not good in fact very worrying the hotel is a maze of corridors the sort you would never escape from in a fire but luckily we were on the ground floor on the plus side our double room was adequate size and was fine when all we were looking for was a bed to sleep in at night and we received fresh towels every day the shared bathroom on our floor had just been refurbished and the machine on our floor sold reeses peanut buttercups and the walls were quite thick so we could make love all night without waking the neighbours if youre looking for a cheap place to stay stay here just dont ask for a safety deposit box;3
my girlfriend and i traveled america for 3 weeks in augustseptember 2014 we stayed in new york city for 34 nights and were carrying as little as possible on a budget positives the jane is a unique experience and certainly adds a memory to your travels the door and luggage service is very helpful and professional the rooms are clean and have a safe and towels dressinggowns and slippers are provided the shared shower rooms are not a problem and are clean above all the jane is in a very good location it is in a safe area in the evening too and there are plenty of restaurants cafes and bars to dine at it is also just a short walk to the highline which really is one of nycs hidden gems the walk to times square north is around 30mins and slightly longer south;3
location great hotel ok room good size and comfortable jeff the doorman was superb and helpful cleanliness in reception was poor expensive hotel for what it was view from rooms terrible minibar and snack prices hilariously expensive;3
its a hotel next to universal and has great rooms you pay a premium for those of course on the plus great valet service fantastic and quick a rarity at large hotels they were 4 for 4 for getting our carit was always ready by the time we got down the elevator kudos to the valet crew desk crewterrible from checkin to a few times we wanted to talk to the front desk there was always a long wait and never enough employees they prefaced their interaction both days with sorry about the wait like robots because they know theres a long wait why there are only one or two people workingand then often they help one customer and spend time on the phone which suggests not enough phone answering crew eitheris a huge mystery it frustrates everyone in line it;3
art deco style building rooms are small but ok entre like in the 50s bathroom small and old bed are a bit slept over tic tic bar ok for a quick bite staff friendly close to the empire state building and times square;3
you are paying for proximity to the park and you will pay handsomely the rooms are adequate if youre going to universal studios then this is a good place to stay short walk in and out of the park a little disappointed that you dont get early entry for staying here during our stay the elevators were ridiculous i think only two of them were working and we waited and waited and waited to go up and down if i was booking today i would actually avoid this place until the elevators are fixed or updated or demand a steep discount;3
the room looked quite nice and everything was clean and in good shape i liked that it had ample charging stations for usb as well as plugs on the end tables and the desk they also had a coffee maker and left many coffees per day as well as a couple bottles of water per day it is in a great location i was able to walk in about 10 minutes to times square or to empire state building extremely close to msg and to subway station i had an executive room it was very small but i expect that in nyc i would hate to see how small the basic room was the bathroom was especially small the sink was so shallow that it was nearly impossible to run water without it splashing all over you no counter in the bathroom except for the 3 wide brim;3
the rooms are truly small but since you dont spend a lot of time at the hotel while in ny that is not a problem not all of the rooms have good views but if you are lucky to get a good view it is bonus hotel is a good value compared to most hotels in nyc it is close to penn station and you can walk to a lot of must see places;3
the hotel was clean the staff was friendly breakfast was beyond continental omelets or eggs in what ever style you want hugo the chef really had his system down pat and really knew what was going on in the breakfast line it was a great way to start the day there are water conservation signs everywhere the hotel does its best to be echofriendly one problem that i had was that they charge for parking 17 a day it was an additional cost that we were not expecting we did not find the hotel located in the best of neighborhoods we did not feel safe walking around in the evening the hotel is about 4 miles from the 101 major freeway depending the time of day it took 40 minutes through traffic just to get to and from hotel very close to hollywood walk;3
a big shoutout to doormen jeff and mourad and their colleagues who are the very very best ive ever met very helpful genuinely friendly and interested always in for a chat and full of tips and information housekeeping staff also very nice front desk staff on the contrary seem completely disengaged from their guests rooms are decent size and the beds are very good unfortunately the windows let in way too much noise which in this bustling area in midtown makes for interrupted nights of sleep too much street noise in the room bathroom was ok but could do with a renovation paint coming off door stuck a small leak in the shower screen uneven shower floor;3
en they gave us a room that had not been remade and the person to whom i said have it changed immediately the second room was clean but very very small essential the neighborhood is pleasant and very well connected by metro and buses it was not expected breakfast but every morning there was always a choice of cookies with tea and coffee it ci hanno dato una stanza che non era stata rifatta e ce lhanno cambiata subito la seconda stanza era pulita ma molto piccola essenziale il quartiere ã¨ piacevole e soprattutto molto ben collegato da metro ed autobus non era prevista la colazione ma ogni mattina cera sempre una scelta di cookies con the e caffã¨;3
great services average rooms multiple problems experienced with room tv didnt work ac was unreliable so room temp was uncomfortable the whole stay they ran out of coffee for the roomshow is that possible in nyc terrific bar tenders roof top bar was fabulous go to get drinks but cant recommend staying;3
having just returned from ny and staying at the astor on the park myself and my husband were happy with this hotel for what we paid to stay there having read some of the reviews we were a bit aprehensive of what to expect but were pleasantly surprised we took our 3 year daughter with us and our main thing was that it was clean and one thing that can not be said about this hotel is that it wasnt clean the room we stayed in was on the 10th floor looking out onto central park and had a kingsize bed in it and bunkbeds the room wasnt massive but it was ample for what we needed as we only slept in there the staff by far were very very friendly and very helpful they couldnt do enough for you and made us and our daughter feel very welcome at all times we would definatley;3
disappointing return visit rooms desperately need an upgrade old worn uncomfortable and not technology friendly location is great and staff were very nice but this is no longer a goto for me ask not to be put in room;3
price was right and the rooms are nice and bright very pared down old building beds are hard as bricks though and skip the continental breakfast its served in a basement boiler room and is prepackaged junk theres a great bagel shop around the corner thats a thousand steps up location cant be beat and definitely check out the late night indian cafeterias and bobs your uncle which is a super chill bar;3
make sure when you eat at this restaurant for their breakfast buffet that to not do it 30 minutes before they end the breakfast buffet because they will give you a rude hint to leave your table our server was sweeping under our table while we were still eating our breakfast even though my husband voiced out his frustration he kept on sweeping under our chairs and table;3
whilst sitting in a great location the hotel feels tired and not as good as expected the reception staff were functional rather than welcoming the concierge was very abrupt most of the staff didnât live up to the usual american friendliness experienced elsewhere in new york having mentioned we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and booked four rooms i was disappointed that even though guest relations had requested an upgrade of our room when we checked in they decided to give the upgraded room to my son and not my wife and i;3
i was on a business trip average hotel good location i fund the hotel quite expensive compared to other hotels i have been in the neighborhood quite poor the breakfast and small the common areas at the reception level;3
my room was very nice the linens were clean everything else was also clean it had a cute little tv overall i really liked my room and was surprised because i expected it to be unkempt the only thing i didnt like was that i didnt get my own shower and toilet but other than that it was a nice stay;3
we arrived early and left our luggage with a friendly receptionist think the name was jaz used the guest restroom wich was filthy should really clean that more often since it was our first impression of the hotel the room was very small but alright the doorhandle to the bathroom almost came off doesnt the cleningstaff notice such things the walls in the room could need some paint but i understand itâs a busy hotel very good location near times square and central park when we checked out the receptionist did not ask how our stay had been or anything else almost not even a goodbye all together an alright stay and you really visit ny for the atmosphere maybe not the hotel but some small improvments would have resulted in a better review from me;3
thanks a lot to mohamed on customer service we managed to upgrade our room to the suite which what we wanted the suite had two bathrooms as well as two rooms the downside was the bedroom was a corner room and had windows overlooking two sides of the street hence this maximised amount of noise from the sirens at night but i suppose it being ny this is expected also the bathroom had a bit droughty window and the sink did not drain very well the air conditioner was working ok until one night it stopped and became very cold in the room we managed to switch it back on alright otherwise the beds were extremelly comfortable the best beds ive ever slept in also the hotel is located in the centre of what we wanted to do as it was very close to the undeground station and;3
made reservation for a tower floor the amenities were not there for breakfast you have to go down to the lobby restaurant no lounge on the floor room is old and small need renovation old tv with limited channels you can hear the quests talking from the next room last day no hot water left a comment card did not response;3
for the money and the location i felt the room was good it was clean small but workable the shower door leaked causing water to get all over the bathroom floor but was easy to clean up the city was surprisingly quiet late night my biggest problem was no elevator not the hotel for you if climbing three flights of stairs with a suitcase is a problem the staff was nice but couldnt make local food recommendations parking across the street was reasonable as well;3
my room was very comfortable all the things i needed to spoil myself not too far away from the shopping areas with access to multiple restaurants multi cultural foods staff was friendly the lighting could have been a little brighter;3
1st time visit was great 2nd time was horrible with my luggage situation and how things were handled overall and 3rd trip started off terribleyou would think that what happened on my second visit that they were not give me a a terrible experience for this trip check in was horrible with their servicetried charging me 75 dollars early check in with knowledge of my bad experience the last time i was there the manager was supposed to call me in regards to this but never did i had to call several hours later to complain about the service upon check in and not getting a call back the manager took off the 75 dollars i was happy about this i was just hoping to get better service upon check in i should not have to start off my vacation upset i love the location but with;3
if you are planning a trip to la or to universal studios this hotel is a good choice it is conveniently located in the heart of universal which means you can easily walk to the park or take the free shuttle i stayed here in january when visiting la for a long weekend the hotel is outside of the city but i wanted to be near universal so it was a good pick it is a large hotel and had a conference wedding and another event going while i was there the room was large and clean i booked a king alcove my only complaint about the room is that they did not provide cups for the coffee maker and there wasnt any lotion in the bathroom i would recommend staying here if you are going to universal but you need to be aware that it is a large hotel and can;3
this hotel was simply a place to sleep whilst visiting new york at christmas time a must do experience we left most mornings before 7am and arrived back at 11pm for the whole 7 days but on saying that he hotel was clean and tidy and was in a brilliant location right below central park and above times square the staff were all lovely and helpful we never ate here and we didnt use the bar only thing was i dont think we had doubled glazed windows because it was so so so load on the road below us but we mostly didnt noticed because we were so tired from being tourists all day;3
great location but plenty of flags to consider staying elsewhere if you can housekeeping and general upkeep leaves much to be desired 55 per night parking is obscene great views of lax runway take offs and landings and nice club lounge;3
decent hotel good location though 8th ave is a hub for homeless people constantly asking you for money the room was pretty small and basic but itâs all we really needed given it was just a place to sleep at night the only downside was that the duvet was insanely thin and the tv was quite blurry check in was quick they took my debit card and immediately took 300 100 for the facility fee which they keep and 200 for the security deposit which iâm waiting to get back which was a bit jarring but it is what it is what i felt wasnât fair is that despite paying this facility fee it costed 30 per day to use the coffee machine in the room which was just a basic machine with some plain coffee pods it was also another 30 i think per day to have a mini fridge in your room;3
our reviews can be little influenced by the fact that we were in nyc for the first time and we were completely thrilled by it all it is true that the hotel is a bit older but still performs its function well we had a room on the top floor where we later learned was reconstructed so the room was very spacious and newly furnished the lower floors areapparently awful and you can feel cigarette smoke from our own experience we have we were very excited only the bathroom is tiny breakfast we did not manage to taste because short walk away is the supermarket which is open 24 hours a day and you will find there really all and there are many restaurants around metro is a 2minute walk away so too great if i may recommend if you make a reservation write that you;3
ive stayed here twice both times on business the first time i stayed was for 2 nights in september 2009 and last time was for 3 nights in july 2010 my first stay was great the last stay was awful it really depends on the roomfloor you get on my last stay i got one of their very last rooms since they were fully booked and it was near some sort of generator could not sleep even with ear plugs had to have my room changed the next day but the second room reeked of smoke even though it was supposed to be nonsmoking the third room was great rooms typical hilton rooms comfortable beds modern decor they do have some rooms in really noisy locations though the first room on my second stay smelled musty and was not very clean and one of the outlets in the bathroom;3
the staff is average the hotel is in fair condition some rooms better than others great location on the uws of manhattan electrical outlets are few and the bathroom was clean overall all an average place nice size rooms for nyc;3
this is a boutique hotel that is in an amazing location which i believe is what you are paying for the rooms are small and if you go above the 3rd floor unbelievably hot and uncomfortable the beds were comfortable firm but comfortable bathrooms small and i could not even stand in front of my sink and brush my teeth or use the mirror overall clean but rooms are dark and interior of hotel is dark the valets doorman extremely nice and the concierges were amazing front desk staff well some were great but the ones who were not left a bad impression on the rest of the staff note if you stay here and get a lower level room on the front side you will have to deal with traffic noises etc which i think you would expect in nyc;3
i do like trying new hotels in nyc this is one of the more quirky ones ive stayed mainly in the decor but also in the vibe the rooms are not big bathrooms are smaller if there wasnt a big mirror sitting on the floor vs hanging up i would have been able to sit and work at the desk and it was propped against the wall not secured thankfully it didnt fall over see pictures it is in a good location near my office on 56th and 6th and times square and that area for restaurants the shower was strong and hot towels were okay bed comfortable i was able to sleep despite some noise from the outside i was facing a courtyard and the window was quite small the ac made too much noise so i left the window open and was fine early june bonus;3
there were positives and negatives with this hotel the positives great views of the empire state building from my room and a central location in the garment district i did have to switch rooms late at night due to a housekeeping issue it too the staff a long time to bring keys up for the new room and they did not offer assistance with my bags which i had to move from one building to another i also prepaid for a valet package when i went outside to retrieve my car they told me i didnt pay so i had to drag my bags inside and have the desk clerk come back outside with me to speak with the valet attendantonly to have another fee attached to my folio which i disputed the hotel was gracious to offer a discount due to my issues which i did not ask for so that was;3
there are some great hotels in new york i just dont think this is one of them besides the good location in the upper west side empire doesnt really offer a lot in terms of service dont expect much natural light in your room dont expect room service to show up and dont expect your bill to be right the front desk staff are lovely the bar staff are not for the price you can do better;3
ok lets be honest and just say that the hotel is very basic and is in real need of a good repairman now lets look at the positivethe room was clean the staff was friendly the hotel has good security they do provide basic hygiene needs if you want to save money and you just want a room to sleep in because you plan on exploring during the daythis is not a bad room it is in a bit of a run down side of town but never felt unsafe because it is very secure and the police presence is very high to insure safety its within a 2 mile walk to ground zero and overall i have no regrets staying here if however you are someone looking for perfection then be realistic about what you can get at this price and go spend double the money someplace else because these people;3
rooms are really nice but a few let downs really creaky bed every time you turned over it was noisy 2 not sure how it happened but house keeping missed cleaning our room when i called they were asking me why they would have missed it when it was marked as completed 3 house keeping them decided to knock on door at 830 even though we were checking out that day to clean room 4 husband was taking down bags over two trips and i had do not disturb sign on and house keeping still trying to get in and clean room this may have been a one off staff were really apologetic and asked what they could do to make it up to us this is close to universal there r always shuttles and metro is not far you can get to hollywood blvd in one stop i would recommend hotel as mentioned;3
this is the only hotel ive ever stayed in new york city so i dont have a frame of reference for other hotels there the room i was in was nothing special but if youre just looking for a bed and this is all this is the best thing i could say about it is its very clear that subway station if i was going to go back i would probably try to find a different hotel;3
we booked the empire via trailfinders as part of our honeymoon as it seemed to be in a great location and it looked like a classic nyc hotel from the photos we saw the location was perfect right on the southwest corner of central park there are plenty of restaurants bars and coffee places within a short walk as well as two subway stations on the 1 line for easy access to midtown and downtown the hotel has two bars in reception and on the roof both were comfortable classily decorated and served good drinks the rooftop bar especially was buzzy in the evenings though it was too chilly to enjoy what looked to be a cool outdoor area beneath the giant red neon sign staff were very helpful and friendly across the board from start to finish no issues there;3
art deco hotel but very tried from the 1st floor upwards colour scheme is very depressing rooms small and pictures on website are misleading the photographer did a good job but u end up being disappointed limited information in the rooms large reception area but needs more seating we had to change rooms as the suite was just to small however the hotel receptionist was very helpful and sorted us out not much noise from within the hotel but the location is noisy even in the early hours if the morning the city that never sleeps is a perfect description of this location;3
we got to this hotel on 27 dec 06 and were quite surprised with the size of the room we were given 901 had a double bed and a bunk bed there was myself hubby and daughter 8 a quite big room and bathroom was clean with clean bed sheets noisy heating though the first night the radiators were hissing and pipes banging like everyone says but it was too hot in the room so turned off the hissing although banging still occured on new yrs eve it began to rain and when we woke up the carpet was soaked we told the reception and as it was only on one side we were willing to stay in that room as we only had one more night left but the staff changed our room and this room was much nicer bathroom was cleaner and bigger than our other one room was smaller but;3
i stayed here for one night we were upgraded to a two bed room as i was travelling with my friend and we had requested a twin room the outside and communal areas of the hotel are excellently furnished the lobby and bar area are really nice and comfy and the hotel offers free wifi in these areas check in was good and all staff at the hotel were welcoming and friendly the room was a bit small but had everything you need the bathroom was a little bit tired and a bit small there was no shower door the actual rain shower was great the showers were very refreshing the bathroom did not feel as clean as other areas and i feel in some ways let down the room overall the beds were incredibly comfy and i had an amazing sleep it was the sort of bed that encompasses you;3
we stayed at the empire hotel this last week i have stayed there before when it was first refurbished and was generally cleaner and more comfortable this stay was less than optimal as there were so many crowds and the weather was hot the environment quite frankly was not pleasant or fresh the dark brown wall paper makes the rooms dreary and confining in feeling while the tiny bathrooms are almost impossible to use as a couple the location is fantastic the beds fairly comfortable and the rooftop bar nice when not overly crowded but other than that this hotel is in dire need of improvements;3
the rooms at the empire are very clean but small the bathroom seems to have a lot of water damage and again is pretty small there is free wifi in the lobby of the hotel but not in the rooms they charge 10 per device for wifi in your room overall i felt that the location was the only selling point to this hotel and i dont feel you get value for money;3
ok the bed and the bathroom were clean very low voltage lighting quaint foyer overpriced for what it is new york hotels are expensive but this was not worth the cost however with a makeover it could be a stunning boutique hotel;3
we were unfortunate enough to stay during the power cut and that wasnt very pleasant but we have received a refund for that nights stay apart from the obvious problems of having no power or water we actually enjoyed our stay at the empire the room was fine it certainly wasnt dark and our air con worked very well house keeping did a good job every day the pool is cold but sometimes thats just what you need after a hot day in new york the hotel is well situated for sightseeing and i must recommend le pain quotidien an excellent bakery and restaurant just a couple of blocks away we had breakfast there most mornings;3
this is the only place to stay if youre visiting universal city and hollywood and make sure you get the executive rooms as the lounge with breakfast and afternoon snacks is great everything about this hotel is good foodroompoolbarparking etc we ate at the bar on two nights and it was great and very reasonable with excellent service buses to universal are regular and convenient and we did a hollywood tour by bus from the hotel as well this really is 5 star with value for money oh except for the phone calls dont use the room phones as international cell phones are cheaper;3
metro 12 and 3 are a one minute walk away express takes you downtown in no time duane reade is just around the corner as are starbucks subway some banks churches dvd rental and so on central park is ten minutes away the old building has new bathrooms and old ac a big bed and small slow elevators you can book tours in the lobby or a transfer to the airport wifi is available in the lobby as wel our electronic door lock failed so maintenance was quickly called in to replace the lock this eastern guy was very friendly and professional this was one of the more decently priced hotels in ny because prices are going through the roof compared to other states;3
me and my girlfriend stayed here from sept 8th to sept 19th 2013 room was wery clean with towels changed every day water was ok showerhead was attached to wall and not removable but thats unfortunately normal in all of the us tv and refrigerator was ok though we barely tried the tv as we were there to see the city surroundings and nieghbourhood was good pharmacies shops restaurants and bus stops just around the corner and just a few blocks to the subway wifi was just ok really a week signal but several networks can be browsed to choose the one which is best at the moment there was no chair or any table at the room but then we did not ask for it either wery good and large bed with a good matress to sleep in our room was also surprisingly quiet;3
great location the initial front desk clerk was able to get me in my room quickly not as clean as expected there was a cockroach in the shower it was not resolved during my stay the carpet on the floor was continuously dusty the rooftop bar was nice but again not as clean as i thought it would be and food was just okay;3
after reading so many bad reviews after i had booked the days hotel i was scared of what we would encounter once we got there once there it was fine especially for the price we wanted to go to nyc for valentines weekend and needed a cheap place to stay days hotel delivered the room was very clean absolutely no cockroaches bedbugs or any of that nonsense the bathroom was immaculate and even had toiletries good closet space tv and there is a drug store right next door and a few really good places to eat there is also a subway stop right outside the hotel the staff even let us check in early i really dont know why this hotel gets such a bad rap must be prima donnas writing the reviews the only suggestion for improvement would be the elevators but if you need;3
reading the other reviews on this site im not entirely sure we stayed at the same hotel i found hotel riverside studios to be excellent value for money our room was clean the bed was decent i never heard any other guests only once was the bathroom occupied when i wanted to use it so i walked 12 paces down the hall to the other one and we felt safe and secure although the phone in the room doesnt dial out people can leave messages for you on it and there are payphones on the ground floor all in all the hotel suited our needs especially our budget for our 1 week in nyc pros location safe neighborhood close to subway line quiet deadend street cleanliness of room fridge in room inexpensive for new york secure room cons the hallways smell;3
good enough for city trip but not good enough if you plan to spent more time on the room bath room was very outdated and not everything worked as well wifi is pretty poor unless you take the paid one;3
stayed here for a week on business stayed in the new yorker view suite queen on the 26th floor room was a decent size for nyc the living room area was pretty spacious with a foldout couch for additional sleeping space and the layout was open enough you could probably get an extra rollaway or queen size air mattress on the floor for even more sleeping space if staying with a whole family pics on their website for this suite are accurate and look exactly like the room i stayed in so bonus points for accuracy there hotel has a diner colocated on the ground floor that was honestly probably one of my favorite places to eat during the entire trip the chicken tenders waffles with a side of bacon hit the spot multiple times nothing blow your mind amazing about the;3
location wise this is a superb hotel close to macys and only 7 streets along to 42nd streetbroadway my room was on the 27th floor the room was cold and draftie i could putting the heating on but it was so noisy that it kept me up one night the room was basic but clean i spent a lot of my time out and about so if youre looking for a lush pad this is not it the staff were friendly and incredibly helpful id go back there because of the location but nothing else remember to watch out for the facility fee at the end of your stay it was 25 tax so worked out around an extra 110 for a 4 night stay;3
if you ever find yourself travel on a budget and want to spend the night at upper west side manhattan this is a good choice the subway station is just two minutes walk away and there are plenty of decent restaurantsdiners around the block i did not get the renovated room so the bedroom has definitely seen its better days the elevator is very slow though i just took the stairs when heading down my room did get a unusually roomy wellproportioned bathroom so thats a plus it is almost as big as my last hotel room when i visited manhattan a year ago;3
originally several incidents were the cause for me to write a harsh review of this property which has now been deleted thank you tripadvisor while there in fact were issues at this location like the plumbing being exposed and the property not having a full time door attendant they do but they must have been on a break the other issue that i had with the service was when requesting to be notified about my transportation but referred to the concierge to put in my request the most serious issue was in their hotel bar when there was a shouting match between another patron and one of my colleagues the other patron was a jerk and we were not comfortable in that establishment anymore so we took our party to another location the bar manager and bartender tried to;3
to be honest this was a 2night stay because we needed to visit universal studios the hotel gave us what we expected clean room with a park view breakfast very busy though and some waiting time location was the key and it was good in walking distant to the park and back that was what we wanted and we got it;3
this hotel was in a perfect location for lincoln center and central park the front desk staff were friendly overall the hotel was fine for one evening the room was small and had problems figuring out where to put the luggage the bathroom was extremely small and already had a lot of watermoisture damage due to the shower not having a door the room was clean and beds were fine any more than one night i would look for another hotel;3
very good location near hollywood and right next to universal studios its a pretty standard hilton the room was very spacious comfortable bed and everything worked fine friendly helpful staff at the front desk and the bartender was great hotel itself needs some updates the carpeting in the hall was pretty worn and dirty and looks like theyre already working on the elevators only other complaint is the tv in the room given how far the bed is from the tv a 32 set is way too small could barely see it while sitting in bed;3
the hotel is very convenient for the frequent travelers the rooms are very small but that is typical of old buildings in new york some rooms dont have much of a privacy because of the other buildings across the street with ten thousand apartment windows facing you but some could find it somewhat entertaining;3
stayed for two nights whilst we did universal and some sightseeing in hollywood hotel was more of a conference hotel with auditions being held frequently we stayed in four hotels during our mini trip and this was the only one that didnât have usb ports which was surprising not impressed being woken up by banging at 7am and also hoovering at 730am overall a very average stay;3
the hotel amenities were very convenient and good you pay a lot for parking but it is a secure space with ample spaces available the staff were extremely friendly and helpful my only complaint was the condition of the room itself the room needed to be repainted badly lots of marks on the walls and the bathroom needed to be caulked again the wall paper was damaged and it just felt like our room had a lot of miles on it therefore we did not spend a lot of time in our room the location is convenient with the metro station so that you can forgo the driving and parking to shop the malls overall it was a little better than average but not much;3
weâve been staying at this hotel because of its convenient proximity to lincoln center please see my previous reviews at our most recent stay we were upgraded to a fairly large suite with pleasant views of lincoln center the bed was comfortable the room was chilly and there was no heat temps were forecast to drop to the high 40âs i telephoned reception and was told that an engineer would be up shortly some hours later still no engineer i telephoned reception again this time i was told that the heat had already been shut off for the season but they did send up a handy little electric heater one wonders why the first reception person did not have this knowledge wifi worked fine and was included in the cost of the room thus it is no longer necessary to;3
room was clean comfy and satisfactory positives are location and jeffrey the doorman was friendly and a great help with all the questions we had he took the time to tell us about taking the subway as a group for a reduced price and we found it a great way to get around thank you jeffrey;3
this property is the closest hotel to universal studios hollywood theme park and universal city walk dining and shopping so a great location just off of the 101 near burbank airport and hollywood the 23rd floor corner king room we had was like a mediocre aged wineâinteresting but approachable the wall paper was dated and starting to fall off the walls and the furniture was dated mattress on bed was too soft and the pullout wasâwell an uncomfortable pullout pillows were a calico kat of overstuffed bodysize and understaffed pancakes bath towels were sheetsize but so old and discolored it was kind of gross to use time to do a complete refresh of this property upgrade the room decor furnishings towels etc and get away from the solarium themed dining and do more of;3
no tea and coffee making facilities in rooms despite what website says or mini bar but get 2 very small complimentary water bottles each morning billed as mid range 3 star hotel but carpets hard and well wornlow lighting masks some very tired decor posing as boutique in the uk this would definitely not pass as a boutique hotel booked in feb 2019 for new year 2020 asking for them high floor room and a bottle in the room for partners birthdaygot neithertold that hotel was too full got 4th floor with a view of the back of the other rooms and a very noisy air con outside that never goes off so take earplugs roof top bar great place to relax but this is not part of hotel so no special discounts or treatment nice views of the lincoln centre and broadway good location;3
not a bad hotel really when alls said and done good sized rooms quiet and not expensive however i tried using the vending machines conveniently located at every turn only to discover they are in fact a complete scam after plying my hard earned quarters on every floor in a vain attempt to get a soda i noticed through the glass that the sell by date on a packet of crisps was a year out of date the management were supremely uninterested and fobbed me off with a bogus customer queries number several small things like this left a slightly bad after taste not bad but be warned;3
too expensive for what is offered be wary of city views as their view is of their parking lot the room was clean service staff were all very friendly and accomodating the issue here is one of delivering what is advertised and in this regard hyatt fails miserably yymv but caveat emptor;3
the hotel has a convenient location and a fair price rooms are small and bathrooms tiny hair dryer didnt work tv has only a few channels theres no elevator and the stairs are very narrow it was clean and the bed was comfortable so it worked out fine for a few nights what i really didnt like was the impossibility of an early check in or a late check out;3
the hotel gives off the impersonation it wants to be something more but canât quite pull it off front door guys were excellent and gave us sound advice when we asked questions front desk was solid but seemed under manned â an express checkout on the tv would help bartender desperately hoped i was more âhipâ sorry just a guy with children that needed a beer for the room the rooms are fairly large but were a definite cover up make over from its old days as commercial hotel heating system when turned on was very noisy a banging radiator took me back to my days when i lived in the city the bathroom is ridiculously small but it worked overall it was okay but just wasnât all that my only complaint and it happens everywhere why if i walk off the street i get free;3
we checked into the empire on valentineâs day previous to our arrival i requested twice that we have a bathtub in our room and had no response and showed up to a shower in our room the shower leaked every time you ran the water and there isnât a shower door which was before baffling to me the mini bar in the room was not stocked with drinks we called down to reception for some cokes to be delivered and an hour later our door knocked for a woman to say there is no cokes in the whole hotel left another hour passed and a different lady shows up with one can of coke in her hand we let her know that it was now too late as we have taken it upon ourself to go to the shop across the street for our own drinks rooftop bar in the hotel is very nice and has a nice atmosphere and;3
stayed here for ny marathon very convenient for the marathon convenient location three blocks from subway rooms are small and bathrooms even smaller no internet but you can pay a secondary provider close to lincoln ctr lots of restaurants close by;3
this place is located very near to hammersmith tube station which has direct connections to many important places in london piccadilly victoria abercorn house doesnt have much of a hostel atmosphere its a huge place with many rooms which makes it look a lot like a holiday inn kind of place the shared bathrooms were plenty and rather clean the staff was friendly and 24h available and the place looked quite safe but i had a private room and never handed in my key which added much to my personal idea of safety the mattresses were old and the walls are very thin and because there are many rooms close to each other there is quite some noise in the evening and the morning there is a tv room but i didnt go in and also a small place outside for smokers the wifi;3
a lot of my coworkers hated their rooms but i liked mine its really small but its manhattan iâve stayed in smaller rooms in new york the mini bar prices are just ridiculousâ¦3 for per tasteless keurig 11 for a bottle of water 72 for a bottle of cheap wine and so on tip thereâs a starbucks next door i got stuck with a room next to the elevator but it was still dead quite the service was nice the sheets were soft the bed was comfortable and room was clean the rooms were dimly lit and everything felt dark in an oldhard wood kind of way the pool deck was closed for the season still but looked nice we made it up to the rooftop bar but it was very later20scollegeclubby this is definitely a business hotel and i was there on business so i didnt think it;3
location of hotel is very convenient lovely ambience in lobby staff was friendly and helpful check in was easy and we were met with a friendly attitude and courtesy by rudy at the front desk and daniel the bellman room was clean poorly lit somewhat cramped but efficiently designed and beds were comfortable we liked that the window would actually open and we could get some fresh air we were told at the front desk that we could get a keurig coffee pot sent to our room but were not told we would have to pay three dollars for each k cup of coffee we needed a new bulb and housekeeping was there quickly the room had a minimarts worth of things to buy on the dresser and took up a lot of already limited space it seems they were a bit into the retail businesss as well as;3
had five days at the new yorker in july location very central and a great base for sight seeing is a grand old hotel but could do with a coat of paint to bring it back from looking tired and dated staff were great our room was spacious and the views from our room on the 22nd floor were exceptional only real negative was getting slugged with a usd 45 per day âfacilities feeâ on departure we had prepaid our stay well in advance and did not expect this fee they said it was to cover wifi gym and business centre none of which we actually used;3
its a good and relaxing place to stay and i made all my business customer feel the best views ever you guys should come and check it out and see for yourself ððð fully protected and the food is amazing ð;3
when i last reviewed the new yorker i said i was happy enough but would probably look for something else next time well this is next timeand the price for the location or the location for the price at this hotel were just too hard to go past we had a seven night stay and once more we really appreciated being within walking distance of so many landmarks the empire state building penn station madison square garden herald square fifth avenue times square and broadway are all within striking distance right outside are the subway entrances to take you further afield although the lobby is rather charming much of the hotel is quite dated though we found our room to be clean and comfortable good beds pillows etc when we arrived it seems there was a;3
i did get a good deal for a hotel a stones throw from lincoln center and daniel bouluds culinary corner but i would not give it the same rating as say the essex house if you like animal prints and loud techno music if you are impressed by dark lighting and heavy handed decorating this is your place smoke and mirrors was my takeaway the front desk does not seem to know how to accommodate travelers the way any other 4 star hotel does effortlessly when we returned for a third try to get into our room at 3pm we had to wait in a long line for half an hour by the time we got to the counter the bigger better rooms with a real view were gone imagine a queen size bed with a one foot clearance on three sides that was our room imagine sitting sideways on the toilet so your;3
quality inns promise a budget friendly price with little to no frills on that basis this hotel delivers yes the hotel is in need of repair yes the elevators are small and creaky and yes the rooms do have problems however the price reflects this and given that the hotel is a real value the rate is a real bargain we paid less than 100day for our room our room was clean and kept up every day there are little amenities like a coffeemaker hair dryer and refrigerator in the room another plus is that the hotel is in a good location fairly close to the museum of natural history as well as central park itâs also just one block from the subway and although located in the upper west side travel to times square is just a mere 1015 minutes on the other hand;3
this hotel is an older property that has been painted and was clean the lobby and courtyard was nice and the pool was quaint the rooms are clean but small bathroom was dated and old we had issues with the shower the water backed up in the tub towels are small the parking is gated which is good as its in an up and coming area this is easily accessible to downtown and to universal studios the staff was friendly and helpful the bar closes early most nights but on the weekend there is a comedy show with up and coming comics which is fun;3
yes its a little dated but its in a great location the staff are super friendly beds are comfy rooms are warm and the showers hot not sure what more you would need on a visit to new york dont stay here if you are expecting a 5 swanky hotel though;3
the hyatt regency lax does not provide exceptional service breakfast is provided in the restaurant but no lunch or dinner additionally the electric socket in the bathroom did not work and had to dry my hair by desk table the room furniture and decorations were blasã© i know we can do better i regret staying there;3
i was visiting universal city walkstudios in early july 2009 here is my review ill start with the good service i have to admit that service throughout my stay was absolutely amazing checkin staff was supernice and helpful cleaning people and room service were friendly and helpful also the room service menu had some nice healthy extras that you dont normally find on other hilton menus i sampled several different salads and fruit dishes and was impressed now for the bad the room the first room i got was on the 14th floor it was hot upon my checking in so i turned the ac down almost immediately upon checking in i left the hotel for an excursion when i returned a couple of hours later the room was still hot i called downstairs and they sent a;3
as hotel rooms are generally very expensive in ny this seems to be a good alternative it is cheap but do not expect a categorized hotel pros very good location just 3 min walk to metro station line 1 110th street from there in 12min at times square clean bath bed was made every day no cockroaches no bedbugs cons towel was within one week never changed but i also did not asked;3
like a lot of people on here i was pretty nervous about this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews but booked it anyway because of the nearunbeatable price i consider myself to be a pretty practical person and dont have super high standards when it comes to hotels my friends and i were pretty much just after a place to sleep and thats what we got we chose the shared bathroom rooms our rooms were very basic but clean and spacious enough although that could be because we had 3 person rooms for 2 people the beds arent all that comfortable but they replaced our pillows with nice new squishy ones a couple of days in and that hugely improved the situation the rooms have tvs in them with cable which is good the shared bathrooms were pretty average definitely;3
in front of the 96st subway with a great neighborhood cafes dinners and the central park great staff i stayed in the 4th floor wich is a little noisy the room was adequate with ac tv a good bathroom and a little closet the only problem is that are few elevators just 2 but you can use the stairs;3
hotel was great for location just 2 blocks from the metro station very nice and helpful staff at front desk helped me book 3 tours for my son and i and also car service arrangements making things very easy the tours we took with starline picked us up at the hotel so that was also very convenient no frills room but very comfortable and clean breakfast complimentary with a made to order omelette and waffle bar very nice omelette chef delicious coffee really bad there is a starbucks very close by;3
the hotel has a great location and a very nice rooftop bar the room was very comfortable and had a nice decor however it was lacking on cleanliness especially the carpet and corners the service was also not very professional the first day i called 0 a few times but had no response also the checkout took around 2025 minutes as they took a long time to check the minibar in the room moreover during my checkout the front desk clerk was having trouble handling a complain from other guests and did not seem to give them a proper solution in general not very impressed with the hotel i will definitely not be staying in this hotel during my next trips to the city;3
the restaurant is 24 hours and that is terrific however it isnt very good and the wait staff arent great either however it does mean you can get dinner if you get in very late and tired without having to go walking around the city the concierge is fabulous he was so helpful and kind when i needed a taxi at 4 am its a classic hotel and thats nice but i thought the halls were grubby and the room was very small however the location for me was unbeatable and i have booked to stay there again the convenience of the 24 hour restaurant and the location trumps the room size and food quality for my purposes;3
i stayed my one night here since id booked a show at the gibson theatre at universal studios my room was on the 3rd floor just down from the lobby i agree with others that the 17 parking charge is just too steep also i was unimpressed with the service my time at the counter while the agent looked for a single bed room for me i had a prepaid reservation but room selection at checkin took way too long and without explanation my room had a king bed and the longest set of windows ever bathroom was a spacious v shape the sofabed had a really long coffee table next to it tv was old but adequate huge closet had a safe plus iron board but no robes theres a large fabriccovered bench to place your luggage unfortunately someone had placed a hot iron;3
very old hotel which require urgent renovation bath taps are terrible wifi is the slowest on earth staff are friendly location is central room is medium size and convenient room is fairly clean;3
worst cleaning experience in premier inn you have to request a clean i consider this a basic of a hotel stay 1st day bathroom not cleaned 2nd day room not cleaned at all despite requests at 1030 and reception did not resolve had to request clean towels stay was comfortable and quiet excellent location on southbank beside london eye 4mins from waterloo tube and station ms food beside hotel good restaurants on southbank close to hotel;3
room was very small heater was very loud but seemed to have a calming effect and block out some of the outside noise our window didnt stay open so had to roll up a towel and stick in it bathroom was tiny no shower door so water went everywhere also looked like a lot of water damage positive room was cleaned thoroughly daily close to central park a bit far from times square;3
i stayed two nights the room was very nicely appointed but also very small i have a hardsided suitcase that opens like a book bifold and there was literally no place to put it on the floor where it wouldnt completely block the pathwalkway in the room i had to step over the suitcase to get past it the bathroom is also nice appointed but very very small there is no wastebasket in the bathroom because there literally is no place to put it the overhead shower is nice but the controls are very confusing the wifi in the hotel is incredibly slow good for email but not much else;3
the hotel staff when we checked in were very friendly and helpful once checked in they couldnt care less if there was a problem none of the drink machines worked and when they did work they took your money then the hotel staff said we had to talk to the manager in the morning no good when you wanted some water at night also the atm at the hotel wasnt working and when it was fixed only lasted 1 day before being out of order again rooms were a good size close to pretty much all things in la but staff were not helpful at all also much cheaper to catch the metro to universal studios only 5 compared to the 79 dollars they wanted to charge from the hotel;3
booked via travel rupublic for 5 nights it does state on web site that there is a resort fee to be paid at the hotel but after researching this and reading previous reviews this seemed to be optional based on services used this fee is not optional the services you are paying 31 a night for are wifi which is advertised as âfree internetâ on trip advisor and other booking sites so it is not free use of the gym who the hell comes to nyc for a few days to waste their time in the gym use of the business centre again why on earth would i want to do that unless i was here on business which i was not and for making international calls from the room telephone well being organised i have a bundle on my mobile for that so again did not use my husband confronted management;3
good hotel right near to the empire state building only reason i scored so low is this i paid a lot of money to stay here for a week then upon arrival i had to pay a serviceresort fee of nearly 250 dollars all this got me was poor wifi apart from that the rooms were clean and today great views and lobby area was tidy bed was comfy and bathroom has everything we needed;3
hotel is very conveniently located although if you are sensitive to noise you may want to chose another location my room was nice and a good size for nyc the internet did not work well in the room but was ok in the lobby i found the lobby was too dark for my own taste;3
second time to stay in this property the good across the street from lincoln center the bad pretty much everything else was disappointing heat in room didnt work it took nearly an hour to get a maintenance person to the room front desk wouldnt switch our room booked solid and when maintenance person called down a few minutes later magically a room became available no bellman available to help with the room move overall the property needs attention worn carpets lots of minor maintenance issues that need attention etc walls are thin and doors are not the quiet close found in even midrange properties standard rooms are tiny not unusual for nyc but more uptodate and roomy choices available nearby at similar price pointbathroom is closetsize;3
the hotel was beautiful and modern the rooms were nice and updated i thought the food prices were expensive just beware you do have to pay to park and if you park over 20 minutes to unload you get charged 13 and they will take your keys and time it;3
this is the perfect hotel to stay in if you are going to be going to lincoln center its just across the street the lobby to the hotel is nice but the hallway to our room needed some updating and cleaning our room was a junior suite and was spacious it has a fully stocked mini bar which is nice when so many hotels are doing away with them as always in nyc my number one complaint are the elevators it is impossible to get an elevator down near checkout time because all of them are always full and only 2 elevators were running we waited about 10 minutes and then just walked the 7 flights down;3
for the price it was more than enough the room was clean and warm during a snow storm the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was excellent right near the central park north entrance and near the subway no free wifi about 10 a day the pillows were hard and too high and the radiator whistled all night the price was so cheap that it was well worth it though just bring your own pillow d;3
for me while the lobby was impressive the common areas and the guest room at least the one we had did not impress me we opted for the standard view room with a queen size bed 125 sq feet the condition of the room itself was ok but not great i understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic art deco style there is limited closet space and dresser space the room was about a 125 sq feet which is what they list on their website the bathroom was very small with very little space they painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling the shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature there is no mini fridge nor a microwave the common areas on floor 21 were a;3
the hotel is right in the heart of ny with easy walking distance to all attractions and land marks no coffee facilities unless you pay for the upgrade no fridge in the room the staff are super friendly and very helpful;3
i decided to stay at this hotel because it was located down the street from kaiser hospital on sunset blvd my dad was going to have surgery early that morning so this was the perfect location waiting to be checked in took a while the male checking me in never even smiled or welcomed me to his hotel breakfast was good took a while for the cook to come make the omelette though the room with the double beds was a good size beds squeak as you sit on it air did not work made it extremely uncomfortable mildew in shower room needs touch up paint actually most areas of the hotel needs touched up area in check in sure could use a wet rag to wash down dirty walls;3
top location mid town where you want to be the rooms are clean if not a little tired if you ride the lifts you will notice a number of the floors have been turned over to some form of student hostel university accommodation which whilst nothing against students seeing pad locked room doors from the lift is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel effectively not a 4 star hotel when compared to other 4 star hotels i have stayed in in new york it is cheaper than the others i have stayed in but not by much overall good location and clean;3
grandchildren looking forward to rooftop pool it was advertised on line the week prior to booking the day prior to arrival we were told it was being repaired on arrival we were told it was in the process of being repaired for the last few weeks that would mean it was not available the whole month of august;3
before i begin this review i should say that having read through some of the reviews prior to my stay i was really concerned about my booking and whether the hotel would meet my previously high expectations i made my concerns known to the hotel via the power of social media and on arrival at the hotel a saturday night in june at around 9pm we had been upgraded to a corner suite free of charge i was really happy surprised about this our room was really big by city standards had a lounge area and a good sized bathroom our room was on the 10th floor and yes the lifts are slow and a tad unreliable we werent disturbed by the street noise or by the roof top bar the bed was comfy but the wardrobe space left a lot to be desired considering that tourists do a lot of;3
first hotel that i stay in during our trip to the usa suffice to say that out experience was somewhat mixed the hotel itself does not look too bad on the pictures and the outside but the room could be improved with some updating the staff is very friendly the breakfast is somewhat monotone same stuff everyday the hotel is not too far from the public transport subway and bus stop internet access is one of the are that could be improved during our stay it was somewhat slow and unstable;3
i was there from oct 23 to oct 25 they charged 50000 cad a night which is almost 40000 a night the location is perfect but the hotel is not worth it the hall way and entrance is old and does not show clean the room was small and the air was not fresh the bath room was moldy dirty and very small there was not any coffee tea or anything else in the room they charge 2700 a night for resort fee which i could not understand what that was for overall this hotel is not worth it for the money they are charging the only thing was fine is the location;3
this is a good hotel in hollywood and i dont think that its easy to find a hotel to a better value the hotel itself is ok but its certainly not a luxury hotel the rooms are spacious but feels worn out the bathroom didnt feel fresh and would really need to be refurbished soon the staff are friendly and give all help you need the breakfast is good and is served in a nice dining area they have a chef making omelets waffles etc the pool area is nice and relaxing but there arent too many sunbeds however we always found available sunbeds so it doesnt seem to be a problem parking is safe but cost 24 usd per day all in all this is an ok hotel when taking the price and location into account;3
the hotel is in a great location for universal studios we were initially placed in a room on the 2nd floor with a view of some bushes the room was so dark it was like being in a basement we were a party of 3 booking a room with a sofa bed for my daughter which hadnt even been made up i refused to stay in the room and we were quickly moved even then i had to remind reception to make up the sofa bed the rooms are a little tired and having just come from the bellagio in vegas paying more to stay in the hilton was a bitter pill to swallow parking charges are a joke the hotel is more concerned with catering for functions and dont seem that interested in your average holiday maker would not stay again;3
i would have graded this very good if the location and staff were nicer we stayed 4 nights on arrival i felt staff were a bit off and given we had just come from a super friendly hotel in san francisco our room was clean and looked onto the nice little courtyard wifi was a little so so didnt bother me but my son got grumpy about it pool area lovely you arent even aware you arent in a particularly nice area breakfast is really good loads of choice eggs and waffles cooked to order the only thing is the breakfast staff are so utterly miserable especially when you smile and use your manners and you get grunts area isnt nice but actually most of la is dirty and full of poor homeless people there is a nice italian on the corner plus a little supermarket we used uber to;3
location could not be better since the lincoln center is across the street however i was not at all impressed with the rooms we paid 1400 for two rooms with king sized beds and although the bed was quite comfy the room was not at all impressive the bathroom was the size of a plane bathroom you could not sit on the toilet without the door being in your way it was not lavish at all and was not pleasant to use the lobby is nice but thats the only thing impressive in this place the elevators are horrendous and get stuck every 10 minutes im assuming that is because the building is over 100 years old and i appreciate the fact that renovations cannot fix everything but we literally waited 8 minutes for an elevator at one point and one was not working if you;3
if you want just a place to sleep near tourist locations this is it very little to no wait for the elevators check in was quick the public areas were clean and well maintained the room while clean was run down scuff marks on the lower part of the walls and the carpeting was peeling up around the edges chipped and old paint through out the bathroom was the worse it was clean but need some up keep maintenance the bathtub had chips and grout is stained the drains let off an awful smell i had to keep the door closed at all times the wifi was spotty in the room but tolerable no outlets near bed scaffolding outside of window but expected from reading other reviews overall it was clean but needed an overhaul even with the issues it was a tolerable stay and i;3
reasonably clean near subway station and all night supermarket this is really a budget travellers hotel would i stay here again yes if got for reasonable price would not pay more than 100 dollars a night for a single room with queen size bed and en suite;3
pool was cold because the heater was broken staffs make us feeling like strangers than guests they donât seem to like working there not to happy what i paid for 4 stars hotel disappointed hope i can have better experience next time;3
booked through priceline upon arrival informed that we would need to pay 125 non refundable per deposit for our terrier we prepaid in part bc they advertise dogfriendly 125 is not friendly then we were given a dirty old dingy room so we were forced to overpay priceline was unhelpful and then stashed in the ghetto oh no free water or coffee so prepare to spend 750 for a plastic bottle of water disaster this is no 4 star hotel the lobby is nice the bartender;3
empire hotel has a very good situation close to central park and columbus circle you can go walking to main places in new york like times square moma or metropolitan we were one week and we were very comfortable we had the subway very close and directly connected with downtown manhattan the worse of our visit is wifi system it doesnt work very well and you must pay for it in your rooms;3
we stayed here in february 2018 and had a fairly mixed experience we requested a higher floor weeks in advance i understand that not all requests can be granted but we were a little miffed when the room we had was facing air vents we asked to be moved and we moved a couple of floors higher and then when i asked if there were any higher than that the lady on reception snapped at me the pool was being refurbished while we were there and we had to use the pool at the neighbouring sheraton we had continental breakfast included with our room but in my opinion it isnât really worth it even as a complimentary serveyourself breakfast you have to pay a service charge itâs toast bagels fruits and cold meats youâre better served going up to starbucks on citywalk or if;3
not a bad hotel but there were some problems we stayed here one busy friday night which was enough i think we stayed on what was a pretty busy weekend for them the hotel lobby was very stylish and featured a trendy bar hotel was located right across from the met so its a good location if that is of interest my favorite part of the hotel was the pool bar that was on the roof i had heard that the rooftop bar separate from the pool bar but just one floor down and easily visible from the pool barpatio had a dress requirement no tshirtssneakers but we saw lots of people in tshirts shorts and flipflops who got in anyway by far the worst part of the stay was the door slams in the morning granted this happens with every hotel but there is something with their;3
wow i havent felt this controversial in a whileit seemed whenever there was a pro there was also a con to outweigh it i would have given three and a half points if i could have but settled for the lesser score its always nicer to be positively surprised than negatively since it is a huge hotel it was not surprising that there were tons of people checking in at the same time i wanted to fair point however the checkin also felt like a massmarket procedure and i didnt feel welcomed at all the room wasnt ready until 4pm which was an additional challenge after an 8h flight i just wanted a shower and lie down for a bit but that wasnt possible the room was big enough so i was very pleased with that i even had a little balcony the shower however turned out;3
stayed at this hotel for a little nyc adventure on a shoe string budget it was my first time staying at one for these âshared bathroomâ type hotels after reading the reviews and going into this with the knowledge that my expectations should be non existent i donât have anything really bad to say about this hotel yes the inside of the hotel has seen better days the staff does not cater to you necessarily and having to share the bathroom does get annoying having said that the bed was comfortable although you could tell the sheets didnât get washed towels were provided every day without asking the shared bathroom even though small it was kept clean and stocked with toilet paper the location is very convenient for getting fromto laguardia easy access to the trainbuses;3
we recently stayed 4 nights in this hotel its by no means a 4 star hotel but neither is the price it is dated and in need of a refurbishment but in general it is ok the best part is that its a 2 minute walk maximum to the subway which serves lines12 and 3 and only 2 stops from times square if you take one of the express trains 2 or 3 train 1 is a local train and stops at every stationthe cost is 3 dollars for a single journey the hotel doesnt have a bar or a restaurant it only has vending machines on certain floors this isnt an issue as theres a few restaurants close by that do great breakfasts and evening meals there are a couple of bars directly opposite the hotel which are nice if you turn left when leaving the hotel and walk up to the next road amsterdam;3
its now downtown but you can get there in 15 minutes o to take the ferry to staten island in about 25 minutes the upper east side of central park is near too we stayed at a private room with our own bathroom so that option was ok place was very warm even though we went there in one of the coldest days would recommend if you donâ´t mind not being downtown they provided a room to store our luggage the day we had to leave so that was very nice of them;3
we arrived at the new yorker after a 3 hour wait to get through immigration i would have thought an airport like jfk would have been more organised we got a taxi to the hotel 65 plus tip and upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a family suite on the 39th floor we were also told that we had free wifi and free international calls there was a facilities fee of 135 which we were told was for things like waterroom service etc turns out the facilities fee was for the free wifi and we felt completely ripped off and we were charged 92 dollars for this privilege of using this our upgraded suite turned out to be nothing more than a run down bedsit with a double bed and a dirty looking sofa bed we declined the offer of the upgrade and asked for the;3
a good example of its kind staff are an asset but the travel concierge was less than helpful knowledge of local transport was very poor and could not accept we did not want to drive she was clearly committed to her commission if you are visiting universal studios this is excellent if not it is miles away from everything breakfast is way over priced and there is limited choice nearby;3
this review is just for the breakfast buffeet which we visited twice during the second half of december kids up to 15 get to eat free with parents for my family of 4 the buffet came out around â£21 for us the buffet includes decent english breakfast items pastries cereals and drinks latte coffee to juices overall it is a great value comparing to other options the location is right by london eye and the south shoreline the waterloo tube station is nearby;3
small room cleaned but dirty towels in the closet food in fridge from others tv not working towels were so old there were teared on the sides bathroom on the level should at least provide paper towels;3
first time in usa stayed in the new yorker hotel which is very central in manhattan next to madison square garden the hotel is very dated but ok for price and amenities the tick tick restaurant which is joined to hotel was very well priced and staff very helpful hope you like walking;3
im going to go out on a limb and give days inn broadway and 94th a three star rating when others have been bashing the joint i was able to have a me time foray to the big apple stretch myself out in a nonsmoking room with a king sized bed who hoo never mind the dated dã©cor skip the fact the place is old and still has crt tube tv i was here to pound the pavement eat and hit some of the galleries i never get to see since none of my family or friends seem intent to like art the way i do i have a room to myself the water pressure is fine and theres a room safe the bed is clean and theres no bedbugs or evidence of any theres a hairdryer and iron and ironing board available its walking distance through central park and you can walk to the guggenheim from;3
the hotel is in a great location but to be honest that is the only good thing i can say about it i realise that the decor is art deco but it just looks drab you exit the elevator to dark grotty hallways and once in the room it continues to look dull and grubby with brown carpets and tired funiture i went to reception and said that i thought that my room was a little grotty to which i was told you have been upgraded to a room with a view but my problem was the room was grotty i repeated to be told yet again that i had a view on the day we checked out we needed to leave our bags as we were flying out in the evening we were charged 20 to have our bags stored would not return or recommend this hotel;3
this art deco hotel has interesting public areas but our room was very poor with a tiny en suite 8th avenue around the hotel leaves a lot to be desired the tik toc diner and the trattoria were reasonable but overpriced close to penn station so if youâre travelling by train perhaps itâs ok;3
the usual small room for an hotel in new york ours had an inward facing view which was a bit dark and disappointing but we didnt spend much time in the room shower was ok but lacking room facilities ie no fridge in room nor teacoffee making facility bed was only a double not the king we expected and we saw a cockroach in lobby while waiting for elevator;3
be warned that this is an old hotel and the rowdy people nextdoor to us might as well have been in our same room additionally our room smelled like moldy cat urine my husband declares that this is âjust new yorkâ i think for the outrageous price we paid a room should smell much better also the rooms are extraordinarily tiny again this is probably just a new york thing but it bears mentioning i will say that if you were in town to attend anything at madison square garden the location canât be beat there is also a creepy mcdonaldâs across the street and two starbucks within eyeshot also very convenient to penn station;3
the building is excellent and traditional from the period however extra facilities and charges for extras like coffee that are standard in most hotels let the hotel down the lack of welcome pack was unusual i received a key card and directions there was no further contact until i checked out;3
a pretty basic hotel for that kind of money bed was ok bathroom was tiny faucet wasnt easy to operate room was all in all pretty small theres a desk there with a chair but you could hardly sit on it as you were so close to the bed room was very clean though;3
the service was ok at best the door man eugene was the exception he was amazing remembering our names was always great with suggestions for anything we wanted he would be the reason we would come back;3
when you reached here remember to have british pounds in hand as they only accept payment in cash in pounds no card or other currency payment accepted luckily there is an exchange currency shop in hammersmith station i quickly went over there or else i could not check in or stay at hotel for a cheap stay like this in london recommed for budget travels as this hotel provides basic things a bed to sleep a shared bathroom a shared toilet mixed malefemale a shared kitchen they also have tv room and free luggagekept room the location is extremely convenient about 5 minutes walk from hotel to hammersmith station and easilyconnected to main station like victoria or city center links food drinks and supermarkets can be found right at the station or on the streets;3
pros convenient to lincoln center restaurants and cafes room 340 was close to the elevator decorated in earth tones cons the bathroom light switch is outside the bathroom behind the door when open no hot water at 10 pm and only a little at 7 am the shades seem opaque but at night the light shining in the room may make them see thru easy to get to the bathroom just roll out of bed and you were nearly in the bathroom;3
me and my mum stayed at the new yorker for 3 nights there was numerous problems with this hotel from check in to check out we had issues with check in regarding a pre arranged upgrade this was dealt with to some extent by one of the guest service managers as many others say on here the rooms are small and the hotel is 1930s so a lot is still the original fittings however the room was in need of a refurbish especially the windows which let in a draft and the curtains or drapes had to be closed to prevent the cold draft from getting into the room and the heating turned up very high we kept getting electric shocks of nearly every piece of furniture from the towel rail in the bathroom to the metal trim on the table this was a real nuisance as you had to carefully tap;3
my 75 yr old mother and i spent a couple of days in la after attending a conference in anaheim checking in was easy and fast the hotel has a contemporary flair but not fancy it was not easy to locate the pool for there are no signs the gym was located on the penthouse and has a pretty good view however there are no cleaning wipes to disinfect the equipment after use yuck some travelers allowed their young children in the gym to fool around on the equipment despite the posted rules against it there was a slight odor of cigarette smoke in the lobby and in the halls of the hotel yuck the coffee in the room sucks and the hotel is stingy with the body wash etc even though the hotel states on their website that parking is 16 it is not it is 44 for valet parking and 20;3
pros decent location adjoining diner is good and staff in there are great friendly doorman who sorted a taxi for us consdisappointments booked two rooms at the same time 9 months in advance and requested rooms with views neither room had any view to speak of one room was vastly different to the other in terms of size and decor despite being booked at the same time and it being the same type of room put a note on the booking and contacted the hotel additionally about it being my dadâs 60th birthday during our stay as most hotels do something nice nothing done at all very disappointing maid service done daily but the bath was dusty every evening obviously not cleaned properly no tea or coffee making facility in the room even holiday inns have;3
overall was good bedding needs improvement no fitted sheets everything is just tucked in â¦ comforter keeps coming apart shower water pressure is terrible can not enjoy showering with that kind of water pressure;3
this hotel is located in the heart of the upper west side which is great unlike most midtown hotels you really get a chance to see what life is like for manhattanites the rooms are surprisingly spacious but do not include private bathrooms at least not the one i stayed in this means you will be sharing with lots of other people and by the end of the morning it can be downright disgusting to go in there i would definitely recommend shower sandles still the price is right and the neighborhood is great so if this is the only way you can afford it its still better than most hostels;3
this hotel is worthwhile for the location alone its a block away from msg and walking distance from times square and broadway that being said the hotel itself isnât great the lobby is cramped and always busy the rooms are kinda cramped and not the cleanest i actually had to change rooms because the shower pipes were rusted and released dirty brown water the wifi wasnât strong the hotel also has guards that you need to show your room card to in order to go in and out the whole operation seems to be 20 years behind more modern hotels but if you donât plan to spend much time in your hotel this is a pretty affordable midtown hotel;3
we chose this hotel for its location which is 8 minutes walk away from times square the bedroom was clean good quality beds and great shower the size of the double room not that generous and you ave to pay for everything considering we paid 250 gbp for one night stay on a mid season monday night it did feel a bit like a rip off the bottle of water in the bedroom was five dollars didnt want to check the rest of the goodies that were there not even wifi was included in the room staff in the lobby was very helpful and friendly always with a smile and ready to assist;3
it looked like the hotel needs some updating youre pretty much paying for the convenience of the location right by central park and the lincoln center at least the mezzanine and the lounge look decent the rooms not so much;3
we stayed at the empire hotel for a week the location was brilliant for tourists minutes from central park next to the lincoln center 15 minute walk from time square only complaint location wise would be that the number of reasonablypriced eateries in the area was limited or they were hidden well and the hotel didnt help us to find them our room superior 4th floor was spacious for nyc had a great bathroom though drainage from the shower not good and risked overflowing a couple of times we were able to see out onto the lincoln centre plaza which i liked we found the service average it was polite enough but we didnt feel really welcomed to the hotel and there was certainly no effort made to provide any extras or useful information free wifi was;3
rooms are clean and nice windows are too old and thin you can hear a lot of noise coming from outside and the cold also enters in the room not nice when you have 5f degree outside i would suggest to offer the coffee it costs 3 and a bottle of water as basic amenities room service is ok but it takes too long 3045 minutes to get there even only for a club;3
this hotel looked great on the website and was sold to us through an agent we were appalled at the additional charges which were not explained to us at the point of booking or at checkin they wanted 7 â£7 for a small bottle of water wifi wasnt included despite most places around nyc offering free wifi opportunities the rooms were disappointing with marks on curtains and blinds missing plugs and a need for upkeep of decor;3
on two nights business related stay in manhattan i chose the hotel for its location near penn station arriving at the hotel at noon the clerk tells me me my room is ready but my rate only allows me to check in at 4pm therefore for a mere 50 i could check in early the weather outside is turning and the rain changes to snow lets do it what a customer first experience not i head over to store my luggage and the guy asks me for 5 i have never been at hotel before that charges money for this but here i go than i ask if i can tie my backpack to the big luggage and the guy says sure but its five more dollars im like no way and head out into the snow everything else is normal but old and a bit rundown though everything works and nothing is obviously;3
did enjoy the hospitality but bedroom only had a view of a wall and the aircon was an oldfashioned underwindow unit which was noisy and inefficient as a result it was difficult to sleep comfortably but the bars and restaurants are lovely and its good value for the price;3
its hard writing a bad review of this hotel because most of the staff except one or two employees at the front desk and some maids are very nice and willing to help however the hotel feels somewhat dated the rooms are not very big in size the sauna is never heated so dont plan on using them if youre in a hurry they need a lot of time to heat the pool is never heated either so its very cold most of the time the breakfast is ok some of it is made to order while pastries are not very fresh our room was not made for at least three days apparently the maid forgot but then when we asked someone if our rooms could be made we were told that the maids were out at 3pm so the rooms had to stay unmade this happened way more often that it shouldve there were;3
the hotel lobby is beautiful most of the staff is friendly location is not bad near a couple stores banks starbucks and so forth down falls fitness center is made up of three machines 2 of which do not work i was here for two nights the first room i got was tiny tvs are old with very limited channels breakfast is not included but your offered a discount at a place near by tickets availible at the front desk wifi in the first room was great in the second room however though the room was bigger0 wifi is slow over all the price is fair and the hotel is clean though in both rooms the floors seemed to be sticky also right across the street from the 2 the 1 train;3
i recently traveled to nyc with my husband and 2 of my children we stayed at 3 hotels of similar price the paramount the empire and the ameritania the paramount was right in the middle of times square the the theater district which made it extremely crowded and the room was cramped the lobby was nice and the room was quiet with a city view there was almost no room between the foot of the bed and the wall after feeling cramped we woke up to a bill for the resort fee of 27 no idea what was worth 27 the lobby the empire hotel has an amazing rooftop terrace and a small pool it was the only one of the three with a pool so it made a huge difference in entertainmentrelaxing environmentand wow factor there was a lot of staff and the lobby is amazing the coolness;3
reserved for one night in order to catch an early flight the next morning upon checkin the room reserved was not ready but three alternative rooms which were ready were offered and we accepted one of those the room had a view of lax and the soundproofing was excellent the only available drinking cups were the paper ones provided for the inroom coffee maker at 300am the next morning there was little hot water in the sink although the supply in the bathtub was better but slow in arriving 8th floor room ate in the hotel restaurant which offered a limited sitdown menu service was prompt and the food tasty easy to catch the provided airport shuttle early in the am as it runs every 10 15 minutes 24 hours per day overall hotel is adequate except for the exceptions;3
really looked forward to staying at the new yorker iconic hotel and highly rated it was bound to be good we arrived early we got into nyc at 11am so made our way to the hotel and arrived at the hotel at 1ish knew we couldnât check in till 4pm so asked where we can leave our bags i wasnât expecting a 5 per bag charge and itâs 5 even for a carrier bag doesnât matter if you attach it to your suitcase they still charge you for it that was very disappointing to see iâve traveled a lot and never been charged to leave suitcases we went off around nyc and returned about 430 reception was busy the âtraineeâ who was stood watching didnât crack any sort of smile shrugged her shoulders when asked a question herbert however we spoke to and dealt with was excellent;3
we stayed here for 10 nights in december 2015 me my partner and our 2 year old the outcome it was ok the location was great but the room was very small we travelled to ny last year around the same time but stayed further out and wanted something a little more central this year in future we would stay further away for a better hotel our room had 2 double beds so we thought it would be pretty spacious also from the pictures we seen on the hotel website we were confident we would have a comfortable stay not at all the room was tiny with just enough space to move around the beds the bathroom decor was poor there was paint pealing off the bath and all in all the whole room needed updating the draught from the windows was really cold and with a 2 year old this is;3
recently stayed at the new yorker with family and friends although the hotel is in a great location and it is a lovely historic building the charges made were ridiculous we were charged 25 per night for facilities business centre fitness centre and local phone calls woopie do we had no need of any of the services just another way to get money out of you then to top it all we had to pay 2 per piece of luggage to have it stored i have stayed in a fair few hotels all over europe and never had to pay this i even had to go in to the luggage room as they couldnt find mine it isnt a cheap hotel to start with but the extras made it too pricey to go again such a greedy shame the room was ok but coffee making facilities would have been better the bathrooms are;3
the rooms are pretty nice the bed was decently comfortable i have stayed on much nicer beds in hotels the room was contemporary my one complaint about the room was the lack of hot water i was up at about 700am because i had a business meeting and the water would not get warm figuring that most people would still be asleep you would think that they would have more hot water i ate at the breakfast buffet and was disappointed it was overpriced and not very good most of the food was cold and dried out for 25 dollars i expected a good breakfast but felt like it was dennys quality if even that the biggest pro of the hotel is the location you are within about 510 minutes walking distance to universal studios and city walk no need for taxis;3
the lower floors are not quiet also if you happen to get hurt do not expect compassion the hotel earns brownie points by being so close to universal studios but the sheraton is also close i would rather have spent more at the sheraton next door and received a quiet nights sleep than paid a little less and receive a poor stay;3
first of all the hotels location is great for universal studios its a 10 minute walk to the park entrance and city walk the rooms are big and modern however the amenities are shocking for a chain of this size no wifi unless you want pay a large fee for 24 hour access they charge you nearly 400 for water in your room we stayed in smaller hotels dueing tge course of our near threeweeks in california and had complimentary wifi in hotels except here in others we even had complimentary champagne would only recommend staying here if you are going to universal studios and being close is important;3
everything was all good we possibly just didnt see the note that the bathroom would be down the hall lol pack your shower shoes and all of the stuff to prep in a public bathroom all in all all was well for the cost and location;3
if your objective in new york is to be near lincoln center this location is perfect right across the street obviously convenient to the neighborhood and a perfectly reasonable walk to central park a block away and the theatre district just a few blocks down past columbus circle the room while small was surprisingly quiet it was on the second floor so not too far above the traffic but it faced away from the street no view but we didnt care and there was no noise to speak of whether from the street or elsewhere in the hotel given the premium price of the room and the image the hotel is trying to project however its the little things that count the closet consisted of several hooks behind the door and four hangers two paper cups in the bathroom which the;3
was here for a few nights for business so not for universal studios which may have been the problem as it is clearly geared to that i had asked for a high floor room away from the elevator was given a low floor very close to the elevator i asked if i could move and was told no i am a diamond member so was disappointed room was clean but looked tired had an odd smell to it had all sorts of little thing light bulbs burnt out that were never replaced clock on wrong time and a really small tv for the room i had the diamond complimentary breakfast which was mediocre at best nothing seemed fresh in general the staff didnt seem too interested either and not very friendly;3
stayed here in august 2014 decided we wanted a decent room so opted for the executive suit on the executive floor this promise good views and good rooms with excellent service its a pity they didnt uphold there end of it the rooms were not very clean and you couldnât see out of the window as they were so dirty so the view was hampered the food was good though and it was handy for universal studios just a 10 minute walk i dont think i would stay again as there is so many hotels in la to stay in;3
rooms are relatively clean buts needs regular maintenance check the ceiling light was not functioning tv has only 5 channels and the reception is poor towels are old and no longer soft no complementary water i used the vendo machine and nothing came out but my card was charged i reported the incident at the front desk i was told that my money will be reimbursed but it did not happen the building and facilities are old the noise along the hallway was disturing and nobody maintains peace and order overall felt i wa not able to get my moneys worth i wont recommend this hotel to the people i know;3
this iconic midtown manhattan behemoth of a hotel was once the place to be sadly time and economic realities have taken their toll still beautiful in its art deco architcture rooms are small for 2 but adequate for solo stays run around 200 per night if youre in town for mostly theatre this location is perfect minutes by subway to all theatre district locations close to macys and herald square for shopping;3
our room was small and the bedroom portion was nicely decorated the bathroom looked like something from the 40s but it did the job and we had hot water it was quiet and the elevators were fast the location is excellent walking distance to broadway madison square gardens penn station times square and other subway stations we were charged a daily fee of 30 us for phone internet and fitness room this fee was a surprise and was not optional the safe did not work but someone came up to fix it;3
in understanding that this is a tourist destination and location is everything i have paid for hotel rooms at the same rate that had updated everything made the stay feel comfortable and felt taken care of and heard at this location art deco is thrown around to hide the outdateness of it all from the dim lighting even with all lights on terrible shower head tv reception out of the 80s paper thin walls and promises to my simple request that was never fulfilled to boot the moment after checking in i was great by a rep for a timeshare if you need to be in the center of it all for accessibility sake without the need for modernized amenities and comfort go for it however i have paid similar prices for a lot better and considering this is owned by wyndham i would;3
stopped here for 4 nights at the end of september arrived late due to delays to be informed that they only had a smoking room left i was not happy with this but the front desk said that they would try and sort something out the next day our first night was spent in a really small room that needed refurbishment when we moved to a different room this was a little larger but still very small dark and tired the wardrobe was tiny the smallest ive ever seen in a hotel the bathroom was also the smallest ive ever seen it had a shower with no door so that the water went everywhere and no place to put any toiletries we booked this hotel for the roof bar and pool as it was recommended by our travel agent and we thought it would be a good way to relax unfortunately it was;3
the place was a little bit out dated and dirty but the convince and customer service was good would probably stay there again very loud at night and thin walls you could hear the 123 line;3
this is a hotel manned by friendly helpful staff in a great location but let down by rooms or at leaã my room404 i was sharing it with my teenage daughter and soon realised it was a bit too smallno wardrobe only a space above safe with space for maybe 4 short items hidden behind a dark curtainthe blinds was drawn in the day time so we opened it to discover our view was ox a brick wall and also looking straight into opposite rooms we had one and a half drawer space to share the room was clean and bed comfortable but air conditioning was huge and very noisythe bathroom was lined with old fashioned wood effect and had no extraction fan so became very steamedno where to hang clothes while showering and no waste bin i did;3
the hyatt regency is a mainstay when i arrive from the east coast in the early evening and i think thats because its staff from the guy who maneuvered the airport shuttle to the checkin crew are all excellent this visit our first hotel stay during the pandemic was odd for the same reasons that other places feel odd but odd nevertheless the restaurant was closed on a tuesday evening but we could buy food at the togo place and take it to our rooms super theres no bar understanding so we each bought 25 halfbottles my husband prefers white i like red and were given a plastic cup in which to drink them on our floor the soda machine and the ice machine were out of order due to covid im not sure why a soda machine would need extra precautions but its part;3
me and my friends stayed in 4 rooms two single rooms and two double rooms when checked in the receptionist only gave breakfast vouchers to me and my other friend who stayed in single room as well my other four friends who stayed in double room didnt get voucher and the receptionist said they just need to say their room numbers for breakfast but when we took breakfast the restaurant staffs requested us to sign a bill even we had told them our room numbers and they had confirmed if breakfast was including in our room i signed that bill because i though it was just a confirmation and wouldnt be charged and it usually happen during my stay at other hotels in europe but when we checked out there were a bill for breakfast and it spend 45 minutes to settle it the staff at;3
great if you are hung over but if you are older the place is way too dark beds need updating with better pillows location is a little far from midtown staff was friendly room was clean the sky bar staff could be a little nicer hotel needs to be updated;3
this hotel is well located but their rooms are really too smallno view at allwe wait for the elevators quiet a few minuteslobby is always too crowdedi dont like it as i said the location is excellent;3
this hotel is really centrally located for many major attractions in nyc such as macys and the empire state building however the hotel room needed major upgrades first another family we were there with found an empty beer can in their room which is obviously doesnt make you feel like the best cleaning job was done our room had chipped molding and dim lighting the bed was not very comfortable also the room was not spacious but that is expected for nyc the lobby was nice and the diner in the lobby was convenient and pretty good;3
the last time i stayed here was 2013 and my first three reviews of the place were pretty good but now i see some of the faults a bit more clearly what is great about the jane is that its quite clean im not one for shared washrooms but they are really meticulous in keeping them clean and you cant beat the location the beds are actually quite comfortable the rooms are very small but thats assumed theyre up front about this the staff are pleasant the problem for me is the doors since many many rooms are packed into each floor there are many many doors at close quarters and they all slam naturally you want your door to close tight and properly i get it but youd think that the jane would invest in hydraulic arms for the doors this place has to be;3
after checking all budget hotels this one was had good location and affordable price one bedroom room was ok no tv or private bathroom the bathroom was shared next to the room overall solid budget hotel in ny subway is 5 min away and you will reach downtown in 15 minutes if you are on budget and looking a place just to sleep in this one is for you;3
i am currently staying at the empire the hotel is in a great location close to lincoln center restaurants and subways my room is an interior room so very dark i realize that this is a risk when staying in nyc hotels i live in connecticut so travel to nyc every couple of weeks i think perhaps this is why the front desk clerk included free wifi upon my checking in to makeup for the lack of viewsunlight and i am appreciate of that my main gripe is that the desk in the room has no light so virtually no work can be done at the desk also there is no plug for the computer the only plug below the desk has the refrigerator and tv plugged in to it it renders the desk useless for any kind of work i have to sit on the edge of the bed and plug the computer into the wall i;3
very expensive hotel for an average service nothing special in this hotel just the comfort to be close to universal when i visited there was a rebuilding in the lobby but it wasnt a problem they have a transfer service to universal that was really good during a rainy night otherwise you can walk its 5 minutes walk until universal its easy to stay in a place like this but its expensive for no service;3
stayed here in july with my teenage son while visiting my sister in new york the check in staff were very friendly but we had to bring our own suitcases into reception the bell boy did not help us the rooms are small but most hotel rooms in new york are and we found our room very dusty in place my son found mold on the backs of the curtains the carpets looked well worn and the bathroom was tiny for some reason when you went to the toilet you could not shut the door but the toilet roll holder on the wall was very awkward to reach on saying this the beds were very comfortable and the sheets and pillowcases were very soft and comfy the room service was very expensive which we found out the first morning of our trip when we ordered our breakfast30 dollars for 2 of us;3
the location is good but the service is terrible i had a brand new dress stained by bleach in my own room by one of the maids and they said i was lying and that they wouldnt pay for that felt really injured from where i come from the costumer is always right and must be well treated so he can come back other times thats not what happened here and thats why ill never get back neither recommend morningside inn;3
location good next to train station front service desk always happy friendly service very small bed rooms need to update the tv channels very old and outdated movies wifi is 10 a day room cleaned everday;3
on arrivel were given a room on the second floor which was small old and not cleanwhen when i told the man at the front desk that we booked a room which had free wifi and was bigger then the room we received he was rude and insisted that it was our room the next day the lady at the front desk did change the room when we asked we received a room on the ninth floo which was bigger but there were days when we had no hot water the area is very good near the train and one can find supermarkets near by we paid extra for the fridge the hotel is undergoing renervation at the moment if you are young and looking for a place to sleep this could suit you but on the whole i would not recomend this hotel;3
if like my wife and i you want a hotel that is comfortable and convenient then this hotel is great if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room then this may not be the place for you the rooms are compact but comfortable clean and air conditioned there is a subway station right across the road and there are plenty of places to grab a snack and shop in the immediate vicinity;3
our first trip to new york didnt start too well arrived checked in got stuck in lift no apology from management at all room was good size although in desperate need of a revamp after the initial shock though bathroom large great shower and very clean bed very comfortable and room cleaned and clean towels daily reception staff couldnt have been more kind or more helpful when my credit card was stoleneven letting me use theirpersonal mobile if your looking for decent size room in fab location at good rate i would say give it a go;3
the hotel is location in a really good place next to madison square garden the rooms were ok average size clean but very dated unless you love art deco however you only use the rooms as a base to sleep so that wasnt a problem for us the lobby has a small take out coffeepastries and the tic toc diner is good the 25 dollar a night fee when you arrive is a money making scheme by the hotel we were aware of it before we went not really sure what you got for this mandatory fee access to the tiny business suite and the small gym perhaps you also have to pay 2 dollars for every bit of luggage you store once you have checked out this seems another money making scheme by the hotel i must say though the staff were very nice and helpful the only reason i havent;3
new york hotels are a different ball game you pay more and get less bearing that in mind the dayâs hotel isnât such a bad option sure the rooms are shabby and dated the internet doesnât seem to connect and the âfitness centreâ consists of a single exercise bike and the tvâs are from the 1980âs but for the price itâs not too bad here you are in the heart of the upper west side a local area with plenty of good shops restaurants and bars while the hotel will be full of tourists this is not a tourist area youâre a ten minute walk from central park five minutes from riverside park and the 2 and 3 trains will whisk you to times square in less than ten minutes the hotel is right beside the subway station when we stayed in feb 2015 the hotelâs exterior was being;3
totally average hotel very well located near the subway concierge was nice rooms are small and not very clean front rooms have nice view of central park though no overview;3
our room was terrible i never complain about the room but this was the first time that i couldnt stand the dirtiness the hair was all around the bathroom the towels were dirty and disgusting looked like they were not washed i didnt have space in the room to open my suitcase how small the room was just space for a bed i complained to the manager about this they apologized and immediately gave us another room the new room was much better but still not very clean this hotel should not be more than 3 stars elevators were very slow and congested the hotel provided free printing which was very good however we needed to pay 5 per baggage when we wanted to leave the baggage in the hotel in order to wait for our flight this was the only hotel i stayed at that asked;3
a third of the tv screen had lines in it there was rust in the tub from the dripping shutoff and the fan in the acheater vibrated loud enough to wake you up dont stay in room 864 the view was great the room was clean and the hotel staff were the best ever;3
we stayed one night in august to take advantage of early park hours at universal studios the hotel is a four star but a well used 4 star our tub was peeling which was odd must have been covered at some point and the base boards were pretty kicked up other than that it was good hotel nice views clean lobby and efficient check in we found it was faster just to walk to universal studios then it was to wait for the shuttle it was close enough the walk was about 7 minutes and there is an elevated walk way over the road so no busy streets to cross the proximity to the park made it worth the stay no drive in the morning so no traffic to deal with overnight parking is expensive but you can leave your car in the lot until 6pm the next day the restaurants were;3
the hotel is in a good location but thatâs about it the decor is dated the carpet on the lobby stairs is literally coming off the stairs the bathroom is so small that even a petite women hits the sink while sitting on it it took 3 minutes for he shower to heat up and thereâs no door on the shower so the whole bathroom is wet when youâre done the rooms and overall interior of the rooms are darkly lit and all the finishes are reds and browns so itâs dark and busy insidenot exactly modern or worth what youâre charged per night if you want to go to the âpoolâ be prepared to walk up two flights of stairs and be disappointed itâs a very small dated pool overall left me wanting to switch hotels or askfor a refund;3
location is great customer service soso lots of extra charges in addition to the 25ish dollar per day facility charge and local taxes the hotel charges 2 per item for left luggage not at all clear what the facility fee is actually for would i stay again yes but purely for the location and in spite of the pretty average facilities and staff watch out for elderly electronic door locks too we had to be moved to a different room at 10pm when our door lock stopped working not what you want at the end of a tiring day however were given a complimentary breakfast as an apology for the inconvenience;3
we spent 3 nights at this hotel in june 09 the rooms were spatious and clean but are not well isolated you could hear people running and talking loudly in the hall at night the hotel area is not optimal but its a central location to do all your excursions by car complimentary breakfast staff was friendly except for the guest manager natalya x who seemed to be very annoyed when we turned to her for the check out complimentary wifi access overall ok pricequality;3
as far as hiltons go this one is lacking old and a bit run down they were remodeling the elevators during our stay so i guess that will be a plus though you are already over paying for the room plus you have to pay for wifi and parking parking at 29night and when you walk up from the parking garage you have to walk the entire length of the hotel to get to the desk and the elevators to your room other than it being convenient to universal studios i cant say too many good things staff was only ok restaurant is expensive but the food was good i have stayed in alot nicer hiltons for a little bit less;3
this is a basic three star hotel towards the lower end of the 3 star range i personally do not know how people would give it 4 or 5 stars the hotel is a renovated ramada inn located in an older area of hollywood that has seen better days the area is not the prettiest but is far from dangerous it is the commercial strip of a working classimmigrant section there are some homeless people but that has been an unfortunate trend all over los angeles and the country as of late the hotel is pretty centrally located basically within 30 minutes of anywhere you would want to go as a tourist except disneyland which is actually in anaheim in orange county about an hour away the walk of fame in hollywood rodeo drive venice beach santa monica malibu melrose;3
classic ny 70s high fashion style in black and gold dark if you like that kind of thing rooms are decent size for ny bathrooms nicely updated bed comfortable closet is useless for hanging anything longer than a sport coat thats ridiculous staff pretty attentive although one bartender a complete jerk but another was great nightclub upstairs but served by separate elevator so no interference with rooms location great for getting to lincoln ctr and central park decent walk for times square but far away from late night eats restaurants and bars;3
the pictures are a bit deceiving as this is not as posh as it might appear our room looked a bit run down and the toilet didnt flush well however it was quiet and comfortable enough we stayed on the first floor outside our sliding door was a tiny patio however outside that was a courtyard that had a fountain candles and chairs tables and couches it was a nice area except there was what looked to be a bar that was being worked on by a worker they have a very nice free breakfast with an omelet bar and a nice dining area it appears they have a comedy club and bar but i didnt see it open the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but it is hollywood i felt safe in the hotel my brother and sisterinlaw stayed in the jacuzzi suite and it was very nice for the price the;3
the best feature of this hotel is the location neighbors to the beautiful lincoln center 2 blocks from central park and columbus circle grand entrance to the hotel but the rooms are rather small and outdated wall paper and paint peeling off the wall one worn out bath rope for a double room gym closed down free internet connection not working anywhere in the hotel there is a pool on the roof for a dip but not for a swim it is small nice roof top bar well isolated from rest of the hotel;3
i meant to write a review on this back in june when i was in new york stayed here and was a little nervous based off the reviews but our room was totally fine bathroom was very clean we had ac wifi it was very close to a subway and lots of little places to get food and walk around i guess the only downside would be the elevators how dark the hallways are and it smells weird sometimes id recommend this place if youre looking for somewhere cheaperaffordable to stay;3
my daughter and i stayed at this hotel 5115152016 it has a great history and 30s ambiance in the lobby that is where the fun ends our room was extremely small there was no coffeemaker or refrigerator and the bathroom sink was clogged there was no functional ice maker within several floors of our room and the housekeeper knocked on our door before 9 am every morning definitely not what i was expecting for over 250 a night;3
its in the midst of chinatown not my favorite place to be but it is safe the rooms are pretty basic not sure it should qualify as a two star but you get a prety small room hard beds dusty tabletops bathroom countertops and desk at least bathroom and sheets were clean towels looked a little brown i brought my own you do get soap shampoo toothbrush and toothpaste in case you forgot your own the wifi worked fine for me and we had a medium sized flat screen tv in our room that made it look a little nicer but rarely ever used there was a safe in the room but i didnt need it its perfect walking distance to financial district little italy and the subway station is just 1 block away and it takes you anywhere you need to go so in that sense it was great;3
when i arrived i saw that the shower had no door did not bother to say anything since the rolls of towels on the floor told me they were aware of the condition also they charge you for the coffee in the room and wifi which feels like being nickled and dimed charge a bit more and have that be covered decor was nice and staff friendly plus the location is very good all said the good and the bad average out;3
a lovely hotel and a fabulous deal for a hotel in los angeles good room rates and a free breakfast buffet included all good right my only criticisms are that its location is a bit too far east if your business takes you to west hollywood and further west and the breakfast is great but the coffee is weak and the juices watered down go elsewhere for your breakfast beverages;3
the hotel staff were very helpful friendly and could not be faulted the location of the empire is great very central and not too far from anywhere my criticisms are the rooms described as deluxe are very small and the bathroom was way too small to be a pleasant experience to use the room was unhealthily hot with no way of controlling it the wifi priced at 13 per device per day was ridiculously overpriced maybe this ny for you it my experience of other us hotels is its free;3
the room was tiny dated smelled weird and there was lots of noise from outside which was obviously due to the fact that it was built a long time ago and didnt have much soundproofing i got a great rate though so i guess it made up for it when i say tiny i mean there wasnt enough room in the bathroom for my toiletries and not really space to put them elsewhere in the room either you also couldnt open drawers in the mini dresser because the full sized bed was in the way and there was barely even a place to put the ironing board my entire floor had a musty smell to it that was clearly being attempted to be covered by air freshener note you have to show your room key to get up to your room so always be prepared to do so the lobby is spectacular which is quite;3
stayed here for two nights positives great location reception and door staff were great rooms were nicely decorated great bathroom negatives sheets werent clean as shown in the pics arrived late so just wanted to sleep they changed the next day and they were then clean wifi they charge a day rate but the signal was pretty rubbish;3
elevators were extremely slow and did not stop on the 12th floor had to get off on the 11th with my family of 5 and walk one flight of stairs also they had one elevator that was completely out of service the elevator was slow enough but with one not working it was even worse not happy that the hotel didnt provide any notice upon booking that they were performing hotelelevator maintenance if i knew i would have booked at the sheraton next door;3
dont want to review because it would be negative lighting is horrible cant even read in the room rugs frayed lousy room service hours excellent staff good housekeepers maintenance good service;3
it seems like a lot of these reviews are not real too many posting from people with 1 contribution on trip advisor this is a real unbiased review when pulling up to the hotel from the main road i was concerned with the appearance and dated exterior the nice fountain pictured is in the back gated parking area i was greeted at the front desk by pil he was lovely friendly and put me at ease with my choice of hotel the room was basic and dated but cleanliness was no issue i got a room facing the courtyard and it was very quiet the entire 2 nights of my stay on to the reason you want to stay here the free breakfast is fantastic and hugos reputation is well earned friendly and happy to serve up delicious omelets or waffles in addition to the fresh made items there are;3
the best thing about this hotel is the location it is walking distance to almost everything we stayed 11 nights the rooms are small there is no space to open the suitcase and wardrobe is very very small so you have to keep some of your clothes in the suitcase the rooms are not very clean when we came we found a hair in the bathtub the worst thing about this hotel is staff in the lobby they are so rude and not helpfull at all in the lobby you can buy coffee and pastries coffee is 5 dollars so you can have breakfast in the lobby on the ground floor there is a tick tock restaurant donât go there across the street is starbucks and mcdonaldâs the taxi from jfk to the hotel is flat rate 52 plus tip penn station is 1 minute from the hotel so you can use public;3
got a renovated room however room was small and had no desk and chair which was important since i was travelling for business they failed to clean my room after my first night however they cleaned up after i mentioned it they cleaned every day after that for the remainder of my stay friendly and helpful staff;3
booked here because of proximity to penn station access to ewr figured rooms would be tiny in an old hotel and they were no problem there downsides once they have your email address they just dont let up in their effort to squeeze every last nickle out of you frequent offers to buy upgrades meals tours etc etc arrive daily in the run up to your stay want a checkin prior to 4pm that will be 50 late check out same if youre above the 20th floor better budget up to a 15 minute wait for an elavator and hell awaits those with animal dander allergies decades of visitors for the westminster and other animal pageants make this place a severe challenge to breathe in getting our train to the airport was a breeze though;3
very good service with a very friendly front desk nothing special a goodlooking breakfast buffet that we did not try though the reason you stay here is to be able to walk five minutes to the hilton universal property its a very easy walk even with kids worth the money;3
good location comfortable beds nice enough space wouldve been nice if wifi and lightsheating worked better was very disappointed that each package that i had delivered to the hotel was a 5 fee;3
great location for exploring ny and with fabulous rooftop bar but room quite small and tired the noisiest aircon ever very good buffet breakfast but not cheap we found the lincoln centre cafe next door more than adequate for a quick breakfast with free wifi at half the price and quieter than starbucks hotels of this standard really should have free wifi by now it is free in the reception areabar but even this wasnt working one of the two days we stayed;3
we stayed at the empire for 7 nights so got a really good feel for the hotel the location is great and the staff is friendly and helpful but as a family of 4 we would not stay here again for the following reasons superior double room is extremely small and barely walkable once your bags are in the room and we pack light we later upgraded to a junior suite which was about 50 bigger but had to deal with a pullout couch since this room has only one real bed we paid for the splash package which includes inroom wifi and continental breakfast but the wifi connectivity was very choppy and would often drop or be completely unavailable the continental breakfast was a complete waste of money the offerings were minimal and they were consistently out of food or napkins;3
my family stayed here 42817 we were checked in early and promptly and the hotel staff were polite we had a corner king with sofa sleeper huge bathroom and nice sized sitting areathe room looked great but when we opened up the sleeper sofa we noticed that the sheets were clean but quite damp upon further inspection the cusions of the sofa were very wet on the bottom side my best guess is that the previous occupant spilled something on the sofa or sat there with a wet swimsuit i called housekeeping and had them deliver up a new set of sheets there was a spare blanket in the closet which was in really terrible condition i would definitely recommend that housekeeping pay more attention to the condition of the sleeper sofas in the future it was disappointing and a;3
was only here for a night but had a generally good stay on a night where everything seemed to delay getting us to our anniversary dinner the hotel was no exception who knew that checking in at 5pm on a saturday would be so busy to the credit of the front desk we were graciously upgraded to an alcove room with a king sized bed which was very nice considering the original booking was made with 2 double beds so excellent service there it did take a little longer to get checked in as calls had to be made to the reservation center and then the hhonors center since we were using a points redemption but overall it was worth the time as the room was spacious and had a great view of the hills the hotel property itself could really go for some renovations having stayed at;3
good value for money very spacious room with 2 double and comfy beds clean size of hotel made it seem a bit impersonal and although efficient staff we encountered were not warm or friendly waiting for lifts wasnât too much of an issue for use despite being up very high i would probably stay again because of value for money but would have lower expectations of staff;3
yes the rooms are extremely small but for the price and the amazing location just one block from the highline and pleasantly placed at the edge of the village it really is a great deal i also found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful my lower rating comes from the fact that though they have a no smoking policy they are not enforcing it and not only did our room stink like a good old fashioned smoking hotel room but the hallway was constantly in a state of someone having just smoked in it even the stairway smells like smoke the smell is definitely strong enough that i sadly wont be returning for another 50 a night watching for their deals its back to the edison in times square for a much larger room a bathroom ensuite and fresh air;3
our stay did not start off well as i had booked the moderne and was moved to the empire which was 8 blocks further away from times square due to a supposed flood in the room but thats another story the carpets and furniture are dated the bathroom is minute not just small breakfast on our first morning was a shambles there were no seats and no food meanwhile there was a separate part which had only one table with guests but we were told that area was for a group and we could not sitserve ourselves from that side second morning was less busy but still breakfast was minimal;3
centrally located and a good base when visiting nyc staff were friendly and efficient security staff in the lobby which is good given the issues evident in nyc since cannabis was legalised room was sufficient badly needs an update stains on carpets and headboard bathroom door chipped quite badly paint work needs freshening up in room and throughout the hotel compared to european standards this is not a 4star hotel at best its 3 i would recommend this hotel as its centrally located and sufficient if youre not in your room all day if you want a little luxury look elsewhere;3
there were good and bad things about this hotel good things included cheap rates and close to busmetro stops these are a must if you dont want to spend tons on taxi fares in a lot of ways though it still would have been nice to have been more centrall locatedmaybe west hollywood or beverly hills the neighborhood was entirely iffydont go walking about by yourself at night but the hotel is very secure i would consider the rooms entirely average for hotel rooms i know a lot of people have been complaining on this site about them but i bet if they had looked at their room at check in and asked for something to be changed it would have been the cleaning staff was very polite and efficient so i doubt it would have been a problem noise is a problem in this;3
a friend and i stayed at the empire for 1 night if you are going to nyc to see something at lincoln center you are right across the street which is great but the room was tiny the view was of an inner courtyard with nothing but brick walls and windows of other rooms and the bed was hard as a rock it was clean the hallways were clean but i cracked up when i saw that the bathroom was tiled in pergo and the shower did not have a full door and the sink was really shallow and water splashed everywhere nyc hotel rooms can be very small and this one definitely fit that category i didnt see how this could be rated a 4 star hotel it did not strike me as luxurious as i would expect the staff were not exactly warm and fuzzy but i was only there for a night so it was no big;3
very central hotel with easy access to all the main sights however we had to pay for internet acces 12 per day the pool deck was closed all week and no free tea and coffee in the rooms however the doormen and housekeeping staff were very friendly;3
decent hotel in very good location walking distance of most of tourist spots hotel is clean and attached tick tock restaurant is reasonable value especially for breakfast the gratuies however are as in all america eye watering the waitress even had the cheek to cross our the suggested 18 yes 18 and ring the 21 she didnt get it we had a room with a view of the empire state building reasonable size and clean the main objection with this hotel was at check out when the taxes and gratuities and fee for use of amenities it matters not if you dont use them you still pay while taxes etc are beyond the control of the hotel the total cost of stay should be given at time of request make sure you get the final total and not a surprise on check out having said all;3
tiny room with shared bathroom facilities in a great part of the city the housekeeping and bell staff were excellent front desk staff not so much i stayed for 8 nights and for the cost in pricey new york this was a fine option for travelling alone my booking clearly stated that there would be a hold on credit card of 50 this was incorrect and a hold of 50 per night was applied which i thought was rather steep as there were absolutely zero incidentals in the room no mini bar for example it snowed for 4 of the 8 nights i stayed and great emphasis was put on central heating in the lobbyhallways but the room itself was far too cold i asked the front desk to turn up the heating on three occasions and then gave up instead requesting extra blankets from;3
arrived late evening for a four night stay and was told the payment was cash only was directed to the closest atm which was the station a few mins walk where wed just come from booked dbl private room w ensuite room is small but neat and looks clean own set of crockery n cutlery ontop of small fridge disapointed no kettle though bathroom v small but shower hot and soap towels supplied small cafe at reception if u want a snack or coffee pay for internet;3
a friendly staff greets you in a chic lobby next to a cool bar excellent location with great dining options nearbyhowever the room looked nice but was very worn with an uncomfortable bed room smelled so strongly of chlorine bleach it was like a swimming pool at a gym;3
the shower design is not very good extremely tight there was no second door or shower curtain to avoid water coming out the air conditioner wasnt working very well it looked like an inferno the location is very good;3
when your paying the money we have for 4 nights you expect luxury when you arrive you feel like the entrance is luxurious you get i the ornate lifts and then open your room door small is all i could say then look out of single pain windows with wind rushing through the gaps this isnt going to be a quiet hotel then into the bathroom to freshen up on what looks like he original bath and taps from when the hotel was built in the early 1900s i wish i could say it was spotless i cant the stains were everywhere so time for a shower you can have either boiling hot or freezing cold no in between if i had kids i would be taking a lawsuit our for third degree burns right now so if you like listening to hill st blues whilst trying to sleep stay here 2nd night i had;3
the good room 770 nice view corner of the building room was nice quiet clean huge bathroom this is the third time ive stayed at this hotel in the last 3 years i stay here on business because the hotel is close to my office pool is nice but gets covered in shade around dinnertime so you cant swim much after 7pm too chilly peets coffee shop on the property is nice bar is nice but out in the open lobby selfparking garage is good staff was nice walking distance to universal studios and citywalk now for my complaints the cost of food breakfast buffet was 28 ridiculous dinner was even higher it was cheaper to walk to cityview and eat there and my biggest complaint the elevators horribly slow i stood there with all the other guests;3
we arrived at 330 but no room available till at least 430 when check in states from 2pm suzie from the concierge was very helpful our room was 2939 on the 29th floor there was building work and scaffolding outside both our windows building work started around 8am every morning loud banging and noises the room was extremely small the bathroom was outdated and small the room was mostly clean the maid came in everyday and changed towels and bedding every 3 days no replenishment of toiletries was left the hairdryer broke in the room therefore i walked down to reception with wet hair after trying to ring 4 times but with no answer they apologised and said they would send another one up 60 minutes later i went back down to reception asking where my hairdryer;3
as new york hotels go this is not a bad one what you see is what you get slightly shabby but not too bad value for money where do you get that on manhattan anyway we were put off by the facilities charge that they add for internet the business center and what they call free international calls well nothing is free as you have to pay the charge whether you use the internet or not a bit sneaky rooms were ok we were given one with a view when asked for it the first was a joke but the last room had good views;3
a great locationabout 12 way between the san fernando valley and the city of la nice thoughtful staffwe were upgraded to a suite as our room was not yet ready the property itself however is showing its age it is a nice propertythat would be even nicer with a fresh new look dont let this keep you awaybut dont expect to be wowed by the look and feel when you get here;3
got a really good deal staff friendly and helpful room was bit run down and just looked shabby subway just down the block and central park is literally seconds away would not stay again as have reached the age where like things to be a bit of a higher standard but if your young and on a tight budget it would be worth a go;3
carpet and furniture are in really bad shape in the lobby and in the room our carpet in room 1034 was really dirty and stained which was really nasty the ladies at the check in counter were nice and sent someone right away to fix our broken shower head room with runway view was really nice;3
tiny tiny older room very clean comfortable bed great wifi no coffee service in the room good restaurant for breakfast right next door penn station is across the street walking distance to times square;3
dated dirty dark and dead roach shower totally open so water all over the bathroom ac didnât work no closet couple of small drawers so had to work out of the luggage on the floor better choices would be watson or the hudson near by for comparable rates would not stay here again if l can avoid it the only plus is itâs across the street from lincoln center and fordham u;3
finding a good priced hotel in new york city can be difficult at any time of year we came across this hotel as one of the better options for manhattan on a budget yes the hotel is in need of some renovations its very old in many ways and lacks the features of a fancier hotel there was an issue with the heat system however the hotel is in an excellent location you are maybe 10 minutes from central park and there is a subway line very close some excellent restaurants around the area as well the beds were comfortable the bathroom was clean and maintained by the staff everyday most of the staff is very friendly if you prefer a quieter area of new york city but still with plenty of access to the finer aspects you could do a lot worse than stay here i wont lie it;3
in town for a friends bridal shower and stayed for two nights in a king junior suite it was very spacious my friend stayed in the standard queen room and it was shockingly tiny spring for the king if you can worth it i chose this hotel because of the proximity to the wedding shower and fabulous location the positives are the location is fantastic the suites are large for nyc the concierge yuri is one of the best in the city the negatives are the animal print decor is not pleasing on the eye the furniture is well worn and has seen better days the elevators are small hot slow and old interestingly the minibar offers a sex toy option creepy placement next to goldfish and trail mix in an effort to be a sexy hotel it actually seemed a bit sleezy;3
first off we are talking of about 600nt with taxes for a king size bed that gets you the followings great location to lincoln center and subwaysnear central park im afraid thats all for the positives the negativers outway that unlike another reviewer the boiler in the hotel was working but the ancient apparatus that controls the heatac in the rooms doesnt function very well we were here in the fall when it still wasnt freezing out and it was hard to control the rooms temperaturethe elevators sound like they are ready to stop at any moment the doors creak when they close and the elevator feels like it bangs around i the shaft we stayed in this hotel last year around the same time because we run the new york city marathon and the room rates where about 100;3
my wife and i stayed here from august 4th until august 8th as part of the first leg of our honeymoon us tour the hotel itself is basic as it is an older building and when you first walk the corridors you wonder what you have let yourself in for however the room although basic was very clean and the maid service was daily and fresh towels were always left and it was very pleasant the air conditioners are old and ours was clicking so much so we had to get the maintenance man to sort it he was prompt polite and efficient and although the method he used to fix it was lets just saybizarreit still worked and we had no complaints the staff at the front desk were exceptionally helpful from day one they advises us on the best bus tour shuttle buses to the airport and how;3
location is great close to the subways and walking distance to many attractions and restaurants the rooms are a different story initially we were put in a room that was so small that there was barely enough room to walk around the bed the bathroom door could not be opened from inside unless one moved their body to the side no room to put any luggage in addition the ac didnt work thankfully we were moved because of the ac issues the new room was significantly better but on the 1st floor with a view of rusted pipes we have stayed at many hotels in manhattan this is one that we will not be returning to;3
the traffic was the worst in any other hyatt i have stayed in horrible and the food selection was bad room service ended at 10pm the hotel itself is modern and clean but they have to make it guest friendly in regards to the traffic we waited over 40 minutes for a uber due to traffic and alamo missed our flight due to traffic;3
we picked the new yorker based on the location due to the purpose of our trip businesssightseeing we arrived early around 1130 am coming from penn station check in was not an option as i had called the night prior and i was told there was a fee if a room was a available no room available we were able to do âprecheck inâ which just meant we gave them our credit card and id and phone number and they would call us when a room became available we could hold our bags there until then here comes another fee 5 per bag to hold our bags this is another first for us we have never paid to have our bags held in any hotel weâve stayed at at that point it was 12 pm and when we returned to the hotel it was around 4305 pm and it was insanity the hotel never called to let me;3
this hotel clearly tries to capitalise on the fact that it is a historic hotel it suffers however from apparent feature we stayed in the queen room and was supposedly upgraded this was misleading because nothing appeared to be different from the original room we had booked with the exception that it was on a higher floor the room was bland the room looks rundown cracked bathroom tiles decrepit curtains anticlooking furniture decor was nothing special the shower head was abysmal and was weak you could barely feel that you were showering the elevators took a substantial amount of time to arrive and they clearly have an overcrowding problem in their foyer also there is no selfservice laundry option which is surprising given the large amount of space they have for;3
if you are staying here plan on leaving at least 1520 minutes early for wherever you are going there are only 3 functional elevators also if you need the hotel to hold your baggage while you wait to checkin or before departure they charge you 5bag the checkincheckout process is very inefficient and the lines are very long with few hotel staff working the room was tiny even for nyc standards but we did get a free fridge delivered to our room upon request overall would not recommend but location was convenient;3
amazing location hotel itself not worth price the lobby area was gorgeous and very nice but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated my room had a gorgeous view but looked nothing like the rooms the hotel posts pictures of it was much more outdated the shower had dirt in between the tiles that couldve been scrubbed away and the bathroom also looks much older it wasnt super dirty or anything but definitely couldve been cleaner especially for the price the tv was older and i had issues with it being so grainy at some points not the whole time that i couldnt read the guide the diner was nice facility fees none of which i used its basically the office and gym plus wifi for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing 100 which;3
if you want to be in nyc and not waste hundreds of dollars on a place to sleep this might be a great choice for you across the street from central park close to subway stops very small but clean rooms bed only no chair or couch also has a closet and small tv wifi is an extra charge;3
the rooms were a bit tired furniturewise our room over looked the street and it was quite noisy there is an outdoor patio which is commonly shared and not private as people walking past can look over the patio there is an inside courtyard which is very quaint but could have used a bar area great pool breakfast complimentary and more than adequate easy walk to restaurants but a lot of homeless people loitering in this area next visit will stay near lax and beaches;3
gorgeous art deco style and great location i booked a room with a city view but when i arrived i was told there were none available not sure how this happened when the hotel had several weeks notice;3
i was hesitant to stay here with all of the other reviews i read but i found the hotel to be clean close to public transportation and the staff took care of us we had a deluxe room with our own bathroom while the room was small everything was functional and quiet i felt very safe in the neighborhood and would stay here again;3
first time in usa stayed in the new yorker hotel which is very central in manhattan next to madison square garden the hotel is very dated but ok for price and amenities the tick tick restaurant which is joined to hotel was very well priced and staff very helpful hope you like walking;3
when we first arrived we were informed that the room we originally booked would not be availableinstead they downgraded us to a smaller much more worn room they did take a large discount off of the bill which we appreciatedwe werent going to spend a ton of time in our room so it didnt seem like a big deal however the room they gave us was not in good shape at allthe beds were incredibly small and uncomfortable the dipped to the center clearly far too worn out to be of any good use for sleeping the furniture was very old and outdated had terrible lighting and one of my biggest pet peevesno extra outlets we live in the 21st centurylets provide those outlets for paying customers so they can charge those electronic devices once in the room;3
i stayed here for 10 days the location of this hostel is good about 3 minutes from hammersmith station the facilities are adequate nothing spectacular there are a few shared kitchens on each floor they are spartan with a microwave kettle and oven but no kitchenware or anything else provided apart from detergent the rooms have a fridge and i stayed in a private room which had two single beds the unisex showers are bordering on uncomfortable they are cubicles with very large gaps underneath the stalls and lots of half dressed leering old men in and out one morning someone male was on his hands and knees in the stall next to mine didnt see his face but was not sure what he was up to would have been easy to get an eyeful under the partition even brushing my;3
ok so itâs rated 4 stars on various websites this is not a 4 star hotel at best it would scrape 3 stars our room on the 7floor was tiny ok i know nyc hotels rooms are small but this took the biscuit the ac was so noisy we couldnât sleep and the engineer whilst friendly couldnât fix it the lobby bar is freezing cold you may as well be upstairs on the roof bar which to be fair is quite cool although pimped our for corporate affairs and a distinct smell of weed coming from the outside space location is ok but wouldnât rush back to this place itâs trying too hard and failing;3
we was here for two day the hotel is nice but it is to expensive when you think about what you get for the money the only thing you get is location it was also disapointet that the pool on the toopfloor was closed we dident get any information about this;3
i stayed in one of the single cabins and while this was perfect for what i needed great value great location and awesome service its still important to note that this is a budget option funky quirky and full of charm but budget nonetheless imagine a private dormroom in a hostel that is your cabin it was small but adequate not the most modern in the world but not dirty like some reviews suggest the aircon was rather noisy which was a little annoying as i needed it to sleep and the hallway had people coming and going but that could happen anywhere and it was a friday and saturday night the staff were ridiculously helpful at all times which was great the location on a cobbled street overlooking the hudson is really beautiful and its really close to great;3
we booked superior room and requested higher floorwe were given afirst floor room which was certainly not superior in any waythe window facehotel with machinery outside making the loudest noise imaginableon opening the door to the room my wife backed in pulling her suitcaseshe stepped backwards into a large bottom drawer that was stuck all the way out because the drawers were unevenshe obviously yelped in pain as it did hurt her calfa huge bruise appeared on her leg but she only noticed it after we had left the hotel to travel on to las vegaspity she didnt notice it before we left the empirewe were given another room on a higher floor but we we werent impressed with the service from front deskwe were told that the 1st floor room was all they had but they magically;3
i stayed at the empire hotel of gossip girl fame for 4 nights in dec 2011 the room was small and not too fancy the hotel was located in the upper west side so it was quite far away from the more tourist areas in mid town manhattan there were plenty of amenities and shops around starbucks duane reade atms all within 2 mins walk from the lobby and the columbus circle metro station was about 5 mins walk away we had christmas eve dinner at the hotels restaurant eds chowder house and it was quite good overall the hotel is a bit pricey for what you get and totally not what i expected for a 4 star hotel;3
i went on my aniversary last novembet 15th i checked in the jane cause i was staying for 8 nights and the other hotels are very expensive i read a lot of bad things of the jane but really it is a great place to sleep is really clean the share bathrooms are very clean the staff is really freindly the room are really really small but if you are looking for a place to sleep it is a great place to stay my wife and i were looking to get a place to sleep so the jane it is a great one plus is about 10 min walking to the 8 ave and 14th st subway station the neighborhood is pretty safe between the meetpacking district and greenwich village chelsea is really near and you can get everywhere by subway;3
pros right next to universal so it was easy to walk and be there before the park opened a shuttle runs every 15 minutes and was reliable although it didnât start until when the park opens so you have to walk if you want to be early shuttle runs until 10 which allows you to eat at citywalk easily rooms were clean and comfortable pool is open late which is nice after a day at the park cons everything to eat is extremely overpriced the shop is not affiliated with the hotel so you canât charge items to the room hot tub was too cold probably would stay again if i was going to the park but might try the sheraton which shares the shuttle;3
make sure the valet does not precharge you for the stay as you have the option for selfparking on a second lot not owned by hyattvalet precharged me for 3 nights without my approval or knowledge;3
i recently spent one night at this hotel while attending universal studios i chose this hotel strictly for its proximity to the theme park even though the hotel was close to the park it was not convenient since it is located right next to the park i would assume there would be a walkway or path that you could follow unfortunately there isnt i asked one of the staff members about getting to the park and she told me to go to the end of the ballrooms and the park is across the street as we walked towards the ballrooms it was very clear they had events happening in these ballrooms and the foyers had catered food and a lot of dressed up people needless to say since we were in our theme park attire we stood out like a sore thumb and after getting a few looks from people;3
i stayed at morningside inn during christmas time of course the rates are higher in this season but the manager patrick was kind enough to make some arrangements for me to stay in a room with a bathroom for a slightly lower cost since i was travelling with my underage niece he is a very nice person denise the nightshift receptionist is also nice friendly and polite very different from one of the morningshift receptionists the brunette one who is extremelly unfriendly and impolite the cleaning girls are also nice the hotel is average bad points internet access only at the lobby which gets pretty crowded when many guests want to go online no breakfast but it seems theyre starting having it soon the heating system is not very efficient the stove in the;3
a hotel that is across the street from central park a good value in new york city the people that work there are friendly and nice it reminds of a european hotel small elevators and rooms needed help to know how to get the shower head to work the room only has about 10 tv channels the reception isnt good only 1 key for the room they allowed us to check in early very good with answering our questions not a hotel that i am used too if you want a good value in central park it is a good place to stay;3
we love this hotel but on this stay the ac was not working as well as we would had liked we are from louisiana so we are used to hot weather however the inside of the building needs to be cooler in hallways and elevators the room acs need to be able to be adjustted to a cooler setting when the unit would kick off it was very warm and we had trouble sleeping a couple of the nights we do love this hotel and would like to stay again i wont come in july next time;3
when arriving to morningside inn i was greeted by a lovely young lady by the name of margarita she was very professional kind and helpful she even gave a us a list of great hang out dining spots in the area and gave us directions around town that alone assured me that my stay here would be great you really get what you pay for i only stood for 5 nights but i wouldve definately stayed longer the air conditioned rooms are comfortable clean and spacious coming to new york you usually worry about how expensive and how rude people can be but here i got great prices and service now thats a bang for your buck;3
we stayed here at the beginning of december it is a great location being within walking distance to the majority of attractions in nyc in my opinion the decor is very dated i felt like i was in the 1930s what i imagined it to be like the beds were small also id say the same size as a uk small double my wife and i arent huge and we had just about enough room i can imagine larger couples would struggle and would actually need to the two doubles in the room the rooms wasnt too much of an issue as we were out all day being a city hotel it is very noisy at night with the passing traffic but this is accepted the hotel is clean cant grumble at that the tick tock diner was fantastic separate review to follow would i stay here again possibly;3
there are some good and bad points to this hotel but overall i probably expected it to be better we arrived just before check in time and being tired after a long flight we were more than ready to get into our room we were told it would be 30 minutes then after that another 10 minutes then another 5 we got our room at about 4pm and in the end it wasnt the room they mentioned as that still wasnt ready the staff on the desk seemed to be very busy and 2 were dealing with complaints while i was waiting because of our wait they did give me complimentary wifi not sure if the room we should have had would have been better but the one got was very small coffee machine but never use it as it was 3 a small cup so the starbucks next door was a better option one;3
my friend and i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights recently metro view double room â£159 gbp per night please note there is a 2722 usd per room per night nonoptional resort fee payable upon checkin even if you do not plan to use the other facilities breakfast can be added on for 28 usd per person per night but we found that the 247 tick tock dinner in the hotel only ever came to a maximum of 1518 usd per person not including tip we loved their chocolate chip pancakes the room was very very small barely could accommodate the twin beds with enough room to walk around them without doing yourself an injury the bathroom was even smaller but it had the basics you might need however after the 1st day and our use of the provided toiletries they were never;3
overall hotel is clean and tidy breakfast was good metro is close by so transport is also okay if it was not for michael at the front desk being a great help i would rate this hotel 1 star roman who also works at the front desk would be the rudest most arrogant person i have ever met in a customer service orientated job other staff were also short and rude when questions were asked area is okay but would not walk alone at night;3
stayed here as part of a sports package for the new york marathon stayed in a room with a fellow runner who i had not met before as such the room wasnât designed the best with not much space and no lock on the bathroom door etc not the greatest idea for 2 strangers as such luckily we got on well the hotel is nice and it is grand but itâs a little outdated in terms of decor the tick tock restaurant which is attached was where i had breakfast on marathon morning as this was allocated by the sports company very bad service in here rude waiters and we had to request to be served at least 3 times before it happened good location of the hotel though very central and can walk to most things or get the doorman to get you a cab amazing views though from my window;3
arrived at the hotel around 7 pm on the 20th of november staff very pleasant and check in was quick and hassle free room was clean and tidy a little small but we didnt mind as it was only a base for our trip of our 4 days staying here we had no complaintswe checked out on thursday which was thanksgiving as everywhere was so busy that day we were rushing gathering up our things and i left 3 very sentimental brackets behind of no value to anyone else a half hour after leaving the hotel i sent an email and phoned the hotel and explained exactly where they were as i knew where i had left them two days later i received an email saying they were not there to say i was very disappointed is an understatement and it will definitely put me off or recommending this hotel to;3
ok had no clue here and the hotel is not willing to do anything about this ridiculous cost my truck was slightly taller than the allotted height for parking so it has to be valet parked for 44 dollars a day and the gal at the front desk said there is nothing they can do i really find this to be appaling and had no clue my truck would not fit it fits in all other parking garages cmon hilton really were even honor members its the little things that matter here do be such penny pinchers;3
we stayed at this hotel on the night of september 5 a monday it is in a fantastic location to walk to universal studios thats about the biggest positive the hotel has to offer while the room was spacious the carpet really needed some attention and the room smelled very musty parking is outrageous at 28 per day that being said we were able to leave our car parked at the hotel until 6 pm on the day we checked out for that rate this allowed us to walk to and avoid paying parking fees at universal studios i guess they are going to get you for parking one way or the other the onsite restaurants are ridiculously expensive didnt even consider eating there when citywalk is so close and offers many wonderful much more reasonable dining options fortunately we;3
we spent 3 nights at this hotel earlier this year during our honeymoon in the states after having spent 4 nights at the mondrian soho we were really disappointed with the empire the staff seemed rushed off their feet and werent that friendly and room cleaning wasnt up to much either during our stay the shampoo and shower gel werent replaced and the airconditioning was unbearably loudthankfully it wasnt too hot so we managed to sleep without it on the hotel was in need of a refurbishment there was peeling wallpaper in the hallways and things just looked a bit rundown and the rooms were actually quite ugly all brown leopardy carpets etc it was a real let down after our wonderful stay at the mondrian soho this hotel is definitely not worth the money;3
i stayed there for the second time and just came home the room is so small especially the bathroom there was a major construction going right outside that the blaring noise of a jackhammer woke me up at 720 this is not something this hotel could do about this they didnt provide me a washcloth until the 3rd day the pool was closed again the door of the next room 530 or 528 kept making a squeaking noise which was annoying the water temperature for the shower was lukewarm in the morning although it was hot enough at night but the location is the best especially for someone like me who loves upper west side and east away from the tourists and the towels are decent the staff is courteous price is right so i know i will go back there after all;3
somehow the lack of smiles followed us from the first second all staff expect 1520 tip but they seem not to want to give anything more than absolute minimum checking in i felt they put us in the segment of guests that will never tip so they need not be friendly and honestly i do not tip such manners;3
if youre like me when you travel to a city to be a tourist you are not spending the majority of your time in your hotel room my best friend and i go to nyc at least once or twice a year i have inlaws in bronx queens and we like to go to tour the city soak up the scene and spend our days enjoying the city touring nyc can be expensive so we dont want to spend all of our money in the hotel room that were just using to sleep shower and store our bags while we explore however you also need to be very careful when trying to find a cheap hotel in nyc bc a lot of the time you are getting exactly what you pay for dirty bedbugs cockroaches moldy rooms with no security days hotel at broadway was perfect for what we were looking for we got a reasonable price;3
good for a conference lots of space you have to walk at least a mile for any restaurants that arent in the tourist trap of universal city would be a great spot to stay if uc was your main destination;3
if you want to be very close to all things central then this is a good place to stay great location very close to times square the empire state building and the shops also very close to the subway to get around further a field this is however the only plus you need to be out most the time as the hotel is very dated and the rooms need a big face lift wall paper coming away from the walls and the bathroom is just big enough to swing a cat no drink facilities in the room which even the basic hotels have in these days overall its an average hotel with a great location;3
i have just got back from a break at the riad kheirredinethe riad has been described many times very highly rated in trip advisor so my overall feelings were disappointing the staff were great but it seemed more chiefâs not enough indiansthe abundant fruit was topped up often but bruised or bad fruit left underneathwe would be asked how was everything asked if we wanted anything time time again only for nothing too arrive or delivered the evening menu wasnât up to the standard that a top draw riad should be delivering free laundry is a bonus maybe i stayed on a week that was a hiccup but that shouldnât happen;3
the jane is great in many ways its characterful in a great location and the staff are friendly the room really is tiny think the size of a double bed but the hotel is very clear about it in advance and theres plenty of space for storage so i dont think thats a negative but the hotel does have some problems the ac is very loud very difficult to control and not very effective in a tiny room it really makes a racket and is behind this wooden drill so the remote doesnt really work and you cant see what its set to when you leave the room you cant leave it running so you have to have it on when youre in there im a deep sleeper but it got on my nerves badly the walls and doors are thin you hear plenty from next door the bathrooms are nice and;3
i would say this hotel is fine if you get a reasonable rate if i recall the rate on their website was not great if id paid full price i would have been disappointed the area is convenient while i thought it was quite poorsketchy when i arrived it seems thats pretty well the outward appearance of most places in lahollywood and after getting used to that felt comfortable in the neighborhood the housekeeping was poor and i dont think i have ever said that my issue wasnt with the cleanliness but with the replacement or lack thereof of towels and other basic items there were many little things that added up for me but one bar of soap there was no body wash so this was both for showering and hand washing was provided to me for my 4 night stay i have no;3
family of four stayed for 3 weekday nights this august room on 18th floor had a great view however the carpet was very stained and dirty whole room needs an update bathroom was very roomy we had access to the executive lounge also needs an update do not waste your money on the upgrade cold cereal and sweet rolls for breakfast and 2 hot snacks at night with cheese and fruit for the extra 3040 per night you can get a real breakfast also the lounge was so packed while we were there we had to stand and eat the hotel is very convenient to universal studios and city walk they have a shuttle they share with the sheraton that comes every 1015 minutes next time i would stay at the sheraton which was just updated;3
first to be clear i am a fan of the empire hotel and this was a return stay i plan to return in the future too but i do want to mention several challenges this stay i made a reservation for the empire through bookingcom for 4 adults in a 2 bed room back in september i called a few days prior to the stay and spoke specifically to the front desk i confirmed that two members of my party would be arriving ahead of me i wanted to confirm we would be able to split the amount owed as listed on my bookingcom reservation she said that would be fine that 150 would be put on hold then everyone could settle up at the end of our stay my fellow traveler was told that she would have to put the entire amount on her card at checkin she said she spoke to three different;3
friendly staff problems with check in no reservation in system problem with length of stay but staff made things ok really helpful at sorting things out room hade funny smell and some mold in shower;3
at first glance the place looks very impressive with its beautiful artdeco designed lobby however it goes a bit downhill from there the room was clean and big enough with comfortable beds however there was no minibar or fridge either of which would be considered a basic amenity in hotel rooms around the world there was only one small window in the corner of the room which meant that there was little natural light although we had a great view of the empire state building the room was unfortunately not soundproofed and we were awoken early every morning by the cleaners and other guests talking very loudly in the corridor the corridors are very dark and dank they look like they havent been changed since the hotel first opened its doors they really need to;3
lived in a double room with simple furniture a frig wardrobe and a chair two set of platecupforksspoons in the room which is convenient for traveler several kitchens can be used however no kitchen equipment to cook but you can use oven and microwave just 2 minutes from hammersmith underground easily to go to city linedistrict linepiccadilly line a great location your travel is near airport earls courts and paddington its a great value in terms of pricelocation in london although too simple shared bathtoilet;3
fun experience and location but they charge for every little thing including inroom coffee roof top bar was great this is a great location to pivot from and is the classic new york experience fun;3
conveniently located only 150m from a subway and a short walk from central park we stayed for four nights with my family although mid afternoon our room was not available and were invited wait with still no news after one hour we left our luggage in one of the two other rooms of members of our party and notified reception staff who told us they would call us on my wifes mobile the call never came but a room was assigned early evening on our return to the hotel the rooms are well appointed albeit small but thats par for the course in nyc the concierge chris is a really helpful guy but from bellboy to reception to bar staff no one appears interested and all have an attitude and a bad one to boot the roof pool and terrace is pleasant for a relaxing drink;3
you can feel the glory of the past but the present condition is less impressive the rooms look old the view from the top floors is great and the location is very central and close to everything;3
this is a great place to stay if you want to be near central park as well as near subway stations without breaking the bank room was comfortable with a nice bathroom which included toiletries with my favorite lavendar scent a couple of cafes were within walking distance so thats another plus id stay there again because i like to get a bargain whenever possible;3
the wilde hotel in ballybunnion is a small hotel facing the beachit has been recently refurbished and it is a lovely and well designed hotelthe staff were very friendly and courteousparking is limited and a one way system is in placebedroom was small but comfortable and the breakfast was top classbar small but adequateideal for a summer break;3
im a current guest the stay was going great until today so upset i think there car service or at least the driver we had today needs to listen to his customers he insisted on dropping us at the wrong location after i and the person with me told him over and over no not this location however he wouldnt listen to us so this caused us to miss out on the filming off a program at warner bros studio very upset also way over priced ive also found some employees a little dismissive lets hope my last day here doesnt let me down;3
we stayed at the hilton so we could go to universal studios they make is difficult to check in early even when requested in advance and are lacking in letting you know there will be a fee the hotel is also going through some renovations so expect some issues the air in our room did not work and we had to have an engineer come to fix the problem the room was so hot it was uninhabitable for the majority of the day the folks working the check in desk seemed irritated the day we checked in this hotel is right next to the park but next time we will stay at the sheraton again where there are no issues with early check in and the rooms and hotel are just as nice its just a few steps further to get to the park or city walk and they offer much more hospitable service;3
if youre a single person who wont be in the room much and youre a heavy sleeper then this hotel is for you its clean the rooms are tiny and the staff was very nice however the walls seemed paper thin and you could hear every bump creak and step on the entire floor;3
i wanted somewhere to stay in manhattan that was cheap but close to everything this place is perfect for that its not a hiltonbut the room felt as cozy as any other hotel the building is old and seems to be mostly all original so it looks a lil rundownbut personally i like the old rustic lookfeel the room was clean and the sheets smelled and felt fresh the room had a bed fridge sink table bed and tvbathrooms are shared with others on the floor but you use it privately meaning not a locker room bathroom the location is awesome 2 blocks from subway station few blocks from central park quiet and nice neighborhood if youre travelling to nyc to be out of your room for most of your stay then this place is great if youre looking for a;3
if you have low expectations in the dorm apt furniture iron but no ironing board flat screen tv but no remote heater but it dont work toilet paper but only a half roll a 2 burner stove and only 1 of the 2 burners worksif this doesnt bother you youll be fine the location cant be beatlots of great restaurants and shops around metro a block awayand its cheap try it once then treat yourself to a nicer place the next time;3
first of all the hotel is in a great location for all site seeing activities a big bus tour stop is right outside which is great had to wait longer on our room which was abit of a pain but as a result we were upgraded we stayed in an unrefurbished room which was still great and very spacious wifi in the lobby and in rooms safe and hairdryer provided only complaint is the way we were treated by security staff one night both our key cards stopped working and we could not access the room it was about 8pm and we had brought back food which was already cold and we were hungry seeing as we were on the 23rd floor we decided to just sit outside the room and eat it and then go to reception to get everything sorted this decision was made because it was a burger and therefore;3
it was a bad start i booked a one bedroom suite and it was still occupied and no fixed time when the room could be ready i had to downgrade and that was a painful process the club lounge disappointing you need to pay for the drinks not sure if this is a american lounge concept bed was comfortable and room was ok the gym was good and the bar staff were fantastic think if you donât have an early flight would recommend to stay in la the 3 was mainly due to the check in experience;3
had a 5 night stay in this upper west side hotel 100 yards from the lincoln center the prices in the surrounding restaurants were to be expected however the hotel location is terrific central park in 5 minutes the aforementioned lincoln center in one columbus circle is 5 minutes away with its subway connections and high end shopping you cant go wrong the rooms were typical manhattan quite compact and ours had a view of some air conditioners but this isnt a bad thing compared to noisy streets well equipped lovely rooftop terrace and plunge pool we only tried the attached chowder house for breakfast and it was fine and the pj clarkes downstairs was good for burgers etc but again unsurprisingly expensive there is a starbucks of course in the same block as;3
me and my boyfiend had decided to go to new york city for his 21st birthday from march 11th14th 2005 we had it all booked up and was really excited to gountil i read really bad reviews i was absolutely dreading it especially the cockroaches as soon as we got there the reception staff and the area were friendly and clean so i had sort of calmed down i was worried about getting in the lift because of what people had said we were only on the second floor so we didnt have to be in it that long but it didnt sound too good so from then on we always took the stairs when we had finally reached the room the first thing i did was checked the room from top to bottom i checked everything the bed in it all around it under it bathroom the shower toilet it was;3
basic hotel no catering on site but diners on street for breakfast clean air con room with impecvable bed and bathroom linen and towels etc hot water hard to find first morning but ok after quiet surroundings subway 100yds away mainline 1 for straight run down to broadway and battery park 2 blocks to central park and pleasant walk to midtown purpose served pleasant staff at reception and service;3
location is superb really do feel in the thick of it on top of madison square garden very close to the empire state and a short walk to times square it has a lot of history the new yorker which is a pro and a con the pro is that you do feel like you are staying in a classic new york hotel the only problem is you are used to a modern world the hotel needs modernizing lifts certain decor and the breakfast restaurantcafe the best part of the hotel is the upmarket restaurant in the basement of the hotel which is a converted bank vault lovely food and great service the worst part was the receptioncheck in and out slow slow very slow the people behind the desk seemed as if the computers were a new development which of course for america this is especially not;3
the hotel is located on a busy blvd approx 510minutes walking from vermontsunset metro station some of the rooms appeared rather old others have been renovated we were a group of 7 people who booked the same room category but some were given renovated rooms others had to get away with old rooms the rooms in general were ok spacious with teacoffeemaking facilities a safe and a small fridge the bathroom was pretty dirty when we checked in and also was not taken great care of by the cleaning staff the hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 63011am the breakfast is ok from pancakes omelettes to hamcheese fruit and cereal all the basics were offered we did not make use of the pool but when parking at the hotels parking lot we realised the pool was right;3
its basically in central park and pretty close to the subway should you feel game enough keep hand sanitizer handy no park views small room friendly staff no free wifi you have to pay 10 and its mediocre at best the worst part is a lack of a fridge in the room would have been great to keep some water bottles etc cool does everything a basic hotel needs to not like youre going to be spending your whole holiday in the room anyway;3
ok the jane hotel is for many aspects a little gem gorgeous lobby bar with young skinny upper class girls and boys who have fun until 4 am well dressed and very good looking but they are accompanied by drivers in rolls royce and even dont look at you too rich for the hotel customers they make you understand they have nothing to share with you the rooms are provided with some comfortable facilities such as safe hooks tv i was at the fifth floor no noise nor from the large street beneath river hudson nor from the bar at the ground floor rooms are tidy with the bed done every day and towels changed every day toilets and showers always clean and not busy staff was enormously nice and helpful the must are location in meatpacking the coolest quarter of nyc full as;3
we had 2 nights stay at this hostel at the moment we checked in the staff told me that we never had a booking with them although i showed us us booking slip they said they did not received my deposit i ended up with paying again deposit and 2 nights stay the room was acceptable with double story bed and shared toilet there is a sink in the room and every time you want to go to the toilet you need to bring your own tissues which are provided in the room the location is near the hammersmith tube station;3
this is an old hotel that is doing its best to keep up with the changing times there are some issues with upgrading the wifi but for the most part it was a minor inconvenience we had no long waits for the elevators the rooms were a good size for new york standards clean and comfortable with very reasonable rates and the staff were responsive to our needs the location is so handy to all forms of transportation good cafes restaurants and markets as well as to tourist attractions we would stay here again;3
clean nice kingsize beds lovely roofterras and situated in a beautiful safe surrunding close to everything no closet for your clothes had to stay in the suitcase the whole week not isolated you heard the street the guests next to you and in the hall;3
we selected this hotel because they offered free shuttle to universal studios the price compared to other hotels around was higher and they charge additionally 20 self parking or 25 valet parking per day as hilton honors member they offered 55 ticket at the checkin when booked online when we checked in there were no tickets available for this price and of course they offered a ticket at their hotel which was fine because it was the same price maybe a trick to sell more at their hotel we were four people in one room so i had preordered extra set of towels online a free service offered to hilton honors disappointed that it was not there had to call front desk 2 times and wait for about 30 min until they finally brought us extra towels the room was nice with a;3
when first arrived was booked into room 701 take note of this number which was located next to the elevator you can see where this is going cant you the elevator made a loud scraping noise every time it passed the room result not much sleep however the staff at the front deck couldnt have been nicer in the morning and changed our room for us we ended up with a bigger room with a better view all in all the staff were really helpfull and the location a few steps from broadway was ideal it was two minutes walking from central park and ten minutes from times square a lot of the big attractions were within walking distance the docor was very dark and not to our taste but thats a small issue wed be happy to stay there again;3
location was good as next to subway i booked and paid thru priceline and was surprised by the facility fee i was asked to pay at checkout price paid was thru bidding so it didnt give me a choice to reject the purchase if i had noticed the details did mention there may be additional charges from the hotel when checking in the front desk said that it was a big room but it was one of the smallest hotel rooms ive ever been in;3
i would have given this place four stars but for disappointing and frankly incorrect advice regarding a taxi booked by reception which in any event failed to turn up be aware that contrary to their advice it is now fixed fare in a yellow cab for the return journey to jfk as well as the inbound journey this place is fine for a solo traveller and i would probably choose to stay there again on my own i definitely would not stay there if travelling with my wife the compact room was fine for me and the communal bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean be sure to seek out the eccentric bar on the ground floor if you ask politely they do allow photographs the environs are great up and coming might be how they would be described reminds me of say shoreditch in london i;3
room is nice in that itâs big and comfortable the shower was great big issue was the internet didnât work in the room and i was told it probably just didnât reach my room specifically couldnât get any work done in there also there was a dead bug in the coffee filter so that was gross rest of the room seemed really clean though iâd give it another go;3
we stayed here in january and the hotel is in a fabulous location the rooms are small which is what you expect in a large city however the hotels is looking a little tired the rooms need to be redecorated along with the corridors the plumbing is noisy and you can here when the people in the next room have a shower or use the bathroom the rooms are spotlessly clean but we bad to ask for a coffee maker my biggest gripe was the facility charge that you have to pay on top of the room charge a which was 3157 per night this is for the gym wi fi and phone calls this was on top of a refundable deposit of 45 per night the other charges that you have to pay is if you check out and want to leave your luggage you are charged 200 per case would i stay here again no;3
beautiful classic hotel in a great location with great customer service it was worth every penny we paid 200 with a great kayak deal we even were allowed to check in early and were upgraded the room needed some updates but the location and service made up for the lackluster interior of the room;3
the staff was amazing both housekeeping front desk security was great rooms need an upgrade the bathroom is very small old iâm not a fan of showertubs i prefer walk in showers the curtains tend to stick to skin ac kept shutting off didnât seem to be the desired temperature i was aiming for tv also kept losing connection several times the floor carpet seemed worn old the beds were very comfortable with clean linen;3
upon arrival we did not receive a warm a welcome we stayed for 7 nights and never felt welcome the only people who actually said hi were the cleaners in the morning but it seemed to be a running theme in the city that everyone was extremely rude check in and check out the staff were unfriendly and i felt like i was bothering them by asking checking in tick tock diner served good food with a few friendly staff room and bathroom were small but adequate for what we needed facility fee is a joke why not charge for use of the gym office rather than charge everyone whether they use or not everything seemed like it was in need of a good refurb location brilliant;3
hotel was a decent choice location is excellent and close to penn station price was low and room was as you would expect for that not the cleanest and not the best but fine for the cost staff was not as friendly as you would expect;3
itâs a basic tidy hotel nice lobby decent bar missing coffee stand in the morning but starbucks next door rooms ok but the bathrooms are very pokey the shower needs fiddling with these are things that they should keep on top of staff are good always helpful location is very good next to the lincoln center and next to the one train subway central park is 2mins and cool to walk around;3
the hotel prides itself on its history it could use some updating from that history for examples the bathroom tubshower has 4 knobs for water not convenient also a major shortage of electric plugs;3
it is the second time we come back to the jane and we love it even if the music of the bar does wake us up at night during the week ends the atmosphere is bohemian the look superb and the service excellent we choose a captains room a great choice great dining room with a retro look and a superb bar we come back the first week of february that tells it all thank you;3
the hotel was fine as was the room except for the lack of security on the adjoining door which was remedied by housekeeping and engineering but the wifi didnt work during my entire stay which made working extremely difficult also i stayed on the second floor and the noise from next door the hall the street and something clanging outside the window made it one of the noisiest hotels ive ever stayed at in nyc;3
third time staying here the first two times were better though this one was not badjust very average rooms are on the small side bed linens were lacking imo no top sheet just a duvet cover and no real mattress pad no extra blankets either so it was a little cold overnight the windows leak lots of cold air so glad that there were insulated window treatments to cover them the room did not seem vacuumed when we arrived overall not a terrible stay just average glad that i found a discounted rate would not have been pleased at full price;3
my partner and myself arrived on the 11th of december 2015 after a long day of travelling we arrived at the hotel only to find that the hotel had no record of our reservation after presenting the receptionist with an itinerary and proof of booking she was helpful and put us in an empty room over night the next morning we returned to the reception desk and the matter has been resolved overnight the booking had been placed with a spelling mistake by the travel agents we were moved to another room on the 6th floor immediately the rooms are very clean yet basic personally id say its ideal for a cheap city break as long as youre not expecting anything special it had all we needed and did the job as we were out the whole day the shared bathrooms were clean but;3
you cant get any closer to lincoln center than the empire hotel but what you gain in convenience is lost in the touches that make a hotel exceptional the corner suite although it has a view of the lincoln center campus and fordham is cramped and dark the few light fixtures give off dim light and the windows arent very large so you wont get ample daylight to compensate the bathroom is minuscule barely enough room to turn around the sink is only about 4 inches deep and there in no door on the shower of course the water spills onto the bathroom floor the bed has a hard mattress with a relatively thin pillow top the climate control only emits one temp and the air is extremely dry mini bar items were never replenished pluses very clean very quiet and the very;3
if you visit the universal studios this hotel is right where you want to be a free shuttle takes you there in less than 5 minutes rooms are excellent large and with very comfortable beds views from the room were outstanding reception staff are quite friendly one strange thing that caught my eye when i checked in was that there were two hotel staff managing the elevators i thought that it was a traditional thing but not elevators have all sort of problems they delay an eternity when i finally boarded one it was empty and it stopped in every single floor from the 12th without anyone getting into it haunted then i could t board one or two that were full all of that in one day the other downside was the concierge the poor young lady really doesnt like;3
the lobby and room were nice with the exception of the bathroom which was extremely dated there was a very loud fight going on in our hallway and i called the front desk a few times because i was worried someone would be seriously injured i really dont think they sent anyone or were worried as the fight kept going long after the initial phone call also the hallway smelled like weed overall though it was worth the price for a downtown new york city hotel;3
my wife and i stayed here in august of 2013 as part of a wedding party first impression of the hotel as you walk in is that itâs a nice place with a good atmosphere even if the reception and bar area are a little dark â¦ well quite dark actually â¦ although in fitting with the dã©cor and atmosphere the staff seemed attentive and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for our wedding party our room was basic although comfortable the only downsides were that there was no wardrobe in the room only a small clothes rail and a few coat pegs on the wall the view from the window overlooked the internal aspect of the hotel so not the best either one other thing worthy of note do not eat drink any of the complimentary items in the room as they are extortionately priced;3
the hotel was very posh but the room we had stay in was incredibly small it reminded me of a dorm room there was no ice machine on our floor the room came with a mini fridge but it was stocked and did us no good for the price we paid it was good and convenient for what we were wanting to see in nyc its right near the lincoln center the staff were pleasant and the room was clean;3
the location is great staff were friendly but the hotel itself was unimpressive i found the decor dark and dreary and the rooms were very depressing i was appalled that the beds were not made properly for a hotelnot a mattress cover and one flat sheet used covering the mattressfirst time i ever saw that done we complained and they sent up 2 sheets for the 2 double beds and we fixed them ourselvesweird it turned out that there were no more problems than that but thought the bed making improper i like to feel that hotels take extra precautions such as mattress covers and proper sheets from one guest to the next one and only time we stayed there still surprises me that this hotel gets a 4 star ratingmust be the nightclub;3
i had stayed only for one day at the new yorker hotel and my experience was great it was a twin bed room waking up to the most beautiful view of new york city picture attached let me rewind back a little bit though on booking sites the initial price was 200 with taxes etc it came to 270 at checkin i was forced to pay an additional 31 per day for premium wifi mandatory payment i was just not happy that i got surprised with these fees at check in and that was the only thing that ruined it for me over all stay was good the hotel rooms cleanliness would score 610;3
we stayed here while in the city for a coffee show the rooms are very very small but clean which seems to be the norm in ny the bathrooms are beyond tiny and it only took us 3 days to figure out how to temper the shower and not get scalded and good luck finding an outlet to charge anything they are few and far between you can tell there is history in this hotel though our room had a lock on the inside of a closet door instead of the outside and our friends down the hall had 2 bathrooms it was definitely a unique experience i would stay here again but definitely going to ask for a corner room they are twice as big;3
we arrived to friendly quick service after our 28 hrs of travel from australia no lift but thats ok room is very small but very clean shower had hot water and it was a good shower after 28 hrs the normal new york noise could be heard from outside the room need a shelve below the mirror somewhere to put toiletries if your staying for short period id stay hear again;3
located on central park west up at the top of the park between 106 and 107th streets the astor hotel is a wonderful little quirky gem of a hotel with 112 small rooms it is an older property with very few amenities there is no restaurant bar or gym the rooms have no desk or chair no safe coffee maker nor shelf or drawer space just a flip open suitcase stand and an armoire cabinet with hanging space and a half a dozen hangers with a single cubby on top but the bed was very comfortable the shower had consistently controllable hot water the room was very clean and my 7th floor room had a great view of central park there was an ice bucket with ice available from the desk clerk in the lobby the tv was a small flat screen mounted on the wall at the foot of;3
very expensive hotel given our room smelt of stale smoke 400 for the night so it was our most expensive hotel during our 3 week stay in the usa the staff for helpful enough so no complaints there just couldnt believe the price for an extremely basic room that stank;3
arrived after a horrendous experience with immigration at jfk 4 hours in a queue to get throughhad room on the 19th floor looking down to 35th street room very small expected for ny and very datedbathroom also tiredno storagetoilet flush very loudtalking about noise it honestly sounded like the window was open the amount of outside noise you got in the room from car horns and sirensone last gripe was the bag storagewe had a late flight and had to store our bagswere charged 5 a bagi have never been charged at a hotel before and we travel regularlya final insult on the plus side and why it got a 3location good next to penn station hudson yard and time square a short walkstaff nice and maid did a good job on last observation on new york as a whole was the;3
the pros the location can not be matched it was just the best spot for access to everything the subway empire state building times square the vessel macys it is a phenomenal spot and made the trip commutes around ny very easy the staff were friendly and courteous the lobby is lovely the cons the rooms are dated and decaying our first room wasnt even cleaned properly when we went in and much smaller than the advertised pictures we got moved to another room easily and that room was ok but barely we got to see next doors room and that was a little better so its random how the rooms are allocated and some are better than others nothing really inclusive like other hotels no mini bar the service was also slow took 3 or 4 separate calls for;3
we booked our room because if the excellent reviews on trip advisor but the experience did not match the 5 star reviews that s many people left this hotel is 3 stars maximum and one of the stars are for value but the truth is i would pay more in the future than stay here another time the room as others mentioned was tiny there is no closet and room for only one side table with a light which might not be the end of the world but when only one of you is ready to go to bed and itâs the person w the light itâs not ideal the drab brown colors in the room felt depressing and our view consisted of looking at another building also depressing though we didnât hear city noise since we didnât face the city we did hear the sound of an air shaft unfortunately the guests before;3
so really excited to stay here as great location and as a gg fan did want to relive the memories of chuck and blair value for money fair i expected to pay more due to location in new york and was happy for the value check in was flawless great welcome email reconfirming check in time and asking if we needed an earlier check in as an option which was a nice touch door men spot on very friendly welcoming and informative lobby breathtaking this is when you see the class of the empire good vibe very clean and great bar rooms clean and have what you need but on the small side for the price very poor air con incame from a budget hotel into this and the budget had excellent air con empire can afford it and they need an upgrade this is the reason for my average score as;3
we stayed here as part of a road trip for 3 nights its a great location right next door to universal studios and around the road from warner studios also very close to hollywood blvd mulholland drive etc the room itself was really comfortable the fridge wasnt that cool and needed replacing but they did not have another one available when we asked so were left with only marginally cold drinks the outdoor hot tub had faults with only a few of the jets working so this needs looking at when we told the front desk they said it may get looked at soon upon arriving home i discovered we had been charged more for valet parking than we otherwise should have been we booked via a third party whose rate was almost of the hiltons but this was missed we would have selfparked;3
on the face of it the hotel has a lot going for it location just across lincoln center a couple of blocks from a subway and a decent rooftop bar however the hotel is very dated the corridors dark and the windows dirty the lobby area obviously had a touchup but not much else of the hotel or i was just supremely unlucky with the room i got staff is fine though;3
my wife chose this hotel for its location and it was brilliant near the river near the whitney near the subway perfect in other ways it might disappoint very hot and stuffy rooms and corridors the air conditioning fought to contain the problem and probably lost the shower was trying to cope with too many people and people who were slow to work out that they should speed up under the circumstances the bellboys were charming the desk staff were vague a bedside light didnt work we asked for help a handyman switched two bulbs around so that the other light didnt work instead and left his master key behind the restaurant is a different business attached to the hotel but independent like a lot of new york it was overpriced especially the drinks but very;3
as a frequent overnight guest near lax i typically stay at a different property a couple blocks away i decided to try the hyatt regency this time the modern dã©cor of this hotel is really nice from the lobby to the room i really liked the style of the hotel as soon as i walked in the number one best thing i noticed about this hotel was the sound proofing theyve done its excellent being this close to the airport you usually expect some noise but they did such a great job during their recent renovations i couldnt hear a thing outside as nice as the dã©cor and sound proofing was there was still some things lacking the front desk staff was not exactly what i would call friendly it seemed like i was interrupting whatever they were doing both when i checked in and out;3
after reading some of the reviews we approached the hotel with some trepidation bug spray and deodorizer were lucky enough to have a friendly woman wait for us to turn around so we were able to park very close the elevator held both my husband myself and our luggage the room was small clean and cheerfuly decorated yes the hallway was grim and i did see a cockroach or two but also saw them at the cafeteria at macys did not notice any bad smells the low hotel price made it possible for us to do more of the things that mattered neighborhood is safe there is easy access to transportation staff was very helpful when asked im not sure why our experience was so much better than others who have review riverside studios but perhaps attitude might be a clue;3
i was here for a seminar so i didnât choose the hotel big pluses comfortable rooms deco design pleasant and helpful staff negative itâs an awful neighborhood and taxis are hard to get since people leaving penn station grab them first the tick tock diner claims to be the largest diner in nyc itâs certainly the archetype;3
we asked to check in early and they asked for a fee of 70 then they reduced to 50 if we donât want to pay for early check in then we have to pay for luggage storage the room does not have coffee machine or the refrigerator if we want to have those items we have to pay additional for each item the location is a couple blocks from penn station and 1015 min walk to koreantown or timesquare which is convenient overall i wouldnât recommend unless you are willing to pay for those additional fees;3
the hotel is a little better than i expected after reading all the reviews here the room is not big but not too small for 2 persons with a king size bed the decoration is updated and pleasant the bathroom is surprisingly big with good shampoo and lotion supplies we asked for a room with a park view the hotel staff was nice and granted our wish since the window faces the east it can get quite hot in the morning and it is difficult to see anything out of the window with the shining sun it rained the last day and i could finally see whats outside through the dirty window the view was nice with a lot of trees and nothing else also facing the street can be very noisy with traffic and occasional sirens we encountered two staff both are nice and friendly;3
the best thing about this hotel is the location on the border of chinatown and 2 min walk from the subway it is perfect for one to get to any aprt of new york in minutes if you like chinese or italian food then lots and lots of restaurants within 10 minutes walk the room was ok no fridge or tea making facilities so you have to go out to find a coffee shop or bakery if you want one if you want to use the hotel as a base for your excursions in new york and a place to sleep and wash then this hotel will do just fine anymore then look elsewhere as this is a basic hotel;3
staff are quite simple and hard work to communicate with 1st night our bathroom stunk of weed as weâve arrived back on the night found it bizarre that we had to ask for our room to get cleaned when we was stopping more than one night and then come back to our room still not clean but we give the cleaner time in the end whatâs not a problem donât understand why the cleaner who gave us one towel to share when there was two of us overall i wouldnât stay at this premier inn ever again and definitely better hotels around and better price;3
booked here as i wanted somewhere super close to penn station with a 24 hour reception this did exactly that penn station is literally just round the corner service was amazing super kind and friendly including helping me with my suitcase and giving great directions the room was very small and perhaps a bit more basic than the photos on the website i booed on good shower and range of toiletries bathroom grouting could have been cleaner though and the room window had obviously not been cleaned in a long while quite a noisy location at night would recommend earplugs to deal with horns and sirens;3
this is a no frills hotel the rooms were very clean the staff was friendly and helpful with directions etc the shared bathroom was ok not as clean as i would of liked the location was great close to several atractions such as central park museum of national history or museum of modern art plus close to the subway i loved the neighborhood it not like a regular hotel more like a hostel such as shared bathroom where you had to bring the toilet paper which is provide with you each visit didnt have any bed bugs did have a small refigerator which helped with expenses was close to trader joes so we got groceries and had some meals in our toom no micorwave though;3
the price for hollywood was good but the room was lacking there is no where to unpack your clothes no dresser and no closet we had to live out of our suitcases all week the room was recently remodeled but difficult to enjoy with clothes and suitcases everywhere there was no where to put them the first day the shower was only warm and after that it was cold we spoke to the front desk daily and each day was told it was being fixed it never was fixed so we had cold water all week the surrounding neighborhood was run down but the hotel was not far from area attractions;3
its easy to dismiss poor service in new york hotels because people think its a new yorker way of saying or doing things for a highly competitive hospitality market i find some things inexcusable first rode in for check in with luggage the hotel bell captain stood next to us as i grabbed the luggage just to realize this hotel doesnt help anyone with their luggage asked bell captain for help with a taxi he just said you can grab it from the street yourself last these guys have a 400pm check in time very late i think and even then the room wasnt ready until after 400pm so in short ill never stay here again look elsewhere new yorkers in hospitality are nice people but some exceptions here a shame;3
this hotel has a great location common areas are very nice and clean the rooms are clean but renovation was done on the cheap just to make them look good so the conditions of the rooms are not the best the ac in the room didnt work complained to the front desk everyday but was never fixed in the june heat and after the 3 of us took a shower it was like a sauna in the room no ac and no vent in the bathroom its ny so the rooms are very small but i was happy with the double room the bathrooms are very small;3
itâs 0130 and i have been awake for ages with very noisy people in rooms around us the night before awake with smell of cannabis at 4am from an other nearby room bathrooms so noisy that a flush echos in other rooms windows donât shield the outside street noise iâm not a light sleeper usually but not a decent sleep here in 5 nights corridors very dingy lifts can be slow but maid showed us the service lift location the rooms are very small i have never seen double rooms so small and very dated please consider this when booking safe did not work in either room as we had 2 rooms beds comfortable showers powerful ice machine on floor 25 which was good staff pleasant and no issues at all ticktock breakfast great i wouldnât return to this hotel but the position;3
stayed here while in new york for 3 nights this place grew on me over them days at first my impression was bad nice decor downstairs in lobby however the room was so so small that suitcase didnt fit in properly when we was both in the room the bathroom was very dated and the old fittings hadnt even been removed when changed was quite dirty too however as the days went on i loved the diner located inside the hotel and the staff were nice too especially when we had an issue in our room it was sorted out almost instantly good location however i was concerned about how safe it was around there;3
i stayed at the new yorker for four days when i visited manhattan with my mom its located about a ten minute walk from both times square and the empire state building so id say the location is good but other than that this hotel is just that a hotel the staff is average the concierge was nice but the lady who checked us in was quite rude the rooms are small normal for new york though and the wifi was awful you had to sign back in all the time overall the hotel gave the impression that it was once a luxurious building yet is now just old and kind of mouldy showers id still recommend it though because it is inexpensive and new york is a place where you spend most of your time sightseeing and not in your hotel;3
first the good the hotel in in a nice location with an easy walk to universal studios we had a stroller and even with the hills it was an easy 57 minute walk the front desk staff was friendly and helpful the pool was large and clean and they provide fresh clean towels the bad the elevator situation was brutal they are undergoing upgrades to the elevators which caused a little bit of chaosto be fair they did have notices of the maintenance posted in the hotel and a staff member stationed at the elevator door in the lobby to assist guests the concierge was not very helpful in finding transportation options for a family that requires car seats in fact it was suggested that we buy our own car seats to use with the services they can offer yeah ok we ended up;3
hotel was well positioned for the empire state building well looked after and very busy room cards checked by security before access allowed to the lifts but we had no choice but to pay the facility fee this supposedly covered phone calls gym access and wifi code at nearly â£19 per day per room for something you might not want or use it was way too high treatment at booking in was far from friendly take care booking a taxi from reception there are cheaper ways to travel dont fleece your guests;3
astor on the park is conveniently located on new yorks famous central park although this hotel is situated on the upper west side and on 106th street is quite far from the action it is approximately 20minutes walk to the museum of natural history and around a 30min40min walk to fifth avenue broadway times square and the rockefeller centre it is also in easy access of the subway on 103rd street or 96th street with all of the above in easy reach on train lines b and c the hotel itself is very clean fresh towels and rooms cleaned everyday other reviews have described rooms as being small but the twin double bed room my sister and i stayed in was surprisingly adequate in size the staff are friendly with a hint of the stereotypical straighttalking new yorker they were;3
i have stayed here twice in the past 5 years as above those are the two reasons to stay at this hotel the lobby and the rooftop bar area are super and great places to meet up with friends and hang out for drinks the location directly across from lincoln center cant be beat the service was good butif you are expecting a welcoming bright room forget spacious thats not happening set your expectations accordingly the lowest price category has super tiny rooms one price level up is ok no views mattress was firmgood linens just ok the quality of the roombathroom renovation is poor and evidence of the old bones of the hotel is everywhere and not in a good way if you lookwhether it is the peeling paint on the doors or the dingy back hallways and;3
all that was good about the hotel is the location constant waiting for elevators no personal attention well i understand a huge hotel really small room i have been to many other hotels with the same room type but i have never been to such a small one room cleanliness is sufficient but for two people one vial of shampoo and soap a restaurant adjacent to the place did not give priority to hotel guests also brought in from the street as a regular luggage storage at extra charge also for hotel guests it has always been part of the hotels service but probably not here i chose this hotel because it is part of the history of new york but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations;3
parking eas difficult we had to get further information from parking attendees vs hotel staff even after we asked twice the beds and pillows were not comfortable over all i probably wouldnât stay here again if i visited;3
ok so good location not very far fromcentral park 10 min walk broadway 20 blocks away we get that good location hotel itself is well laid out good lobby not much pressure on selling drinks to customers only place for free wifi is lobby and the pool bar on the 11th floor the rest strangely is chargeable for per device at 599 per day per device we seem to be stuck on early 2005 here where wifi was a luxary and people only carried laptops for business everything within the hotel is chargeable except for the use of the pool the pool is around 10 meters by 3 meters not v big unsupervised so of you have kids or cant swim dont use or use with caution i saw a number of dead flys floating which killed the experience for me breakfast in room dining is an;3
well iâm not sure where to begin here really me and my partner stayed here for 7 nights during january 2018 we had an early flight into jfk headed straight to the hotel we were told very quickly that there was no chance of an early check in so we left out cases and went off for the afternoon when we arrived back we got our room we had the top floor so squeezed in to the tiny lifts and got to our room which from what we could work out was one of the ârefurbishedâ rooms although it looked like i had been done about 10 years ago it was very well used on the plus side the heating definitely worked we were lucky enough to have no issues with the room everything we needed worked the bed was comfy and considering we were in new york the hotel was basically;3
welcoming by the staff rooms not the greatest in terms of cleanliness but the room was secure the shower worked with hot water the toilet was clean there was a secure safe for your personal things everything provided was adequate for a short stay in the city staff were helpful willing to help with any issues free wifi too good location in chinatown with subway stations bowerydelancey grand streetchrystie street a 30 second walk in each direction overall i was satisfied at 100 a night;3
an old hotel in east hollywood the price was good and the rooms were ok internet is free but doesnt work reliably and is slow the pool is nice and there is a very small fitness room the patio looks good but the bar there was closed all the time;3
i stayed at the empire hotel during a business trip to nyc it is a very convenient hotel for its location across the street from lincoln center the rooms are a little tired and the elevators are almost scary most days i wasnt sure if i would make it up or down depending on the time of day the upstairs club is a hot spot that i didnt visit so i cant comment on the restaurants nearby are plentiful and varying in tastes close to the subway central park broadway theaters and all new york has to offer with all the other hotels in new york i will probably pick a different one next time;3
ariana at the front desk had a very poor attitude she would not listen to me or answer my question so i had to call my travel company to find my answer the other staff were lovely and helpful ariana is the one bad apple in my entire experience at the new yorker hotel also could have used a coffee pot in my room;3
we stayed here for 5 nights at the end of our honeymoon and we have to say overall the hotel was a bit on the disappointing side the good stuff first the location is excellent with easy access to the subway and plenty of cabs central park is only minutes away and times square etc a 1520 minute walk the staff were superb special mention to the excellent bar tender who was friendly good with guests and also very informative about where to go the rooftop bar was absolutely amazing with brilliant views up broadway felt like we were in a movie the decor throughout the hotel was modern and tasteful now the not so good stuff the room was small with little room to put cases etc the bathroom was also on the small side but i guess thats understandable for;3
only location was perfect and rest was between poor and average rooms are so narrow no kettle or compimenetary water at rooms no employee is wearing a name tag doorman were perfect and helpful i asked for key no size bed and i got two small beds;3
we stayed 4 nights at this hotel first week of december i donât have anything to complain about rooms was clean free wifi very quit a night and the best thing â only 1 min walk from grand street subway that has excellent connection both up and down town however didnât expect the hotel to e in the middle of china town and if i ever come to ny again i will look for a hotel where i get more value for money;3
firstly the location is brilliant super close to waterloo and westminister tube underground stations london eye and big bus hop on hop off stops the negatives 1 there is no ramp to enter the hotel all bags need to be lugged up the stairs to enter there is an assistance button to press however no one comes to assist 2 self check in counters were not open check in queue was long and slow it seems a possible staffing issue 3 the rooms are very small and in equipped we had a family room that had a queen size bed it was very small so iâm assuming a queen or double plus a very flimsy small single bed there was no fridge at all there was no safe to hold our passports or valuables the air conditioning only went down to 19 degrees which at times made the room;3
2nd time to stay here previous stay was on club level and room was fine second more recent stay was on regular guest floor the condition of the room was terrible there were multiple disgusting and large stains on the carpet which looked extremely worn there was a random mini fridge sitting in the room all by itself the tv was small and the furniture was outdated to say the least common areas also needed updating;3
staff are excellent and location is great yes its quirky but this is a tale of two hotels if you go for the posh end the captains cabin option which isnt cheap you have a superb room probably overlooking the river and can just see the side of the world trade center plenty of space ensuite bathroom small table wardrobe and enough room to do the p90x3 warrior workout there is a fabulously eclectic bar and a nice restaurant the gitane attached on the other hand if you get a small room the twin bunk version be aware this is not comfortable now they are very clear about this and to some people that is part of the charm but in practical terms its not easy for two adults to share a 40 sqft room that contains two beds your luggage will be on the floor;3
i came to nyc with my mom my sister and my boyfriend it was their christmas present i booked the hotel and everything without checking the reviews first once i saw the reviews my stomach turned into knots all the reviews were terrible i was so doubtful on going i wanted to book somewhere else so badly i was so nervous it was raining and snowing so we had no where else to go but the hotel it was around 2 pm but check in was 3pm once we got there they were friendly they let us check in early gladly the hallways were narrow but it was fine we got a room on the first floor 2 double beds i opened the door and got a wiff of clean air i was surprised i rushed to inspect the bed i brought a can of lysol just in case i found not even a stain we had nice sheets;3
my husband i stayed here a few years ago 2007â¦tripadvisor will not let you put the date of stay farther back than 2009 anyway iâm sure some things might have changed since we were there it was then a ramada but many things in my review are still relevant iâm sure such as the location we just wanted a decent place to come back to after long days of exploring we stayed 8 nights and did a ridiculous amount of activities hollywood blvd graumanâs chinese theater rodeo drive went to marilyn monroeâs house in brentwood dodgers game san diego padres game san diego zoo universal studios disneyland coachella festival in indio near palm springs gwen stefani show at universal ampitheater warner bros studio tour sony pictures studio tour santa monica pier venice;3
no frills budget hotel at a good price for new york hotels for people looking to stay close to soho and lower east side areas walking distance to brooklyn bridge clean rooms perfect for what my girlfriend and i needed as we were out exploringeatingshopping 90 of the time;3
we stayed at the new yorker mid february being a family of 4 ill give an honest review im a uk travel agent so im used to reviewing and staying in many hotels i had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when i booked firstly the good the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere thats about it as far as the positive the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room this room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed with another 47 dollars a night resort fees;3
this hotel is for those looking for locationpriceand cleanliness not 5 star this hotel was on central park west 2 blocks from a subway basic but clean helpful staff fuzzy tv reception private bath requested room with a balcony and overlooking central park got both paid with tax 134 in nyc november i saw hostels with shared bathrooms for that price;3
clean and quiet for sleeping the ac could have been a bit better if the curtain did not block the air flow the astor on the park had everything we needed very close to the subway and in an area that felt very safe;3
this hotel has two positives first the staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful they let us check in early and that gave us several hours of touring which we appreciated second the location is excellentwithin walking distance to the park times square the theater district subways that take you downtown etc but the room was a huge disappointment for a four star hotel first the bathroom was minute standing room only no hand towels half a shower door no counter for personal belongings no hair dryer just a toilet and a shower and a pedalstyle sink even the lining in the trash was missing the room had very little extra space and the decor was odd junglelike the beds were made up but no flat sheetsjust fitted sheets and comforters lined with;3
nice quiet location right on central park great proximity to upper west side harlem and columbia campus my room was basic but clean modern bathroom comfortable bed front desk staff helpful and courteous dont book this is youre looking for sleek luxury but if youre looking for a good value for manhattan its hard to beat;3
did not know how to rateaveraged the good and the bad usually i start with the pro but this time i am starting with the con because it was so peculiar con the water we stayed tuesdaythursday on the first two days the water in the tubshower was lukewarm on thursday there was no cold water either in the tubshower or in the sink the water was boiling hot out of all faucets we could not take showers instead had to run a bath then keep adding buckets of ice from the icemaker until it was bearable brushed teeth with hot water con the age of the place the room smelled somewhat mouldy more so when the ac went on con no makeup mirror no facial products such as cotton balls worn out towels tv small and far from the bed so much so that writing on the;3
hotel was in a great location not far from empire state and macys inside hotel it was viable that they are still doing a lot of renovation work and some floors looked newer than others our room was tiny and very basic but to be honest it was clean and we were not in there that much to notice the tick tock diner connected to the hotel offered amazing breakfasts so would definitely recommend;3
it is a conveniently located hotel which is why ive given it a 3 it looks like a really nice hotel and the lobby is beautiful but all in all it was one of our least favorite places in our 6 week trip in america we asked for a room that was high up but we didnt get one which was disappointing the wifi barely worked not ideal when you are travelling and relying on it to plan everything and even though it says in the guidebook in the room that the hotel does offer laundry services when i phoned up to ask about it i was told that they actually dont the mattress didnt quite fit the bed that well either once you venture further than the lobby you see that the rest of the hotel doesnt quite have the same nice appearance throughout however it was a place to;3
overall this hotel was in a good location it was only a 34 minutes walk from two subway stations columbus circle and central park the room was a good size the bed was comfortable although a little dated and quite dusty the rooftop bar and the bar in the lobby were impressive and the door men were very friendly at night it was quite noisy outside and we could hear the noise coming from the next room this made it difficult to sleep we were a given a complimentary breakfast on our final day this was good although we wouldnât pay full price for it on our arrival we asked room service for bowls and spoons so we could eat breakfast in the room the hotel could not provide these and instead gave us disposable coffee cups and plastic spoons to eat with there is a starbucks;3
very convenient to universal studios hollywood right across the street they have a shuttle but it is only a five ten minute walk room was clean and comfortable but they really ding you for things that are either free or much cheaper at other hotels you need to be a member of hilton honors program to get the wifi otherwise you pay for it self parking is 2800 a day wow restaurant prices are sky high would not stay here again;3
when staying in a new york hotel it is important to keep an open mind if you want a large room at a great price you should look perhaps in some midwestern or sunbelt city hotels in nyc are tiny and very pricy we have stayed in new york hotel rooms not much larger than the bed itself and the window looks out to a brick wall 10 feet away we do not come to nyc to hang out in a fancy hotel so much to see and do in the city we stayed 2 nights at the windsor hotel over new years the room was somewhat tired looking but clean enough and larger than we expected and the window looked out across to roosevelt park unlike other nyc hotels we have stayed at the walls were thick enough to provide a quiet night for sleeping there are literally hundreds of restaurants within a few;3
the hotel is perfectly located rooms are in good condition lively bar downstairs it is good for those who just need a room in the city and no expectations for good service if you need concierge services or something delivered to the hotel the empire hotel is not for you things get lost at the reception packages are not delivered to the room and at the reception there is always a queue the staff doesnt even pretend to be helpful;3
hotel was comfortable amd met our needs self parking was secure and spacious breakfast buffet was har variety and tasted great didnt get to use patio but took a peek is very nice beds i do gotta warn are hard but i slep well in it you get plenty of pillows;3
truly in the heart of it all and youre paying for it but if you want all the amenities of an expensive hotel this one is not the one for you unless you want to roll out of bed into lincoln center in which case there is not other place like it;3
first for the positive the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the shared bathrooms are cleaned at least twice a day and probably the biggest draw the price is very reasonable for this great location along the hudson in manhattan however this hotel is shared with residents and some of them smoke so if you dont smoke but end up on a floor with smokers expect your room and the hallways to smell like cigarette smoke there is a club on the premises and the loud thumping of the music can be heard up to the third floor and goes on until at least 2 am we changed rooms to the sixth floor and eliminated the noise and the smoke which only left the hard lumpy mattresses to contend with but in spite of all this we would rather spend our money on food and;3
great location for visiting universal city although far from any airport you wont need a car since its walking distance to the city walk and studio tours as far as the hotel staff is friendly polite and helpful but the food drinks and everything else that cost extra is expensive buffet is overpriced drinks are extremely overpriced;3
the hotel is very well located near to a subway station i spent six nights there the first four in a deluxe apartment suite with a couple of friends and the last two alone in a private bath room the location is great and overall i have no real complaints both rooms were clean staff was nice enough and most of all it was affordable they have a little room where you can leave your luggage if needed but theyre not responsible for your belongs and just give the key alway to any guest they entered our room for cleaning with us there more than once yet gave us just one key to a room that can acommodate up to five people but i will definetly stay there next time im in nyc im used to all kinds of hotels and this is a simple good enough one in a city that makes you;3
excellent location friendly staff fast checkin checkout spacious double room in 8th floor stylish lobby walking distance to times square many restaurant and coffeeshop around 24h grocery store in front of the hotel parking is 40usd and 45usd for suv for hotel guests nearby sewage smell was coming all the time from the bathroom during our stay old small tv not hd limited channels;3
we landed at the astor after being in a really dodgy place far away from nyc so it was definitelly a better option for us after going through all the other reviews i have to say mine are very similar the hotels rooms were smallamenities inside the room were basicthere is only one elevatorroom seemed to tilt towards one side wireless internet is not free it was a safe place to be during irenenice quiet locationhas a metro station few minutes awayinfront of central park and close to columbus avenue has vending machines and an atm in the basement rooms has a clean and decent bathroom i would recommend living there if you dont have any other better options for the price but if you plan on walking to times square its far away also if the doorman organises a cab make;3
i had a one night stay this week at the empire hotel and the room was sweltering at noon when i checked in i closed the shade thinking the room may cool off before the evening but not so the ac is old and rusty barely blowing at all they really need to update this you get what you pay for i guess the front desk folks were great;3
the location is the only real positive they gave us a âstandard roomâ and iâm assuming because it was booked through hotwire we were given the smallest room we asked if we could pay for an upgrade and the gentleman rudely said no with no reason why the room kinda smelled funky it was somewhat updated with new paint the bed was so so security maids and bellman were nice they do have a diner connected to the hotel which was great the subway is located just outside which was a plus this place is not a four star like the lotte westin or the w i would much rather have stayed at the holiday inn or crowne plaza for the money you can get a better hotel will not be staying here again;3
we visited this hotel mid week in late april we got what we thought was a decent deal on a nicer room so my expectations might have been too high turns out we got an average price on an average room the rooms are smalltwo queen beds one dresser one desk no closet or storage space no bathtub no separate toilet area linoleum on the floor rather than carpet was a bit offputting but in keeping with the boutiquelike ambiance theyre going for rooms do have a mini fridge and a microwave so that was nice ac never worked we didnt report it because we were only in the rooms to sleep and didnt want our sleep to be interrupted by a maintenance worker computers were down when we arrived so we couldnt check in right away elevator next to our room was also;3
we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights which we booked last minute on the internet the day before we went it was a good base for sightseeing new york the concierge doesnt have great local knowledge and generally wants to sell you trips in order for him to get commission i would suspect we booked a helicopter trip with him which we are glad we did as you need to reserve a place the day before and it was the same price if wed booked it ourselves we also booked a car to the airport with himbut this was a bit of rip off compared to the cost of the taxi from the airport paid 47 from the airport plus tips and the cab he books is 55 plus tips and also 5 for a toll bridge which they dont tell you about if youve got the time and arent too tired would recommend you;3
we had a room with 2 double beds and my own bathroom it was clean and the ac worked well the staff was friendly and helpful however if you want poshyou had best go somewhere else this is an old building so it has window units which is fine by me the architecture is lovely but the elevator is slow the lobby is kind of run down but you can hang out there and chat with other visitors it is extremely well located for the price i could walk 1 block to the strangers gate entrance to central park and 1 block to a little breakfastlunch shop it is near cathedral circle which is beautiful and st johns cathedral is right there;3
i know the new yorker is an old hotel so i was prepared for it to perhaps be a little dated and it was i had hoped itâd be charming but unfortunately i was not charmed cons cleaning subpar to say the least long dark hairs on the towels grimy looking tile mold in the bathtub a strange wet spot on the carpet inside the door past itâs prime decor and carpeting in the hallways was old dingy and smelled stale felt a little creepy in a strange way bathroom very compact ie tiny no storage space for your toiletries just a very narrow glass shelf above the sink with barely enough room for one personâs things also extremely high hooks to hang your towels or whatever as a short person that was very annoying bedding no blanket or cover on the bed or;3
im new to this website and love reading all the helpful insightso i thought back to my short years of vacationing experience to think what insight can i give to give back here my only thought was to write a warning about this hotel the pictures are very misleading in my opinion very nasty hotel as i pulled up with my girlfriend at the timei had a sinking feeling she gf even witnessed some homeless people get into a brutal fight as she was sitting in the car the positive thing i can say about this place is that they let me cancel my reservation on the spot with no penalty and i promptly and fortunately stumbled upon the hilton in century city that hotel was great and really was right next to universal studios hope this helps;3
overall my 2 night stay was fine all the staff were friendly and helpful my room in the 8th floor was small but very clean the bathroom is tiny the vessel sink was shallow so water splashed on the floor and it was difficult to wash out my reusable water bottle there is a shelf behind the toilet and sink unfortunately the toilet seat cover didnt stay up because of the shelf every time i used the toilet the seat hit me in the back that was annoying;3
far too expensive room are small but ok for nyc as always difficult to find a great hotel there with good value for money but here the service was so poor staff except the concierge so usefuland the doormen was not friendly one of the bar waitress was just so rude i had no time to argue otherwise i would have gone madvery disappointed will change hotel next business trip to nyc;3
it was my first time going to nyc with family and found this hotel close to tribeca actually chinatown but not so expensive compared with others in the midtown but instead of 200night i would probably give half of that and feel better the hotel looks big in the picture but it is tiny no lobby no cafeteria nothingvery close to subway station which was a plusthe whole area stinks since lots of open markets during the day and trash at nighti came back full of mosquito bites young and friendly staff not very interested in giving lots of details we were happy when they upgrated us to the penthouse actually the top floor with access to the dilapidated terrace with a splendid view of manhathan dont expect more than that the room was big but poorly;3
location location location we stayed here only because of that as i think the rooms and hotel in general is overpriced the rooms and building could use some updating our room was super tiny but is just what we needed since we were out most of the day we also went during xmas time which meant high pricesthe staff were friendly upon check in it was fast and easy this hotel is super close to some main attractions the empire state building is maybe a 10 min walk away the subway and msg is right across from it and if you dont mind walking you can make it all the way down to times square we did that a couple of times all in all i would stay here again if it were the only budget choice close to attractions and subway;3
my hotel stay was ok the size of the room was small and the bathroom was outdated there was a lot of doors slamming at night from the other rooms adjacent;3
so youre gong to new york and you check the hotel rates around townnot willing to spend 300 per night or much more choose the days inn and i think you will be relatively happy while saving the positives were the room was comfortably furnished hotel located with easy access to the subway systemlines 1 and 2 right out the door with access to broadway on the express line 2 with two stops comfortable bedding good restaurants within walking distance the negatives public areas were bleak elevators tired in need of freshening up and cleaning some staff at front desk were not as gracious as they could be halls dark bath roomabout 60 square feetsink with pedestalno pullman only a small shelf for storage no magnifying mirror and;3
situated in a bad area but the hotel is decent nice rooms secure car park but with no restaurant we had to order food from a local restaurant which was actually good but wouldnt have found a decnt one to go ourselves;3
positives good location good value very friendly and helpful staff clean beds and bathroom negatives old shoddy furniture room too cramped room looked out over scruffy back yard room number 101 thin walls so noisy from other guests overall it was okay as we went out early morning and just came back to sleep so didnt spend much time in the room;3
the location of the hotel was so easy to get to we took the train from newark airport to penn station which was no bother even with a pushchair when we arrived at the hotel the cot was not yet in the room but they promptly brought it to us the room had only two small double beds so for a family of five 2ad 3ch 1810 13weeks it was a bit tight the bathtub was very old and had been repainted and the paint was flaking making it look grubby but the water was hot there were plenty of towels for the whole family but the complimentary shower gel and shampoos etc were not smoke for a party of our size it was a good job we brought our own the beds were comfortable and clean despite being in the small side and the staff were friendly enough all in all it was just somewhere;3
4 nights here booked through virgin room was upgraded as we were celebrating my husbands 40th not sure what the upgrade was supposed to include in any hotel its purely a base for us so cant comment on any of the facilities excellent location the hotel is tired in places and our room one of the smallest ive stayed in;3
the new yorker is 2 blocks away from penn station which is extremely convenient if arrivingleaving nyc by amtrak or other train however the hotel is quite old the rooms and bathrooms are small and the furniturecarpet etc are a bit worn if you can upgrade to a suite it is much better as many of the standard rooms are quite small the hotel is huge 40 floors and so has a lot of traffic but they are well set up with it with the lobby staff the workout room would be small if this were a business hotel but when we were there it was fine it had 3 ellipticals one stepper several bikes and treadmills plus a full suite of weight machines there is a nice small coffee bar in the lobby for morning coffee and snacks the trattoria restaurant is good and the tic;3
excellent service especially doorman decent location near theatres and subway stop room size average able to easily park car a block away terrible bedold soft lumpy cannot recommend sorely because of bad bed;3
this hotel is small and friendly in a great location for theater visits rooms are small and if you are used to a queen or king bed you may want to check your booking as our bed was a double very comfortable though;3
my partner and i booked this hotel through expedia only paid â£500 for 6 nights which at new york prices this is an exceptional price ofcourse the pictures didnt really reflect the size or quality of the room however it was a good base the room didnt really have much natural light and it was very small but the location really made it value for money and the rooms were clean bonus having a fridge we used the location productively and visited a few bars nearby on amsterdam avenue its also very close to central park one of the best places on earth also sarabeths which is a famous breakfast venue yummy if your all about the dinosaurs like me then the natural history museum is closeby too use the card machines for your tickets i would recommend this place if you;3
there is no doubt that the hotel is well situated very close to the 96th st subway for easy access to downtown around the hotel there are dome passable restaurants and we had a good breakfast around the corner with a 20 hotel discount the staff at the reception desk were courteous and helpful that is about where the good news ends our room on the 5th floor was not dirty as reported by some reviewers but it was dowdy it was definitely in need of updating and the bath had some bad stains having said that the shower was very good we had to ask for the complimentary toiletries but they arrived quickly we were there for 3 nights the main problem was the thinness of the walls a couple next to us decided to have a loud argument at 2am which lasted for hours;3
i was backpacking across the usa with my brother and new york was our first stop we chose the jane because it was reasonably priced a good location and was more private than a hostel for our first accommodation of what was a 3 month roundtheworld trip the hotel itself is really intriguing with an amazing theme and style with lovely bathrooms that are just round the corner further down the corridor with hot water shampoo shower gel etc the rooms were really small but that didnt matter to us too much as we just wanted somewhere to dump our bags and get our head down but id say if you were staying for longer than a couple of days youd want more room they had complimentary bottled water which was super appreciated as it was so hot in new york the rooftop bar is;3
arrived on 17th feb 2 rooms for 4 people to be told that they did not have a room for me and my daughter after a long flight i was so worried they said travel bag had cancelled 1 of the rooms they decided to put me and my daughter in a suite with a fabulous view of the empire state building floor 39 went down to reception the next day and they said it had been sorted i had contacted travel bag in the meantime and they confirmed they had not cancelled our room it was the hotels error on a plus side we got to stay in the suite for 5 nights free of charge which we appreciated i am going back to this hotel in october booked through expedia this time but am really concerned this could happen again the hotel was really well located and the suite was lovely hotel;3
the hotel is only 3 stars and priced as such the rooms are just okay we had warm water showers and two of the elevators werent working the rooftop bar was great location to sit and drink on a beautiful warm day the hotel is an excellent location for visiting lincoln center which had concerts ballets theater and film from morning to night much of the upper west side is walking distance including central park the american museum of natural history restaurants and cafes and lovely residential tree lined street only a 9 taxi ride from grand central station;3
the hotel itself was very nice a short walk away from times square it was clean and tidy but our room was tiny the concierge was rude and threw our bags in the taxi which meant i knocked a point off would have been a 4 would recommend even though the room was tiny we wasnât in there that much;3
the good good water pressure in the showers great location and trainsubway access professional and friendly front desk staff particularly crystal and jose pretty good wifi in lobby inroom safe security to confirm people are guests before boarding elevator the bad really crappy wifi in rooms at least on the 27th floor disconnected every 10 minutes inconsistent performance when it was working and bad offshore tech support meaning they will tell you to reboot your device or pretend they did something when in fact nothing usefull is done slow housekeeping which means rooms may not be ready for new guests by checkin time if inroom wifi is important to you then i recommend you consider an alternative place to stay no filtered water cooler in fitness room if;3
we chose the hotel according to the location it did not disappoint and the pool that was disgusted was dirty yes once we did not use itð¢the rooms were older and the view of the air conditioning was extremely loud that it was not possible to sleep at night wifi in room 10 usd per day per facility 2017 year;3
its a good and relaxing place to stay and i made all my business customer feel the best views ever you guys should come and check it out and see for yourself ððð fully protected and the food is amazing ð;3
hotel very central a bit dated cracked tiles in bathroom which has caused dampness in bedroom we booked a double queen suite and never got the room we booked got 25 a night off for as a result still wasnt happy though;3
we stayed in the larger double bed suite and for the size of the room i was very unimpressed with the bathroom there is no counter what so ever the mirror hangs out over the sink so the small sink is barley usable there is one towel rack and its in the shower no shower door and no shower vent so everything gets wet i have no idea how people get ready for fashion week or any events in the small bathroom dont expect a bellman or anyone to get the door for you the concierge might be at the desk but certainly wont answer the phone on a positive note the size of the bedroom was great the beds were very comfortable and the cleaning staff was great;3
you can walk the empire state building madison square garden times square central park and take a train to the 911 memorial perfect and would most definitely stay here again room was a bit tight and the bed was small granted i am only 6 feet even;3
rooms are clean and well serviced beds are comfortable with plenty of feather pillows tv with movies in the room complimentary wifi but seems a little slow bathrooms are clean we had three rooms on the ground floor but seemed safe and secure occasional traffic noise but nt surprising given location service from concierge was adequate and they helped immediately with checkin and with arranging safe access in the room breakfast was disappointing plenty of choice but nothing exciting coffee was ok boiled could have been stronger but its an individual thingeggs were poor being powdered eggs sausages were ordinarythere was a choice of bread for toasting and bagels rolls and waffles we recommend the waffles nice toiletries and spacious rooms overall;3
stayed at the 2nd floor couldnât find a safety box i told the friendly staff and they promised to fix it twice maybe it was well hidden the toilette was broken but fixed the room where in a desperate need for a renovation at least some new paint the hotel is really close to central park if you like a walk or run in the morning personally i prefer hudson hotel instead;3
this hotel is certainly comfortable and is in a central location within walking distance of many of the key ny attractions and close to the subway too but it is a bit tired in particular our bathroom was very dated and in need of a refresh we didnât use the restaurants apart from a quick coffee at tick tock weirdly served in metal mugs so i canât comment on the wider facilities itâs an underwhelming hotel but is clean and serves a purpose as a place to lay your head;3
i had read the reviews and had seen the pix before i stayed at the hotel so i wasnt suprised when i arrived we found an adult roach on the second to last day of our stay in our room but the room itself was clean and decorated nicely it takes a little getting used to have to share a bathroom with the other occupants of your floor we took flipflops to wear in the shower so things turned out fine it is helpful to understand spanish as the housekeepers that we encountered were primarily spanish speaking but if the guest does not with a little patience and appropriate gestures the guest will be able to get their message across there is a drug store only three blocks away where you can buy soap disinfectant tolietries and snacks there are several restaurants two blocks away;3
for 50night this place was great i just needed a place to crash my room was about the size of a freshman single dormitory room but it was all i needed the cleaning staff was consistent and did a great job ie fresh sheets and towels everyday no bugs or residual muck from previous customers restroomsshowers were on the hall so i brought shower shoes i cant emphasize how safe this place is i never felt threatened or that my belongings were in danger i have to recommend this hotel for nyc on a budget;3
stayed here for a couple of nights firstly got the wrong room and couldnt change due to it being booked fashion week for a 4 star i was surprised that they didnt give complimentary robesslippers also wifi was only available downstairs for free but connection wasnt always that good another unwelcome surprise was the fact there was no air conditioning rooms were liable to get quite hot and even though it was cold out by the morning we were baking dont think i would want to stay here in the summer doormen were lovely;3
great location on the south bank for the theatre galleries and shopping nice helpful staff reasonable breakfast and comfortable hotel to use as an overnight base issue with the room not being cleaned one day only partially resolved overall it was a good place to stay;3
hotel location was fantastic ie walking distance to time square and across the street from central park rooms were small house keeping was unseen and never replenished complimentary amenities hotel is in need of some updating;3
my husband and i decided to book two hotels in ny the first one we booked and stayed was quite near the times square we were satisfied with that one too we wanted our second hotel to be in lower manhattan because the tour agency which took us to washington dc would drop us off near chinatown the windsor hotel seemed to be a good choice with its reasonable price and available rooms the windsor hotel is in chinatown and one block away from little italy itâs close to subway stations and a variety of restaurants we enjoyed several restaurants malaysian vietnamese chinese and italian its within walking distance to soho wall street and the financial district we are in our early forties and like walking our room was clean and bigger than the one in the other;3
well i have read the reviews so i didnt expect more negative location was not ideal for me of course by train one can go everywhere but i prefer walking positive the room was bigger than many more expensive hotels and very very warm to an extend that i would prefer it a bit cooler it could have been cleaner though positive bathroom was clean with very hot water throughout the day seemed recently renovated staff was ok the two bellmen were very polite in general i would suggest before choosing this hotel to consider location as you may end up paying the difference in transportation;3
this was a great location i was surprised at the smaller size of the rooms but it may be normal for nyc 247 diner was great as well the hotel staff were incredibly polite and friendly also very clean;3
everyone has their own point of view on things we have stayed in new york a few times and this was a whistle stop 2 nighter whilst we are touring hotel itself is clean and ok location is alright probably a bit to high up for visiting the sights the hotel says free wifi when i see this i expect it to be in the rooms everywhere we have been in us so far has had free wifi in rooms the only place its free is the lobby the rooms as expected are small but these are really small couldnt swing a hamster rather than a cat when you have 2 adults and 2 teenage kids its no way near big enough the bathroom is daft aswell you have to lift your arms when sitting on the loo and the shower like others have said has no door the problem is the shower head is directly in the middle;3
it wasnâ´t as bad as i expected after reading reviews the hotel has a very good position on manhattan close to a shop close to nice resting area near hudson river close to subway staff was helpful the only problem was cleanness of room and of common areas our friend changed her room three times before she get soso clean room;3
we went to hollywood universal hotel for three nights the staff at counter was normal not very friendly but not rude either i dont know if they forgot or what but we werent given bottles of water until we came down in the evening and asked for it as there was nothing in the fridge just an empty fridge my sister and her two children also got only two bottles of water despite they stayed in the honor room the cleaning staff was nice and one night i called the front desk for a bandage they brought it to my room which was very nice the concierge and the luggage transferrers were good too however the breakfast here was the most reason which makes us not to come back on may 24th we came down for the first day of breakfast and were showed the only counter for;3
i booked this hotel because it was close to my friends apartment and because i got a terrific rate i always look for a couple of things when i am traveling this had free wifi sometimes maddeningly slow a free hot breakfast and the parking was only 22 a night in la it usually goes as high as 40 it also has a pool which looked nice but the weather was too cold to use the hotel is walking distance to a strip mall which had a drug store and a nice yogurt place also a staples you can also walk to some fast food type restaurants checking in seemed to take forever and i cant figure out why now lets get to the specifics the room was a box of decent size with no artwork of anything on the walls a dresser double bed desk chair end tables refrigerator;3
after spending 5 nights at the empire here are the pros and cons pros excellent location overlooking the lincoln centre 1 block to central park and very close to 2 mtr stations wholefoods at columbus circle is the best one ive ever seen loads of restaurants nearby the hotel has a nice lobby and roof terrace with a small chilly paddling pool staff are pleasant cons our bed was as hard as a board the shower was missing a door one of our windows was missing a privacy screen and there were no umbrellas available on the terrace the whole hotel is well used very tired and worn out a major refurb is way overdue with so many hotels to choose from i dont think i would return here i only chose the empire because it advertised a pool which i need to do laps;3
i have to be honest it was my first trip to nyc i had a seminar about 13 blocks away and then an event at the lincoln center and wanted something close to central park the location was great for me just what i wanted i didnt want to be trapped too close to times square or anything and i dont mind a lot of walking to get to places given that the hotel was recommended by an associate who loves this place im in my early 30s and i was hoping for a place where i can go see a show and then head back for some cocktails except the lounges closed quite early i thought nyc would be a late night town you know 24am not the case here also the bathroom was very small not that i expect a huge place but i hate the shallow sinks that no matter what you do;3
this is a great hotel if youre on a tight budget and have use of a car i stay in lahollywood about 5 times a year and have never found a cheaper decent hotel so its great value if you dont want to go as low as a motel the rooms are clean and spacious with comfortable beds and cable tv the free breakfast is great and the hotel itself is clean and well maintained however this is by no means a luxury option so its important to be aware of that before your stay the main problem is the location its quite a long way from the attractions of hollywood and not in an area that youd want to walk around in at night a car is essential here to avoid this and high taxi charges every time you want to go anywhere however with a car its an easy drive from most places;3
this place is nothing fancy but is in a great location in chinatown and the subway is 100 yards from the front door clearly a 2 star property in terms of services of lack there of however room was very clean the 1 person at the front desk was very friendly and helpful and all of the fixtures were in good working order the 30 flat panel tv seemed relatively new ive seen older posts that the hallways were run down and the beds uncomfortable however that was not our experience both double beds in our room were comfortable and the hallways were clean and well kept perhaps there has been some recent renovation since those posts;3
i have to say that if it wasnt for the credit card problem deposit the hotel charged me for something i did not drink asked for a refund and they refunded me id have given a higher grade to this hotel it is well located staff was friendly and helpful especially a blonde girl who works at the concierge rooms are small but since i was solo it was ok when i first checked in they put me in a noisy room complained and they changed me but i have to say that mistakes like charge a guest for something he did not drink eat etc is not acceptable specilly when you check out and they tell you you are clear to go;3
the bed is not big 120cm large but the matress is good quality the bathroom is ok but the taps are old and hot water comes late windows arent very soundisolated and nyc is a noizy city personel is kind and helpfull very close to central park only 5 min from a metro station 15 min to time square every hotel in nyc are expensive in comparaison with other cities but this one is a little under the average;3
iâve stayed at the wyndham days inn close to central park west whole foods shops good location when you dont know anyone to freeload on but arent made of money commit this to memory when traveling in and around central park in nyc east side old money west side new money downtown celebrity money uptown no money 1900s old a tad shabby with the carpets smell of disinfectant but it will do after a day of sight seeing and subways beds are firm clean made daily crowded front desk good for college visits when you just need a reasonable safe place to rest your head at night;3
i thought it was a pretty nice place to stay overall but luckily it was only my husband and i because the room was pretty small we barely had room to put our luggage which was right by the bathroom door and in front of the main door it was nice that we had a microwave and small fridge most hotels dont offer that for a regular room and there was a small balcony that was connected to two other rooms which was nice when we needed to step out for fresh air other than the size of the room being too cramped the bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean also there was a free breakfast which was cool because we didnt have to go hunting for a place to eat oh and the customer service was okay at least they processed everything very quickly so that we could get;3
this hilton is a little outdated as a whole the decor is gaudy and hasnt been updated since what looks like the late 80searly 90s its very average if youre looking for a convenient and adequate stay for an affordable rate this is probably your place beyond that if youre looking for luxury look elsewhere heres the highlights pros very comfortable bed good bathhair products but the room is barely stocked so you need to request extra of it seems clean enough cons bath is pretty run down dont expect anything more than the bare necessities sometimes you see a cotton swab in your bathroom or a little sewing kit not here its no frills not even a robe to use no spa wifi for a fee parking for a fee the food is eh more on that below room;3
great location in central manhattan walking distance to many sights and easy access to metro time square broadway empire state macys etc our room was very tired and lacked space shower was adequate but not up to expected standards of todays hotels tick tock diner was good for a meal or breakfast;3
there are two great things about this hotel proximity to universal studios and their abundance of good food at their buffet dinners and breakfast on sunday the rooms look tired and need updated including the tvs the shower had very little pressure and was disappointing the staff was luke warm with the worst being the check in desk room service was actually good with good service and good food the free shuttle to universal studios was suppose to run every 15 min but you cant depend on that we waited 40 min each way;3
the windsor hotel is within easy walking distance to manhattan bridge and a little bit further the brooklyn bridge the grand subway stop is a block away which makes uptown very accessible the b and d trains will get you to broadway times square the rock museum of natural history and more if you dont plan on spending much time in your hotel this is a great option for the budget minded on the border of chinatown and little italy it is situated in a interesting but safe neighborhood if traffice noise bothers you then just turn on the fan at night;3
pros the staff were very friendly and accommodating the hotel was located around the corner from the subway so getting downtown was a breeze we were only a 10minute walk to central park the beds were comfy cons the facilities were lacking no fridge the tv had four channels the room was a bit cramped the wifi barely worked no breakfast included and the elevators took 1015 minutes to get to your floor parking was also not included they did provide the name of two parking garages near the hotel that would offer discounted rates because you were a guest;3
the deluxe king room is an approximate size and was missing the additional amenities there were no robes in the room and requested two twenty minutes later 1 robe arrived and i was informed thats all they had also to say the roof top bar was a disappointment would be an understatement it caters to an all male very young crowd and is anything but plush;3
positive points showers toilets clean bit strange sharing thats just me i guess good location shops around and everything else within walking distance free bike hire bikes took some getting used to getting on a bit daily housekeeping air con great rooftop bar limited drinks options although people outside use it as well so can get busy downstairs bar great place when open high line around the corner subway about 10 min walk safe in room found it eventually hidden in drawer under bed not so positive there are residents within this hotel that smoke and we dont so we only stayed 1 night in initial room and were lucky enough to get moved the next day which was great news even if you smoked it was grim and it no smoking for people staying;3
it is very noise also internet is very slow double glassing windows should be improved and bathrooms should be updated you can get for the same price ink 48 hotel which is more modern and well presented;3
the good across the street from universal studios comfortable bed room and bathroom great views of the freeway and universal studios itself easy inout of parking garage fitness center the bad extra charge for wifi parking fees i did not bring this up with management but there was a very noticeable draft coming from the taped up windows yep the window that used to open was taped weird for a hilton property id expect this to come from a roadside motel the ugly parking garage isnt convenient to the hotel you have to take an elevator to the lobby then walk past the restaurant and the lobby to get to another bank of elevators to your room getting to universal studios involves walking through the lobby past the restaurant through a corridor past all;3
we checked in after arriving from washington dc at 5pm the front desk went through the motions was trying to clear us as fast as she could it came across like she was behind in meeting her kpi in checking in guests when i presented my credit card to prepay for my stay the machine asked for a pin after asking her if she is able to bypass the pin process for the electronic signing she said we need a pin when i remarked that other hotels in the united states retail outlets allowed pin bypass she curtly replied that our machines do not later when i asked the security staff fronting the lift systems about whether there was a water cooler in the hotel he directed me to a staff st the ingirnsyion counter the man at the ingornation counter was puzzled with;3
needs updates and proper room maintenance bad experience trying to get things fixed would not stay at this location again and would not recommend vto families stay next door at the radisson hotel if possible;3
the hotel itself is nice and has the facilities you would expect the problem is that the hotel lifts are very slow and a number appear to be out of service this is not just in the main bank of lifts but also for the garage to get to your car it was a problem for our entire stay and only on occasion did the lift come in a reasonable time and not nearly full the lower floor guests often could not get on the lifts as they were always so crowed there was no convention that i saw and it happened in the morning afternoon and evening you had to plan an extra 5 min to get to the lobby;3
hotel is ok and lobby is actually very nice but the hotel rooms defy description for smallness of size2 people can barely fit inside with one person its crowdedive seen small hotel rooms in europe but these are smaller than anything thereyoull be shockedif you are attending lincoln center this hotel is greatwe got a deal on hotwireif i paid full price id be very angry;3
great location easy to get to times square central park and uw side but youre not kept up all night downsides the rooms arent the cleanest and they charge for everything even inroom coffee;3
the only reason i am marking this hotel as average instead of poor is because the management was nice enough to upgrade our room for no additional cost when we were first placed in an extremely old hotel roomfloor from what i can tell half the building or less is renovated while the other half is not they typically charge more per night to be on the renovated floors which is ridiculous given how much the nonrenovated rooms already cost the nonrenovated floors look like old office buildings and the rooms are unacceptable with the faucets making loud noises etc i would not recommend staying here unless you are willing to spend more to make sure you have a renovated room the area is good if you want easy access to penn station but because of that is extremely busy and;3
i booked this hotel because my wife wanted a hotel with a nice pool the first thing that i was slightly disappointed by was the price of parking 24 self park and 28 for valet its not like the hotel is located in down town san francisco or manhattan where space is an issue to be fair i was aware of the valet parking charges before booking hotel the second issue that really irritated me was that wifi was only free in the lobby for 3 hours at a timeif you wanted to use wifi in your room it was 8 a day and you can only connect 3 devices this is the only hotel we stayed inover our 2 weeks of holiday that did not have free wifi and we didnt stay in some great hotels the next disappoint was the lifts i wasnt aware before i booked the hotel but the hotel is doing a;3
this is a huge hotel1000 rooms very busy lobby you will always wait for a lift rooms old datedbathroom needs total refurbishment tiny wardrobe no fridge or coffee making facility in the room but comfy bed clean sheets friendly staff ok position in new yorkvery busy part of town ok for a couple of nights but the whole place needs a makeover;3
room clean and large room bed was comfortable and bathroom was large enough that two adults could use at the same time hotel very nice and convenient to universal and all of the production studios i would have given this hotel an additional star except i was told that i could not use the luggage cart because only bell hops could use them small point i know but i dont generally enjoy the whole bell hop experience restaurant only had bfast buffet but it was large and very well stocked lots of choices staff very friendly and helpful except the whole luggage cart thing;3
typical hilton in format but three major issues 1 the lifts are undergoing replacement and the wait to get tofrom the lobby averaged 15 minutes just too many people for the remaining working lifts 2 the breakfast was appalling the worst ever experienced in a hilton very bland buffet served in a cold bar environment it is as though no thought was given to providing catering services until the hotel had been built 3 the bar was the most unwelcoming cold uncomfortable area i have ever seen in a hotel other than perhaps found in a small chain motel so ok but dont eat or drink here and give yourselves plenty of time to arriveleave the room;3
we stayed here in august this past weekend the location is great and its close to a cute cafe starbucks and several shops to pick up fresh fruit the subway is right on the corner and its so easy to get anywhere in the city i would only give it a 65 out of 10 for cleanliness though the floor we stayed on the 8th was old old old the room was small which was fine but its so old it seemed dirty and rundown the ac unit in our room was very loud at least it blocked out my husbands snoring apparently the 11th floor and up is amazing theyve been updated and are a whole lot nicer i imagine more expensive too the elevators were slow though and very tiny there are two sets of elevators but it seems the other ones havent run for sometime the;3
i stayed at astor on the park for the columbia university graduation ceremonies i used expedia but where they show the stars and price but hid the name graduation week also was the week before memorial day and all the hotel prices were charging a premium the location was the best amenity for this hotel it was walking distance to columbia university the subway buses and across from central park nearby there were lots of restaurants and a small grocery store i was in room 504 which had nothing wrong with it though the room was small and cramped as one would expect in nyc the room furniture and bathroom looked like it was recently renovated they provided a hair dryer shampoo soap and conditioner there was a large flat screen tv but i didnt even turn it;3
we spent five nights here over memorial day and it was just fine things i loved the location i pushed a stroller from here to union square and back and it was just fine obviously convenient to anything uptown on the west side too there is a fantastic whole foods in the basement of the time warner bldg a couple blocks away that made for some easy cheap latenight dining the parking i got a valet package that included in and out it was so convenient to drive up have help unloading and then walk away there were a few hiccups with pickups theyre using a new text system and i think theyre still figuring it out the beds are very comfy and the rooms though small are nicely designed i found the staff to be generally helpful though not particularly outstanding;3
not only do the elevators need a facelift but so does the rest of the hotel if it were not for the gorgeous christmas decorations and the close proximity to universal studios this hotel would be vacant old carpet and obviously recently converted nonsmoking rooms added to the irritating smell stay away from the corner rooms on the 4th floor if possible;3
we have just returned from a 3 night stay at the astor on the park as we were very satisfied after reading other reviews before travelling i was slightly nervous about staying here but soon realised that there was nothing to worry about we arrived at the hotel from newark airport at about 430pm we were greeted by a member of staff who took our luggage the reception area is not huge but then you do not spend your time sitting about in this area so its perfect for its use the polite reception staff asked if we would like to have 2 rooms next to each other and also asked if we would like to stay on a high floor this was great as we had asked the travel agent to request a park view and we were not disappointed as others have stated the rooms are on the small side but;3
disappointed they never come to clean my room during my stay the food at the restaurant of the hotel is horrible and wind also first time i had this experience there is no pool and the gym is basic;3
back hall was very noisy due to tile bathrooms were old and mildew in some places the staff was extremely nice accommodating restaurant was nice and good food bed linens were confortable if you like nostaglisa this is the place for you but dont expect a 5 star experience;3
stayed for two nights during a west coast vacation with my son and husband the location itself is great convenient walk to the park the room was comfortably appointed had a corner room with the view of universal great way to get excited about our visit for the price that we paid in the mid 400 range per night i was surprised at a few aspects of the service we had requested a roll away bed for our son which was delivered to the room with a single pillow i called the front desk to request three additional pillows as my husband and i each sleep with three pillows my son with two the front desk clerk told me that it was against hotel policy to provide us with more than 1 additional pillow when i pushed back politely she would not budge i travel;3
i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights the room is as you would expect in new york quite small the bathroom was very old fashioned the bars attached to the hotel were very good the hotel is across the road from madison square garden and 10mins from times square the walk to times square there is a lot of homeless and people on substances but if you ignore them they will ignore you;3
we stayed here because we had tickets to paul taylor modern dance at lincoln center this hotel is right across the street and down half a block our room had an amazing view of lincoln center we stayed for only one night when we got in the room there was no heat it was a cold day the unit was blowing cold air the sent a maintenance person right away to fix it the room is very simple but you shouldnât expect so much more since the price is reasonable for the room and location is right next to lincoln center and central park we walked to mandarin oriental hotel and had dinner there at asiate so what you save on room you can spend somewhere else and enjoy the city the lobby is nice and trendy and door men very courteous we also visited rooftop lounge in the evening it;3
we stayed here for 3 nights on our way from san diego to san francisco after some careful research and review of fellow trip advisors we selected this hotel not expecting any bells and whistles but good average hotel standards and that is what we received location was good for our purposes and if you are looking to see any of the frank lloyd wirght architecture hollywood tourists or even griifiths observatory the location could not be better the front desk staff service was inconsistant but nothing to be upset about the attendant in the gift shop didnt realize that the front desk will mail your postcards for you and had told us that we needed to go to a post office to get stamps but couldnt tell us where one was the included breakfast was just okay and;3
sum up for the higher price tag i expect clear awareness on fees example if tax was included parking fees was expecting a full breakfast not limited to breads and fruits simple picture of a hot tub or mention of it online;3
perhaps i expected too much from a top of the range hotel but the rooms allocated were disappointing as they were both below ground level with a view of a service road into the basement the only positive being that it was only one floor to the swimming pool the other negative about being below ground was the noise from above from what must have been the gymnasium and one night sleep was completely ruined by the racket from above the atrium is impressive and the decor by the ballrooms is a sight to behold we didnt eat in the hotel as prices were beyond our reach but there appeared to be plenty of choice what was also impressive was the unlimited internet access and of course the ideal location to universal studios along with the free bus service though as it was shared;3
four hour delay in finding me a room despite reservations made a month prior they did upgrade me to a larger room shower leaked and flooded bathroom even after they supposedly repaired it otherwise nice room good maid service;3
we had both negative and positive experience with this hotel so iâ´m a bit divided this might be a bit long so stay with me first of all the checkin was good effective and professional i asked for a room on a higher floor with a view a few weeks in advance but we got none of this but we did get a refurbished room since i am a expedia goldmember but in the 7th floor and the view was right into the wall the room was cold when we came but the heater worked fast but there was no heat in the bathroom i was looking forward to a warm shower since it was a cold day but the shower had horrible water pressure the temperature was impossible to fix burning hot or freezing cold and the tiles on the floor was so cold that event though i left the hot water running;3
location is nice parking is expensive and the rate is confusing carpet is disgusting bathroom needs a fan or air vent service is good digital key never worked even though the staff reprogrammed it and ensured me that its working fine my bluetooth and nfc is on so thats not the issue;3
the hotel is a landmark and there were pictures of the way it looked through the years that was very interesting the hotel overall was nice and the staff was friendly the room we stayed in was very small i wouldnt stay there again unless there were larger rooms the internet was also very slow;3
one thing to mention here is location may be great but the room was small and cramped service was okay we only stayed one night but that was enough for one of the more famous hotels in nyc it failed to impress;3
stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip but my wife 1yr old son joined me for the trip location good being with a toddler having lincoln center right across the street was a lifesaver had him running around the fountain also close to central park not a whole ton of restaurants bars in the immediate vicinity but walk a few blocks north south and youll be able to find more options service good helpful friendly staff rooms overall a bit run down furniture bed was fine but floor bathroom ac unit needs an upgrade overall good stay definitely swing by the roof top bar for a drink;3
despite the mediocre accommodations the staff is absolutely stellar they let me store luggage even after i checked out for more than 12 hours plus they let me doze in the lounge while i waited for my ridiculous 340am shuttle ride even when there was a leak in our bathroom they were able to move us immediately to a larger room decent rooms and location great personnel;3
we stayed here a couple of days in august excellent location in the upper west side that was close to everything including the subway the room was rather small and sort of clean yet the room price was the best we found in manhattan so its all somewhat of a trade off price aside i probably would not stay here again;3
needed a place close to lincoln center empire is located right across the street pasquale at the front desk was wonderfull answered all our questions and help us with our needslots of restuarants in the neighborhood;3
this hotel is old and dated be sure to request a renovated floor the staff is very nice but the concierge was not very helpful she only recommended the restaurants on the property this was our second stay the rooms are tiny but this is nyc iâve accepted that the bathroom in our tworoom suite was also just ok clear signs of water damage and the tile was not as clean as i would expect the average night was 500 so very pricey we picked the hotel for location but may look elsewhere next time;3
the location for his hotel is great if you are visiting universal stuidos you can literally walk round the corner and youre there or if youre feeling lazy there is a free shuttle bus that will take you like a lot of hilton hotels this one looks like it hasnt been modernised since the late 80s the hotel rooms and pool area are tired and dated although they had 6 lifts only two were ever working and these were really slow so you often had to wait up to 5 minutes to get a lift that would then stop at nearly every floor the staff were brilliant very friendly full of advice and couldnt do enough to help we were given vouchers to use for food and snacks but never made this due to the timings being between 46 and we were never back in time the parking is;3
got this hotel as part of a package trip to new york it was pretty awful our friend from missouri joined us there and paid over 200 a night which is extortionate small grubby rooms with little facilities electrical sockets loose in the wall mold around the bath and shower this place wasnt really worth 20 a night the only plus side was the staff were really nice oh wellnew york was fabulous but if theres a next time it wont be in this hotel;3
this is a bargain for price in combination to subway proximity its clean enough to not bother me no bugs or anything that would gross anybody out the surrounding area is a bit to be desired never the less i felt safe and i was walking by myself;3
rooms are small barely any phone service in my room and view of another person room maybe my cell service wasnt working because i had an inside room bathrooms are cute bed was comfy room was clean great location nice wine selection etc this place doesnt blow me away but i do like the empire rooftop is always a good time loccatane beauty products in the bathroom are a nice touch walls must be made out of steel or maybe no one was staying on my floor because it was super quit which i appreciated as a single girl traveling this place is perfect i dont know if the empire is good for a family trip ill be back to stay here during fashion week;3
the hotel is just on the corner of 94th street onto broadway though do not think it is in the middle of the action as it is a good 4 km from dowtown humdrum this is a good base if you want to be somewhere quiet to relax after a hard day sight seeing central park is 1km east the metro line 1234 is just on the corner so a metro card is a good addition there is no bar or relaxing area but the a 40inch tv connects you with the newyork atmosphere the draw backs are 4 6 person lifts one which broke down frequently a long wait to got to any floor if you are on the 1112 floors then this can become tiresome hot water is tepid the king bedroom was well equiped and very clean staff though are friendly and helpfull breakfast can be bought across the road or opposite;3
we have just returned from this hotel ok we had some minor problems soon as reported they were fixed staff on reception what can i say but fantastic room and bathroom cleaned every day absolutley spotlessi have no issues whatsoever with this hotel you get what you pay for lets face it yre in new york you dont want to spend all day in yre room do you debs margie x chadderton england;3
i stayed at the empire hotel over new year for 7 nights the location is great and the price is good for a hotel on the upper west side the rooms are clean and the beds are really comfy and nice its a good hotel but a few things could make it that little bit better i had to ask for enough towels for 2 of us almost every day i also heard someone else at the front desk doing the same along with extra pillows only 3 in the room and clean glasses every day however every time i did they came along quick enough will i stay again yes could the hotel do better to really check the boxes and deliver a great stay yes;3
check in problems with no fee card had to use mastercard incurring conversion fee charges were confusing as they were charged refunded and charged again hotel and service was fine but a little noisy even from floor 24 overall ok;3
rooms are outdated and small but what to expect from the old building location was perfect for us since penn train station is just one block away not too far from times square and broadway theaters;3
this hotel is located unusually close to the terminals at lax which makes for convenient transfer tofrom your flight smooth and friendly checkin a large clean room with all the expected amenities however a disappointing view of a huge parking garage my inroom safe was locked when i arrived but security quickly came to open it after i had notified the front desk the bed was comfortable wifi worked well shower pressure was ridiculously weak the swimming pool is good sized though why it is heated i dont know as can be expected at a hotel this close to a busy airport you do get a lot of noise and smell of jet fuel there making lounging by the pool not altogether pleasant i did not try the fitness room on the top floor for breakfast i went for the breakfast;3
door to room and door to bathroom both rattled all night due to wind drafts horrible sleeping from that noise as sounded like people were trying to get in bathroom window doesnt stay shut letting in wind and cold air internet so slow we gave up property is tired especially hallways overpriced given all of that;3
ita really for the young families hope tou could add more activities and variety also if you could avoid just making people dizzy it gets boring at the end of 2hours leaves you with nothing much to do;3
recently stayed here with a group of students on a school trip the rooms do look a little dated but were cleaned every day towels and toiletries seemed to be replaced each day the heating could be noisy in the rooms but some turning of the valve stopped the knocking the wifi could be very slow but if timed right would provide a good service no idea when the right time was but occasionally would allow you to post images in messages and twitter etc the best part of the hotel was the staff nothing was too much for them on the last day we kept one room to store all our bags on returning to the hotel to be picked up by the coach we got caught in torrential rain they gave us a 2nd room to allow pupils to get changed before the coach arrived at no extra cost thank you;3
see questionnaire completed before leaving the hotel very poor beds bathroom shower leaked and we were not moved disappointing as it was our 32 wedding anniversary they did give us some chocolate strawberries which were very nice and a surprise but the wine we didnt drink and we asked to change it 3 days later they changed it but the anniversary had been and gone a real shame as it could be a great place;3
as others have noted location cannot get any better if you are visiting universal studios its a 2 minute walk location is not bad even if you want to visit glendale hollywood w hollywood etc this hotel is also less than 20 minutes drive from burbank bob hope airport so that is def a bonus for me i was here for a conference which was at the hotel and the conference facilities were nice the lobby and the public areas seem fine too the room itself was just average i actually prefer the rooms at embassy suites at glendale versus this hilton my bathroom was tired and showed its age the bed is fine and was comfortable in terms of soundproofing its a good thing that im not sensitive to noise as it seems like the walls were pretty thin more over the noise;3
the hotel lobby was nice but the rooms were small and the ac units in the rooms were old and noisy also the room we had just looked onto other rooms and the ventilation system for the hotel none of this was mentioned during the booking procedure;3
i stayed at the empire hotel for business terrific location a hopskip to the subway very key the empire hotel was a bit of a flea bag the last time i was there but that was over 10 years ago the new empire has had a makeover the lobby is a little too dark for me it felt more like the lobby of a nightclub not a hotel but the staff was friendly efficient the room was a good size the mattress the decor was above average overall the room was solid but beware of the bathroom besides being tiny not a surprise the sink isnt very deep the faucet is just a few inches away not big deal right well turn on the water theres a good chance youll create a little mess but hey its just a lilttle water right well how about if youre;3
cons i still dont understand why they only had one glass shower door for the shower water got all over the place and i spent at least 10 minutes every time wiping up the floors elevators are ridiculously slow subpar in room air conditioning pros great location friendly staff rooftop bar pool;3
this hotel is across from lincoln center julliard school accessible to metro stations 59 and66 it is in a good locationthey have friendly and helpful doormen and bar staff two of the front desk staff that i interacted with are not so friendly there was a problem with billing and that i believed should have been avoided and handled bettertheres a lot of good restaurants closeby and starbucks is just around the corner;3
days inn on 94th is a basic hotel with decent enough facilities staff are competent without being over friendly given the location it is decent value but if you are looking for comfort and luxury then this isnt the place that said it is perfectly good as a place to lay your head before getting out into nyc;3
we have just returned from a wonderful week in new york having booked five rooms for 13 female family members ranging in ages from 2370 initially some of the ladies were allocated rooms on the eight floor and they were in much need of decoration however the rooms were clean bedding actually looked new with a plentyful supply of towels etc in the bathroom alarm clock coffee maker etc however on enquiring at the reception desk about refurbished rooms we were moved to the fourth floor it would appear these rooms have been refurbished and were in a better state of decoration we had no problems with the lifts and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful when asked questions if your only interested in a clean bed and bathroom and not bothered about hotel facilities;3
we stayed at the hotel for 3 nights the hotel is an old preserved building as the most buldings in new york city the location is opposite the central park at the west side a quiet and safe area there are 2 subway stations near the hotel to go everywhere in new york station 96 and 103 i think 103 is closer the room was renovated with modern decor but was very small and our 2 suitcases fit very difficult inside i found a dead and burned cockroach inside the hairdryer i said nothing because we were walking all the day and we got back at night only for sleep the location is perfect but the hotel is moderatethere were many maps and sightseeing tours in the reception the staff was very polite smiley and helpful;3
empire hotel was fairly decent and in a great location across the street from lincoln center but it wasnt a 4star hotel though the room was small the beds were comfortable and clean the bathroom however was ridiculously cramped and poorly designed there was only a partial glass shower door so water sprayed out of the shower stall from the other half all over the floor the shower knob didnt turn and work properly so we either got scalding hot water or freezing cold water the sink was designed poorly so when you turned on the water it automatically ricocheted off the sink onto the person using it the bathroom was so small that you had to close the door to get access to the toilet paper behind the bathroom door all in all it was a very poorly designed;3
second stay in 10 years gone down hill room 508 was old and battered horrid laminate shower walls black with mould and coming away tiny bathroom with shower spraying all over floor broken shower toilet bed was comfy but nothing special room very dark and oppressive tatty hangers noisy air con and coffee maker that had a steady supply of tea not coffee really disappointed wouldnt stay there again unless some money is spent on rooms to get them up to scratch communal areas are nice concierge uri was great door men great and all but one of receptionists was very pleasant;3
checkingin was a breeze for us which i truly appreciate we were also alloted a good size bedroom and the bed are really comfortable location is great as well and the shuttle to from universal studios is a big plus i think that the additional fee for parking and wifi connection is such a bummer this two things are a common add on service given freely to checked in guests in almost all the different locations weve been to also a big turn off was that the room we were given although has good size is very near the gym so the guests who uses the gym very early and late at night when they drop the barbell i think the vibration and sound reaches our bedroom i was woken up early in the morning by this and had to force myself to sleep in spite of this matter late;3
the hotel is at walking distance from universal park great breakfast buffet to start the day apart from that it is a large hilton convention hotel which would require some maintenance ie lifts need repairs and motivated staffs same pitfall has many other hotel with paying wifi â¦ rooms where clean and large;3
positives for a family outweigh the negatives positives location perfect base for exploring nyc family rooms all 6 of us could stay together in the family suite price unbelievably good price we paid around â£1550 for 6 nights by nyc standards this is a great deal decent views of nyc the house keeping staff were very helpful negatives hotel rooms are very dated and quite noisy in so much as you can hear every conversation outside your room the room and lobby outside the room was scruffy but beds were comfortable and clean rooms are made up every day and staff are nice overall great value and perfect for a family of 6 i would stay here again if going with the family;3
nice hilton best part is location to universal studies you can walk clean rooms no club level for diamond members nice work out facility would go back good value they have a lot of places to get coffee and ice cream nice gift shop parking overnight was not too costly for s cal i would go back;3
i stayed there over weekend in two bed room with my son we came in on a red eye flight and the room was ready at 9am what a gift the hotel is old cared for but basic room was large for the money in nyc two double beds comfortable i like the neighborhood easy access to two subway lines room was quiet help came quickly for lamp needing repair i was well satisfied it met our needs;3
my two teens and i stayed at this hotel last week ill start by saying that the staff is friendly and helpful there is security at the elevators you must show a room key to get past them the room itself a double was roomy considering rooms in new york are tiny penn station is right across the street the beds are comfortable and clean our first room was facing the front of the hotel which was a bit noisy we were moved to a higher floor with a room facing the hudson river which was much quieter the upgrade was free since we were asked to move the cons are that the bathrooms are tiny the bathtub was peeling and there is only a narrow shelf above the pedestal sink where you can put your stuff and if anything falls off the shelf it could land in the toilet;3
room was old and very small although we booked suit room doors made too much noise from neighbors service was not good and took in some cases more 40 minutes to arrive breakfast does not include eggs or ham just bread and some butter cream cheese too crowdedif you arrive late you are busted they charge for each bag when you store it in their store room great location;3
the staff were so friendly and polite food at the lounge was good and the hotel decor was fun air conditioner in room was very weak and should be replaced our room refrigerator also didnt work they supposedly replaced it but i wouldnt put anything perishable in it beds were ok a good stay overall for the money nice location;3
hotel has a neat history and the lobby is really cool our room was small and the bathroom was extremely tiny and needed renovation it had a fairly recent wc but the tiles looked original and had been painted over the bathtub was from the 50s shower head leaked our floor smelled of smoke when we checked in we complained and to wyndhams credit the smell was gone by the next day it appears the hotel rooms start at floor 19 below that it seemed as though some of the floors were for long term residents a good number of college kids get of the elevator on the lower floors with take out one said he is going to columbia concierge was very helpful location is great if you come to nyc on amtrak to penn station;3
once you get past the very nice art deco the hotel quality is very basic rooms were very small and showing their age unplanned extras on the bill for phone and internet services which we were told was manditory and we diid not use however great location for a short trip to new york;3
it was ok nothing stellar rates happened to be good for the 2 nights i stayed best thing about it was adjacency to met opera which is why i was in nyc nick at front desk very helpful one of those slow draining flat sinks was annoying channel changer on remote was balky lots of noise from hallway rude guests running yelling talking loudly late at nightso the general clientele isnt the greatest school groups maybe it wasnt horrible id probably stay again but will check out another place that was recommended next time not as close to lincoln center though that is definitely the best thing empire has going for it;3
was not expecting the room i got to be what i asked for however it was clean and really quiet didnt hear any street noise internet however was spotty hope its been fixed;3
in europe this would be a 3star hotel but with caveats pleasant staff no restaurant a bit long in the tooth no plugs at desk for charging devices desk chair broken carpet has seen better days very small but clean room and bathroom some rooms on broadway noisier some face an alley no view but quiet around the corner from colbertâs late show ed sullivan theater;3
be careful when you buy a hotel package from another carrier i had a small cramped room where the night latch was frozen so did not work i immediately asked for a new room which was bigger and better the eclectic modern look attracted me to this location and that it was near times square the hotel is a bit old and can use repairs i stayed 4 nights;3
stay was just average with lot of niggles air conditioning bathroom condition etc stayed only one night so wasnt enough time to complain and get anything fixed but certainly not worth the pricenight;3
we stayed at this hotel first week of february for four nights our room was one of the courtyard room which was quite hotel is in a strange locatä±on on a very busy roadnowhere pleasent or interesting to walk upon checkin the reception staff was rudeeven didnt made an effort to greet us we had to load up our luggages to the troley and push it to our roomsame as check out room was clean and size was okbeds were cofortablecleaning service was the best bathroom was very basicnice toä±letteries free wi fi in room worked well complimentery breakfast was good parking was secure paid 18 dolar for a night hollywood hotel was a good budget hotel;3
small roomgreat tvgreat bathroomgreat location if going to lincoln centerhowever they do charge for coffee in the roomcoffee machine in room but they charge front desk very friendlystaff also very helpful;3
i stayed at the hiltonuniversal city for business reasons it was a nice hotel though somewhat dated i had a room on the 10th floor with a nice view of the mountains and the freeway with the famous la traffic the city walk was quite accessible via a shuttle or by walking over to get to the hollywood landmarks one usually drives but the metro can easily get you there there is a station just down the hill you can walk down and cross the street walking back from the station is more of a challenge because of the somewhat steep incline but we learned another way take the universal studios shuttle which stops at a covered area at the bottom of the hill to the ticket area then walk a liitle to get to the shuttle stop for the hotel or walk over to the hotel the concierge;3
first of all the good location is fabulous so close to central park columbus circle all the subways and there are lots of restaurants and shopping in the neighborhood also of course lincoln center the ok the furnishings are very dark and look as if they should be replaced for the most part i was upgraded to a larger room but it was still fairly small still the housekeeping was good and my room was clean also i wasnt able to get into my room until after check in time the bad there was no closet in the room only a wardrobe that also housed the safe as i had brought several dresses this was a business trip i ended up having to hang them on picture frames so they wouldnt wrinkle and the bathroom was very small you couldnt be in it and;3
the new yorker has an interesting history with many celebrities lives intertwined roaming around certain areas provides visual cues about a fascinating background the art deco features are also very attractive it is an older building and those are challenging to maintain while we had issues with bedbugs we did get moved to better accommodations and the last one did not have bed bugs but bed bugs are a new challenge in warmer climates the specialists did not find evidence in the first room but my husbands reactions on his arm from the first bedroom and mine from the first and second led to a horrible experience the last suite on the 38th floor there are 40 floors provided a breathtaking view of new yorker the managers tried to provide better alternatives and the suite;3
very very expensive for one night there were too many problems from start to finish and not enough help to resolve it or they did not seem to care the quality of their service was poor especially for the amount of money that i paid to sleep for one night in new york i was very disappointed im not sure why people in the customer service industry think it is okay to just be dismissive and disrespectful to other i paid my money to receive quality services and unfortunately that did not occur;3
the location of this hotel is great it is a few minutes walk from central park and close to the subway so you can get anywhere in the city we were in 717 which was a deluxe king room a couple of upgrades up but still quite small there is a stylish bar and reception on the ground floor which would have been an interesting place to hang out had the staff not insisted on keeping the main doors open making the area very chilly at all hours the hotel is twelve floors with a roof terrace on top which has a retractable roof making it good for winter and summer this area seemed to be taken over by trendy young types all evening with even a queue to get up on saturday residents get priority by the way plenty of options are around for eating eds chowder house next door serves;3
there wasnt anything wrong with this hotel judging by most of the reviews i thought i was in for it however when we arrived the front desk was very helpful we got there awhile before checkin time and the associate personally went to our room to check if it was cleaned it was and we proceeded straight to our room breakfast was fineit was the same every morning but what more can you expect for breakfast other than eggs sausage juice coffee and waffles location is excellent i had a car and a gps and everything was within 1015 minutes the room was a little small but sufficient we had a balcony facing the side street which blocked the street noise the bathroom was fine with a large standup shower we also had a small couch and coffee table the beds;3
me and my friend where there for one week on our vecation the hotel is close to centrum but very chabby the wallpaper is peeling off the wall and we got a smoking room and it was super nasty because if we just touched the wall our hands become yellow they really need a real clean up on the walls and carpet it is so dirty tha bathroom was ok but the water was dirty i know new york dont have clean water but this is sick the staff was nice and helpful the hotel had no breakfast even tho on their webside they say they have kinda stupid so we had to pay for our breakfast every day i would stay there again because the location and the price no other reason;3
while this hotel was fine in terms of cleanliness it was slightly overpriced for the condition of the room i had a 27m room and it was comfortable for two however i cant imagine how cramped the 11m room would be the decor in the room is very outdated furnishings were basically chipped completely of the paint rust covered the mirror and bathroom vanity the coffee maker did not work and it took several phone calls to have it replaced the blinds were half broken half slanted the picture on the website of the rooms is certainly misleading the one bright spot is the cafe across the street as there is no option for food or drink in the hotel the cafe has great fresh coffee and breakfast sandwiches one visit to this hotel was quite enough i wont book again if back in;3
great location the sheets were very low quality and extremely loud to sleep on i didnt even know that sheets could be loud before staying here the bathrooms are so tiny but it is new york one set of elevators were broken and the remaining one elevator was tiny and slow wait times were over twenty minutes i took the stairs six flights after running the marathon bc of this not awful but not ideal and many runners were staying here;3
used the hotel tonight app to get a last minute room at the empire hotel the location is nice and our room on the 7th floor was much quieter than i expected the window faced another building and not the street which helped travelers should be aware that the room was tiny while the decor was nice it was hard to even go into the bathroom the space was so tight our room also had no closet just a tiny alcove with a curtain there is a charge for the coffee and tea for the keurig which is absurd the hvac system is also really old and on one of the hottest nights of the year the room was only cool on the lower half when we stood up it was hot for one night just fine but wouldnt recommend for those staying for a few days;3
stayed here for four nights on my first trip to los angeles overall hotel is not bad although it needs updating and new decor our room was on the small side but good enough for two bathroom needs some work our room was on the main floor right next to reception so its noisy all night beds are okay pillows not so much location is good there are food places within walking distance metro stop is close by maybe a block away there is noise almost all night since there are a few hospitals nearby neighborhood is safeno real issues there not a bad stay;3
there seemed to be a lot of negative reviews of this hotel so i dreaded what we would find when we arrived for our holiday in new york however we were pleasantly surprised this may not be the best hotel in the world but for what you pay i think you get a reasonably good deal the hotel is situated on the west side of central park in upper manhattan in an area that is a little insalubrious at night however we had no problems and even coming home late at night everything was very quiet and we never felt afraid the hotel has the normal features a lobby reception a bellboyman a basement area where you can access the internet get complimentary tea and coffee from a machine and go to the toilet our room was satisfactory it was clean provided a tv with many;3
it has character and charm the people are great every one of them structurally radiator heat is outdated and really destroyed our sleep and any chance of a return during the winter ever again but the place has a lot of charm;3
we reached late night after a long journey 09th 08 2018 room was small didnt look very inviting as we were really tired traveling just crashed out for the night next morning we had the impression the breakfast was on the house so it was on booking but were not served otherwise an average stay;3
although i was initially very disappointed in the first impressions of this hotel i changed my mind you dont go to new york to sit in a hotel yes it was basic but it was clean clean towels etc every day and staff who were very helpful with good advice its location was a bit out of everything but a bus stop outside for returning on an evening and subway close by for the morning start there is a little deli on same block with good coffee and bagels and free wifi;3
first impressions set the tone when i checked in early in the day not expecting my room yet and the registration clerk tried to upsell me early access to a great room for 50 cash only i declined and checked my bags as i had a day of work meetings and didnt need the room until later little did i know that id be downgraded for having declined when i finally returned to claim my room key i was surprised to find id been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home it had a lovely view high on the 35th floor which i appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold very cold even though the thermostat was set at 72 i could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the uninsulated painted over bathroom windows the bed;3
i stayed 4 nights in a standard cabin on fourth floor room 451 i would definitely recommend this hotel if there were not for two things bed bugs and a very noisy air condition first the rooms are very small but they their job very good they are practical and comfortable even if they are very tiny the shared bath rooms worked very well and were always clean only at one occasion i had to wait otherwise there was always a free toilet or shower when i need one the small room and the common bath rooms are compensated by the lower price compared too many nyc hotels personally i rather spend my money in nice restaurant bar or go shopping the location in west village and meat packing district is very good and itâs a short walk to the subway on 14th st and 8 ave there are a;3
i stayed at empire hotel for five nights last spring during my business trip to nyc it was conveniently located and the room is reasonably spacious and comfortably the staff were friendly however the overall hotel condition looks a bit tired and needs a good facelift breakfast was not included and i have to purchase breakfast at the rooftop restaurant in the same building every morning the breakfast menu was mediocre but it cost additional 23 each morning;3
small room difficulty with coffee machine disturbed often by housekeeping when i slept late one morning front desk unfriendly with laundry and airport shuttle great location though just off lincoln centre;3
hotel has great location deluxe rooms with views are great but very expensive standard room with queen is very small and at our stay overheated staff friendly and courteous but unable to help with any problems;3
this hotel is beautiful full of history and character and the staff were so welcoming and friendly it was the new york welcome we needed what we didnât need was a room that was so small so unclear how to get a room with a balcony when they are all the same size that it couldnât fit two suitcases that room was also directly above a nightclub that had beats pounding until 4am thurs sat our first night was without sleep basically the only way to avoid feeling the mattress beats was to stay out until then which isnât fine for everyone i imagine one night we got into the ballroom and couldnât believe they suggested we call them up if the sound got too much how could we stop the party in a club that size anyway stay there if you can but make sure youâre not above the;3
aside from not being let into our room because my brother failed to put my name in his reservation when we got back to the hotel 3 elevators were broken and we had to walk 1 flight up to the service elevator our room was nice the people working there were nice and jeff the porter was especially nice;3
the hotel had very friendly staff but accommodations were not great you wouldnt walk on the floor barefoot the bathroom was tiny without a shower curtain or door so floor always wet the inside of bathroom door had peeling paint and you couldnt open the blind because of the dirty air conditioner view would never go back;3
not a bad hotel per se but youll have to pay extra for everything eg making a coffee in your room is 3 and as for wifi thats 1295 for 24 hours in room which is bad enough on its own but that is only for one device you are offered free wifi in the chilly lobby but that was hopeless taking ages to get a connection which then dropped off after a few minutes;3
beautfull art deco style hotel excellently positioned on 8th avenue near penn station easy walking distance to most of the nyc sights rockerfella empire state radio city music hall and lots more negative 3 out of 5 elevators not working and queues building owing to high demand on working elevators 3 attempts to activate a working key 2 double beds squeezed into a small corner room;3
me and my partner came here got a good deal and tried the upper westside friendly staff to be fair lift was as slow which was annoying the corner cafe next door was good tho so worth popping in for breakfast was good for the price didnât like the snoop dog look a like in the reception area was there everyday in the same leather jacket and sat in the same place eye balling everyone funny;3
stayed here in november for 5 nights the location is brilliant for central park but a walk to times square and 5th avenue was at least a 4050 minute walk but there is a subway located on 103 street which is fantastic to take you to 42nd which is where the main attractions are only 275 something like that the hotel itself was very basic friendly door staff reception staff a little miserable but didnt bother us as it was literally a bed for us as we were out exploring the city all day and night the bad thing is that there was no hot drinking facilities in the hotel which was an issue for us in the morning and before going to bed the area near the hotel is quite quiet so wouldnt want to be walking round an unknown area at night looking for hot drinks my advice would;3
the hotel is famous for its lovely bar area which is apparently fratured in gossip girl unfortunately the rest of it is pretty disappointing to be honest the bar is lovely when it is open and the bartenders are not prompt the reception staff are far from welcoming and we had to wait beyond the check in time and if we hadnt had kept on asking they wouldnt have told us it was ready the rooms were really small even for new york standards but they were clean and the maids did a consistent job for the week we were there the roof bar was dark and dingy and overpriced the views you get from bar 65 at the rockefeller were 40 storeys higher and much better drinks were also cheaper and for a hotel outside of central manhattan i was surprised given the choice of hotels in;3
i arrived in my wheelchair after a 23 hour flight from south africa via london i was quickly ushered to a separate desk next to the check in counter after a friendly easy check in mohamed stopped me before i went to my room and said he would like to upgrade me from a standard room to a bigger room in the new section on the 7th floor to give me more room for my wheelchair mohamed went the extra mile the room had great space was clean and the bed comfortable the location was central with staff like mohamed i will definitely use the new yorker in the future;3
great location in walking distance of the metro little italy east village very basic amenities you may need to ask for extra towels or toilet roll happy with clean beds bathroom could be updated as with the carpeting throughout the property located on forsyth street opposite open community spacepark nice change from being boxed in;3
i have recently returned from a family trip and we stayed at the new yorker location perfect not too close to the noise of times square but close to 5th avenue for shopping etc and just around the corner from the empire state building the rooms were large so space was not and issue and they were very clean daily maid service however they were just a little tired chipped paint tired bathroom etc kids loved the room but having paid a lot for the trip i was a teeny bit disappointed tip the tick tick diner is expensive family of five breakfast nearly 90 so take a walk around the corner to the skylight diner amazing food and great atmosphere proper american diner;3
overall this is not a bad hotel its quite centrally located and very close to some major subway lines the room was comfortable and reasonably spacious for the price however prepare to spend a large amount of time waiting for the slowest and smallest elevators you have ever taken in your life we unfortunately got put on the top floor and only one of the elevators in the whole hotel goes to the 13th floor theyre also used by maintenance staff to take up and down trolleys of supplies to the room and when theyre in there theres no room at all for customers i witnessed quite a few customers getting angry at the hotel staff over this issue elevators aside this hotel is a good one its great for people who are looking to save some and dont plan on spending all;3
it was an ok experience tub was clogged but it was late when i checked in so i did not bother reporting it until check out the next morning;3
little gutted there was no tea coffee in room but facilities were downstairs perfect place right in centre unfortunately there were no views out window just bricks staff were lovely and helpful the hotel was dated but wouldnt stay here again;3
overall i liked the property the staff was friendly and the location was great they are also pet friendly which is a plus my only issue was with warm water in my room but i would recommend this hotel to a friend;3
we are just back from 4 nights at the new yorker the location is superb but the hotel leaves a lot to be desired the staff were friendly enough but the whole hotel needs gutting i appreciate it is an art deco style hotel and some features in reception are very charming but it needs totally refurbishing our room was clean enough but so so dated and i doubt its been touched since it was built it felt very old dreary and depressing the worst thing about the hotel was the lifts we would wait up to 15 minutes morning and evening for lifts down to reception and then back up to our floor again after a day out there were at least 3 lifts out of order with no signs informing anyone of this the queues of people waiting for lifts in the lobby was ridiculous this really;3
i stayed there for three nights for the second and third nights i could not have enough towels to use because they failed to put enough towels that is unbelievable also the shower head was broken room is small;3
near to central park the room was a little tired and small with no proper wardrobe just a rail with a curtain the air con was very old and the charge for wi fi in the rooms extortionate but the staff were very helpful and free wi fi in the lobby also access to a room for printing off boarding passes which was very useful the sky bar looked very good except for the maã®tre de who needs lessons in customer service and due to his attitude we walked out;3
was very nervous about staying here the beds were comfortable along with pillows room was sort of cleaned each day some things replaced each day some not but a phone call to front desk the issue was soon resolved my main concern was the noisy air con it was so loud good location subway so very easy to use especially with the iphone app would i use again probably not but defiantly the area;3
great location and friendly staff liked the interior but it was a little old the aircondition was very nosy and the air in the room was bad old elevator the sundeck was nice but the swimmingpool is very small nice for kids;3
i booked the days inn due to its location near central park for my last trip to new york with my wife i paid extra to upgrade to a superior room and it was not the greatest room i have stayed in the furniture in the room looked as if it had come from a skip down the road i had requested a low floor as my wife does not like heights but as i had paid for the upgrade we were on the 12th floor after the first night i asked to change and was told the upgraded rooms were only available on the 11th and 12th floor so we switched to the 11th floor this room was better but still the furniture had seen better days i could not fault the service from the staff but dread to think what the non upgraded rooms looked like as the receptionist told me i would not like them after;3
my husband booked the room with the hilton directly for the 2 of us upon arrival we were given a room with 2 double beds even though we had requested a king or queen they have no wait list so we had to check everyday to change rooms finally two days later a king was available though they had no record at all of our request after speaking to no less than 6 people none the less the rooms were very clean very spacious with decent views room service menu is extensive and the food was excellent pricey of course the pool is very nice with an oasis like feel with lawn and cabanas but poolside service is lacking you have to really hunt for menus and a phone to place an order it seems it would benefit everyone greatly to have easy access to smoothies;3
we stayed for three nights family of four with two teenagers checkin was easy and straight forward we had both rooms on the same floor as we had requested having heard about the limited size of new york hotel rooms our rooms were fine you could walk around both sides of the bed the room was clean and tidy although the decor is looking tired there was no kettle in the room to make a cup of tea only a coffee maker which is very annoying when neither of us drink coffee we turned the air conditioner off at night as it was so noisy we couldnt sleep with it on we used the roof top pool once early evening after a hot day sightseeing it is very small and very cold but a welcome opportunity to cool off before going out for the evening the lobby flooring was being replaced;3
have stayed a couple of times a year for several years booking 3 rooms per stay i stay an average of 710 nights per stay this time was unacceptable all you want to do when you are working all day in the city is come home to a comfortable well stocked room on this trip i never had a complete set of towels and had to call each night to get wash rags etc as i mentioned i stay for 7 nights min they never changed the sheets on this trip great roof top bar but i am not sleeping there this is not the service i have experienced in the past or i would not have been staying here again moving on and i hate it i love the hotel and the neighborhood;3
sure we got lucky and booked our weekend trip to nyc on the hottest day of the summer two years in a row this year i booked a junior suite because the rooms are tiny otherwise and my thought was that ânicerâ room would not have the issues we experienced last year needless to say it was 100 degrees outside and our junior suite on the top floor never got below 80 degrees which for the record is not a comfortable sleeping temperature at least for me you canât beat the location and the pool is a fun space that is full but never crowded having the room on the 11th floor was very convenient to the pool the pool is really the only reason we booked here again next year we will find a different more updated hotel with an outdoor pool in manhattan;3
we stayed here in october before a cruise so it was booked as part of a deal by our travel agent it is located between penn station and the empire state building and an easy walk to times square the lobby was very impressive our room was a big disappointment it was small and outdated and in need of a refurb there was no hospitality tray and not even a bottle of water the view from our window was a wall and sky ok for 2 nights;3
definitely not a luxury hotel very well located close to the airport but the swimming pool is strangely outside the hotel it could be a carpark you have to cross the lobby to actually go to the swimming pool the rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller and more than ordinary as you can see on the photos the bar and the fast food restaurant is really not at the level you can expect from such an hotel no champagne no more sandwiches at 11 pm and the pizza they call it flatbread is really a cheap frozen stuff well useful hotel with a nice view a nice gym and a nice breakfast but not glamourous you feel like at work in a not so nice hotel but useful;3
myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 5 nights in decemberjanuary the purpose of the trip was to celebrate my 30th birthday on new years eve we found the lady receptionist who checked us in to not be very friendly barely spoke two words to us and did nothing in the way to welcome us to the hotel our room was on the tenth floor and was so warm we had to leave the window open all day and the aircon had to stay on at night which was a bit noisy the room was ok the bathroom was small but manageable and fresh towels were provided each day there is a wide selection provided in the mini bar and food on the dressing table all of which cost a fortune so we didnt touch it we had a few drinks in the lobby bar one night and found the prices to be similar to many other;3
i felt as if hilton is becoming greedy with money versus quality of services and room type the price for parking and price for room service is outrageous very money hungry and i was not at all impressed this time around i stated last year and the prices and quality of all was much better i could not even get a two bedroom room;3
you cannot beat the location its on a major subway line and across the street from penn station we stayed for three days in early november for our anniversary during the marathon weekend and it was a bit steep in price 1000 for three nights for a very very small room given the overall condition of the hotel the first morning we did not have hot water and the second day the hot water was so hot that we could not adjust it to get it warmit was either scalding or cold whats with that also we had a pair of pants missing that was hanging in the closet in the morning they were there in the afternoon when we got back they were gone whats with that it is an old hotel so we did not expect it to be pristine but overall it was kept up for the most part it;3
the room was honestly pretty clean and was of average size the only downside was the shared bathroom but it really didnt bother me all that much hotel is in a great location within walking distance to central park or morningside park for the price this is a great deal;3
small but neat n clean rooms paying for a hostel so no need to expect like a hotel good washrooms and kitchen but no aircon or fan in room friendly and helping staff sometimes you may find bugs in the bed;3
the art deco hotel is in a great location but is somewhat tired some of the staff were simply doing a job and struggled to extend the courtesy to guests that one would normally expect the addition of a hefty resort fee of well over 30 per night was both unexpected and hard to justify given the quality of the hotel rooms are understandably small given the location but they are also a little dirty and could do with a refresh and better daily servicing by the cleaning staff;3
hotel looks worn room was okay but had a freezing cold shower every single morning which was totally unacceptable told the front desk and i got the impression it happens all the time iâd never stay here again way too many other options in nyc;3
i stayed here for two nights while attending a board meeting at juilliard so the location was ideal the room was quiet and attractive the bed was comfortable and the staff was friendly and responsive after i got home i discovered that i had left my ipad behind and lionel vassell of the hotels security staff was kind enough to send it back to me right away by fedex extra kudos to mr vassel and his team and especially to gladys of housekeeping who found my ipad and turned it in to the security desk my complaint is that every surface in my room was cluttered with items that could be purchased for an extra charge several 8 bottles of water a tray full of expensive snacks and supplies including charger cords and a pleasure kit and a mini fridge packed with;3
the hotel is conveniently located and the lower floors are very clean and secure the checkin process was very slow however and there was always a line and a wait we were told our room would be ready by a certain time and then it was not this happened three times the room was small but comfortable however the bedrestpillow smelled horribly it was obvious that it had not been cleaned which is a bit disgusting especially when the high price of the room is considered;3
a bittersweet experience this commentary refers to the single or double cabins con the noise of the ac unit whether its on high or low makes the same obnoxious dinning noise wearing earplugs it faintly sounds like you are on a night flight pros if its anything that would bring you back for the affordable rate and the amenities that match it is the rain shower beautiful the loos are clean and quite presentable the two sinks on the marble counter in the bathroom area are nice and clean cafe on the premises the cocktail lounge hall is decadent and the grottoesque bar area staff are pleasant nice flat screen tvs with cable in each room and two tvs in the doublebunk rooms headsup if youre a man lucky us have an empty bottle;3
no upgrade offered asked for univeral view but got hill view restaurant full of people waited half an hour for my drink but got the wrong one;3
the room was small put out the do not disturb sign and hung up our towels when we got back sheets and towels were changed why bother to post signs about being eco friendly when your staff doesnât bother to pay attention;3
i have a mixed review for this hotel on a surface level it was nice clean nice looking amazing location it is not kid friendly the staff was very friendly and nice but hotel service was spotty at best we had someone come to our room 3 times to just change out a blanket we reached out to the hotel front desk regarding babysitting services listed in the room book and never got a reply nothing there is no room servicefood no microwave no room in the mini fridge for anything but the payperdrinks the tv did not include any premium channels and you have to pay 13 for any on demand options the tv picture was pixelatedspotty so it would have been a waste to purchase anything there were also movies advertised that were not available to purchase if you have;3
lets start off with saying that hollywood hotel was not what it was made out to sound like locationwise it was close to the metro red line station and various buses but the nearby area did made it feel like i was in a run down neighborhood my towels had some hair and an unknown black stain on it the decor on the inside of the hotel was kind of dreary and dark i was expecting a much more grand hotel for the actual price they listed per night good thing i only paid 30 per night thanks to orbitz we requested for a courtyard facing room and didnt have any problems getting it it was on the first floor so we have direct access from the room to the courtyard havent used the wifi much but the speed seems to be decent one redeeming quality was the breakfast they have;3
travel agent recommended great location close to hells kitchen for great food options room was tiny and needed updating peeling paint in bathroom carpet frayed in hallway bed was very comfortable and it was immaculately clean so those were saving graces;3
after arriving very late in the evening our experience turnt sour rather quickly with the staff member that greeted they were extremely rude and unhelpful we were also given a room which did not match any room advertised on the hotel website the next morning we raised our grievances with gisel who i have to say if it wasnt for her i would probably never go back to this hotel she empathised and apologised for our experience so far and relocated us to another room throughout our stay gisel and her other colleagues were the most helpful and in fact i could not ask for a better service so thank you very much they definitely went above and beyond breakfast is also available the chefs were brilliant nothing was too much and they were very friendly be sure to have;3
decent hotel good location though 8th ave is a hub for homeless people constantly asking you for money the room was pretty small and basic but itâs all we really needed given it was just a place to sleep at night the only downside was that the duvet was insanely thin and the tv was quite blurry check in was quick they took my debit card and immediately took 300 100 for the facility fee which they keep and 200 for the security deposit which iâm waiting to get back which was a bit jarring but it is what it is what i felt wasnât fair is that despite paying this facility fee it costed 30 per day to use the coffee machine in the room which was just a basic machine with some plain coffee pods it was also another 30 i think per day to have a mini fridge in your room;3
we stayed here for a week the staff when we checked in were very unfriendly and were almost to the point of being rude and during our stay very unhelpful and the hotel parking is expensive the neighborhood is not the best and i wouldnt be walking around there at night there is not much in the way of restaurants but there is a lot of restaurant that deliver and they have their menus is the rooms but on the plus side our room was great big and airy over looking the pool complex it was clean and tidy it was quiet except for saturday night there is a free breakfast very morning with a chef and this is well worth it there is also a very small bar which is not open very often;3
stayed dec 30jan 3 for rose parade bowl rooms nicer than expected cafe sierra food less than average mostly geared toward asians seafood stays out 247 odor overwhelming service just average concierge not nearly as helpful as other hiltons great location easy to get to hollywood la beverly hills room service took almost 2 hours hotel is surprisingly illequipped to handle large capacity would stay there again but depend on eating elsewhere;3
stayed in this hotel while visting new york with my friend pros close to the 96th street subway stationand central park good value and great service cons there was just one elevator working the time i visited and the wifi is really bad which was unfortunate because we were trying to plan our day and to book a ticket to our next location if you dont care to spend a lot of money in new york and youre not picky i would recommend this place;3
i used to live in nyc and had never had to stay in a hotel and was fairly horrified by whats available at what prices after we got over the shock of the very nofrills aged appearance of the hotel and the fact that there were a lot of funky things like peeling paint in the bathroom wires hanging out in the room and different colors of paint within the same spot in about 47 layers including covering some old doorbell on the inside of our room we decided it was not as bad as we first thought really our initial impression was that something was going to come crawling out or that we would hear the people in the neighboring room breathing thin walls but none of that was the case it was actually quite clean and very quiet we stayed on the main floor in the back just;3
just to say that overall we enjoyed our stay at the hilton it was close to universal and the 405 freeway however there are a few annoying problems we paid to stay on the executive floor and found we were on the floor below which wasnt a hardship except that the lifts were so slow and being a renal transplantee the stair option was not too attractive the executive lounge facility was far too small especially in the mornings serving the two floors of executive rooms or so we thoughthowever when you consider the numerous upgrades people seemed to be given from other floors offering access to the lounge it felt like a macdonalds most mornings despite the excellent staff to appreciate a fantastic executive lounge facility you should visit the hilton arc de triumph in paris;3
hotel is very central everyone was very pleasant rooms were clean however a bit small and could do with being updated the rooms are very dated the best thing is the location as you could go shopping and sightseeing and go back to the hotel for a rest and a cup of tea or just to drop off the heavy shopping;3
problem for a family with children to eat at the hotel restaurant was a big problem poor service no refills had to ask twice forgot a item we ordered didnt receive until we where finished with our meal the rest of our stay was very good clean rooms nice staff;3
stayed dec 2018 loved everything about this hotel stayed again jan 2020 and the only thing we enjoyed was our room service was minimal at best no communication between departments made to feel like an inconvenience more than a guest sent in an email to wyndham and was basically told i would be better off contacting the hotel directly so pretty much passed the buck i figured my concerns would fall on deaf ears and i was correct;3
to be perfectly honest this was not a four star hotel compared to a uk fourstar hotel it was very dark and dingy and we were a little disappointed as this was our honeymoon the only plus side where is the location it was only a brisk 10 to 15 minute walk to times square;3
a great location right across from lincoln center with easy access to subway lines rooms on the very small side but it is new york after all on the plus side our room was very quiet the heatair conditioning is very close to the bed and cycled off and on so needed cover for the cold air then got hot and no top sheet only a duvet staff was friendly and helpful;3
the hotel is pretty tired we upgraded our room from the last time we stayed and the room was the exact same tiny size with a view the tub really needed refinishing the elevators were very slow with only a few of them working there is no gift shop so buying a soda after the lobby kiosk closes is not possible the staff were mostly pleasant but our booking was difficult to achieve as it was a bit complex;3
sorry this place is almost great the no shower doors and antiquated heat and air is not good location is great its loud in ny but it is what it is its a bummer so many people still smoke lots of conveninces;3
me and my boyfriend visited the newyork hotel the end of january soon as i arrived i was happy with the room small but had an amazing view photo what i have shared great location 5min walk to macys 10min to empire state 10min to time square and across the road from maddison square garden we both went to see the basketball game as it a tick off the bucket list to do in newyork and what an amazing time we had both not being basketball fans but the atmosphere was brilliant really made our evening they have a stake house next to madison square garden nick and steph it can be pricey but you pay for what you get we went there on last day in newyork before we set off to leave for our flight the worst part about staying here was we had no room service in the whole;3
i very much appreciated being close to the subway and close to all the theaters in midtown but the allnight noise due to the major construction work in front of the hotel was terrible the rooms are small but clean;3
i recently stayed at this hotel and had a great time it was my first time in nyc and i traveled alone so naturally i was scared to death i actually threw up 3 times before i even got on the plane to go yes this hotel is run down and not the ritz but i feel it gets a bad rap here in these reviews i booked it before reading them but once i arrived and the shock wore off its simply nyc the management is onhand 247 and it is in the quietest safest area in the central part of manhattan yes the rooms are small the restrooms are shared dont forget flipflops for your feet and there is a slight odor of old building but otherwise i felt extremely safe my room had fresh linens each day the baths rooms and halls were cleaned each;3
this hotel whilst not outstanding ticks the respective boxes for somewhere to stay on a budget in new york its location is fine only a short ride on the subway to all the main attractions and the staff were helpful when required yes the rooms maybe could do with alick of paint but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed my stay however be careful when using the lift as it is an experience to behold;3
my boyfriend and i stayed at astor on the park for 4 nights my first visit to new york for my 30th birthday having read good and bad reviews we like most were worried about what to expect on our arrival on checking in staff were friendly and helped us upstairs with our bags we had room 407 so had a park view room was small but very clean and bed so comfortable bathroom very modern and clean we used the subway lots during our stay two nearby on 103rd and 110th and even used it late at night to get home and felt very safe this is a very cheap mode of transport as you will always have other things to spend your dollars on and taxis can be very expensive we had an amazing time in nyc and astor on the park is just the ticket and such good value yes the radiators are the;3
the only reason to book this hotel and pay accordingly is to avoid having to travel to universal studios by any shuttles it is the closest hotel to universal studios entrance a very short and easy walk if that is worth it to you by all means book it the hotel itself is very average our room had an excellent view of universal but it was not very well cleaned we found various pieces of papers under and next to the bed for example the room was of a motel quality lets just say but again if you want close proximity to universal and just need a place to crash for the price of hilton this is the place for you if you dont mind traveling a bit to universal there are other less expensive options oh and unless you are a hilton points member you do not get free;3
i had one of the small rooms and it really is small make no mistake at first i was a little underwhelmed but then it grew on me the place has an interesting history titanic survivors were housed there and you feel this strange cinematic atmosphere seeping out of the walls the bar club off to the right of the lobby looked beautiful but it was dead when i went in for a look my room was one with shared facilities and the bathrooms are very very busy i always had to wait but that was just a mild inconvenience the only real negative for me was that i asked for my room to be serviced early in the morning and was out for the whole day only to return to find it the way i left it then i had to call down and they said theyd get housekeeping on it and i had to wander out;3
i was petrified about going to this hotel after reading all then reports on here from clean to bed bugs and creaky lifts it was our first time in ny and i really thought i was going to a borstal plesaed with reception which was nicely decorated if a little dated the staff were okay i requested a low floor after hearing about the creaky lifts and when we got there they had put me on 11th floor after arguing with a lady who said she had nothing else the manager came over and told me i could be on 2nd floor thank god as my husbanc used the lifts and they were very scary rickety unreliable and very small room was clean no bed bugs but i did pull off the dodgy looking blanket room had 2 queen beds which were very comfortbale the carpet was very sticky so i wore;3
breakfast could have a bit more better more cheese pls breads were not good they have all the facility to do so i beleive thath they need someone from the food industry to just look into the quality the elevator also needs to change its like from 18th century very slow the neighbourhood is very shady dont feel safe if one wants to take a walk loved the live coounter for breakfast;3
the hollywood hotel is a pretty nice hotel partially updated i say that because our room had new wood ceramic tile curtains nice beds bedding furniture a refrigerator microwave and safe in avery nice cabinet but you could see dirty spots on the wall where previous pictures were hung and the wall had not been painted there was also an old paper border that had not been removed i am not sure why you would spend the money and put new stuff in a room and not paint the halls rugs and fixtures were very nice there was a patio bar with nice furnishings and a lovely garden the front desk staff were very nice but the checkin was more drawn out than in most hotels it didnt seem that there was enough staff to take care of the clients needswhile the hotel was very nice;3
the hotel is quite old with very old furniture environment and rooms i didnt feel comfortable at the first room they put me in so ive asked to move it felt better but still old and not very clean i found some hair in my bathroom and in my towels;3
i live next door and my kids and friends stay there when visiting the rooms are basic but adequate rooms in all nyc hotels are small this one is small too but adequate and nice to be on the park;3
my daughter and i booked tow cabins for an overnight in new york the good providing relatively inexpensive lodging for those of us just needing a clean and safe bed in a good location fills a seriously under served niche in nyc the cabins are well designed and attractive the bad the lounge area was closed to guests for a private event the entry guarded by no fewer than six bouncer type guys milling around the small lobby making us feel like intruders in the hotel at which we were guests the only other gathering place the rooftop lounge was closed to anyone under 21 this included my daughter leaving us with nowhere to relax in the hotel in a way this reminded me of the surf lodge in montauk not really a hotel more of a night club with rooms attached;3
the lady named micki in front desk did a terrible check inshe have an bad actitude and donât explain nothing about the installation of the hotel dont give me breakfast cards and the next morning i charge for the breakfast;3
dont upgrade for a view 80 extra and all i saw was a tree line room was not ready at 15 hours after checkin extra parking fees and incident fees upped the price of the room no breakfast included and no microwaves in rooms its great being that close to universal studios and their beds are very comfortable is my positive for this place;3
given its location directly next to universal studios it is not surprising that this hotel was rather touristy but it makes it less than ideal for a business stay it is nice enough though and quite clean and well maintained;3
arrived at the new yorker hotel and i am very disappointed so far staff at front desk not exactly welcoming or even helpful a touch rude to be honest once arrived told we have to pay an extra fee for the honour of using the wifi phone calls and gym none of which we need but not optional i wouldnt class this hotel as spotless in anyway its quite dated shabby to say the least in many areas and as for the room queen with a view dont bother no coffee machine no fridge unless you want to pay an extra 65 dollars a day lets see how the rest of the week goes;3
so if you are going to lincoln center and want to walk comfortably to your hotel for now the empire is still the only it otherwise id give it two stars all the staff are super friendly but the rooms are badly in need of attention plus the place is still dark and creepy at least now there are more dining options than in the days of he vampire both inside and outside the hotel id go outside the hotels chowder house is average in a city where average wont do i had one cocktail one glass of wine a salad and an entreefor 8700 youll pay the same at most of the big name places nearby but youll have a much better meal and for less expensive there is a pj clarks anchoring one corner of the hotel check your room first if booking in summer and make sure the;3
we were treated well by the staff they addressed any issues we had quickly and with courtesy that being said there were issues with our stay plumbing problems occurred more than once elevators were unreliable the rooftop lounge was often reserved so guests could not enjoy this amenity even the lighted sign on top of the building has letters burned out needs some major upgrades;3
the best thing i can say about this hotel is really only the location it was near just about everything the bathroom was extremely small for the price we paid when you exited the elevators you were greeted with a combination of old smoke and pickle juice smells did not spend a lot of time in our room;3
the jane has a great location feels safe is close to subway busses restaurants and bars the shared bathrooms are clean and there was no waiting the robes and slippers are also great perks for wandering around the hotel however there is no escaping the rooms are small the whole floor area would be the size of a queen size bed half the room is single bunks and the other half is for your bags and clothes and shoes and getting changed and trying to turn around if you stretch your arms out you easily touch both walls even though you only go to the room to sleep it did affect our enjoyment of ny as we never felt relaxed the whole time but it is cheap and there is a restaurant and bar and is safe;3
we stayed one night at this hotel for a concert at the apollo very small room with fridge barely room to turn round and small en suite personally i thought it was expensive but then you dont get much change in london ok for what we wanted but wouldnt want to stay more than one night staff quite helpful and room clean;3
good hotel room was comfortable washroom small internet and room temperature setting was not consistent the room we were in overlooked an alley i would avoid this room as it felt constraining i had my family probably not the best for families better for couples;3
there were some renovations going on when we visited in january the elevators were being worked on so the wait to get to your room was sometimes quite frustrating but better that they are maintained than not front desk staff were very pleasant one or two a bit too personal and not as professional as they should have been i like to get my reservation and room assignment done and go to my room friendly is fine but there is a line that you do not cross the room was very nice with a slight view of universal and the mountains we were there during el nino so we saw lots of wind and rain more than anything else bed was fine nothing outstanding room was clean nice big bathroom this is where the coffee maker is and lots of shampoo and other essentials for;3
we picked this hotel for its location near central park and is well placed fo the bus and subway it is a good half hour walk away from madness of times square the lobby area is nice but the rooms could do with a bit of an update the maintenance standard are not great as the bathroom door in my parents roon still had decorators tap on it and the plug sockets were loose they charge for everything from the internetwifi to the coffee inthe rooms although the wifi is free in the lobby 8 for a bottle of water and 3 for a coffee in the room th ebar is not cheap either 14 for a glass of white wine if you stay here i would say pop to the shop round the corner and get your water and coffee there loads of places to eat near by the flame restaurant is a 5 min walk away and;3
well when we checked in for some reason our reservation was cancelled we had to speak with a manager and it took hours before it was resolved but it was only resolved because i had to forward them a copy of my confirmation my room was super small and outdated i just want happy with my stay at all;3
from cynthiyas welcome the staff were courteous the inclusive breakfast buffet plus omelette and waffle station is one of the best weve enjoyed the rooms are spacious but lacking in character the bed was only ok and the pillows were not comfortable the bathroom fittings were weary and in parts filler had been badly applied to crumbling tilingwoodwork in terms of value it is not the cheapest hotel in hollywood but it certainly is not the most expensive to say it is close to universal studios is a bit of a stretch but the metro service is close by and in 45 minutes we were in the park it is not in the heart of hollywood but that would cost more;3
full disclosure this property wasnt a first choice for us but the location to universal and areas we wanted to visit were key to our decision to stay at this property the rooms were surprisingly spacious and a good value but there were several service and maintenance issues that should be addressed we had to call engineering twice once to fix our shower due to lack of hot water and once to fix the safe which malfunctioned locking our belongings inside often we would call room service or areas within the hotel with no answer at all and would resort to calling the manager at the front desk to connect us the service at the restaurant was really inattentive we had to ask for coffee and water several times before the waiter would bring them when we checked in we were;3
had a lot of misses mainly with the cleanliness the service was lacking requests went unfulfilled and the room was not clean there were crumbs stains and dust on the furniture was hesitant to even sit on the sofa because of the mess and the toilet area had stains gross but the hotel room was very quiet except for hallway noises but no airplane noises and conveniently located just wished the service and cleanliness had been better;3
small room but big enough for the two of us we were only there to sleep and change to go back out in the evening fresh towels every day some traffic noise from the next street over but not awful didnt disturb our sleep hotel staff helpful some more confident speaking english than others but we didnt need to ask for much organised our taxi to jfk on last day and gave us a room to store our bags and get changed before leaving fab location bit of a culture shock first day but we were tired too felt like a safe area and subway station less than a block nice little shop on the corner so handy to buy soft drinks walk through chinatown little italy for broadway soho financial district etc east village in the other direction very handy and would recommend;3
the hotel is in a great location and you can tell it was once very nice its in desperate need of an update rooms were hot and it was only 25 degrees outside we had to turn on the ac wallpaper peeling off window treatments didnt close properly downstairs bar closed furniture worn and tired however the staff is all wonderful and very friendly;3
hotel was ok but i am always offended by bottles of water being placed in the room with price tags on them the room is over 200 a night hilton can spring for a few bottles of water concierge was very helpful local restaurant prosecco was excellent and reasonable;3
id wanted to stay at the jane ever since reading about it close to a decade ago travelling with a friend we decided the location quirky decor and history made up for the tiny bunkbed rooms and shared facilities and the jane delivers on all of these the lobby is pure wes anderson the ballroom is grand and full of bankers who appear to have put a gram up their noses and the staff are friendly the rooms are admittedly tiny but well laid out in terms of ledge and hanging space lack of hangers is my pet hotel peeve and underbed drawers the bunkbeds are surprisingly comfy the bathrooms are clean very subway tile stylish and mostly empty and now the bad this hotel stinks the rooms have no ventilation except for a weak ac unit and coupled with the regular;3
the ameritania is an older hotel on the corner of broadway and 54th st thats a convenient location but the downside is a lot of street noise windows are not very well soundproofed but the blackout curtains do a great job blocking light and a decent job reducing noise rooms are small dark and dated and desks are tiny so the rooms are not a great place to work bathrooms have minimal counter and shelf space which is annoying towels and amenities are stingy internet is free and pretty fast and reliable front desk service is minimal an acceptable hotel but nothing special;3
ok stay location was great but on the flip side very noisy always trafficnoise at all hours of the night beds were not very comfortable neither were the pillow other places in nyc that are better for price;3
first let me say the empire was very accommodating to us the location is convenient close to the subway line easy to get down town from here central park is a quick walk and lincoln center right there this older hotel is a mixed experience the staff were friendly and helpful but the infrastructure was hit or miss the elevators were slow and some out of service the room was very nice but the shower leaks water onto the floor due to a bad design during a renovation i heard other guests at the front desk looking for other rooms as there ac wasnt working and such getting to the roof top pool is an adventure elevator to 11 floor then several flights of steps;3
overall we had an amazing time in new york we spent very little time in the hotel the staff st the hotel and the bar and rooftop area are definitely worth a visit the only downside is that the rooms were extremely small and the air conditioning was soooo noisy the breakfast was also not great it was like warm;3
the room was tiny but i knew that already the hotel was quite good for its price and the decoration was quite charming the shared bathroom was always clean the only problem with it was that in the mornings there was too many people using the sinksmirror area and being subjected to unpleasant views like and old man in his underwear with his robe open leaving the bathroom also the room was noisier than i expected i could always hear people enteringleaving their rooms and the cars on the avenue beside the hotel;3
average hotel when you first see the hotel its lights arent even fully working on the big red sign that you can see from afar its clean and staff are friendly we did get a free bottle of wine and strawberries as they thought it was our wedding anniversary which is wasnt but it was a lovely gesture the rooms are tiny bathrooms are also small you also have to pay for the wifi in your room or use the free wifi in the lobby which is ridiculously slow as everyone else is using it the hotel is quite close to the nearest subway and to get to places it is very central if you want a bargain search for century 21 which is very close for designers bargains for a huge reduction its about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel central park is also a short walk away and is a;3
i stayed at the hilton universal for two nights in december 2021 i knew the experience was going to be rough as soon as i pulled in i didnt see the sign for self park so i went up to the front and asked where to go the person out front pointed to a ramp and said down there they pointed to the valet ramp we thought it was weird but whatever the valet came over and started screaming at us we explained we were told to come here had no issues moving but could someone show us where to go they kept yelling at us to leave great start check in line was long and slow but they got us in the room was on the 4th floor good size mostly clean i saw some dirt in the bathroom and the phone was filthy youd think theyd increase cleaning with covid but no;3
the hotel is ok but the rooms are too small often the housekeeping service didnt leave any soap shower gel or tissues in our room and when they start cleaning early in the morining they were too nosy in the hallways and they call me every single day asking about around what time they should come back to do the room;3
but the downsides 1 the horrific noise background music at an unbearable volume in the foyerreception area 2 we had to ask for new towels as the room despite having been cleaned hadnt had the towels replaced these took 30min to arrive we were on the 2nd floor not particularly impressive when we were tired the hotel itself was clean and tidy and the staff were unfailingly helpful a courteous a special mention to romeo who helped on several occasions we found the hotel ideally situated for many museums the lincoln centre and eds chowder house just next door central park columbus circle and central manhattan were a short walk a good place to stay for our first visit to ny;3
check in time was at 4p but room was not ready until 430p when we got up to our room it was still dirty smh there was hair on the bathroom counter pistachios shells razor blade covers on the floor it was definitely it worth the money we paid;3
had this hotel booked for us by an agent who knew it was a special trip for us so we were disappointed location is great an easy walk from times square and just across the road from central park the staff were so friendly and helpful but it is tired and the decor is so dark it is not a place you want to spend time in bedroom furniture was on last legs paintwork was in poor shape and bathroom adequate just poorly equipped and badly lit no plug in sink ac unit noisy and innefficient;3
very very expensive for one night there were too many problems from start to finish and not enough help to resolve it or they did not seem to care the quality of their service was poor especially for the amount of money that i paid to sleep for one night in new york i was very disappointed im not sure why people in the customer service industry think it is okay to just be dismissive and disrespectful to other i paid my money to receive quality services and unfortunately that did not occur;3
hotel was nice for a short break but i wouldnât stay again due the âresort feeâ they add on when you leave i know lots of hotels are doing it but it doesnât mean you have to leaves a bad taste just have clear pricing if you want an extra 30 a night then just put your price up;3
my sister in law myself enjoyed our stay at the new yorker the only complaint we shared was that our room bathroom was very small there was no fridge microwave or ice machine on our floor the housekeeping staff hotel staff the restaurant bar staff incredible and we thank all of them for taking such good care of us while we were there;3
this was my second stay at the new yorker hotel in one year mr miguel and ms nayab both staff members at the check in counter promised me to reimburse the facility fee of usd 29 per night but somehow i still got charged during the check out i addressed this issue and ms shamagne said she will asked mr miguel and ms nayab if this was true they would come in at 3 pm and i would already be flying back home ms shamagne wrote down my email address and phone number and promised to get back at me she never did even though i asked her two times before leaving the hotel itâs really unpleasant to deal with unreliable staff especially when you are there for a short perioud and trying to enjoy the city i had to solve this issue when i came back to the netherlands;3
a great base to explore ny from room was small but it was clean staff great uniforms shared bathroom not a huge problem its worth the reduction in price to share room secure and nice location check in and check out was easy room had wifi;3
well located near central park and lincoln center swimming pool is more the size of a double jacuzzi and water is cold nice terrasse at the 11th floor with good music excellent breakfast can be taken at whole foods market in colombus circle;3
this hotel is situated very close to the empire state building and everywhere is very accessible the rooms are a reasonable size and if you want more space there is the option to upgrade the staff were all helpful and friendly and everywhere was clean sometimes the lifts got very busy at peak times i was sad that they donât cater for gluten free and as a coeliac it was like going back in time to how the uk used to be we were given breakfast vouchers which were no use to myself or my daughter because there was no pastries that were gluten free we tried the restaurant one day as my daughter is vegan and again we really struggled she lived on salad and chips and the breakfast i had was slapped onto the plate it cost about â£25 the hotel has 80 floors and the view across the;3
i get that its a great location and that its nyc i get that but puhleeze the stellar customer service provided by zunachy maggie eugene and jose doorman made the high priced yet average room bearable note wheelchair accessible is apparently code for no electrical outlets in the bathroom like styling hair should be optional or something wt the room itself meh it is very dark and the air conditioners will drive you crazy beds are comfy and housekeeping was amazing customer service outstanding the aforementioned people are the only reason why i might consider returning;3
it the standard you would expect from a hilton hotel rooms were a good size quiet and we slept very well staff were friendly and helpful great location of visiting universal studios only a short walk away there is a takeaway coffee and pastry counter located past the main breakfast counters if you want a lighter and less expensive breakfast;3
myself and a friend stayed here after we had spent two nights at white house nyc dont go its horrific we needed somewhere to stay for a third night so i opened up trivago and basically picked somewhere else on manhattan that was very cheap the hotel was really nice and well kept in all areas but the rooms were very small we had a bunk bed and id say if we werent in the room too youd struggle to squeeze a second one in the room thats how small it was the bathrooms were shared with other guests but all really clean and well maintained the rooms also had a couple of tvs and air con which was really loud so we couldnt have it on whilst we slept and we couldnt leave it on when we left the room either because the room key has to be plugged into the wall to;3
very good location room 1005 outdated due to old fashioned wallpaper overpriced breakfast noisy air conditioning and difficult to control the temperature in the warm roomdoor of bathroom deserves some new paint;3
i have visited many hotels some with resort fees and some without this hotel has absolutely no reason to charge a resort fee there is no pool no jacuzzi no lobby amenities they dont even think enough of their guest to provide a drink of water in the lobby a bottle of water or a water fountain this hotel is a 3 star at best the rooms are tiny the bathrooms are dated and in need of updating there is no vanity therefore there is no where to place anything in the bathroom they charge 25 a night for a rollaway bed although our check in person waved the fee the entire hotel is dated most of the electrical plugs are hidden behind the beds;3
extremely helpful staff and although the hotel looks inviting from the outside and lobbythe rooms are in need of renovation the bed was hard and old and i could not sleep because of this the bathroom was ok and there are plenty of clean towels there is no breakfast available i found the man on reception very helpful;3
chose this hotel to be near central park all the main attractions but without the constant noise light of being closer to times square we also wanted a modern hotel with a pool bar area so we could chill with a drink at the end of a busy day the hotel location was as we expected though in retrospect i probably would have liked to have been a tad closer to broadway etc the downstairs bar lobby bedrooms were very modern but the rooms are small and can be extremely noisy if you are on the lower floors therefore near the air conditioning units the pool is nice and has some fantastic views of the city but is sometimes closed for private functions drinks in the pool bar are very expensive even for ny unfortunately we never managed a visit to the rooftop bar we;3
i stayed with my daughter in december the receptionist and the guy in the lobby who books taxis to the airport were rude and unhelpful our room only had a view of the wall opposite but the beds were lovely we got charged â£20 a night for a facility fee for facilitates we didnt use gym and office which added an unplanned â£100 to our five day stay this is a rip off which had left me very angry as i had budgeted very carefully for this holiday;3
i needed to crash for 1 night in nyc and was arriving at midnight so this hotel seemed ok affordable however i was immediately worried when i was offered the opportunity to inspect my room before deciding to stay i went up and had a look and the room was as basic as you can get basically a bed and a dressing table showers down the hall the bed seemed clean and i was to be out in a few hours so i decided to stay however when i went to get into the bed i noticed the sheets were stained that was it for me unfortunately i slept on top of the bed with my clothes on i would not recommend this accommodation the rooms and showers really need refurbished;3
the location is ideal the subway is 2mins across the road and 5min walk to central park 52 fare from jfk in a cab plus extras and tip so expect up to 70 in total if you are sight seeing id recommend the green bus company being the easiest to get around and the fabulous concierge chris i think got us a great deal at 45 each for 3 days hop on hop off uk visitors dont be intimidated by the subway either as its much easier than the london tubes we were on honeymoon and the lovely staff sent up a bottle of champers for us nice touch we had an express queen room which i wouldnt recommend unless your travelling solo for one night the desk did tell us when they checked us in they dont normally sell it and i can see why you have no floor space and we had 2 large;3
having just spent 8 nights there id like to chip in too we were a group of five people aged 32 to 71 staying at the riverside studios and enjoying our stay there excellent location for the price reasonably clean room and bathrooms plenty of hot water in the showers no bedbugs large rooms with clean refrigerators no odd smells fast and efficient reception desk beds made every day and rooms cleaned the place is rundown paint is peeling off the bathtub and the sinks you do have to learn your way around getting a comfortable temperature in the shower the lifts are somewhat old however only the very oldest among us used it the rest liked the the exercise on the stairs we only entered the reception on the day of arrival and when departing since you dont have;3
arrived on 5th feb and the lock was dodgy on my room so the porter asked the receptionist to get me another room she sorted this out after 20mins and i was given 805 the room was very clean although the tv didnt really work and there was no view to speak of although neither of those bothered me whe i headed out i was shown directions for the shower and told how to get to the metro the room was cleaned and towels changed every day only thing was maids didnt lock the room after they had been in it was noisy from about 7am due to the plumbing but i had taken earplugs as where i come from is the middle of nowhere with no noise 247 i was glad i took themthough didnt get hassled to book anything through them i was there on my own and was out early each day for at least;3
location is ideal which is what you pay for as actual hotel was not worth the pricevery comfortable bedshoweverhad problems getting air conditioning to work properlyno vent fan in bathroomsand no microwavenot a huge problembut if you stay more than one night good luck reheating anything;3
if youre reading this and youre planning on staying here then dont be put off but the title of this review you dont go to new york to sit in your hotel room yes it has a communal bathroom and isnt the nicest of areas to stay but it is definitely worth the money the location is not great but its not the worst either and taxis to and from centre of manhattan are around 20 we had no problems with this hotel the beds are actually really comfy we stayed during february and the temperature outside was around 7 10 and the rooms were nice and warm during the night new york is new york you shouldnt have a hard time trying to find something to regardless on the time of year you visit of course youll want to see the city from the top of the empire state but its;3
this review would of been better but for bad service when checking in arrived about an 1 hour before check in time and was told our room wasnt ready which was fair enough so we waited in the bar for them to contact us to say our room was ready over 2 hours later we still hadnt heard anything so went to reception only to be told our room still wasnt ready even though they knew we were waiting so we asked to see the manager who was extremely helpful and upgraded us to another room the location is great for universal some of the lobby areas need updating but would still recommend even after the check in fiasco;3
i stayed in a queen room with a view and the room was reasonably sized however quite dated and the bathroom had aged and needed some attention half way through the holiday i turned on the bath tub tap and brown water was coming out of it i called reception and his response was to let it run for fifteen minutes and see what happens throughout the holiday the water was not totally clear but was not as bad as it was when it first happened however i felt that the staff member was not approachable to solve the matter the maids were very good throughout the stay and every staff member on our floor 29 would say morning to you and have a good day which was nice the elevators are very very very slow you could be waiting up to five minutes in reception and then when in;3
the first room we were put in was not in acceptable condition but we were moved upon request if the room advertises a pull out couch do not count on it being in useable conditionotherwisethis hotel is fine and is in a great location;3
i had high expectations of this hotel as it has been recommended via lots of different social media channels the hotel is a wonderful art deco old new york hotel and iâm sure it could tell many a story of people staying here in the past i would recommend you ask for a higher floor as we were on the 7th floor and the view from the room was disappointing nothing to see having seen amazing pictures on line i can only imagine you would have to pay a great deal to have any decent view the rooms are small and i know ny is renowned for this as space is a premium my biggest grip was that there was not enough space for 3 cases and you couldnât hang much in the tiny wardrobe we shared with my daughter so effectively 3 adults with nowhere to open our cases other than throwing;3
if you stay herebook a room with a streetwiev be prepared that your minibar are very expensive the staff in the reception seems a little noninteressed but you gonna love the bellboys the lobby is very nice a very expensive wifi in the rooms;3
believe you me if you are to read the reviews of some of the people on here you might not ever stay in a hotel in nyc or anywhere else for that matter you have to remember that these people booked a room at a cheap price and are expecting the palace hotel i was trying to stay in nyc for one night with my wife to see a comdian that we both liked alot there were alot of hotels that would not book me because i was not staying for more than one night and it was not acceptable for someone to occupy a room for one night that another person could occupy for up to three nights ie we need the money i went onto bookingscom and found the days inn on 94th street it was one of the few hotels that would take us for only one night we arrived at the hotel at 11am and they;3
the empire hotel is a conundrum on my first stay here in five years or so first impressions reminded me how much i like the neighborhood across the street from lincoln center how much the upper west side feels like home it was many decades ago and what a dearth of good hotels there is up in this part of the city the hotels weird though and if i hadnt paid a very reasonable 133 a night almost unheard of in nyc although there were a few properties advertising in that general range typically it would be in the same 200plus or so per night cost that is more usual for hotels rated with 4 stars the overall rating would be a 2 12 the conundrum this is a quirky older hotel and i like quirky where theres been a spotty refurbishment my room was a;3
this is a good overall hotel after reading some of the posts here i must say it is neither as bad as some say it is nor as good as a 5star it is great in terms of location it sits right across from lincoln center and 5 minutes away from columbus circle subway stop few minutes walk to either central park or the museum of natural history furthermore it got a starbucks and duane reade drug store convenient store a big plus in my book once you step inside it has a very chic lobby i suspect they are aiming for the whotel crowd here the room is definitely on the small side but on par with other hotel rooms in nyc and some european cities the room was clean with decent amenities as per some of the comments i laughed when i observed the nonclosing;3
stayed for 4 nights at the hotel great location right across the street from 34th street and penn station so ideal to travel around plus in walking distance to a lot of attractions such as the empire state building and times square the lobby is wonderful this is an art deco hotel and the lobby is of a high standard shame we couldnt say the same for our room which was tired and in need of refurbishment having said that the bed was very comfy and the maid service very good some people have said they only check if you have a hotel card dependent on the colour of your skin this was not true they check everybodies and do so in a casual friendly manner all in all a good hotel that is just in need of some tlc in some rooms;3
room was rather high priced for what we got compared to like a comfort in suites wouldve rather stayed there gave us a room with a door adjoining another room which was like thin as cardboard could hear the peoples business going on which was uncomfortable with two kids with even the wall were this as the room on otherside could hear them simply lauging at the tv show they were watching yes room was clean nice size bath but for iver 200 a night nothing special no breakfast etc only stayed because semi close to universal studios next time would stay somewhere else save the money and just take a cab that short bit and still come out ahead nothing speacial for the money;3
stayed for four nights on a business trip checkin was super fast at 8pm for me but not for my colleague the next day because computers were down not sure how often that happens but very inconvenient since he was arriving from a long international trek definitely a historical feel but standard rooms are tiny and not many updated features showers were very difficult to get a decent temp several tv channels didnât work espn outlets questionable etc beds are comfy and rooms are quieter than other similar hotels in the area staff was friendly in hotel and connected establishments location is solid with tons of options within walking distance but not sure itâs worth the price especially with the mandatory daily fee just include the 30 per day in the room rate;3
i stayed in this hotel back in october and had a great experience i booked it again for my parents wedding anniversary and got them the romance package they didnât get a room with a view or their free breakfast coupons they tried to ask a desk person about it several times but were told to come back i called but could only be told what they were suppose to have they were disappointed;3
it use to be a great hotel now staff is not helpfull and not nice at all i stay without water and none said sorry the hotel looks like old without care this was the 4th time i stayed there i use to love it now i am very disappointed;3
the best thing about this hotel was the location absolutely fantastic very clean and staff very helpful only downside was hidden cost of 400 deposit also upon checkout we had to pay 5 per bag to store in luggage room;3
hotel has good location for lincoln centre but needs a lot of investment rooms old and aspects that have been âupgradedâ feel like it has been done superficiallycheaply premium internet is actually pretty rubbish in my room it struggled to stream a movie was better one night than another they donât even put the two âfreeâ water bottles in your room each day have to collect from reception presumably to keep the number they actually give out down overall pretty disappointing can live with on a business trip if have no choice but definitely nothing special;3
pros location is very convenient to hollywood pleasant and helpful staff clean very near metro line cons expensive parking smelly room not enough lightsnoise overall its okay to stay for the price except for the parking fees;3
i stayed at this hotel in january 2012 for one night i had tickets to the tv show the view and this hotel was close we had a junior suite on the 3rd floor and it was very nice very large room huge windows overall it was a nice stay but i have to say it was very loud outside while i was trying to sleep and you can hear everything through the windows i am not used to having 100 taxis and 200 buses outside my bedroom window though i think there may have been a bus stop directly below my window so the stop and start of the buses was loud and i had trouble falling alseep other than that very clean and nice spacious room very easy walk to anything best buy was directly across the street which came in handy when i forgot to pack my phone charger you can actually walk;3
i was really kind of surprised how small 2x3 meters maximum 7x9 ft hotel rooms can be what i really disleiked was the doorman staring at me like bein transparent without helping at all with 2 heavyyyyy suitcasesstrange i thought but no tip later the girl at the reception really the best of the whole hotel okay i am picky they even gave me a park view toom the second day but come on so small old tv sets and 1960 cheap furniture the windows were so dirty i thought it was raining outside but nojust lack of cleaning no breakfastof course rude recepcionist in the morningor maybe just the new york way something positive metro in front 110th parkway station cline dont take a 70us cab from jfktake the airtrain then subway to 42nd street then c line;3
the room was cold and a little dilapidated veneer coming off desk but adequate good safe for leaving valuables no wardrobe just a bar for hanging suits etc and 2 drawers for everything else only just big enough for everything i had brought for 8 days internet generally reliable the selection at breakfast was limited but the quality was excellent;3
hotel is affordable and in a great locationsteps from penn station 20 mins walking in each direction to times sq or chelsea pleasant staff but rooms are outdated layers upon layers of old paint on walls bathrooms not modernized hotel hallways dark and lifeless a complete reno project is needed;3
the hotel is in a good location our room was comfortable if a little cold although we were on the 7th floor the traffic noisein the city that never sleeps could be a bit intrusive at times all in all it was an enjoyable experience for a senior couple celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary the highlight of the trip was an evening dinner cruise on the bateaux newyorkmagical;3
i stayed at days inn broadway for 3 nights from 6th dec till 9th dec 2013 the rates i paid was quite high for this hotel as it was during the weekend but i have no regrets the hotel is quite decent the staff were quite friendly warm and pleasant though not many are there the room i got was an old room i guess all rooms are of same standard only nothing fancy but practical and good enough space and amenities the best part of staying in the hotel is not inside the hotel but around and nearby it 96th subway station is just 2 mins walk from the hotel 12 3 trains stop here time square 42nd street station is just 2 stops away and less than 10 minutes there are plenty of restaurants around the block just opposite the hotel is corner cafe which serves good;3
we stayed at the hilton for two nights on our way to las vegas the location was excellent for a one day visit to universal studios easy to get to hollywood and easy to catch a cab to the airport even though we had a very early flight although the room interior was a bit dated it was spacious our room was on the freeway side so we heard traffic pretty much all night the bed was comfortable water was not complimentary the breakfast buffet was very nice service at breakfast was attentive and the bell staff were very good but reception staff were a little mechanicalblasã© we had just traveled 12 hours by plane plus a one hour cab ride so expected a little more from reception we had room service dinner one night and it was very good presented on a round;3
the reservations staff was very accommodating of our request for a room on a lower floor because the jewish sabbath required us to take the stairs instead of the elevator perhaps the price we paid was the tiniest of rooms that opened up to a dark air shaft the hotel location was excellent for our attending family events and the opera nearby and the service friendly we actually would consider a return visit to the empire but opt for a more spacious room even one with a view our weekend in the city was wonderful and despite the comments above we had fun and the hotel served our purposes;3
would have given the place rave reviews but on a gorgeous 85 degree day the pool was closed it was closed yesterday for rain sign went up this morning saying the pool would be open at 11 due to mechanical issues later the sign said 130 sat out waiting for the pool until 215 when they announced the pool would not be opening at all picked the hotel because of the poolâ¦paid more for it than we would have for a hotel without a poolâ¦and no access to the pool at all room was comfortable;3
we reserved a month ahead of time as part of a package from universal studios we selected a room with a pool view we called the hotel directly day before we arrived to confirm we were informed the check in was 3 pm we arived at 330 and were to there was a only disabled room but it was not ready or we could have a room next to the stairs overlooking the parking lot we had to wait 45 minutes for the room the room as clean and modern consistent with hilton quality that we expected i sorry we have dogs but dont feel the need to bring them on trips but for those that do please dont lock them in the room all day and night we called to complain after we left our room in the morning hearing a dog barking came back during the day to rest and it was still barking and at;3
in comparatio with new york hotels and hostel this is quite cheap and not bad is close to the metro station which let you be in the city center in 15 minutes the are is relax and quiet with some bars and restaurant aroun is a good option if you donâ´t wanna spend a lot of money for accomodation and you want a decent place;3
located in a great sport in midtown ny the hotel is very close to major attractions and transport facilities it is walking distance to emire state building and times square however the rooms are very basic and no coffee and tea facilities unless you ask room service then they give you a coffee machine very busy hotel at all times of the day the security staff were very alert even at 200 am in the morning;3
we enjoyed our stay at the empire hotel the location was great within moments of checking in we were strolling in central park and it wasnt too far to walk 16 blocks down broadway to get to the theater the decor is chic with a tiger print arm chair in the room and lovely down comforter the room itself was teeny tiny just enough space for 2 double beds but really it was the bathroom that was ridiculous the door is just shy of touching the toilet the sink faucet is so low it practically touches the sink basin making it tough to wash your hands and there is no counter space to put any toiletries which makes it ridiculously tough to get ready in the morning without risking your belongings falling in the toilet the shower lacks a door so you are bound to get;3
very poor elite status recognition staffs need training lounge food is poor i didnt have time for breakfast location is good as it is right next to lax didnt use the shuttle service so cannot comment;3
we picked this hostel because we wanted something a little cheaper and werent fussed with having to travel into london to sightsee thankfully we werent in the room very much as it is incredibly small so much so we could barely open our suitcases and not particularly clean there is no air conditioning and our window couldnt open so it was like a sauna there is no lift and wifi must be paid for a couple of positives the bathroom was modern and light we found the hostel very quiet despite visiting during peak season and the best thing about this hostel is its location only a couple of minutes walk from the tube and only a couple of minutes from a large selection of restaurants and shops i must admit i have seen worse so if all you need is a bed and a hot shower then;3
i had scheduled four nights and had spoken directly to the staff to get the reservation i had explained that i really needed a quiet room since i cant sleep with lots of weird noise checking in was different than any hotel ive ever been too first of all a computerized sign in then a statement that a 100 deposit is taken from every guest when i inquired as to why i was told that often people watch hbo movies and the deposit helps to cover that most hotels just inform you that any additional charges will be put on the credit card that you register with so i have no idea why they need to take a deposit perhaps its needed if folks pay in cash back to the noise my room was in the back overlooking the parking lot the room was extremely hot when i checked;3
this is a nice hotel but quite frankly i am a bit disappointed the rooms are not that big at all a hotel that claims to be upscale with ridiculously high rates should offer more space and amenities the gym if i dare to call it so looked more like a house basement rearranged with a couple treadmills mind you the internet is not free either for over 200 a night really yikes needs a lot of improvement and a make over;3
itâs not easy to find a reasonable priced decent room with ensuite bathroom in manhattan therefore i felt happy when i found this place which i think itâs a good option if your wish is to sleep in the big apple the location is good and the area is safe subway line 1 has one stop at 103rd street and another one at 110th street so both stations on broadway are very close to 107th street a nice street by the way where the hotel is this area in the upper west side contains also many small businesses cafes and restaurants we tried fex âtropical sensationâ in amsterdam av between 106th street and 107th street âmamaâs pizzeriaâ on the corner between amsterdam av and 106th street and we heard good reports of âthe manchester dinerâ on the corner between broadway and;3
while there may be a little too much fresh paint here and there and our room did not have a bathroom fan the staff is very pleasant and the sleep is restful the location is remarkable columbus circle lincoln center central park the smith for breakfast and buloudâs bar epicerie and restaurant the subway is also blocks away which is super convenient to get to times square and penn station;3
the elevator service was awful the equipment was in the process of an overhaul and long waits and cancelled call lights were the norm rather than the exception my reservation was inexplicably messed up i am a gold level hilton honors members and somehow got switched from a king room to a room with two double not queen beds who puts double beds in a hotel room anymore on the positive side the pool bar service was great not sure i would stay here again as the property is not up to even the hampton inn standard in some ways;3
location was food room was clean and everything worked well but no tea making facilities staff not overly helpful but pleasant enough check in and out was straight forward need laundry room lots of people have a stopover in the big city before going on;3
we decided to stay at this hotel due to its very close proximity to universal studios our biggest issue with the hotel was checkin at the heart of the issue is that we felt they didnt really acknowledge our diamond status or treat us specially like we are used to having happen at other hilton properties for example we had selected an upgrade option for the room and they made us pay for it we understand that this is technically is allowed in the diamond program but this hasnt ever happened at other hilton properties and we travel a lot the other hotels upgrade for free also we were charged a significant room tax per day on our room when we used points to get the room again we understand this is technically allowed but no other hotel has ever charged us;3
stayed here with my husband on the second leg of our us trip we had been told by a travel agent that la has no high or low season its hella expensive all year round we stayed for 4 nights with a budget of around â£100 per night and struggled to find somewhere in one of the hotspots so we looked at the places we wanted to see and found that they were mostly around the hollywood area and chose this hotel based on location and price when we arrived we immediately regretted this decision it is right on the main road so it was noisy day and night that said i had requested a room near a lift which was granted and we were given a room round the side which apparently would be quieter it was still noisy we thought the location would look better in the daylight since we;3
ive just come back from new york and stayed at astor on the park for six nights with two girlfriends were all aged 2223 i dont mind admitting that im really fussy and was honestly dreading staying there after reading some of the reviews on this website however i neednt have expected the worst as the hotel was fine for us for me the facilities were level with those of a typical chain hotel in england and in a modern style too the bathroom was really nice new and clean our room 1001 was a good size with views over central park and the manhattan skyline from the balcony and the staff were also very friendly there is a subway station at 103 street about three blocks away and about fivesix stops takes you to times square although this maybe isnt ideal for;3
the hotel has basic ammenties and room very small but on the whole very clean very helpful staff and bed and towels changed on daily basis it is a far distance from all the action that new york has to offer and using the cabs can be quite expensive we instead invested in a 7 day unlimited rail pass for the subway and this proved to be much better 29 for a week and we travelled up and down manhatten easily closest subway is 103rd street reception can provide a subway map enjoyed our trip but next time may stay closer to main attractions;3
i didnt pay or 5th avenue the place was clean tidy after a long flight room was what we asked for;3
over all the hilton staff were seemed to be quite rude and the place a little old 90s decor maybe its because this hotel is convenient to the universal studios that the staff can be complacent and to be fair it could be that it is peak season and the staff are overwhelmed;3
we stayed here on our first trip to nyc in over 25 years nice hotelevan at the front desk gave us a beautiful upgrade however when we got our credit card bill we were charged a 150 âincidentalâ fee and for 5 bottle of water we never used when we called inquire they insisted we were told about the âincidentalâ fee thankfully my husband is polite and patient and we were able to get it dismissed the hotel is in a nice spot convenient to subway central park and lincoln center many excellent restaurants close by weâd stay again but would discuss fees prior;3
we stay in a king executive suite very nice hotel over looking the los angeles highway saw a couple accidents and a overturned car i guess that la for u had a great stay breakfast buffet pricey but really good the only thing that was upsetting was for a hilton the pool and hut tube out side for dated and for not to my standern for staying in such a nice hotel;3
stayed here for a week with my husband the bathroom was small and the shower flooded the bathroom when we talked to to reception about this we were told its supposed to do that which is obviously rubbish and it is just poorly designed after just a few days we noticed a horrible smell of damp from the bathroom even though the room was cleaned daily the concierge was helpful but at times gave us the wrong information regarding the subway at the weekend in my eyes a concierge should have good local information yet he didnt have a clue which services ran where at weekends and because of his information we got lost a couple of times the hotel is in a good location times square is only 5 minutes away on the subway the only downside to its location is there isnt much;3
comfortable bed clean room and tomblike silence made this a perfectly acceptable place to sleep before an early morning meeting at columbia;3
the hollywood hotel was a very good stay up until the very end while attempting to print boarding passes we were having some difficulty and the lady at the front desk acted like she could not be bothered her instructions were to attach our boarding passes to an email and she would print them i happy to say im pretty tech savvy but i just could not figure out how she wanted this to happen and quite frankly she wasnt too concerned it was literally like talking to the desknot the person behind the desk but the actual desk what do ya say we just get a printer for that area ok paper is expensive hook up a printer and just turn it on when boarding passes are needed this was my only albeit major complaint having your boarding pass makes such a huge;3
jennifer daisy nelly joe patrick tonyahave been unable to recover nearly a 1000 credit charge for a reservation in october which was cancelled in september well within your policy i have talked with so many people and you have confirmed my cancellation however you have a cci group who represents you somehow who is not honoring your policy and therefore because they rep you your reputation is on the line with this please assist me with this 1000 refund i would hate to see this happen to your other customers elizabeth;3
im in two minds about this place it does have nice new clean bathroomsalthough it was a shared sex bathrooms on my floor which i felt a bit uncomfortable about the kitchens were new modern and plentiful but theres no cooking equipment i had to buy a saucepan from reception which irritated me theres a lot of older men staying hereincluding in my room they were nice people but it just wasnt the young fun hostel vibe i was after this place is decent just not exactly what i was after;3
we were two from norway living there 5 nights for vacation the location is good close to central park rockefeller center and two underground stations several resturants and shops near by the style inside seems to be from the 1970s in mainly dark brown the room was ok two large beds filled up the room making it a bit tight the shower was dificult to use;3
i picked the empire because of its great location to lincoln center right across the street i was going to the opera and i wanted something very close and available especially if the weather turned bad ive stayed here before but i must admit that i was a bit disappointed in my stay this time let me say that the staff and workers at the hotel are very nice and the room was not too bad but i just thought that many of the extra cost were unrealistic valet parking at 7000 i parked myself on the next street for 5600 a night they have a kureig machine in the room but the cost is 300 for each cup of coffee there are bottles of water left out in the room ordinary size at 750 each while the location was good and the room fine i would say that this hotel is at;3
good location but no coffee making facilities in room beds were short for someone 510 or taller the wardrobe had a safe taking up valuable space so couldnt be used and not deep enough for the hangers and our room with 2 double beds was tiny the whole place needs new carpers and paint;3
we stayed here as part of a package with tui and while the photos show it as quite glamorous the rooms and decor are a little dated we had booked a twin queen room but on arrival were shown to the smallest room i have ever seen with a single queen bed squeezed in needless to say we turned straight around and spoke to reception who confirmed we had in fact been booked into a queen room as per the request from tui there was no problem upgrading and luckily they had a junior suite available which is what we wanted in the first place i cant fault the staff as they were always friendly and very helpful the location is very good and for first time new yorkers like ourselves wasnt too much of an assault on the senses we arrived late on the first day due to;3
the empire hotel is beautiful hotel the designer boutique style hotel is located in the heart of lincoln center if you like classical music ballet opera and art cinemalincoln center is the place for you and your family just a short walk over to central park and some great restaurants in the area if you are a light sleeper i donât recommend this hotel the windows in the hotel are outdated and you can hear everything outside;3
due to budget limitations and the expensive prices in london this was the only place that was decently located affordable and available for the times i needed for a hostel the place was relatively clean although the common areas were a tad unkept room size twin room was average and included a mini fridge very handy and rare in a hostel i agree with some other reviewers staff wasnt the most friendly especially on check in location was handy fairly close to central london on a major tube line but further from the centre than i would have preferred my major complaint however is the lack of single sex showers all communal showers that i could find were open to both men and women there should be at least one shower that is only for women if there was i was;3
this is a great reasonable hotel in its price range location is its best point the rooms are small but average for ny standards there is limited storage space and a small bathroom with an average shower note to all hotels not everyone wants those rain shower heads that pelt down on you some of us ladies do not want to get our hair wet they had a hand held shower piece but it rarely functioned would not stay on the wall and the upper shower head still dripped on your head as usual half the room is taken up with stuff you dont want but that takes up precious room overpriced mini bar rubbish 7 usd small bottles of water a coffee machine you have to pay for if you have a coffee all pointless the lobby bar is either freezing or boiling there is rarely service;3
hotel was nothing special it was clean and basic although rooms were spacious and comfortable its right next to the airport literally and not as convenient to downtown la the room rate wasnt cheap nor was it expensive for what was received it has a bar in the lobby which is okay saves you traveling too far and it has a restaurant and a marketplace or cafe which was okay but very pricey which made relaxing in the environment a little dollar conscious i stayed in the hotel for a week and it was okay but felt that the overall cost was a little too high;3
as with a lot of reviewers i was not expecting a high class hotel i was thinking it would be like a travelodge a decent one basic but clean and to a certain standard we were initially given a room on the eighth floor the mirrored lift was dirty and the corridor to the room was gloomy with ripped paper so my expectations were already lowered the room was dark when we walked in with just a blue light coming from a desk it looked quite cool until we turned the light on the room had a strange area behind the door 1980s style wooden kitchen cupboards i have no idea why its there i wouldnt have used it for food as it was dirty the carpet was worn and the tiled area in front of the unnecessary kitchen was broken the airconditioning unit on the window was taped on;3
we stayed here recently as a family of 4we were greeted by the bell desk staff but not by reception during my 3 day stay here not once did i see the reception staff smilethe rooms are on the old side and felt a little bit crampedelevators were temperamental kept on jamming i tried cashing an american express travellers check for us100 early in the morning and was told to try later in the day as there was no cash available we stayed in one of the deluxe suites nothing to write about except for the awesome viewsthe only good thing about this hotel is the location to hollywood studios subway to hollywood walk of fame and caffe sierratry the seafood buffet 43 tip eat all you can lobster termidores alaskan crab legs shrimp etc its delicious still;3
my family and i stayed at this property july 710 2007 there were four of us in one room husband son 7 daughter18 and myself my husband was there for a convention and the kids and i tagged along for a vacation we were a little skeptical with this property especially after all the negatives reviews it had received but we had no choice as this was the hotel my husbandâs employer booked this stay was booked on hotelscom for 149 a night but we were surprised at how decent the hotel was checkin pretty simple fast and easy we arrived at 130pm and of course our room was not ready the staff was polite and advised us to come back at 230pm they recommended we leave our luggage 10 pieces with the bellhop david while we went to get a quick bite david;3
we arrived sunday 12620 poor check in experience our flight lyft has us at the hotel by 150 we were told to sit and wait until at least 230 we checked a couple of times after and still had to wait as the âjr suiteâ room we had booked wasnât ready yet after 3pm we checked and was told it would be another couple of hours or they could put us into a newly renovated room âfor no additional chargeâ around 345 we finally got into room 209 the room ac didnât work when we called the front desk to complain they told us it was part of their âgreen initiative â we had to sleep with the balcony door open to cool down the room to our comfort level then at least twice during our stay we had to close it as somebody was smoking outside and the smell was coming into our;3
decent size room and a good location the bathroom was very small but the shower worked well bed was comfortable staff offered waters to couple next to us checking in but not us i had to ask for water i did not like that first impression;3
bad service we arrived at the hotel 30 mins early from the check in time and having catched an early flight the last thing i want is to get treated rudely the female staff who checked us in was rude to begin with and when i went up to her again 250pm to check if the room will be ready by 3pm she replied me you are early come back later maybe 5 10 15 min or more it can be from 3 to 4pm i dont know you can come back later after 3 all she could do was just answer me politely that the room is not ready and she will give me the room as soon as it is ready i felt like i was checking in to some budget hotel and since i wasnt the one who made the booking i was shocked to realize i was in a four star hotel being tired i waited for check in time and went to another staff;3
i love the location of the empire right across the street from lincoln center and a quick walk to columbus circle to pick up the metro the bar inside the hotel was also amazing and they make great cocktails we didnt make it up to the rooftop bar although a long line formed on saturday night waiting to go up so i can only imagine it must be good if people are willing to freeze on a cold february night to go to an outdoor roof bar our room was on the 10th floor and small but very nicely decorated we had a crappy view of the other side of the hotel though and literally could see into other peoples rooms so we kept our shade drawn the whole time the bathroom was insanely tiny but well thought out in terms of how the space was laid out my only bathroom complaint is that;3
this hotel is on the upper west side of manhattan just over the road from central park it was a few minutes walk from the nearest subway station 103rd st making it very easy to get to all major tourist destinations in manhattan its in a mainly residential area without many restaurants or shops the room was basic and small but clean and adequate for our needs the bathroom was new and had a bath and shower we booked it on a last minute website and were happy with the reduced price there is no bar or restaurant internet access is available for a fee no breakfast is provided but four blocks uptown there is a nice cafe which serves reasonably priced food and lovely tea our 8th floor room was quiet although you could hear subway trains passing beneath the;3
we stayed 2 nights in april on our recent family vacation as most do we chose this hotel due to its proximity to universal studios we did not mind paying for this convenience but were disappointed on a few points check in was a little slow we had to wait about 10 minutes upon arrival with only to families in front of us which seems like forever after a long drive wifi unlike many hotels you have to pay per day and per device in a family of 4 this can get costly pool bar service during our stay was closed at all times the beautiful pool area was another reason we chose the hilton so that we may relax after a long day of walking unfortunately we had to walk to the main bar area in the hotel which was located on the main floor not ideal having said;3
only stayed here as it was such a good olace location wise for the new york marathon however although the hotel is well run friendly and does the job its supposed to location wise i must have been given the worst room possible location wise it was like something out of a bad movie scene where the only thing missing was a train line running just outside the room causing it to shake every five minutes there was no sound proofing at all it was like sleeping with the windows open all night we could hear every shout siren engine and noise all through the night and also with the added bonus of a giant neon light illuminating the room up every few seconds i supposedly had one of the best rooms available too also the first hotel ive ever stayed in where you had to;3
hotel is in a great location right across from lincoln center near restaurants shopping transportation hotel has stylish lobby and rooftop bar crowd mixed depending on night also has a pool that i didnt try room is small which is not uncommon in ny but was also clean however there were signs of wear and tear particularly on the bathroom door where the paint was peeling a bit have to pay for coffee in keurig machine in the room major gripes against the hotel was that the hot water did not work an entire day and the elevators kept breaking so clearly the guts of the building need a refresh i booked via hotwire deals however if i had booked directly and paid full price i would be more angry;3
not a fancy hotel but the location is great because it was 23 mins walk to the nearest subway station there are lots of restaurants cafes and marts nearby also near central park the hotel is quite old and needs refurbishment the room we got was in front but it was very small for a family of three the bathroom was okay in size at least the aircondition unit was not working but thankful that we visited nyc in november so the weather was cool and accommodating the lobby is small and crowded but we could use the free wifi there the staff were okay friendly and accommodating i will only recommend this for couples but if you are a family you may want to consider other larger hotels depending on your budget;3
the hotel is typical of many hotels beautiful lobby drab hallways and rooms the room was of a reasonable size for a city centre the room was clean but looked quite drab and dreary and in need of refurbishment my main complaint was that the hotel decided to land an extra 22 per person plus tax for use of the wifi phone calls business centre and fitness centre this is a hefty fee and one which i was not aware of when i booked the holiday through the travel agent clearly the travel agent knew nothing of it either the location of the hotel is excellent being near penn station and msg;3
i booked through hotelscom and got a room for under 100 per night including breakfast which i thought was a good deal given la hotels can be pricey the positives room was clean bed was comfy and shower was hot the buffet breakfast was fine a simple hearty not healthy breakfast of waffles toast cereal juice tea and coffee the negatives its not in hollywood its not near shops or fast food joints its out of the way the subway was a couple blocks away which was handy however it wasnt really that safe late walking back late at night staff seemed uninterested however i expected that reading other traveller reviews so was prepared for this in short you get what you pay for but if you are on a budget and dont mind being out of the way then this place is;3
the room was pretty good with a good size comfortable bed and decent enough shower but the hotel is woefully understaffed check in had a huge queue a twenty minute wait none of the automatic machines were working and after finally getting my room key it didnt work apparently the battery in the door had died so they had to send maintenance which was another ten minute wait outside the room and although the room facilities were fine they only provided one towel which was ridiculous the woman on the front desk was pretty defensive throughout unlike the maintenance woman who was charming and helpful i think its pretty poor that premier inn dont clean your rooms now or replenish teascoffees etc unless you request this separately at reception so;3
i spent one week in this hotel and the only good things are the location 5 min walking from time square and the view my room was in front of madison square garden the building is so old and dirty doesnât look as a 4 star hotel the restaurant is 410 points;3
stayed here 4 nights and have to say for the price was good bed softer than im used to but still comfortable great bathroom shower plenty of decent towels toiletries tissues the staff were obliging and friendly eating facilities are not provided but there are plenty of shops restaurants nearby coffee and a selection of different teas are available in the reception area during the day unfortunately every time i wanted tea the hot water had run out maybe a bigger or 2nd run would help overall a good stay and based in a fabulous location for times square but away from the major hussle bussle of being in the middle of it would stay here again;3
now this is in no way a place to stay if you like your luxuries but for a place to crash out after a day of exploring the city its just fine we found the room perfectly adequate for our needs it was fairly spacious there was a fairly comfortable bed with clean bedding no sign of bed bugs a fridge a place to hang and store clothes etc and a clean bathroom just down the hall its not pretty to look at in the sense that it could do with a lick of paint and a general facelift but at â£40 for two people a night i wasnt complaining the hallways were grim and some had an odd smell not dissimilar to that of a wet dog didnt have much to do with the staff but anyone we ran into was generally courteous the location couldnt be faulted 2 blocks away from the subway and in;3
well the hotel was cheap considering that it was nyc very small room and bathroom the noise isolation between rooms was poor and there was no view to the outside nevertheless my overall experience was ok and for that price i would go there again if you enjoy running the central park is so close that it gives you the chance to make a superb walk in the morning;3
we stayed here for 4 days recently and although it has some positive qualities overall it would be low on my list for future stays first the good we were upgraded to a junior suite and given free wifi for the stay having a roof terrace is very nice in new york during the summer as you arent stuck in your room when not out looking out with a beer at the end of a hot day was really nice its location isnt too bad a quick walk to the park not too far to 5th ave and times square columbus circle area has some decent clothes shops also it was also surprisingly quiet check in and out was quick courteous and easy the not so good the decor is awful like a bad 70s movie leopard skin prints furniture dark heavy fabrics on walls and everywhere most rooms seem to have;3
the hotel was in very good condition overall but after we checked in on the first night we found the room assigned to us smell auwful we have to call front desk to ask to change to a new one the late was perfectly fine on the morning of second day we went to have breakfast according to the flyer in the room the buffet breakfast serves newly introduced chinese style dim sum but i have to say they are tasteless other food in the buffet are just below average and it costs us 30 each;3
i booked this hotel through the universal studios website which had a great package deal for the hotel and tickets to the park the package included a room on the executive floor with a view of the studios that was truly the best part of the experience the harry potter ride the waterworld show were visible from the room itself which was amazing it also included free continental breakfast which could be upgraded to full buffet for 10 per day which was also very nice there were good choices for breakfast there is also a shuttle that goes from the hotel to the studios every 15 mins overall the location was the best value from this hotel room was clean and spacious parking is 28day but then its la hilton honors issue here is my biggest peeve with this;3
first stay at hilton universal not quite satisfied but i will give them a second chance the only thing that is nice is so close to city walk you can go back and forth to hotel in few minutes they have a large room and one thing i like about the room is theres mini fridge yahoo and extra pillow and blanket;3
the location of this hotel is great but there are lots of hotels in new york that are situated well the lobby is nice and there is a 24 hour diner on site the manager i dealt with meghan was sympathetic and helpful unfortunately thatâs all the good points there are no tea or coffee facilities in the room tough if youâve been travelling for 10 hours and although there is water this is chargeable at 5 per bottle the lifts upto floor 20 are frequent anything above that you best be prepared for a wait if you want to leave your luggage perhaps because you have a later flight itâs charged at 5 dollars per bag per hour first time iâve come across that in manhattan perhaps we have been lucky late checkout is charged at 50 i think that gives you 3 hours on;3
we were appalled by the service provided to us by the lady at the front desk attempting to check us in as soon as we arrived she was not helpful and was pretty rude how could a hotel not have a bell boy we were expected to drag our suitcases to the storage room and to and from our hotel room the description on the website was misleading about the hotels location it is not near anything touristy at all loads of homeless people around we could see them from our hotel window which was spooky rooms were clean and had the right amount of amenities plus wireless internet access other staff members were helpful in providing information breakfast less than average will never choose the hotel again especially because of its location;3
think ill start with the positives location for universal excellent view not too bad from our room would have liked to have been looking at universal but never mind staff friendly but more to honors members hotel looked very nice very clean and big now for the negatives this was part of our honeymoon having only got married the week before in hawaii staff aware of this and i made it pretty obvious with the mr mrs tops etc but not even a smile or a congratulations i wasnt expecting anything free just an acknowledgment would have been nice but they only seemed to care about their honors members when they asked if i was one and i said no their attitude changed and didnt even get have a nice stay or anything was just heres your key and the lifts are over there;3
we stayed on the second floor you take the elevator one floor down the room was big but dark and no view it rained and the rain came from the window they put a towel on the floor to collect the rain very poor for a high end hotel nice bathroom the food was ok nothing special i would not stay there again unless you are visiting universal;3
the hostel is far from the centre but it has good options of public transport the bedroom is ok but they use a very stinking product to clean it there are a hundred of kitchens in the hostel but all useless because they expect that the guests will bring saucepans in the luggage so there are stove microwave fridge but no utensils the staff dont help with any turistic information and they charge you for wifi;3
i never found staff so acid in my hotels experience the cleaner get into my room while i was naked after a shower the bathroom wasnt clean at all an hundred bucks in the trash;3
the private room was ok but the tv was not working during the 11 days i spent there the wifi was ok the receptionists are not too friendly they dont say even a good morning the local is very safe and easy to get to the subway there is a kitchen in each floor but the microwave was not clean the housekeeper staff was friendly differently from the receptionists;3
hotel ok room was tired and in need of a make over shower curtain in bathroom sticks to you when using the shower teacoffee making facilities would be nice noise from street below was loud late checkout was expensive;3
after reading others reviews i learned a great deal first it is wise to try and get this room for around 115 on pricelinecom i stayed from 12 162012 the top floor is very warm but the windows do open the bottom floor is cooler but the quiet side away from the street is very noisy due to the hvac units acheat the showers do flood the design is awful the prices on fooddrinksother accoutrements are a bit pricey even for nyc standards i requested a king size bed each day and received it which made me really happy the staff was very friendly the roof top bar was a lot of fun the location is very close to great shopping and central park my only major complaint was when the roof top bar closed i had just bought an expensive liquor drink and was;3
just got back from universal theme park in ca stayed at hilton just a short walk from park best part was the location the rest was very pedestrian large rooms comfy beds clean breakfast was pricey and uninteresting didnt eat any other meal there service was good employees extremely nice bar always seemed busy be aware of the construction at the hotel gym is closed and outside walkways and patios being worked on we never knew which door to go out for our walk to universal there is a shuttle to the park but honestly its faster to walk just got tired of outside doors being locked and walkways closed it was an adventure just trying to find a way back into the building all and all an uninteresting hotel that could use a little personality;3
would recommend this hotel for how central it is and the staff are pleasant and helpful other than the adjoining cafebar where the blond lady behind the bar doesnt like her job or people the rooms are not big but more than ok and the facilities are clean is short other than just one miserablerude member of staff behind the bar and the unexpected surcharge for facilitys advised on their website with no reference to extra fees and the are we had no need or use of them somewhat goes against this hotel is great;3
stayed here for one night on a quick trip to manhattan for business my assistant found it and booked it and certainly that choice wonât win any brownie points from me iâll keep this short and say that the hotel is huge 42 floors i think art deco style though the style is lost behind a veneer of shabbiness the room was small and clean not well appointed or overly comfortable my mint green bathroom looked like it was original to the 40âs not even a toilet paper holder simple a roll on the sink shelf the kicker for me was the walk to the room the hallways are interior no windows bad lighting kind of dirty and all combining to a scary vibe i felt like i was walking the hall of the hotel from the shining it is however a busy hotel lots of budget tourists on;3
this was very bang average the cheaper rooms still 500600 per night are very small the bathroom is rather unremarkable and small it also doesnt offer any sizeable shampoo or shower gel as well as this there is a very loud aircon that will either keep you awake or when turned off the heat will do the same for this amount of money my three night could have been better spent;3
i stayed here for work and was not impressed the room was clean but the heating and cooling system was a disaster maintenance had to come multiple times to adjust the heat because the room was so hot maintenance indicated that this was a common occurrence which is unacceptable with so many other options in nyc i would not choose to stay again dont be fooled by the pretty pics they dont paint the true picture;3
spent 4 nights in november with a friend twin room ensuite we wanted a budget stay and we got what we paid for room and bathroom were clean however the hostel needs some tlc the bottom handle of the side tabledrawer was broken off when we got there the ensuite while clean smelled slightly of sewage the whole stay while that wasnt super bothersome what was bothersome was that the heat did not extend to the ensuite it was always cold in there also some of the grout had mold which again was not bothersome but just not nice to see overall it was a good stay nothing save the temperature of the ensuite was bothersome the room was clean i slept well there was a minifridge provided and dishware in case we wanted to use the kitchens there was also a lift which was;3
our hotel room was very noisy the windows are poorly fitted and only single glazed the fitness centre is of low quality with broken and poorly sited machines we also feel the price paid of over â£250night is very expensive compared with the quality of the experience the location of the hotel is good and the staff are welcoming and friendly which just scrapes a 3 star review;3
i had booked 2 rooms based on my previous stays at hilton hotels we arrived to self park on the first day in a dark and lonely car park and then came up a lift at the back of the hotel where all the lights were switched off first impression of the lobby was that it was tired and old we were checked in and went to our rooms wow what a let down the rooms were old and tired the whole hotel could do with a make over this place definitely was not a hilton by any standards the rooms were functional and showers good they rip you off on wifi as they charge 799 per device per day so if you are a family with iphones and ipads you can forget it what a shame that they have not refurbished this hotel the location was excellent a couple of minutes walk from universal with;3
i have been staying at the empire during business trips since right after the renovation over the years i have seen a steady decline in overall experience rooms turndown service used to be customary with a nice bw cookie no more linens seem nowhere near as fresh or pressed the latest trip the linens seemed constantly damp not comfy paper cups in place of glasses 750 for a bottle of fijineed i say more i had to request a robe whereas in the past the robes were fresh fluffy and available upon arrival okhotel used to provide free wifi in room now 13 per day per device laptopiphone ipad youre looking at 40 a day to work times are tough but there are different behindthescenes ways of cutting costs without sacrificing guest experience;3
the location of the hotel at 63rd near the lincoln center was great easy walking distance to time square central park and shopping provided you are up to it the regular queen room we had was cramped certainly no bigger than rooms in small paris hotels the shower was only 31 wide and the sliding glass door part was missing so it was impossible to keep water off the bathroom floor the sink and toilet were also crammed into a very small space in room conveniences like bottled water coffee etc were all quite expensive 3 for a keurig coffee but the starbucks was right around the corner and 750 for the fiji water bath towels were nice and fluffy but really single ply toilet paper the lobby area was quite busy at times with friendly staff and a bowl of;3
we arrived at 1 o clock to be told it would cost to check in early but that she would do it for free didnât really understand this as the room was ready all i can say about this hotel is that itâs very average good location however our room was absolutely tiny run down bathroom and air con that didnât work very well on check out we had to pay to keep our bags in the hotel whilst we went out for the day hadnt we paid enough if i returned to new york would probably pay more to stay somewhere else no other issues apart from these;3
the location of the hotel was ideal for universal studios amusement park where we were headed it was also close to hollywood and beverly hills which were our other interests the bell services and valet services were excellent especially rod the bell man from philippines reception staff were efficient and courteous rooms were spacious and clean cons free breakfast was a measly continental breakfast with no eggs though marked by stickers from the full breakfast which cost 10 per person and informed by the waiters still prone to confusions and misunderstandings tv channels lacked the golf channel as this is more of a big city hotel the atmosphere was more professional and businesslike unlike the small town familyoriented hotels and inns didnât like the shower;3
the room location was difficult to find but then the condition of the room was marginal at best the housekeeping was excellent but there was paint peeling from the walls the carpet was frayed or ripped the pictures and tv were very datedugly and the whole feeling was not at days inn standards on the other hand we had been originally schedule for another room on another floor but we requested to be on the 6th floor with the rest of our family and room 609 was apparently the only one available so i guess i shouldnt complain;3
i had a ticket to the opera a noreaster was forecasted booked the empire hotel because it was the absolute closest to lincoln center seriously right across the street the valet was courteous and the valet parking was 6000 front staff was limited so service was slow the room super double was very small the bathroom was microscopic with no flat place to put toiletries i asked for an extra blanket several times staff was limited sink was clogged with a bottle cap from a former guest but was fixed very quickly chowder house is closed in the empire immediately next door to pj clarkes so dinner was convenient during the storm i would definitely stay here again if i had tix to lincoln center;3
bought a package from barrhead travel and this was the hotel in new york i admit after reading some of the reviews i was very concerned with the cleanliness of this hotel however on arrival the first thing we could smell on entering reception was disinfectant we were given room 408 4th floor overlooking central park which was basic had a bed side table lamp wardrobe with shelves chair luggage stand alarm clock and a tv clean towels in ensuite soap a couple of shampoo bottles plus a hair dryer being on the street side there was plenty of noise from traffic pedestrians and chain sawing trees at 3 oclock in the morning the room was spotless and so was the ensuite the bed was very comfortable there was an air conditioning unit the windows did not open i;3
arrived at 1230 room check in was 3 so went for a wonder could leave bags at hotel was told get a text when room was readytext never arrived so came back around 4 had previously asked for room with a view quieter floor high up via email got 8th floor looking out on to buildings opposite noisy but its new york i suppose and every one loves a horn room not the biggest two adults and 1 9yr old two beds not doubles more like 34 beds 4ft beds no where to put cases so they were left on walk way of room had keep stepping over them asked about moving to other room but wanted extra few hundred dollars for sake couple extra foot love to know how all these people get free upgradesit it if the face fits no main light in room have to use two;3
good hotel right near to the empire state building only reason i scored so low is this i paid a lot of money to stay here for a week then upon arrival i had to pay a serviceresort fee of nearly 250 dollars all this got me was poor wifi apart from that the rooms were clean and today great views and lobby area was tidy bed was comfy and bathroom has everything we needed;3
location is great rooms are a bit dated and my bathroom was hilariously tiny they still charge for wifi seriously guys its 2014 and if you want to drink the fiji water in your room its 750 im not joking 750 for the little bottle of fiji not even the large one every single time i left my room my key card became demagnetized every single time as if that werent frustrating enough there was usually a 510 minute line at the front desk so i had to stand there and wait just to get my key working so i could return to my room no it wasnt next to my credit cards or my cellphone i mustve said that 100 times over 48 hours there is a great roof deck but it was pretty much always closed for a private party;3
i stayed at the empire for a weekend and while i was initially happy with the exotic decor and smallbutcomfortable enough rooms but that was before i needed anything from there front desk one particularly striking incident was when eugene the lobbys bag handler slammed the baggagerooms door in my face while chatting away on his cell phone i had a few bags i needed to store when i spoke with the manager on duty at the front desk his response was one of sorry that happened to you we will be doing exactly nothing about it they care more about the money theyre taking and when than the service and hospitality they offer their guests rude rude rude;3
stayed here for 4 nights the room was a good size for new york and the location was great the breakfasts here are horrible most of the stuff was old and stale and there is not enough space for dining when we complained to reception about the breakfast she just laughed the staff at reception were mostly rude when dealing with them and could learn to deal with complaints the doorman however was great basically this hotel is not worth what they are charging there is a trend with staff complaints in the reviews but it seems this is not being addressed the staff are what really lets this hotel down;3
great position and nice and clean rooms showers and toilets could be better but theres no free wifi you have to buy it at 1â£ per hour reception is 24h but they are very slow at replying emails if they do no elevator in september 2014 there was a construction site right next to it so be prepared to be woken up by the noise;3
the room was nice and large and had a great view of the empire state and the chrysler building but it was in need of a revamp the headboard had a tear in it which was only small but could have been fixed easily enough the main reason it got 3 stars was the bathroom tiles that had been painted over is not acceptable and fixtures and fittings were tarnished which only contributed to the overall tatty appearance there is a charge of 22 per night for use of the facilities including wifi even if you didnt use them i did say i thought this was rather expensive as we would not be using the gym and so they charged us 11 per night;3
my friend and i stayed here for 5 days from 27th november booked the hotel through bookingcom who advised the hotel wouldnt ask for payment until we checked out we arrived immediately we were hounded by the receptionist to purchase an upgraded room as wed booked a smoking room requested twin beds we werent interested the receptionist asked for full payment we paid it got a receipt the receipt stated the amount that was taken from my card which was the price id agreed with bookingcom for the room cost i signed to say i accepted that amount a couple of days later i checked my online banking realised that not only the room cost had been taken out but also another 151 for tax i was furious as when i popped my pin in the omg amount that came up on the;3
i booked a night at the empire for a romantic night out besides looking great and great location i chose them because i read that they accept cash deposits for incidentals i like to keep my card at home because ill just charge and charge keeping my card at home keeps my credit score high and my debt low i booked through orbitz and looked forward to the weekend i was dismayed when i got there and was told i couldnt book the room turns out that orbitz had the wrong info regarding cash deposits and i mistakenly thought that i read that on empires official site but why have different info out there in the first place fix it you are a major hotel that shouldnt even be an issue and on top of it all the first person i spoke to at the desk had a major attitude like i;3
i have been here many times however during my most recent visit i had some problems first i was not able to select my usual alcove room via the hiltoncom web site there seemed to be a problem with the hiltoncom web site since i was unable to checkinto three different hilton hotels last week when i physically checked in at the hotel an alcove room was not available also hilton no longer arranged the usual fruit basket for their gold members which i previously enjoyed also they no longer gave me a bar appetizer coupon as they have done in the past i need to reconsinder my next visit the nearby sheraton may be my next best choice;3
tiny bathrooms even by ny standards the rooms are tight as well the beds and linens were perfect the bathroom door was rotting the curtains became detached from the ceiling just from pulling them open and the desklamp had a broken switch and would randomly turn on in the middle of the night the public spaces of the hotel are very lovely and we hear the rooftop bar is fantastic but we never made it up there;3
the hotel people are very nice and inviting the rooms were clean albiet spartan this is definitely for those just looking for a clean place to go to sleep after a long day it is not a hotel filled with amenities and spaciousness in rooms this is clean bare bones living downside is that it is centrally heated and my room was warm i could of opened the window but with nyc noice it was a debate between which one would keep me up worse also the hot water is very very hot so careful as easy to scald oneself if not careful otherwise go in with your eyes open knowing it is bare bones living upside is easy walk to penn station and trains to everywhere;3
i was quite wary of this hostel myself and my boyfriend where staying in it for 3 nights before we got set up in an apartment for the summer living and working in nyc i was pleasantly surprised how clean it was we booked into a double room with a shared bathroom the bathroom was cleaned a few times a day and the bed had fresh sheets on every morning i will stay again on a budget;3
fix the plumbing or at least act like you care and you fix the hotel i have stayed her several times and never had any issues unfortunately i cannot go back without knowing they have addressed the problem;3
it is normal that rooms are small and dark in new york city hotels but for this price i still would have expected more the room was quiet and that is good for a city like new york one of the four elevators was out of order the whole time five nights the remaining ones were very slow and we had to wait a long time for an elevator during rush hours morning and later afternoon the gym was out of order but the hotel had contact with a bigger gym in the same block we never used it the people working there were very friendly and helpful the pool on the roof top is quite small but nice the roof top bar is fantastic the location close to lincoln center is great;3
the location of the hotel is the best thing short stroll to both the lincoln centre central park and main subway on columbus the pool is much smaller than the picture suggests and was closed for a private party one evening when we were there so never actually got to use it the restaurant did a good breakfast and the room was pleasant enough like the other reviews though we werent wowed but its a safe bet for hotel in a good location;3
super convenient location to penn station and madison sq garden room was very small sink in the bedroom not the bathroom but itâs nyc and we know not to expect large rooms bed wasnât not very comfortable no iron or ironing board in the room you must ask for it also as an important note no elevators in this hotel we were on the 4th floor depending on how much luggage people have this might be challenging very nice front desk associates;3
i have relatively low expectations for a hotel a clean room a reasonably comfortable bed and a place to get clean a helpful courteous staff is a plus the empire staff was a plus they were unfailingly courteous and very willing to help however the room did not quite meet my low expectations the room was clean and the bed comfortable but the bathroom was an interesting experience the number of clean towels varied daily the number of wash cloths varied from none to four hot water was sometimes available toiletries were replaced at random the hotel is in a great location but needs to improve a bit to make it worth the money this was our first stay at the empire and will be our last there are other hotels in the area that do a better job;3
good location near penn station madison square garden macys empire state but noisy i booked the hotel at website and prepaid it during my checkout i asked the hotel bill receipt to check it and everything was okay it wasnt a great experience but it was okay the next door room noisy bother me a little during the night and early morning the hotel rooms soundproofing needs to fix;3
the most positive comment would be the price got a great price by pre paying and the location is great spent 4 nights while in town for the gift show room was tiny very tiny and the heat wouldnât quit we were asked by other guests about it and heard other complaints so our room was not an isolated experience could not control the heat or even turn it off the controls we were told about were sealed off not one of my better choices;3
stayed here for 4 nights check in was fine room on the 27th floor thought we would have a nice view opened the door the room was the size of a shoe box no view at all we were facing a wall room was clean we ate in the tick tock each morning and really enjoyed it the location is perfect right across the road from penn station and a few blocks from port authority around the corner from macys now i did have a few issues with the hotel 1 the concierge was sooo rude she spoke to me like i was a bold child when i enquired about an airport shuttle our flight was not leaving till 8pm from newark and she advised me that i would have to take a shuttle at 230 and when i explained to her that this was far too early for us she got up on her high horse and when my;3
had 4 days in new york and couldnât fault the location of the hotel as previous reviews have said the extra â£100 âservice chargeâ is just a stealth revenue uplift for the hotel you get nothing for it not even tea and coffee facilities in the room check in team tried to sell and upgrade before weâd even seen our allocated room definitely recommend you check your allocated room before agreeing to any upgrade cost would advise against eating in tick tock the food is over priced and poor forego the convenience factor and venture out a block or two room was ok tired and bathroom âsweatedâ with ceiling dropping water after anyone had a shower the key selling point is the location;3
being a long standing hyatt regency gold member i had been offered a late check out at 2pm when the day of my departure eventually arrived however i received a phone call around 130pm asking me kindly to vacant my room the first day i tried to reach out to the concierge desk only to be asked to show up later since the concierge would be on a lunch break right now but when i did so in the early afternoon i was informed the concierge had already left work at all really if you pretend to be a 4 star hotel you should certainly provide the assistance of a concierge especially if your property is literally next door to a mayor international airport having been referred to the bell desk as the substitute concierge i raised the simple question where i could buy a;3
if you are going to lincoln center or columbus circle then maybe you should overlook my comments and book because of the location otherwisethere are three points that are important to know about the hotel 1 the woman who was working at the front desk could not be bothered to help us not warm not welcoming not willing 2 unless you are a slender person you cannot stand in front of the sink in the bathroom in room 327 im a size 68 and i could barely squeeze in 3 the charge for making the coffee in the room is 3 and the cost for making the tea is 250 seriously on the other hand the bellmen were terrific especially the guy who handles the luggage room;3
they charge extra for internet and business center this makes them unacceptable to me for future stays most hotels provide these at no extra charge i dislike being taken advantage of especially when i am already paying a premium price for a nice hotel;3
the front desk staff were outstanding i selected this hotel as we were arriving by a late train and the hotel was close to penn station the rooms were tiny but the prices were reasonable for new york the front desk staff were warm welcoming and friendly after midnight the rooms are small but definitely adequate the bathroom had a small patch that was either mold or green paint that had been inadequately painted over with white paint otherwise it was a good experience made unforgettable by the outstanding staff;3
we stayed just one night toilet overflowed and we called the front desk told them the situation water was all over the floor and we needed to shower and get to dinner called three more times before they sent someone they actually hung up rather than answer very poor customer service we were late to our dinner reservation;3
this property gets a mixed review i reserved two rooms for a family visit to universal studios for a couple of days if you are planning to visit city walk universal studios it may be for you if not you can do better elsewhere in la this hotel is a tourist trap the positives location friendly staff 5 minute walk to universal studios free shuttle to city walk clean rooms with refrigerators pleasant pool and large hot tub negatives 300tax night price expensive mediocre food daily parking fee of 28 self 40 valet very slow checkin and very slow elevators;3
i spent here 5n on a business trip no doubt the location is great right in the middle of theatre district 10â walking from times square 57â from two different subway lines room was ok size typical ny i should say clean and modern nice bathroom with rainforest shower however the noise from the street was terrible almost like there was no window really annoying unless youâre so gifted to be able to sleep with any noise conditions you have to pay 20n for council tax and fees newspapers wifi use of the gym two bottles of fiji water definitely i would not go back if i wasnât given a quieter room;3
the jane is a great rate in a great location in a great city but the rooms are so tiny you can barely move if there are 2 of you in the bunk bed room forget it one of you has to leave the room so the other one can turn around pack soft luggage so you can stow it under the bed or hang it on the hooks that serve as the closet bring a good toiletry kit because you have to carry everything to and from the shower and bathroom stay here if you are on a budget or adventurous;3
we stayed at the hollywood hotel for 4 nights the main reason for choosing it was its proximity to public transport as we were travelling without a car to get to the hotel we got the flyaway bus from lax to union station and then the metro red line to vermontsanta monica station you can see the hotel as soon as you come out of the station thats how close it is we upgraded to a suite at the hotel as the price was reasonable the room was big with a seating area as well as a small dining area and kitchen but we felt that it was in need of some updating our room overlooked the courtyard which is a lovely area with seatingplants and a fountain breakfast was included in the price and there was plenty of choice the made to order waffles were especially good the staff were;3
we have stayed in many places in nyc so we knew what we were in for its a small space older sometimes you share bathrooms etc our room was clean that was the most important and safe of course when we checked in they informed us the cable was being re wired i personally was not bothered but the husband thought we should get a discount of some sort wireless worked fine a bit slow but worked the location is great right in front of the 123 lines we didnt spend too much time in the room just to sleep shower etc staying in nyc is expensive in general so if you want cheaper better stay in a hostel;3
i stayed here with my husband on the last part of our honeymoon we chose this hotel because it was across the road from central park and close to the subway its also not far from the museum of natural history and the tour bus did a fairly close stop the room was clean and free of any kind of bugs housekeeping cleaned up and left fresh towels every day the furniture and room in general was a bit shabby and in need of updating the two main problems we had were 1 the air conditioning was very loud we came back one day and it had been turned to low we didnt realise and had two very overheated nights 2 the door lock the key wouldnt turn and we had to go back down to reception someone came up and showed us how to do it this happened a couple more times but each;3
the best thing about this hotel is hugos breakfast he is doing an excellent job with eggs and waffles the hotel is pretty quiet but rooms and services are average but over all a pleasant experience;3
what was supposed to be a fun day and evening turned out to be a very stressful start we did not receive keys to our room until 345 pm we had tickets to see bocelli at the met at 5 pm so now we had one hour for two people to shower and get dressed the only reason given for the delay was that the inspection had not been done yet with check out at 12 how is this possible not fair i would appreciate an explanation to this matter;3
the hotel is beautiful clean and the staff wonderful but the noise we experienced while staying there was unbearable first it was the construction noise all night long then got moved to a nicer room but i swear we were in the elevator shaft as we heard and felt the elevators risingfalling all daynight other than that the place is great;3
we stayed here as three adults in a superior double double room the location of the hotel is great its about a 20 minute walk to time square area and a 45 minute walk to macys it is essentially on the edge of central park so a very quick walk took you in there we had a facebook deal which reduced the price of our stay by 15 which i think was definitely needed as the hotel itself especially in our room looked a bit tired we didnt have any issues with the noise of the traffic outside and we were on the 8th floor we had a few issues with the heating as we couldnt see how to turn it on during the first night and there was a large draught coming from the window which made the room very cold on the second night someone had come to show us how to use the heater and;3
the location was fantastic and the exterior of the hotel stunning beyond that it was âjustâ a premier inn at significantly higher prices we stayed two nights and the bedding and towels werenât changed after arrival the beer was disgusting the family room was a standard double single and camp bed the camp bed was small creaky and uncomfortable all in all for the price i expected better;3
beautfull art deco style hotel excellently positioned on 8th avenue near penn station easy walking distance to most of the nyc sights rockerfella empire state radio city music hall and lots more negative 3 out of 5 elevators not working and queues building owing to high demand on working elevators 3 attempts to activate a working key 2 double beds squeezed into a small corner room;3
stayed here a while back for a couple of days on business it is located close to universal studios the staff was very nice but he hotel seemed a little bit dated but overall a decent stay and i would return;3
hotel is nice not sold on the location though arrived early approx 3 hrs before checkin after flying all the way from perth australia woman at the checkin desk wasnt too friendly or helpful no rooms available early so left our bags there for a few hrs breakfast included ok breakfast in nice environment good sized room close to metro perhaps next time i wont stay in hollywood though burbank etc is nicer;3
my average rating is due to charging for wifi exorbitant charges for minibar items and coffeetea the location made it very desirable for a short international visit which included 2 shows and shopping first the good the staff are exceptional very calm efficient and helpful the location cannot be beat i loved it and am now converted from midtown hotels the queen room we had was small and functional the bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet 508 the list of flight departures with terminal which is constantly running in the business center is very helpful improvements to be made snacks and coffee took up all flat surfaces on desk and the prices were really too expensive 4 times retail for a can of sodabottle of beer coffeetea was 250 to;3
despite reading all the negative reviews i and 2 friends stayed at this hotel for 4 nights contrary to previous reveiws all the staff were pleasant and helpful the concierges were especially good recommending local restaurants and trips rooms are small as in most new york hotels and we were given keys to two rooms to choose which was best after two nights the manager gave us a larger room which had become available rooms and bathrooms very clean and there was no traffic noise from outside no problems with noisy pipes either hotel is ideally located for central park directly opposite it is about five minutes walk from subway and then about six stops downtown if youre staying at this hotel there are some great little cafes bars and restaurants within 510;3
undoubtedly this hotel is located in an excellent position for central park times sq and the shows etc we easily walked and took the subway everywhere we found the door men especially jeffroom cleaners maintenance staff were very friendly and helpful but there were 2 counter check inout who had zero customer interpersonal skills ive ever encountered so much so they really turned us off the place i guess it could be because they dont get tipsour beds were shockingly soft with little support so i felt like i was rolling out we had a room with 2 x double beds for x3 people and it was very tight for space to stow luggage and move about i wouldnât advise trying to get four in this room as it would be a nightmare the breakfast is a communal self serve thing for 20 pp;3
our room was actually tiny with a tiny bathroom and a tiny wardrobe staff was not very friendly i would only recommend this hotel for a nice location;3
good locationsteps away from penn station be aware that they charge 3700 usnight for resort fees the fees are not justified they basically include wifi and telephone calls we still had to pay the hotel to store our luggage after check out;3
celebrated birthday with friends and family thought the rooms were small had to call to get ice brought to the room elevators got stuck prices were high for drinks and food could have been cleaner;3
great location short walk to central park subways and not too far from midtown very aesthetically pleasing with inviting earthy tones loved the very friendly staff everyone greeted each time we went in and out of the hotel exciting to see the hotel for gossip girl fans and they still even have the chuck bass cocktail at the lobby bar room was a bit smaller than expected but was nice and clean we booked a standard and my friend and i shared a queen bed and were also only given one room key bathroom was clean and tidy not too small no in room free wifi which was disappointing and quite frankly very dated as the hotel advertises free wifi free wifi can only be found in the lobby or rooftop bar as a result of this when internet is slow as lots of people using it;3
staff needs to be more responsive and more people should be available to answer phonesif its a staffing issue hotel is nice bathroom is tiny but nice location is the only reason why i stayed here;3
we stayed 5 nights in aug14 it is very old hotel rooms are ok but bathrooms are so small you can not even find place to put your creams or toothbrush elevators are awful there is always long queue on elevator because 2 of them are not working we choosed the hotel because of the location and outdoor pool location is great and i guess this is the only positive thing related with this hotel pool is so small we didnt think about to swim after we saw it staff in reservation and concierge are very helpful this is the second positive thing i am sorry but thats all so dont expect much we stayed much better hotel in nyc before in a same price so i dont think that this hotel deserves that money;3
this hotel is certainly comfortable and is in a central location within walking distance of many of the key ny attractions and close to the subway too but it is a bit tired in particular our bathroom was very dated and in need of a refresh we didnât use the restaurants apart from a quick coffee at tick tock weirdly served in metal mugs so i canât comment on the wider facilities itâs an underwhelming hotel but is clean and serves a purpose as a place to lay your head;3
i would stay her again but they need to step up their hospitality service it is very poor you call the front desk and the phone is ringing like no one is available the hotel was very clean and the location great the rooms very nice every morning housekeeping comes and clean the rooms and change the sheet i like that;3
we are a family of 4 adults now and the beds were small but doable but we are average size people if youâre tall or large it would be hard to sleep two the rooms are spacious though good location and the price is on the low end so no complaints;3
we stayed for the meggit event but everyone who didnt stay at the hotel received their parking fee waived but we actually stayed at the hotel paid moreand still had to pay for parkingwe requested a king bed but were told we could only book two queens when i asked how much the price difference was they said there wasnt any they were the same price but we could only book a queen based on the meggitt blocklastly the hotel was beautifuland the staff at check in and during the stay was greathowever for the pricemaybe a voucher for a free bar drink or 2 or even to enjoy a bagel and a coffee in the morning would have been nice just expected a little more from the hilton the name is suppose to stand out from the restbut it was just okthank;3
supposedly a premium hotel so we expected better the rooms are nonsmoker but ours smelled musty and there must have been smokers there before us the air conditioner fan was so noisy we had to turn it off to sleep the shower controls are ancient with no temp control and i would be boiling one second freezing the next and then boiling again on the day we were leaving the maid just walked in on us at 9am one knock then used the key and walked in no calling in no verifying that we had not yet checked out she saw us naked but that was her problem she had no business coming in at that hour let alone unannounced when we were checking out 3 hours later the location is excellent that is about the only positive thing i can find to write;3
this is a total tourist hotel its in a great area for the empire state building 34th street times sq etc and is one of new yorks busiest soits but not generally in a great area as lots of dodgy characters about particularly on the corner of west 35th for some reason i know new york very well so already knew this wasnt the best area but the hotel was booked for me its so dated too dated regardless of all its art deco ness its old very old furniture very tatty looking and musty the elevator doors opened on my floor and my heart sank dark dingy mustyjust horrible the elevators themselves are like hospital lifts lino floorsold the hotel i gather think its 1920s style is quirky but nothing much seems to have done since it was built even the wallpaper in the;3
i booked this hotel because it was in close proximity to madison square garden where we were going to see billy joel when we arrived i realized there was no elevator which was ok it was only a 3 story building we checked in and proceeded to our room when i opened the door i thought it was a joke the bed literally hit both walls foot to head no room to move around to the other side of the bed we just assumed they were all that small and got ready to leave for the concert walking down the hall another room had the door opened and it was a normal sized room so we immediately went to the front desk to ask them to change our room they did so with no problem and no upcharge to us it made the rest of the visit so much nicer;3
hotels need refreshening i have stayed at this hotel many times over the past two years the rooms are getting beat up and the bathroom was miniscule the desk staff were like robots but efficient because i like the area across from lincoln center and close to central park i will most likely returnif the rate is decent;3
the hotel canceled our reservations we ended up in smaller rooms that were more expensive we made reservations with aaa and they were wonderful but someone decided to cancel our rooms without notification the beds were smaller and we were not made happy with the hotel staff saying sorry our breakfast was messed up as well only good thing i can say the walk was easy to universal studios;3
stayed here with several friends on a girls weekend getaway hotel was recommended to us by someone who had stayed there on a few occasions very good location central park across the street and lincoln center on other side of building easy access to subway walkable distance to shops restaurants rooftop bar might be nice in summer but in april it was just a loud living episode of jersey shoreon second thought it probaly doesnt get any better in summer just less clothesas if that is even possible based on what i saw parading through the lobby every night the laughable thing is one of my friends was refused entry to the bar because she had flip flop style shoes on they were not rubber flops but they did have a toe thong but doorman was insistent meanwhile;3
small bed for two no toiletries at all after checking out we decide to leave the bags with the bell service while we had breakfast they charged us 2 for each bag poor service so crowded every time you go to your room need to show your key to security;3
this is one of the most affordable hotels located adjacent to msg and near times square and the empire state building the single rooms are quite tiny so if youre traveling as a family i would upgrade to a double room given its location to tourist hotspots expect a lot of crowds the lobby and restaurants are packed at all hours of the day the service is average but all things considered it is worth experiencing the historic hotel;3
having flown in from nassau disappointed about the atlantis hotel there we were looking forward to coming to new york to a reknowned hotel that we expected would put our faith back into vfm stays a good sign then that virgin atlantic cabin crew use this hotel for their layovers the fact that a large number of guests checking in on a sunday evening with us also shows a hotel in demand check in was done reasonably efficiently although waiting for a lift to the room on the 21st floor wasnt it would appear that all the new guests were booked into floor 20 and above this causing a scrum for elevatorsthe other bank for floor 20 and below were very frequent with very little demand upon gaining entry to the cubby hole room 2144 we were greeted by the mess let by the;3

we have just returned from the new yorker and there are lots of things we liked but on balance the bad knocked the good points down to average we had our resort fees included in our package with virgin which was great however i do feel the fees are not value for money we contacted the hotel before we arrived to ask for rooms close together and a nice view we got one of those requests and had a great view of the empire state building the hotel is clean and staff helpful it is in an excellent location so convenient for the attractions and subway the not so good now the smell of weed seems to seep into the rooms through the vent the rooms are very small and there is no fridge or kettlecoffee maker unless you pay for them also the lifts were a nightmare when we;3
this was our second stay at the new yorker the first was fabulous not as great this time but iâll get to that later the hotel is in a great location for visitors to ny if you arrive by train penn station is only across the road the blue line subway is just around the corner and the red subway line is just a block away 10min walk to the high line 15mins to times square the hotel has a 24hr diner downstairs and a bar and steakhouse attached also there is a fitness centre downstairs but if youâre doing sightseeing you should be too buggered to use it the staff arenât the happiest bunch but were happy to help me out when i had some questions the hotel looks like it needs some tlc the floor we were on the hall way carpets looked very worn the bathroom ceiling;3
the room was fairly sized for a king bed had everything you would want safemini fridgetvnice shower but after we took a swim at the rooftop bar and came back to shower the hot water wasnt working it seemed everyone was trying to call the front desk and took about 15 minutes to get through they said water should be back in 15 minutes after another 45 minutes it still wasnt working went downstairs and they gave us a complimentary drink at the bar okay fine we went back to the room later and discovered the ac was not really working called front desk several times but still wasnt going through so called house keeping and they sent someone up who said the circulation in the room was bad and brought up a fan which helped a little but it was warm in the room this was;3
a nice modern airport hotel with open plan at ground floor with a nice breakfast buffet and a good shuttle to the airport however check in in the early hours was totally unacceptable and a terrible way to experience the hotel on arrival an airport hotel must work as well at 100 am as at any day time hour;3
great location right across the street from the lincoln centre 12 block to the subway clean lobby and fairly nice design respectable lobby bar the room was tiny but thats expected for ny the bathroom though lacked any kind of ventilation so made the whole room muggy and dank feeling there was some water damage on the bathroom nothing major but rot on the baseboards the shower was so small we kept banging our elbows into the walls and glass our room safe was not working just needed a battery replaced had 3 requests to fix all not attended to it does not measure up to the quality of the photos on their site just a little sloppy all around not horrible but far from great;3
great locationvery classy hotel but with way below freezing temps outside we had to put room ac on high ask for an extra sheet upon arrival only hot down comforter on bed to sleep under strange;3
stayed here from the 18th feb 2016 in all fairness it is what it is friendly staff clean and accommodating do not expect bell staff to carry your luggage after a long fought or any luxuries but if on a budget and the amount of time you spend in your room who cares bed was comfy took me a while to work out the air conditioning as room was sweltering hot first night was not so good due to extensive heat lift was a little scary if you want to be right in the bustle of time square this is not a good location as costs around 20 in a cab to times square or the subway is not far from the hotel knowing what i know about location now i would have been more in times square area but very central to subway and overlooking central park cant complain at all for the price and;3
great location and hammersmith is perfect with 4 tube lines making it easy to go places this hostel is an okay place to stay if you only need somewhere to sleep and dont plan on spending time in your room except for sleeping i had to sleep with earplugs because there was lots of nosie and very thin walls one plus since they dont have a restaurant it was a big plus that the room had its own fridge we stayed here for one week and i would absolutely recommend staying in hammersmith just not at this hostel;3
after a 19 hour journey i arrived at the empire hotel ready to sleep unfortunately the room id been given was right next to an elevator shaft which was very noisy in addition there was some piping outside making a constant noise i didnt really want to cause any issues but knew i wouldnt be able to sleep with that noise going on despite being provided foam ear plugs which were determined to keep leaping out my ears the reception staff were incredibly helpful in allocating me a new slightly quieter room away from the elevator i greatly appreciated their efforts for this although the new room was still slightly noisy from the pipes outside and i did need to wear my own ear plugs wax ones each night in order to sleep other than that my bed was comfortable and;3
good location but the hotel is in need of renovation hotel staff are not helpful and quite rude we asked for a change of room and the manager was not helpful the carpets and bathroom appeared to be original installation basic budget accommodation certainly not luxury;3
the hotel was nice i have noted the issues i had on the previous page the bathtub was disgusting with a brown stain all over the bottom so i would not take the warm bath i was looking forward to i had trouble sleeping as the cheap refrigerator gurgled and hummed all night it was also rather loud in the morning from others though i do not really blame the hotel for this there was not even a very basic breakfast included with the room i dont eat much in the morning but would have loved a free continental breakfast downstairs or something;3
nice hotel little rooms a bit expensive but great location there is free coffee and tea in the mornings a mention to jeff the buttons of the hotel thanks for all your advices and for being so polite with us;3
second trip to ny first stayed in riu hotel amazing the rooms were really small but we had been upgraded as i asked and it was my 30th perfect location across road from maddison square gardens penn station and all subways right outside which was fab for getting about deffo get 7days pass for 33 well worth it empire state and mach within easy walking distance hotel does need a bit of an update especially on some corridors as look a bit outdated and dingy but they are clean we were on floor 22;3
older type hotel but value for money considering position near central park no control over heating meant room too hot but better than too cold very noisy ch or ac machinery outside and plumbing about to fall to bits overall filled the requirement for sleeping accommodation in ny for 3 nights;3
we spent five nights at the new yorker in may generally it was pleasant but i expected more focusing on the positives location is very very good within walking distance of the empire state building times square and a host of other landmark sites for places further afield the metro station is just around the corner and penn station across the road making travel to the airport a breeze the room was immaculate thank you to the team of housekeepers who must work exceptionally hard to keep a big busy hotel so clean the room and bed was very comfortable the room was a little on the compact side but its new york you expect that the reception staff were very welcoming and very helpful as were the security staff we always felt we were in good hands the;3
i wanted to stay near a performance venue this hotel also is very close to penn station the building is interesting art deco with a huge lobby and convenient diner tucked into the corner the room was tiny and not inspiring i was impressed that they had enough elevators to make it easy to get up and down front desk staff was plentiful and good got me into my room way early this was adequate to needs but i was happy to leave when the time came;3
this is my second time staying herethe location is great for visiting universal studiosthe room was nicethe bed was comfortablethe negatives was the the front desk supervisor came across as snobby and condescendingwe had two rooms and parked one carcharged for parking on both roomsthe room service was good but again watch your charges at check out there were many people at the desk with similiar charges issues as well as missing itemsone guest complained of their credit card missingwe never had any problems with thatthere is a safe to place valuables ini probably would hesitate to stay here again based on the rudeness at the front desk i cannot understand why service oriented businesses employee rudesnobby people in front desk first impression positions;3
what promised to be treat turned out not to be convenient to everything we had planned and at first look appeared to be a perfect fit however our first room was disappointingly small for the price and description ie dont believe deluxe bathrooms were small with dysfunctional small sinks comfortable enough the first night but we were glad to accept an upgrade to a junior suite for the rest of our stay much better despite the same small sink and they tried to charge us 40 for the use of the laundry bag to move some of our clothes a nice minibar and wine selection available but no wine glasses just heavy paper cups now about the lobby bar for some reason perhaps weather related the owners have not been able to replace the front doors so that;3
we recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights hotel itself is big clean and did the job for a few nights it is 5 min walk from a metro station that will take you to hollywood boulevarduniversal etc for only 175pp each way as per previous comments lifts were very slow parking also ridiculously priced and should be included seeing as the hotel wasnt exactly cheap anyway breakfast was ok fresh omelettes were the highlight everything else was average also was not happy with a sign on wall in dining room advising that there are detectable traces of a chemical within hotel that could cause birth defects amongst other things for a newly wed couple this was concerning hotel also advertises an appertizer happy hour in courtyard this was not on during our 3 night stay;3
overall hotel staff was very friendly and lobby was nice the rooms are somewhat small and need some tlc they were nice but need a little improvements the hotel is in a great area close to attractions restaurants etc also has barnightclub on roof that is very nice;3
the jane is a historic hotel with a great vibe easy motorcycle parking nearby a unique hotel bar worth checking out and hey this is where survivors of the titanic slept where else can you get a room in nyc for 80 a night the real problem that prevents passable sleeps is how temperature is managed the heating works on a building wide boiler system that can not be regulated by zone in the winter rooms had the window open because it was just too hot to breath at least in the standard rooms with the window open and the air conditioning on you can maybe sleep with earplugs go ahead and book but beware i hope hotel management will invest in fixing the problem by adding temperature zones;3
we have been here for 4 nights it was not really in our expectation the location is good few minutes by walk from time square empire state building and the subway station is literally next to the door entrance the room forniture is a bit old we were in 4 in a room with 2 double beds the sink in the toilet was really noisy we couldt use it during the night when we checked out we asked to leave the luggages and they asked us 5 for each luggage this is incredible as it supposed to be a service from the hotel it needs improvements because it is a really shame for the location;3
a dated hotel with a good location right near the express train which shortened our trips across the street from a great cafe nice closet space and not very noisy when we arrived there were no towels in our bathroom when we called to get towels they sent a guy to fix our electrical wiring;3
stayed for 6 nights location is fab down 8th so about 1015 min walk to 42nd street then the madness begins if you want to be out the business of times square then this location is perfect along the road from macys and empire state building you might be lucky to get a view of the esb unfortunately we didnt which was disappointing i had emailed twice to there customer services to ask for a room with a view and to advise them it was a special occasion 65th birthday for mum no replies to emails and no special view room or surprise pretty poor show tick tock diner was good for breakfast we ate there a few times and also had coffee from the cart in the lobby which was lovely and nice pastries;3
this hotel and the sheraton definitely most convenient in regards to visiting universal studios however the buffet overpriced and its probably better to just grab something at peets coffee in the lobby andor starbucks at city walk only half of the elevators working were testing everyones patience but werent horrible unless you were in a hurry pretty much feel like a number at this hotel nothing too special but expected for a big hotel i did sleep soundly so i cant complain too much hotel room was decent nothing out of the ordinary didnt visit the gym or pool area;3
i stayed here for three nights over a weekend in june the hotel is perfectly nice but the rooms are tiny in need of renovating and sound travels too much room i was surprised on asking for a good room and offering to pay more to walk into a tiny room reminiscent of the 70s after having read the website about flatscreen tvs a horrid little television was in the room there would be no connecting the hdmi cable to watch movies that night the room had a small safe vertical style that managed to fit my laptop and other valuables inside a tiny wardrobe the room also had a small desk to work at and ironing board the bed and bedding was comfortable enough thankfully i planned on spending very little time in the room sleep i had a room relatively high up i suppose;3
nicely located but the hotel was dark and tired the wall paper in the hallways dark and dated the pillows were too hard and the lighting was very poor in the rooms small bathroom by new york standards;3
okeverything clean and tidy the hostel is cheap and value for money all my belongings were safe and i felt ok staying here the hostel is close to everything you need and i found the area to be safe my only problem was the staffnow this wasnt the manager but one young girl in particularyoung ladyi pay your wages and i work hard just because i came to stay here doesnt mean i cannot afford to stay in a hotel somewhere a little up market she was rude and didnt want to help my first time in nyc and i didnt feel comfortable asking her anything the only words she muttered to me were whats your name that is it other than thatno worries;3
the location of the hotel is perfect very near to central park very near to metro stations on 59th and 66th street there are lots of fancy places to eat nearby hotel rooftop is a nice spot to have few drinks after 5 pm just to mention one negative point about the hotel is the rooms look old furnitures are old bathroom is old air conditioner is old and all of them totally create an neglected a little dirty look;3
for the price it wasnt worth it the main reason why we booked this hotel was because it was close to our event nycc our room was on the 33th floor and they have many elevators to accommodate the many floors room was quite small and so were the bathroom and closet the biggest let down was the lack of a microwave anywhere in the hotel food stores and things to do all around so that was another great thing about this hotel i did find the old tiled floors and ceramic tubtoilet interesting as well oh we didnt have a view either sure the hudson river can be barely seen but our main view was the top of another part of the hotel im sure there were rooms with great views but sadly ours wasnt one of those rooms;3
hotelâs nice and very comfortable and conveniently located and all that but our experience of the current housekeeping situation was rubbish told on arrival that housekeeping would come on day four of five night stay but if we needed anything to just let front desk know great lovely on our first full day having stayed one night we returned to find our room being cleaned etc unexpected given what weâd been told but always nice to have a fresh bed by day three coffee supplies had run out so we called front desk to request some and were told it would be with us in 10 15 minutes two hours later when we were heading out it still hadnât arrived so on our return it was back to the front desk to request we explained the situation and coffee delivery was;3
list of positive and negative things about the hotel positive helpful waiter in breakfast dining area friendly and helpful door men location of hotel is excellent clean halls and rooms nice and comfy beds very little noise at our room 717 lobby personell helpful with turning off noisy machine at conference room negative lighting in our room was poor lobby personell denied us coffeetea at our conference room that we rented for 200 for a few hours we had to go out and buy at starbucks and bring back to hotel when we asked to have some water we had to serve ourselves from the lobby and bring the cups into the conference room lobby personell were very unhelpful with this conference room was untidy cold did not have a projector and had a loud;3
if youâre looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to public transport and within easy reach of the main los angeles attractions by underground metro or bus â this is the hotel for you a five minute walk from the hotel takes you to the metro red line and a number of bus stops â meaning universal studios the walk of fame downtown la and setoff points for beverly hills tours are all less than 30 minutes away the hotel staff wonât tell you this â but they will sell you expensive timeconstrained tours to your desired destinations the hollywood hotel formally a ramada boasts that its âan ultramodern hollywood hotel is 21st century living at its finest decorated with luxuriant european designs and laden with cutting edge technologyâ this might have been true five;3
stayed at the empire hotel in nyc through a package with ba in july we were given a room on the 11th floor and told it was an upgrade from the room we had booked the room was very nice although quite narrow and long there were two queen sized beds in the room it was really warm in the room when we arrived at 7 pm the ac was an outdated unit under the window in the center of the room we turned the temp down as low as it would go and left soon afterwards to go to dinner on our return several hours later the room was still really warm and very uncomfortable we called the front desk and asked to be moved the next day we were told to leave all of our things packed in the room and they would be moved to another room by 5 pm the next day we barely slept all night;3
wish i could leave a happier review but few things disappointed me firstly building lobby staff feel of the place was lovely beautiful clean and pleasing however the size of the rooms were beyond rediculous i expected small from the pictures and descriptions but honestly two adults with a suitcase each just does not work the room was not big enough for both our suitcases literally we could not open them they had to be put on the beds to open then back on the floor to be able to sit on the bed but then it was hard to get up off the beds and move because no floor space left to stand up we couldnât even get up and out the room to use the toilet very easily as we couldnât open the door without having to lift the heavy suitcases up onto the bed to be able to open;3
we stayed at the hilton for 3 nights this is a great location for universal which was our only goal for this trip the walk was super short room was very clean with a great view we were overwhelmingly disappointed that there was not a refrigerator or microwave we had brought breakfast options with us that we could not use eating on site is very limited;3
if this hotel would be anywhere outside manhattan it would probably not get even 2 stars from me the staff is the worst feature of this place most of them not all are rude new york style rude this is upsetting rooms are small and dark bathroom is from the 60s if not earlier and water temp is not stable one of the most annoying things that a hotel can have the lobby is as hectic as the penn station on a friday afternoon hundreds of people just walk in and out and around the lobby certainly not a place to relax they have about 1500 rooms and it is not an intimate place as one can imagine and will not give you any relaxation from the craziness and noise of midtown manhattan outside the doors having said all that the location is a winner just a few blocks;3
you only have two choices up the universal city sheraton or hilton anyway so the room is not spacious and not new i feel it never renovates since 80s staff are pretty friendly but not really helpful the shuttle service is extremely convenient but make sure you catch the last one try the buffet here for the price 50usd it s definitely worth it;3
we chose this hotel for its proximity to madisson square gardens and the billy joel concert from that perspective it fit the bill perfectly however the rooms themselves were very cramped and basic and it looked like the whole place was in need of a good clean as is typical in the city things like wifi and even the business centre came at a sizeable extra cost making the headline rate much less than the final bill;3
my first time in new york city and i stayed at this hotel for two nights in a standard cabin which is tiny enough room for a single bed and standing room only however the room had a lcd tv telephone clock radio ipod dock and dvd player shared bathrooms which consisted of two showers and two toilets a bathrobe and towel were also provided location of the hotel is close to the west village however my room was close to the highway and opposite a carpark which made it very noisy at times the airconditioner was so noisy that it blocked out the traffic noise the carpet in my room was dirty and the sheets were threadbare in parts the only lift in the hotel was slow and clunky staff were polite but did not offer any assistance with luggage when you get to the;3
stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in april i had booked a room with 2 twin beds but when i checked in i was given 1 double bed the hotel was fully booked so they couldnât give me alternative room so gave a fold out bed to compensate the room was rather small and a bit dated but served its purpose on the plus side itâs a great central location which is worth the booking;3
truly this hotel is great when it comes to its location and access to central park subways and midtown attractions and this was the primary factor in choosing the empire hotel it is an older hotel so rooms are small and elevators are slow but a lot can be forgiven for convenience we had three rooms reserved for a girls weekend including a suite and two deluxe rooms the suite was great spacious and perfect for a gathering spot just dont try to use the pull out as a bed worst bed ever a positive for the whole hotel were the personnel from nick at the front desk to all the doormen and staff everyone was happy and positive and helpful some of the negatives of the hotel in room coffee was 350 for a kurig cup completely disingenuous given the amount the rooms;3
this a a completely adequate but not at all special hotel i attended a conference at the hotel so it was very convenient but the decor could definitely use an update it looks like the lobby and cafe were done in the mid 80s rooms were large clean and reasonably well appointed room service was prompt and decent quality with a reasonable selection easytouse internet access in the rooms although it was down for the whole hotel for 3 hours during my stay very inconvenient i also had a snafu with messages in which a message was not delivered to me because i recieved two messages from people with the same name and the desk clerk assumed it was a duplicate if style and service are important to you i might consider looking elsewhere if youre looking for a;3
what a great idea cram a shedload of tiny cabin like rooms and hallways in a hotel so ny the single cabin makes very good use of space i would have been thrilled with it but for the bed which really isnt one its a small mattress plunked on top of a wooden plank i woke up continually throughout the 1st night missing my latex mattress at home there was also a halfeaten snack bar in the room when i arrived so the cleaner wasnt quite thorough enough although they seem to be great about the shared bathrooms which are unisex by the way if that bothers you the only thing that bothered me were other travelers seeming to expect to have a chat or something im brushing my teeth ffs the parisian cafe attached is nice the avocado toast is everything the;3
empire review would like to first off state the best thing about this hotel is the location we arrived early understandably werent allowed into our room until bang on 3pm check in having travelled from scotland and been awake for 21 hours we were looking for a sleep but found ourselves in a very loud room in the hotel on the first floor right next to the air conditioning machines which never go off and made a loud noise having politely asked to change rooms we were told the hotel was full we were given no other options and spent the rest of our 5 night stay with little sleep we found the staff on reception and the female concierge to be less than willing to help however yuri was an excellent help who went above and beyond for us and spent about an hour on saturday;3
i understand the hotel is in the process of refurbing rooms but we were unlucky enough to be allocated to an old style room view from the 32nd floor was overlooking the hudson river and not spectacular would have preferred to see more of the city but acceptably nice the room itself is quite large in comparison to other nyc hotels but disappointingly lacking in facilities there is plenty of room for a fridge or coffee machine or even a kettle but none are present this means the only options for hot drinks are the starbucks across the road or the ticktock restaurant in the lobby on our first morning we visited the ticktock but after being charged 5 per bowl of cereal we didnt come back room was acceptably clean though noticeably dusty around the edges of;3
pros the location is perfect for lincoln center clean rooms friendly staff luggage storage is available cons no free wifi in rooms charge for computer access dreary fitness center in basement;3
the room was small but clean the furnishings were outdated and worn the shade over the window was in shambles walls were scuffed carpet was worn but clean the bathroom had been updated fairly recently and was nice the view was of other windows but we were looking for a cheap place to stay so i would have to say it is average for its price the elevator was small and slow but still much better then the steps;3
i am an ex new yorker who hates relying on relatives when i visit that said i always seek out a location away from times square the hotel does the job if you just want to crash after a late night as its a clean comfortable though old room butif you are looking for more than thatkeep looking pros location is great very near subway but a 15 cab ride into midtown brand new bathroom thankfully very cheerful desk people big cons lighting lighting lighting my room was so dark because of its location in an odd tight corner facing other bldgs i could see inside the neighbors kitchen without my glasses but also the lighting in the room was so dim even the bathroom it was a drag trying to get dressed for a big evening out also you can wait forever;3
i have stayed three times at this hotel which is due to the combination of excellent location great breakfast style of the hotel and price i recommend everyone to have a look at the reviews as it appears that the level of service and the rooms etc varies quite a lot in my case the staff has corrected all problems that have occurred i dislike the fact that they charge for everything extra but on the other hand i think for this level hotel the price is decent for me the location close to the lincoln center was essential and with that criterion empire hotel is hard to beat;3
this hotel is in a very convenient neighborhood and the staff is great nothing electrical in my room worked first the bedside lamps had to be fixed and then the hvac had to be fixed the desk lamp had issues and the hair dryer never would turn on worst of all the remote just didnt work and i had to get out bed to turn off the tv is this the 19th century otherwise i liked it close to food and the subway little italy just down the street straight shot to columbus circle and wall street id go back again if they promised me a working remote;3
we needed to find a nice hotel on the upper west side of manhattan the didnt cost an arm a leg and a foot as well and this hotel definitely met our needs friendly staff and very convenient location and all rooms had been recently renovated my only issues were of the thin walls that echoed every noise from the hallways and parking was very difficult on the plus side they have some awesome restaurants close by including carmines etc i would highly recommend the dive bar around the corner awesome burgers;3
stayed at this hotel in february 2011 not our first choice but as we chose to go to la on the weekend on the all stars game and week of oscars there was not a lot of choice the hotel was centrally located but the rooms were a little dated the shower entrance was bizarre my husband only just fitted in through the smallest opening check in was slow and every time we approached the desk there seemed to be an indeference to our presence the breakfast was the most awful we have ever encounted the eggs were powdered but were made into the shape of fried eggs and they were tasteless there was not a lot of choice so we basically had coffee and toast for breakfast each day location was good short walk to the train and close to hollywood itself;3
facility charges dont make sense feels like a tricky way to up room price and not clear during shopping for a hotel room be prepared to pay more as you check in out love the location yet the room didnt have much room to move very small it looked bigger online when i made the reservations;3
went to new york for my sons graduation and chose the new yorker for its location close to where the event was and his job and such i was a bit disappointed to see such a small room for the price i paid i get the location was great but there were not many amenities in fact all they had was a diner which was pretty good and a barrestaurant and a workout room and they give you free wifi the views were amazing and i will say the staff was very pleasant my kids were hoping to have had a pool but no such luck this time;3
i stayed in this hyatt property for one night because of a transit in the los angeles international airport lax checkin is belowpar no sign in checking i am a globalist and do not tell me the benefit of a gloablist even i told the staff it is the first time i stayed in this hotel till i asked what the benefits of a globalist are in this hotel i also found that my card cannot access the regency club the next morning and i need to come to the front desk to request for it also i only know i would have a complimentary bottle of water when i filled in the hotel survey after the stay lastly my preference on high floor is not honored i understand i checkin at 230am pt that maybe many floors were occupied but why dont the staff simply tell me that the high floor;3
the hotel has been rejuvenatedit looks goodhowever the rooms and especially the bathroom is like entering a tomb darkdark why they have a makeup mirror with no lights on itwhat idiot bought them too dark to put makeup on in the bathroom must use hall mirror put some lights on in the roomsthe 20 watt bulbs dont cut it restaurantwhat restaurant it is like all bar food improvement is needed;3
booked by our travel agent we were looking forward to our stay on arrival we asked if we could have a room with a view but were given a very small room overlooking a utility area with window cleaning gantry and no view of the city just one dressing gown blocked sink requiring replacement and very thin walls so disturbed by adjoining bathrooms quite glad to check out;3
stayed here for a couple nights before we were due to fly home as was most handy to the airport we had two rooms booked and on arrival both the rooms were dirty litter on the floor in both rooms the noise from the planes in the room closest to the airport was horrible and went all night long every 10 minutes the other room on the other side however was fine we requested a room with a bath as wanted a chance to relax before our flight bath was a waste of time fills up to a point suitable to bathe a toddler was also covered in a layer of grunge on arrival pictured disappointed beds were however comfortable and some of the staff were friendly;3
rooms were way too small the two beds in the room dresser was all that could fit in the room very little room for any people bathroom was exceptionally small too no vanity or room to store any bathroom supplies very disappointed in rooms lobby was beautiful;3
we stayed at this hotel for only one night it was right across the street from central park and only 3 blocks from the subway station convenient to the subway made it easy to go downtown to the statue of liberty 42nd st times square etc it was an expensive hotel for a room probably only 10 x10 ft small window with a air conditioner in it and room only enough to get around the bed its definitely not a room to hang out in its just for sleeping the elevator could barely fit 2 people and 2 suit cases sopack lightly and use small suitcases if you plan to stay there the bathroom had been remodeled soit was ok;3
stayed for only 4 nights in this hotel whilst on a mini break to new york whilst the hotel style and room was basic in style the staff and location couldnt be faulted checking in was an easy process upon our late arrival though wasnt informed that i needed a card on file though i had already paid luckily i had taken mine with me the room was clean small but spacious enough for two of us as a base lets face it in new york with lots to see you only want to use your room to sleep there wasnt a tea making facility only coffee and as a british person this was a let down the safe was on hand in the room but the instructions to use were stuck on top so had to get a chair to work it out old fashioned tv was difficult to use if you wanted to so didnt bother much with it;3
usually we stay more north last 2 trips have been 42nd the grand hyatt 59th the marriott we thought we would stay a little closer to the main attraction times square and also the added bonus of macys being 2 short blocks away ok so the good points upon entrance the lobby is beautiful very clean fresh looking we arrived from the uk on an 8hr flight so really just wanted to get to our room freshen up head out check in was smooth not the quickest but the lady on reception was polite we made our way into the lift heading for our room on the 19th floor ill be polite in saying that you can clearly see the hotel are making changes however the appearance of the hallways doesnt leave a lot to be desired now i know i said wed stayed further up at the;3
did like the location of the new yorker we walked everywhere from our hotel rooms were small but expected that from ny beds were very comfortable staff were great at helping out on our room confusions when we arrived dont really have much more to say about this hotel;3
this hotel is worthwhile for the location alone its a block away from msg and walking distance from times square and broadway that being said the hotel itself isnât great the lobby is cramped and always busy the rooms are kinda cramped and not the cleanest i actually had to change rooms because the shower pipes were rusted and released dirty brown water the wifi wasnât strong the hotel also has guards that you need to show your room card to in order to go in and out the whole operation seems to be 20 years behind more modern hotels but if you donât plan to spend much time in your hotel this is a pretty affordable midtown hotel;3
stayed here one night room was basic but was clean the lock on the front door was awkward to use on arrival but managed to unlock eventually there is a big wardrobe and fridge in room nothing special but was a good stay;3
recently visited new york and chose this hotel due to its proximity to central park which indeed a great location to stay in manhattan i did my booking through a third party for bed and breakfast and found the bed very much there except breakfast the hotel staff informed me that they dont have any in house restaurant in fact they have outsourced their terrace restaurant to another vendor who runs his business there i had to pay every time i ate there despite paying for it already while bookingtalking about amenities my room was clean though bathspace and wc were very small i think they are slightly overpriced for what they offer;3
hotel is in a good location on the upper west side the hotel itself is a little dated and needs some updating only 2 of the 4 elevators were in service the shower was broken and the bathroom is very small there is very little storage for clothing the tv picture quality was poor due to bad connection the heater popped a breaker as soon as we tried to use it the maintenance guy has been up to our room 4 times already hes very responsive and i feel bad for him since everything seems to be broken the hotel nickel and dimes for every amenity 3 for a keurig pod you can buy a whole box for 8 at duane reed next door 750 for a small bottle of fiji water every snack and drink in the minibar has a huge markup i think this is the last time we will stay;3
a little late revewing but after reading a couple of recent reports i wanted to agree and post a note on my experience in december 2011 we were amongst the unlucky guests to be put on a high floor looking out at a brick wall and other guests in their rooms opposite you can see everything so you have to keep the curtains shut roasting alive each night whilst listening to the roaring noise from the air con outside our windows nothing wrong wtih the hotel in particular just think i could have done a lot better for the money i paid and didnt like it at all felt like a night club on entry to the hotel with the dark dingy decor struggled to see in my room whilst getting ready each day travelled with my 2 teenage sons who developed a rash from their beds have stayed in;3
although the hotel was cleanit was very noisy at night due to the air conditioning staff were friendly and helpful a great dinner just around the block for breakfast subway just across the blockvery easy to get into the city;3
based on 4 stays in the past 4 years averaging 1 to 4 nights great location especially for visiting the universal studio comfortable rooms especially the alcove room dining slightly on the expensive side but excellent dinner buffet friday saturday staff service housekeeping parking restaurant are all 5 stars except frontdesk frontdesk service 0 star due to one rude unprofessional lady working eveningsnights special care for hh diamondgold guests nonexistent and cost s unlike other hiltons marketing fact you will need 6 new customers to make up for 1 lost customer good bye hilton los angeles universal studio;3
we stay in new yorker hotel over thanksgiving week the hotel is located 10min walking distance to time square and beside pennsylvania station as 4 star hotel its not even close to 4 star hotels in europe its very old decor need revamp asap we paid 1400 for suit believe me nothing special overall good stay but for me is basic 3 star hotel;3
it is a nice hotel affordable do not expect to be impressed by the room it is standard for nyc small but very well maintained must visit the bar in the lobby and the roof top if you stay there the ambiance at the roof top is perfect for date night and the bar in the lobby is perfect pregame for your night out in nyc;3
as background im lifetime diamond with hilton and stay between 60200 nights a year for the last 20 years i dont really write reviews but there were some key service issues with this property the biggest being that they are extremely concerned that you checkout on time including sending at least me a text at 524am reminding me of their checkout procedures thanks victoria when i replied that i didnt really appreciate the practice of such early am texts i did not receive a response also in your welcome packet there is a threat of a 75 late checkout fee if you dont vacate the room by 1130am i understand staffing shortages but tacky to say the least and if it is that much of a concern discuss it at checkin dont sneak a note in like a note home to a;3
the hotel was fine and the room was clean staff were very friendly the subway entrance is right across the road on the corner although they dont serve breakfast you do get a voucher to get a special discount breakfast across the road central park is a short walk away if you are going to nyc and want to be close to the main action then it would be better to stay closer to times square so that you save yourself the traveling time we found ourselves waiting for the subway later at night for budget accomodation it is not too bad;3
my friend and i often meet in ny and this time we chose the jane because we were budget minded the bunk bed room was very small indeed barely any room to move around in however the room was very clean there are communal bathrooms which are also kept clean and i never had to wait the bathroom floor did get quite wet and there are no shelves to put your things on while you shower the room was extremely warm so i had bit of a headache in the morning we had the window open all night there is a charming cafã© attached to it and a separate bar and lounge the lounge gets crazy at night we stayed on a saturday people are dancing on tables and furniture the music is a very good mix not house electronica it was fun the place got very crowded and there were;3
got wrong room at first way below adequate for pre paid rate not clean about 120 sft smaller than suggested in booking process upon complaint we were relocated to the correct room great size great view unfortunately hairdryer and small things missing and only provided after walking down to reception after calling twice in vain wifi low and unstable in our room on 10 th floorcorner useless unless in the lobby overall still a lovable place but you just notice itâs been great in the 2000s and thatâs been a while pool area closed again for one of our few days there lobby bar closed restaurants closed;3
conviently located right next door to universal studios we chose the hilton for that fact check in was pretty uneventful though took the receptionist 10 minutes to find a king alcove room that we had booked will suggest an alcove room if you like us were carrying a lot of luggage last stop on a 5 week us holiday or if you like that extra space it was amazing valet was helpful and very cost effective and the tour desk was able to help us with booking a 4 hour la tour on our last day as well as directions to shoppinglax 40mins in really good traffic up to 15 hours during peak hour my only gripe is the elevators they had 4 elevators to 20 floors with 1 being out of service the whole 3 nights we were there the elevator took anywhere between 1020 mins to;3
stayed two nights good location generally friendly staff i payed 450 per night according to these posts people are paying 50 less what i payed was too much there was one wash cloth the first day and the next the maid left none the room was on the small side no window view reasonably quietthere was a defective short bureau door which did not close properly and i kept hitting my leg on it also difficult to get ice had to call twice they only bring you a little bit also you have to que up and take a special elevator to the roof i didnt bother no access through the hotel elevators;3
most inexpensive rooms are dark interior courtyard rooms you can pay for upgrades to rooms higher up with views and light but you should then consider staying in a nicer overall hotel away from madison square garden area;3
great location near lincoln centre but room was not very big for a family even though being described as deluxe not super clean but adequate as long as we didnt spend too much time there pool should be disregarded as is the size of a small fountain and can only fit two people really at most maybe a third splashing and we felt a bit misled people were mostly very helpful and we will have to weigh up if we go to ny whether we would really stay again but good for a short trip;3
staying at the empire for a week for the second year in a row in town on business love the location frustrated with staff during a thunderstorm a group of 20 of us tried to catch cabs outside the hotel 8am trying to get to a meeting when i asked the front desk for assistance the response was thats not our job you can ask out front so i head out to ask the bellhop who responded im not getting all wet thought thats what they were there for will be moving our 35 rooms for a week to another hotel next year;3
the empire will seem familiar for those who like europeanstyle hotels and the color brown translation smallish rooms understaffed fron desk narrow corridors dim lighting and lost of brown decor rugs wallpaper furnishing i was housed here while on a business visit to fordham university and its super convenient to both the campus and lincoln center and columbus circle my room was smallish although not the microroom one sometimes sees in nyc however the odd trapezoid shape made it look larger than other rooms on the floor diagram it was perfectly comfortable for a short stay but oddly configured the bathroom was long and narrow with aa very shallow sink athere was no desk but rather an 18 inch by 4 foor table under the falt screen tv covered;3
very central and across from madison square gardens tic tic dinner which has a entrance from lobby was great for breakfast and staff very warm and friendly room we were in was small but was ok very retro but all mod cons were there;3
you wouldnt want to be in a more convenient location if you base yourself on the upper west side the hotel is an old building which has been refurbished and is popular with people from the us when in town the rooms are clean the beds comfortable the lifts are shabby and the overall decor is very 70s the breakfast service could be improved but there are plenty of places to eat in the vicinity go for a room on a higher floor to lessen traffic noise if you dont intend to spend too much time in your room and you receive a good rate this hotel is recommended;3
this hotel is less than half the price of anything else near chinatown or little italy and its a far better option than a hostel i booked rooms for both my boss and myself my room was incredibly small but clean and comfortable the furniture was dated but i really didnt care because i was going to spend as little time as i could in my room since i was in new york i did have 1 window and i could see the corner store and the park my bosses room was an upgrade it was one floor below mine and about twice the size he had windows on 2 of the 4 walls if i was staying here again id definitely upgrade for the small price difference the location is awesome little corner store on the corner a park across the street many markets and restaurants within 1 block a;3
we used a housing booking service to book rooms at this hotel so it is pre paid ahead of time as my flight was landing late i called the hotel to give them notification that it will be a very late check in i believe the night receptionist gave the worst room the hotel have to me and to my colleague which are room 401 and 402 there is the hotel sign outside the window but the rooms only have one layer of window blinds so our rooms were lit up by the neon sign all night long it was impossible to sleep we requested to change room but the night reception would not do anything and tell us to wait until the morning when the day shift manager comes in i have to pay a 25 to upgrade my room to king size bed room which i did not hesitate as the double size bed room is really way;3
hotel location was perfect for our needs however being an older hotel windows are doublehung single pane and had little to no weather stripping this resulted in a very noisy and cool evening since it seemed like the windows were open and the typical ny traffic was constant all night long a good upgrade to the windows in this facility particularly on the lower floors may increase my rating of this venue other than that rooms were typical ny style small but comfortable and generally an ok stay for the one night we were there if we stayed longer we would have been exhausted by day three;3
no free wifi poor purchased wifi only one device can use it poor signal of cell phone no one changes the broken thing in room finally someone just took it and left no one in the room but the location is very good;3
absolutely enjoyed nyc comic con wyndham hotel was very easily accessible from penn station which was what we were looking for given it was centrally located inthe city room sizes were definitely much smaller than the photos show on their website if you are familiar with room sizes on commercial cruise ships the room sizes will not surprise you on the upside the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable rooms were quite pricey but given the nyc comic con was being held that weekend it does not surprise me next time we travel to nyc we will most likely look around for a better place to stay;3
the hotel is very out dated4 ladies went in one room beds very small it was my 70th bday i would have thought thy would hav given us nice room but we were room 2597 overlooking sum building work going on we could see cranes but as you are out most of the time it dosent seem to matter we were what seem to be near a lift the noise was awful they never seem to stop going up down all night when we went to our room there werent any coffee tea facilities we rang asked reception for some 2hrs later it arrived but it wasnt replenished we went and bought milk sugar do not bother going on a dinner river cruise not worth the money poor service and very cold on the boat 41 dollars for a bottle of what seem to be a cheap wine the best thing was the show peter pan and 911 very;3
very quick check in and staff very friendly and helpful upgrade on arrivalthe hotel is older style and most areas a bit tired which i dont actually mind as it has character i guess throwback to the 70s the room is ample the toilet tiny but great shower room serviced every day the heating in room gets very noisy due to age there is a charge if you want to listen to music channels on tellybit mean rooftop bar open but too cold to sit outside in january it was my partners birthday a few days before arrival and they put a bottle of cava and card in room which was a really great touch tube a 2 minute walk and 2 stops to times square all in all not a bad choice but dont expect 5 star but vintage;3
the hotel itself is in a prime location next to madison sq garden penn station just a ten minute walk to times square we were checked in by a very personable receptionist i cannot remember his name but he upgraded our room floor and view which was good of him the hotel room was adequate but the bathroom was small and the shower did not work correctly it had very little pressure and the temperature was hard to maintain either scoldingly hot or freezing cold there were two occasions when we encountered cockroaches in the room the toilet in the bathroom also made a loud squeak every time it was flushed in terms of the area around the hotel it is littered with homeless people and drug addicts it really is not a pleasant place to walk around especially after dark;3
overall it was a good experiencethe location of the hotel is very good the room was clean and everything worked although the manager was quite rude and arrogant to be honest food was a bit overpriced;3
a standard hilton with nice big rooms and a decent size pool parking is not free this is la and you walk or take a shuttle free to universal studios bar is nice although a little expensive rooms were comfortable and the large windowsviews of the freewayhills good elevators seemed to have a mind of their own and can take a while to stop at your floor;3
stayed one night from a late night arrival from new york its just a place to rest for a night shower bed and sleep shower pressure is not great the bed was comfortable the room size is average check in was fine airport pick up worked well and was drop off this is not a destination hotel and simply an airport hotel and it works for that nothing more;3
i booked a superior twin room here for me and my mother when we arrived jerry said he would give us a great room with a view well we got the view of broadway and the noise to go with it but the room was so tiny there was nowhere to put our clothes or suitcases and the bathroom was really a closet hopeless for two people i complained immediately but as the hotel was full apparently we could not be moved until the following day the next room was much larger with a closet for a wardrobe and a sofa however it was also on the 2nd floor right above where the rubbish men come at midnight and 4am room 215 do not go there if you want a good nights sleep also despite the loccitane toiletries there is no kettle in the room so you have to use starbucks or duanes;3
we took my 9yearold son on a trip to see universal studios and chose this hotel for proximity and because we are regular hilton users first the good stuff the staff were genuinely kind courteous and hard working our housekeeper did an especially exceptional job we bought a suite so there was plenty of space in the room the hotel is nice and close walking distance to universal so no need for a car if you taxi in from burbank the room service menu has a nice assortment and food is delivered hot the view from the upper rooms is lovely next the meh stuff the hotel needs a makeover the wallpaper and carpet in our suite were not in great shape and the look of the overall place plus our room was pretty dated we upgraded to a suite to have extra room for our;3
my first experience when i turned up was the man on reception trying to tell me that the room i had booked wasnt available so theyd pay for a taxi to take me to another hostel in a different part of london it was only after explaining that id picked this one because it was near a convention had to a spot on a map several times and asking more than once if he could confirm that my room wasnt available did he give in and say that it was and give me my key i had to ask a few times for the second one nobody explained the facilities to me just a general handwave and kitchen there but ive heard others say there were kitchens on each floor never so much as hinted at my room had its own bathroom the bedroom itself was clean but bare which is fine its a hostel the;3
pleasant staff and fine location however this hotel could use a serious facelift the wallpaper is rather drab and just outdated the lighting is something out of a eastern block experience circa 1970 the bedding was definitely not premium amenities were decent but the bar was closed all weekend;3
i came here for a workrelated weekend trip and chose the hotel based on its 4star rating i stayed in a single room with no view and was mostly satisfied with my stay the beds are comfortable the look and ambience of the hotel are very chic and the rooms have functioning amenities that made my stay problemfree however the rooms clearly are due for a bit a maintenance for example the ceiling shower head dripped cold water on me while i took a shower with the handheld shower head the wallpaper is peeling all over the walls the cover of the box spring has a large disintegrating border and the doors and walls have many visible marks and scratches i feel for the price i paid i was paying more for the central location of the hotel;3
on arriving at the hotel the interior looked amazing very dark looking and cosy but on arriving in to our room which was a superior twin double on the 11th floor we found it very small and dark even with the curtains still being open having two suitcases the wardrobe space was very small with not enough hangers supplied for a room thats meant for two in which your clothes fold as the safe is nestled underneath i had to put 4 dresses on one hanger the bathroom also being very small and tired looking also had no space for products the shelf was too small also i found it very annoying that the wifi was free for the general public being stated as hotel lobby complimentary access who were using the facilities for meetings or drinks but for people who are paying;3
the air conditioning was pretty much nonfunctioning the hotel is a bit shabby not too bad but not at all expectedthe doormen and the location couldnt be better your advertising of the pool is very deceptive it is way too small and the stairway is never mentioned i spoke to some guest that never found ityour front desk was not helpful and when i do not have air conditioning for one night and most of the next day and then have to move three peoples things to another room i expect more than well we moved you as a response i also thing you overcharged me for the ammenities;3
while the hotel itself and the rooms are brand new and fantastic there had been a water outage that affected the entire building as of 4 am july 9 theres still no water anywhere in the compound guests are freaking out and many are asking for refunds or to be rebooked at another hotel its very disappointing although its mostly not their fault as the water pipes in la have aged poorly otherwise ive had a great experience in my first two nights the hotel staff are trying their best but dont book today;3
the advantage of staying at this hotel is its proximity to universal studios and city walk but despite the hotel being here forever the walk over to universal involves walking in the middle of streets full of traffic a nice view if youre willing to pay and wait and fight for a nonparking lotfreeway view the disadvantages are the daily charge for parking is 28 the daily charge for parking ends at 6pm not posted anywhere on their website look for yourself if your car is in their lot after 6pm they charge you an arm and a leg for each hour after that the breakfast is below average even if youre the highest tier in hiltons frequent guest program they still charge you 10 plus tax for their hot breakfast foods the coffee in the restaurant is;3
great location which really cant be overstated but the other reviewers are spot on elevators were not reliable throughout our four night stay they offered free water for our stair journeys there are eleven floors in this hotel extra towels and the linens for the foldout sofa were slow in coming i called at 1030 again at 1130 arrived around 1230 am air con was fine water was hot and plentiful the chowder house was good the concierge seemed nicer to some than others the business center purchase system is not efficient there are some shabby spots that need repair and surely they should rethink doors on the showers the cost in just answering the phone calls saying my shower door is missing and in laundering the many towels that people put on the floors should;3
the hotel is as you would expect for a central nyc hotel the corridors are like rabbit warrens and the rooms vary in size and noise level my room was defiantly compact and a little worn especially the bath room that said it was comfortable and very peaceful which is a huge bonus in nyc the tic toc diner in the lobby is 24 hours and is fairly decent there are pletly of places close by to eat drink and shop and its a stones throw from madison sq gdns overall i would say its a fairly good choice to use as a base if you are looking for luxury then this isnt the place for you;3
this hotel is really nice but the front desk concierge made a major billing mistake even though i questioned him about it he assured me it was correct after checkout i received a call that they were going to charge me the other 200 mistake they made i also left a jacket in the room and called lost and found twice both times saying theyd call me back and never did i waited a month and called back theres no jacket and no log of me every calling which is apparently against policy but the room was nice;3
hotel it not bad it about 1520 mins walk from times square staff helpful and very kind rooms not very big for double room bathroom was very small we didnât like it personally clean and tidy hotel not ideal if you want to be closer or in time square;3
stayed at this hotel for 4 nights elevators were being repaired and to the hotels credit there were notices posted everywhere including on their website and in the hotel rooms but still one evening i had to wait 7 minutes for an elevator the rooms were so dark i ordered an extra lamp and still couldnt see much carpet seemed old two mornings my shower was luke warm food at the pub was marginal check in was a nightmare i was given a room that was still being cleaned went all the way down back up and got a room to which the keys didnt work come to find out someone else was booked in the same room at the same time got assigned another room and that one worked out fine the three good things about this hotel are the piano man at night in the lounge hes really;3
the location of this hotel couldnt be better its in walking distance of some amazing restaurants as well as the high line the hotel itself has a lovely historical lobby and staff that work at the hotel are extremely friendly and helpful the rooms are fine if you have a small amount of luggage we had 2 very large suitcases that had to sit in our room giving us even less room to move around i personally also like especially on a city break after having a long day walking around somewhere to relax at the end of the day and we did find ourselves not going back because it wasnt comfortable in the room regardless of any issues we had with the hotel the price is obviously fantastic for a new york hotel but i would personally now rather spend a bit more money for some;3
we have booked at the empire for the 4th time and were very satisfied with our previous stays but this time we were totally disappointed by rude front desk staff and an incredible situation we were given a room that was immensely different from all the previous ones so small we couldnt move around and with no place for our luggage and clothes it really seemed like a closet that was remodeled into a very tiny dark horrible matchbox room the staff took one night and a lot of attitude to move us to a room where two people could actually sleep that has made me question the 4 stars of the property and since we had just stayed for a few nights in the new and great nylo also in the uws area we were impressed by the gap in quality and customer relations standards between this;3
if youre planning on spending time in the hotel beyond sleeping and showering this hotel isnt for you its in a great spot for cityexplorers and museum goers pay for an upgraded room i was on the 11th floor and my room was clean renovated and just big enough for myself and one more person i dont use housekeeping when im at a hotel so i cant comment on that but the bathroom was clean and stocked my room was clean and tidy yes the air conditioner was loud but chilled the room nicely the elevators are slow and small hallways dark long and humid but if youre just going to and from your room youre fine my only major complaint was how long it took for the hot water to come when trying to shower it took about 1520 minutes but i planned accordingly and;3
never been to a hotel without coffee pot or coffee i have now housekeeping doesnt keep coffee on the cart have to call front desk for coffee daily and ask for coffee pot all vents need cleaning badly location is great for site seeing the hotel does need upgrading with decor the door men were helpful the front desk people answered our questions but had no personality i would probably stay again but would try to get reservations somewhere else;3
booked this hotel as it had a rooftop pool but were advised upon arrival that it was closed also the fitness centre not happy lock on hotel room was faulty and had to be looked at several times during our stay corridors smelt of cigarette smoke even though hotel has a no smoking policy beds and pillows not the most comfortable and bathroom was the smallest id ever seen staff were ok and doormen were friendly and helpful breakfast in hotel not great either for the usd20 that it costs;3
the elevator transportation system is woefully inadequate although the staff realizes the issue and provides a letter with the hotel key the waits of up to 15 minutes for an elevator is unacceptable;3
hotel was book through prime sports for the rose bowlgame package good all the employees that you have contact withwait staff front desk bellmenwere fabulousbad maintenance and housekeeping we complained twice that the heat in our room was not working properlytemperature would not go above 70did not have consistent housekeepingone day did not even have servicewhen i complained was told that we did not have service because we put out a do not disturb signwe never put out any signwe were ignored by a front desk management when i calledi guess i would recommend the hotel but be wise;3
the empire hotel is old but quirkily refurbished a great boutique hotel but unfortunately there were a few quirks that werent on the positive side the lobby area which also holds the bar lounge is generally kept too cold to be comfortable we were visiting in early autumn and the staff do not offer refreshments on the other hand the rooms were uncomfortably warm the airconditioner needed to be on high when it was less than 10 degrees outside from 8am doors in the corridor were slamming for an hour or so beyond what seemed normal for the amount of doors there were rooms are small but standard for ny and the bathrooms tiny but all manageable recommend that you purchase water from duane reed downstairs as the overpriced minibar is a ridiculous 7;3
i have been to new york 10 times and i have never stayed in this part of town upper west side but chose the astor based on its proximity to a music festival i was attending i stayed with a large group of people and the rooms were what i expected for nyc small washrooms in both rooms had clearly been redone and were nicer overall the decor could be drastically improved but if all you need is a cheap clean place to stay this is the place for you also quick walk to a subway stop and really close to tons of delis and pizza places if you need something quick and cheap to eat one woman at the front desk was especially helpful and really nice;3
the front desk staff is a nightmare misinformed rude and argumentative with each other about policies rooms were nice and clean but a bit expensive for what was essentially just a giant bed and side table;3
ok people please read this review before you read any others and before you plan on booking the woogocentral park apartments for your stay in new york trust me as a poor married college student i understand that everyone is looking to get the absolute best deal possible when travelingespecially to expensive places like new york so it makes sense to try and book the place thats only 195 a night instead of say the marriot at 350 a nightbut if you want to save the money and stay at the woogo apartments there are two things you must understand first 1 these are temporary apartments this is not the suite at the westin times square this is a lowkey lowmaintenence facility that is for people who do not care about having their rooms cleaned everyday;3
250 for the night and the bathroom door didnât close all the way there may as well have not been a bathroom door no glassware in the room and paper thin walls we only stayed here because of its close proximity to lax but i will never stay here again some of the other hotels were almost as close;3
the hotel is nice good location in close proximity to the subways the bar was closed 4 of the 5 nights we were there because of private parties so that was a bummer our room was very small we had a bunkbed room 50 square feet we knew it would be small but it was really small the only tvs available were at the end of the beds and the beds were so small we had to get in our own bed and watch them separately not what i prefer on vacation our room service was pretty bad the maid did not change our sheets until the night before we left we called the front desk and asked if they would do it and the said they would we told them we were leaving at noonwe returned at 730 pm and she was cleaning the room next door she hadnt gotten to us yet;3
we stayed at the empire for 3 nights in june as a group of 4 girls we had requested 2x queen rooms next to each other upon arrival we were told that the only rooms available were on the smoking floor as non smokers we werent particularly happy with this but we reached a solution whereby we would be in smaller rooms not on the smoking floor for the first night and the following night we could move to larger rooms a category above what we had booked the concierge had warned us the rooms on the first night would be small we initially struggled to find them as they looked like cupboard doors rather than rooms there wasnt much space at all in these rooms trying to get in and out of the bathroom was quite a test of agility the showers only had a half screen there was;3
this was our first visit to ny and for location in our opinion we could not have picked a better hotel we had looked at the previous reviews and frankly where a little nervous of what to expect on arrival the lobby looked clean with great dã©cor and our booking in was friendly and efficient our room was very small and had no view at all however it was in line with previous comments and what we expected it had a comfortable clean bed and was suitable for our needs as a base but the bathroom was in desperate need of a revamp and re decoration peeling paint job old soap residues left on the side of the bath rough and extremely worn bath bottom which was uncomfortable under foot had it not been for the location then i think we would feel really let down the staff;3
compare to other cheap hotels on the uws this is by far the best choice located directly at the subway express local lines upper floors seems to be freshly renovated and offer a decent size for ny hotels in this price range the only down side is that there are only two elevators active which could lead to significant waiting times during peak hours;3
i didnt expect much near subway and off broadway but hotel was run down even after what looked like an attempt to upgrade bathroom door was falling apart paint was peeling off wall like wallpaper elevator was cramped and dirty dresser looked like a file cabinet overall i wont be backbut you get what you pay for;3
went to nyc to visit our aunt she lives extremely close to the empire hotel and she was paying so she decided on this hotel the first room we were assigned aunt said was too small for us she was staying at her apartment and not at the hotel so we moved to a larger room which was better and over looked broadway and 63rd the hotel is way too dark the elevators slow cable tv ok and there are some upgrades needed especially in the bathrooms tiles chipped and shower leaked not too much storage space also i thought this was weird the hook on the back of the bathroom door was so high i couldnt reach it im 5ft2 that has never happened before overall it was a good hotel to crash in after hectic long days of sightseeing location was great with an awesome fruit;3
stayed here 4 nights in december in a unrefurbished metro double room 2x double beds the hotel is well placed at the junction of west 34th st and 8th avenue a large number of subway access points if that is how you intend to get around most of the must see places are easily accessible on foot indeed the empire state building is only 10 minutes away madison square is less than that 5mins housekeeping kept the rooms clean and tidy and bedding was changed during the stay suppose the question of whether i would return is definitely but might look to stay in a better quality room but that would depend on cost as you only there to sleep;3
very good location youre in the middle of the town close to times square 10min walk kingsize room is very bigcomfortable with a modern bathgreat shower very loud baddirty windows street;3
so i will make this as fair as i can be unlike some of the other latest dubious reviews driving up to the hotel you wonât see the waterfall as shown on the pictures as this is in fact at the back of the property itâs fairly nondescript from the front with a drive up to the front lobby checking in was fine and the two gentlemen on the front desk were friendly you do have to leave a small refundable deposit 100 at the time of writing for your stay however i did feel uncomfortable with the hotel taking my passport and making a photocopy of it i donât know of any hotel outside of eastern europe who does this practice and see no reason for doing this with guests that aside checkin was completed and was i was shown where the lift was my room classed as starlet queen;3
convenient to airport but not much else going for it room service average at best and overpriced after added charges and tip was charged for room water that was not used got that corrected after a few phone calls but an unnecessary hassle;3
our stay at the jane was part of a 5 month trip through the americas part of a sabbatical from work the place is a novelty for sure the rooms have a narrow spare to operate in so you need to be tidy if there are two of you you will bump bounce and scratch on the fixtures and fittings but its ok and the location is great collecting water from the lift elevator is strange but ok the place models itself on being quirky and cool the latter is its downfall every night bar the last night of our stay i heard the music and felt the vibrations from the ballroom where hte whos who of nyc seem to hang out it is very cool but when youre in ny for 5 days and want to be out and about in the morning you should consider the impact of this on your following day lets just say;3
we stayed for one night early december so with that in mind it was ok the room is small and very hot better than cold there is a bathroom with toilet the bonus was there is a breakfast granted not a huge choice but it does the job i agree with other travellers it does need some tlc and upgrading it is very tired however you dont spend your holiday in the hotel the location was good and we slept well what more do you need for a flying visit;3
what a good location for this hotel but it lets itself down in most other areas the rooms are small but comfortable enough the decor is dark and depressing and the staff are ok without being good the reasonably comfortable bar is again very dark and is limited in what it offers no bloody marys extras are very expensive wifi water in the room and they even charge for room made coffee or tea a first for us worst of all were the lifts we were on the 10th floor and more than once it took more that 10 minutes to descend the lift stopping at almost every floor only to find that there were no passengers to board rather frustrating;3
the moment we came through the door the lovely door man and the woman at the counter made us feel very welcome they kept us a king size bed with a park view which we where well pleased with the room is really confined there wasnt enough room to open your case and walk around the room without having to close and move your case to another part of the room because there wasnt anywhere big enough to store it the aircon was average every morning after i had a shower it was on but as i continued to get ready i ended up really hot and harassed with the confined space in the room too the bed was really comfortable the television had a range of channels and theres space to hang your clothes up and store them the staff where excellent we phoned down for ice a few times and;3
we were in ny for a black tie wedding and had very little space to dress it was difficult to put makeup on in the tiny bathroom and the lighting was very poor when we checked in i was told that the bigger room on the 11th floor would be noisy at night when the bar was open;3
the windsor hotel is a good place to stay as long as you accept that it is not exactly what it advertises itself to be the safes in the room dont work the kid at the counter offered to hold on to my valuables thanks but no thanks and the wireless was down but the hotel is clean you dont have to share a bathroom with anyone and besides that one sort of harebrained kid everyone else at the desk was totally cool and super helpful plus it is located in one of the coolest parts of the city a couple of blocks to either the lower east side little italy soho east village and right on a quiet strip of chinatown we had some issues with the plumbing in the room but after shoving that kid at the desk around a bit he finally gave us another room that worked the;3
i had read reviews after we booked this hotel so i was not taken by surprise when we arrived the elevator is indeed only big enough to accomodate two people with one large piece of luggage each our room was the smallest i have ever slept in someone commented that they could only open one suitcase at a time unless you put them on the bed thats true there was barely enough room to walk around the bed the tv was within reaching distance of the foot of the bed and it was a model i havent seen in years that being said the room was clean and the bed was comfortable the bathroom was also clean although the shower enclosure was a bit odd a large pane of glass or plexi that extended half way down the tub leaving the other half open it meant strategically;3
just returned from 4 nights at this hotel first impressions good very sexy long line to check in their room card machine had broken down so the only way to get into the room was for reception to page security to let each client in individually which clearly took some time the room was tiny with very little storage in spite of being a superior king air conditioning unit ancient and the dial to control the heat was missing made the mistake of unpacking before checking the bathroom which was in a dreadful state of maintenance wooden surround of the shower was actually rotted and you could lift a piece of splintered wood right out paint flaking off the woodwork metal surround of the magnifying mirror rusted and 9 inch space between the sink front and the wall meant the;3
my husband and i stayed at the new yorker on our honeymoon and we found the hotel to be in an absolutely brilliant location the room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size all could do with a referb but ultimately it was cozy and suited our needs well although no tea coffee making facilities which for a brit abroad was startling one thing to be aware of with this hotel is how tightly packed in the rooms are therefore your neighbours sound like theyre in the room with you we had horrendously noisy neighbours on our first night which to be fair security came and spoke to who didnt shut up until 5am after this the hotel decided that their maintenance team needed to be in the next room for the rest of our trip the next 3 mornings had us;3
hotel was okay needs a bit of a makeover bit dated rooms are quite small staff was friendly the hotel is very close to everything in good location of macys and train station staff and cleaners were very friendly so overall had a great time in new york;3
we have stayed at the empire on several occassions and thought it would be the perfect hotel to stay in for our wedding in central parc oct 28th 2012we had a party of 35 people and we highly recommended this hotelon arrival none of our rooms were readysome of our friends were still hanging around in the reception two hours later and still hadnt checked inwhen we eventually went to our room the carpet floor was soaking from the air conditioningour room was far from a bridal suite it was actually the smallest of all the rooms we had bookedseveral of our quests had to complain about their rooms as some doors werent securethe list is actually endless and i was very dissapointed as this hotel is not cheapi will definately consider staying elsewhere this year as i visit every;3
stay report 1213 to 1214 locationâ the hotel is located about as close to lax as you can get which makes the terminal walkableâ thats a good thing these days as the delays getting in and out are still horrendousâ also do note that hotel shuttles now pick up on the departure level not the arrival oneâ i was also able to walk to pick up my avis rental the next day and it was a pleasant one mile strollâ hotelâ the hotel has a nice lobby with a bar that stays open until 12 and a decent sized market which sells a lot of to go itemsâ the second floor has a business center key card activated and a lot of meeting spaceâ i didnt deal with any waits for elevatorsâ the hotel is right next to a huge parking garage and in fact shares its shuttle with them check;3
this hotel was really mixed but may be suitable depending on what you are after there were good points the front desk people were cheerful efficient but often busy the upper west side location is nice if you want to stay away from the bustle of times square5th ave with subway entrances within a minutes walk rooms were quiet not cramped by ny standards wifi was free but the bad was quite bad i saw the doorman being quite rude to some guests we were shocked to find the tv did not work no channels at all the room was old not so clean although upper floors are renovated i found the room too warm there were no controls for me to adjust there is no onsite food outlet but there are lots of neighboring places which deliver to the guests the shower took ages to;3
as typical for a hilton very good staff and very clean with comfortable bed and furnishings car valet service was excellent location cant be beat if you are visiting universal studios unfortunately we got a bad room we were next to the gym and the weights dropping were annoying even worse the water was never really hot in the bathroom alarm clock did not work although it was replaced to their credit they gave us a free breakfast for 4 on our last day but in my opinion the stay was disappointing at the price we paid i expect no issues;3
we arrived around 10 am on friday may 20th pros we got an early check in at the desk for just a 25 fee if your room wasnt ready they did let you check the baggage with them everything was clean they make sure you have a room key before you enter the elevator area they have a little museum downstairs from the lobby about the hotel we didnt visit this as we didnt have time they let us have a late check out for no additional fee at 100 pm view was pretty decent from 35th floor cons our hairdryer did not work we plugged it in and it made a burning smell we called downstairs and it took about twenty minutes to get a new one which didnt work well because we had a show we had to be at in ten minutes the room was a lot smaller than the picture;3
overall not bad but hvac system in the room was very loud all night long loud vibrating and clanking noises turning on and off every 10 minutes made getting a good sleep impossible bring a set of ear plugs if you want to sleep soundly other than that not a bad hotel;3
the wyndham new yorker is in a great location essentially diagonally across from penn station and the price especially with the senior discount was superb the rooms are a bit dated and basic lacking in sufficient outlets at the desk to charge a computer and a phone simultaneously though there were other outlets if you looked around my bathroom sink didnt drain properly and wasnt really fixed when i brought it to their attention engineering tried but didnt succeed and there was no information about the hotel and city in the room i ask twice and was eventually told by the front desk that we dont do that anymore front desk staff were very welcoming and friendly all in all a good value in a fantastic location its a 3star hotel which is what i paid;3
i have stayed at this hotel before and was very impressed with their customer service and quality of rooms they used to leave a fresh cut flower in the room and you would get a red apple upon checkin this trip my experience of their customer service was not impressive i arrived late and needed help with my shower and the engineer took a long time to get to the room in addition getting on the rooms wifi was very difficult and it was too much of a hassle to log into the rooms wifi even if you have to pay for it it was easier to go to the lobby and take advantage of the free wifi totally inconvenient for a business traveler when calling the front desk they took a long time to answer their phones to the point i had to place the phone on speaker and insist it keep;3
good location nice clean good customer service but not worth the cost would go for something different next time in room they charge for everything even the coffee thumbs down for that the pool is more like a hot tub size of course view from the roof was great but couldnt go up at night because it was closed for a private event;3
i booked this hotel over the internet and i was not familiar with los angeles at all upon arrival it was dusk and the neighbourhood was very intimidating we were less than pleased and though we were booked for 5 nights we debated about moving hotels immediately however we ventured out in a car and sunset and hollywood blvds are only a minute drive the hotel was fine the food was fine and the nieghbourhood is a little rough around the edges but follow the protocol youd follow in any major city and youll be fine a car is handy as well;3
we chose the empire because we were looking for something different from the usual chain hotel and what we thought would be authentic twenties style new york we based our choice on the recommendation of british airways and info from the empires site the decor is pseudo art dã©co and the main lobby a bit somber so not to everyones taste whats really a pity is that this atmosphere is destroyed by the loud boom boom of pop music as you enter positive points the situation very near central park and within walking distance of mid town we specifically requested rooms around the sixth floor overlooking dante park and were not disappointed the view of lincoln center at night is great the receptionist on arrival was polite and helpful i suppose because there had been;3
the room was small but clean our room 908 is dark due to limited natural light the rates of using any of the snacks left in the room are expensive we would have apreciated a kettle i the room to make ourselves a hot drinkthere are hot drinks available for free in the dinning room of a morning without purchasing breakfast but not at any other time purchasing hot drinks several times whilst away is quite an aditional expense geoff the doorman was particularly helpful and friendlyhe clearly knows the city well and doesnt encourage customers to waste their money;3
shocked that only one cup of coffee is given per suite no room service did not get a call back from lost and found for my gym clothes left behind the bathroom door why does one have to forfeit the entire reservation mine was 7 nights if they do not show up on the first day;3
i returned to this hotel because of a great experience only to be disappointed the checkin was a 20minute wait when we arrived with only one person at the front and a long line up of people then they promised to text me when the room was ready again it did not happen finally when i went over my final billing and used points i had one staff member at the front desk who could not help and another one being rude to me when i was simply asking a question 3 strikes and you are out when it comes to customer experience the hotel is great and the rooms were excellent;3
cheap as you like shared toilets and showers etc but i didnt care room was very basic but was ok cheap and central as you like cannot fault that anyone looking fora luxury apartment visit is barking up the wrong tree but this is the real nyc as far as i am concerned the reception reminds me of us police front desk and the various securities and antiquated booking system with its hand written chits etc is fascinating i have nothing bad to say about the place probably hipster paradise;3
the room was small but clean staff was pleasant the bed pillows are extremely small we asked for one more the bed has 3 it never came despite our request we were awakened on our first night at around 2am by a very loud crash and sound like glass breaking unsure what it was but when we looked out our window in the morning our view was basically a graveyard of used sinks ac units and chairs the location is wonderful so that made up for a lot if you just want a place to sleep after your city fun this hotel is good;3
first time in new york and the new yorker hotel on 8th ave first impressionlobby etc very niceart deco hotel hotel staff very friendlycheck in took around 20 minuets having to queas it was a birthday trip for my wife we got a free room upgrade on the 43rd floor with excellent views of new york and hudson river in the distance room was something youâd expect from a 1930s film by tastefully donevery niceajoining the hotel was the âtick tock dinerâ great breakfaststaff were excellentvery funnybroad new york accents and loved to chatloved it new york is a great placelots to do and seefelt very safe walking and using the subwaypacked so much into 5 days but need another trip as still loads to do and see going back next year and dining at delmonicos restaurantso;3
ive stayed at the empire repeatedly over the past four years and each time find there to be an issue with my stay that makes the experience frustrating whether being put in a room right under the rooftop bar with music pounding all night getting an interiorfacing room with no real sunlight despite being a repeat business traveler having elevators not working or delayed or most disturbingly the general i could care less attitude of all of the staff i wonder why i stay here so often they never recognize my loyalty or welcome me back like other hotels do they dont work to fix problems to make guest stays more enjoyable the location is excellent and near my office which is the primary reason i keep going back but im going to look at other options for the future on;3
we stayed at the astor for five nights and were pleasantly surprised after reading some bad reviews before going the room was clean but a little on the small side with a good view over central park the staff were friendly and helpful particuly felicia from reception the hotel is near harlem at the top end of cental park west however there is subway a couple of blocks away on 103rd street to take you to all of new yorks attractions within a matter of minutes we were told before going that the hotel offered continental breakfast when in fact it was just free tea and coffee down in the basement however there are a few very reasonably priced delis a few short blocks away the next time we go to new york we would stay somewhere a bit more central but would definately;3
a request made during our booking was not fulfilled and was not mentioned by the hotel we arrived 2 days late due to the failure of ba no surprise there to get us there noone at reception offered any sort of comment on how we must be feeling or any sort of dialogue about it at all some might say thats just normal but in the service industry something like that is a great way to show good customer service the room was small basic and the windows cant have been washed for months the windowsills were thick with dust but the rest of the room was clean the ac worked well which was great we waited for almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged when we went to try out breakfast so decided not to bother and didnt dine in the hotel so cant review this the pool was;3
a historic hotel with a proud history today hotelwise i consider it average on the plus side it is in a very good location in midtown manhatten opposite madison square garden and next to penn station it is a decent place good for a quick stay or for a business trip just dont expect anything fancy some of the floors are rented out as student accommodation so you will see a lot of students there the 24hour diner is very handy if you need to eat or drink at odd hours you can visit an exhibition about the history of the hotel in the basement for free;3
great location great security procedures at the entrance and in room we must show the room key to the security personnel before getting in the elevator when we returned to the room during the room cleaning was in service the cleaning personnel asked us to put the key card to open the door in order to proof that we stay in that room bed and restroom cleaning are good the hotel should improve the cleanliness in the hallway corridor entrance and the far to reach areas in the room such as lightninglamps bathroomvent on the ceiling etc it was very dusty and dull the the hotel very greatly the deadbolt at the door was out of order the room smelled a bit and we sensed overpower use of the air refreshing spray to override the odour in the room we were so far;3
two friends and i agreed to meet here to attend concerts in la my friend made the booking i was a little skeptical when i read some of the reviews so here is my take it was previously known as the hollywood hotel it is a fairly large property on vermont avenue and looks like a typical hotel out of the 60s or 70s but was it rundown no it was quite obvious that considerable effort has gone into the property to renovate the facilities and there wasnt much to fault i am plead to say the rates are very reasonable which explained why the place was quite busy and could not accomodate me for additional nights while i would not call the place elegant it was much better than i expected in appearance and comfort breakfast was also more than;3
my husband and i were transferred to this hotel by ameritania who we had originally booked with but they were fully booked we received complimentary wifi and breakfast the room the room itself was quite small it had a fridge and lots of nibbles you could buy but they were extortionately priced eg bottle of evian water 750ml was 8 although the ac was powerful it was very noisy sounding like a tractor at times the bathroom like the room was small too it had a shower but no door to close it so water kind of splashed everywhere breakfast the complimentary breakfast was lovely delicious scrambled eggs with potatoes you had the choice of fruit cereal yoghurt breads pastry and drinks included tea coffee and juice location the location of this hotel is;3
great location if you are planning to spend the day at universal studios hollywood my friends and i stayed for one night and were given a double room on the 7th floor room 766 it was large clean and quiet the carpet had a few stains but that was to be expected and the shower head needed changing pressure wasnt great the peter roth amenities were great and it was overall a good hotel for the convenience and cleanliness i didnt eat at cafe sierra only because i had the dinner buffet there a few years back and go food poisoning for about three days not sure how it is now but i wasnt dying to find out pool was clean too but it gets a bit windy on some days;3
the property is old so the rooms are very tiny tinier than others ive experience in nyc on the plus side they took most of the available space for the shower on the minus side the toilet was difficult to use without hurting yourself on the toilet paper holder the wall and the sink potentially all at the same time the bed was comfortable but the tv was off to the side so difficult to view from the bed the safe was too small for more than a laptop but there was a safe we were sucked into a free breakfast presentation at a new wyndham property not far away so we thought why not but it turned out to be a very aggressive timeshare sales pitch and the breakfast was a sad showing of a small scoop of scrambled eggs a couple pieces of bacon and a small;3
good location but this is an old hotel that has been partly refurbished we were in a standard room 807 too small inside facing and far too dark after complaining we were offered an alternative an outside facing room much brighter less depressing and slightly larger despite this the bathrooms are all the same size and just too small to be practical i think the air con units are the same age as the hotel very noisy and not efficient in july with temperatures approaching 100 degrees fahrenheit you need the air con to work we stayed on a room only basis and made the mistake of having breakfast in house at a minimum 26 dollars per person starbucks downstairs seemed much better value 2 of the concierges were very helpful yuri and sergei the general;3
at first lookthe the hotel was great nice room good location but the first morning when we went to breakfast there was a cockroach running across the wall next to me made my skin crawl on the 3rd night the toilet overflowerd through out the bathroom when we called reception he came in and said heres some towels someone will fix it tomorrow eeek the location was good though the train was just across the road which made it cheap and easy to get to the kodak theatre and to universal and downtown they had tours on offer that pick you up from the hotel which was great for the money it was okay but they do need to do some work to the place;3
excellent customer service central location close to subway shops etc an excellent base for our stay noisy due to large volume of traffic and use of vehicle horns windows could do with being updated to reduce the noise;3
we spent 11 days here in september and it was a nice stay overall the room was huge and more than enough for a family of five but the rooms and rest of the hotel for that matter is tired and needs a massive renovation the staff seemed quite rude most of the time and only seemed interested in helping if you were going to tip them plus i heard a lot of people complaining at the front desk the location is right in the middle of midtown and right next to penn station so this saved a lot on taxis;3
but they really need to update all of the rooms my last visit with them wasnt too bad now they have microwaves which is awesome my knob on the shower was hanging off the hinges;3
we stay in new yorker hotel over thanksgiving week the hotel is located 10min walking distance to time square and beside pennsylvania station as 4 star hotel its not even close to 4 star hotels in europe its very old decor need revamp asap we paid 1400 for suit believe me nothing special overall good stay but for me is basic 3 star hotel;3
the new yorker has a fabulous location in midtown close to the subway and a great number of the âmust seeâ nyc sights itâs architecturally stunning and the trattoria bianca bar and tick tock restaurant have great ambience and are reasonably priced however we had two real issues with our 4 night stay last week first was that due to the hotel being full the room i had booked and paid for was ânot availableâ despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all the second was that the concierge tried to charge me 130 for tickets to a game at the garden that i actually paid only 54 at msg box office so unfortunately i have to advise that if you choose to stay at the new yorker donât think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid;3
this hotel is quite old and needs some work the rooms are tiny but cozy enough for a place to sleep thats about it i was stir crazy a lot of the time the bathrooms are decent but still cramped we are also provided cut upshredded small pieces of scrap towels for wash clothes the outlets were busted and seemed like a fire hazard i was too scared to leave anything plugged in it was close to the subway lines and taxis passed by regularly all three days we were there housekeeping would knock and then immediately open the door on one occasion there wasnt even a knock she just opened it if you are looking for a more affordable but less luxurious place to stay i would recommend it;3
overall the hotel was clean with friendly staff i was not pleased with the cleanliness of the bathroom however the rest of the guestroom was fine i could hear when someone used the toilet and my toilet made a horrendous sound when flushed;3
was billed upfront rather than on arrival as my booking indicated this caused an issue as my colleague was from our irish office in ireland and had a different expense route so i had to put through as one as the uk which was not ideal;3
the hotel is definitely run of the mill we felt it was aged and needed an upgrade the waiter was pleasant but had no idea what gluten free meant checking out was interesting she charged me for the breakfast we had just paid cash for she charged car paring twice this took considerable time i wanted to pay by cash passport in us dollars but she put it though on my nz credit card which they insist on having as security i didnt want to use that i await my credit card account to see what the damage will be after reversing and fixing this im not sure what i was actually charged i do feel a language barrier contributed to this confusion;3
enjoyed a 5 night stay in december excellent location opposite the met sadly our room was very small and the air con was noisy but otherwise we enjoyed our stay also being charged for wifi in 2015 is a little cheeky only free wifi in the lobby the concierge both guys were excellent thank you for restaurant bookings and juel and nikki in the hotel bar were flawless thanks to you both see you next december;3
there is no doubting that the hotel provides a brilliant location for sightseeing in new york situated across the road from madison square gardens and 5 mins away from the empire state building however hidden costs for basic essentials such as wifi take the sheen off your stay 95 dollars for 4 days worth of wifi is a pretty rough deal the charge also covers international phonecalls but then how useful this is to tourists on a sightseeing trip is a matter of opinion on top of this a petty 2 dollar charge per item for left luggage on checkout isnt exactly accommodating given the nightly charge for the room and the hotels inflated in my opinion 4 status my wife and i have been fortunate enough to travel the world and we have never come across such blatant;3
disappointed that we had double beds not queen or king and it was a tight fit for my daughter and i on one but my son had his own bed felt it was rather expensive but did not expect otherwise in nyc elevators were a challenge but we dealt with them as an experience staff were all very helpful and friendly;3
if youre looking for a clean roombathroom and a friendly staff at a moderate price then this is a good hotel to stay in while in new york city the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful it is true that the rooms are very small and that the elevator and hallways are old and in real need of updating but i didnt really care about that my room and bathroom were extremely clean so i was satisfied we had a room overlooking central park but the windows were dirty from the outside there was easy transportation from this hotel because the bus stop and train station were about a block away my fourteenyearold daughter and i stayed here in february 2014 during the winter break from school the week was a treat to her and when the staff at the desk found this;3
first time to new york and was there for business conference new yorker accommodations were quaint and full of nostalgia great location for walking to some of the tourist sights and feeling the buzz of the city but not luxury stay by any means staff were helpful and friendly;3
got a family suite based off of pictures on hotels website great location excellent staff the room on the other hand was severely lacking half the size of what was pictured on the intenet and the bathroom was pretty busted and could use a refresh;3
small but very comfortable room beautiful and fun patio area toilet didnt work well have to take a cab to go the 25 miles to hollywood area but a lot of fun things to do there neighborhood a little scary for walking 70 cab ride from lax hotel does not provide shuttle does have car parking;3
ideal location but overpriced and some staff dishonest most i should say weâre very pleasant but checkin clerk told us there was a 10 fee for wifi one off this turned out to be every day so we paid 50 instead of 10 after the cost of this hotel itâs simply dishonest the 45 dollar a day retainer also seems a little high also although you do get this back minus the charges would we stay again likely not the hotels dated but filled with history so whilst the corridors look like something from the the shining itâs actually tolerable;3
very friendlily staff rooms are just ok bathroom beautiful and very roomybut very ill equipped was trapped in shower with only 1 tiny shampoo and 1 mouthwash which i mistook for conditioner for a family of 4 only after requesting more it took 1 hour to deliver it very amazing breakfast buffet and most helpful and kind wait staff the seafood buffet in the evenings was unbelievably large and comprehensive and beautifully arranged but at times confusing with additional stations and buffet tables in the hallways outside the restaurant super close to universal city walk free printer use for boarding passes was a nice feature the really big problem arrived 1 month later when i was charged an additional 200 on my card and no one could tell me what it was for until a;3
nice rooms free breakfast is good the location isnt great and for â£100 per night you are away from everything next to subway station and buses to santa monica so not to bad builders started banging at 8 am on our first morning not great after a long flight nice waffles though;3
i was on a short business trip to nyc 4 days needed a comfortable quiet hotel in a safe area at reasonable price close to the subwaymetro i found the astor to be just that the room was tiny but clean and comfortable i find that people often complain about a lack of space in budget hotels however if you are only in a hotel for a comfortable sleep in a clean room with a clean bathroom then why look for extra space which normally comes with a higher price tag i would use it again even if accompanied by my wife;3
yes its not the best area but really where is in this area its close and convenient to the hollywood sites and offers decent nightly rates compared to other hotels in the area the hotel is clean and quiet for the most part nothing fancy noticeable areas of improvement but comfortable they charge almost 20 for parking in their gated lot which was a bit disappointing but the complimentary breakfast made up for it a lot of items to choose from including an made to order omelet bar they said they have a bar but it didnt open until 6pm so we werent able to check it out;3
stayed 4 days at the new yorkersmall room by our standards but well appointed but you had to pay extra daily for a teacoffee machine in your room great location to penn station hop on hop off bus route very clean and comfortable bed;3
the rooms are small but kept pretty clean no coffee making facilities in the rooms but there is a vending machine below the lobby sadly not working during our stay the staff are friendly enough and im sure helpful though we didnt require any help so cant say for sure its location on the main road is an advantage for transport but also makes it a little noisy too overall if i were to return to new york i would stay there again;3
this hotel has a lovely bar and leisure area the staff was very friendly and the concierge extremely helpful as with any hotel in new york this hotel was as well very small four of us stayed in a room with 2 double beds there was barely enough room to place our luggage to allow for walking space the bathroom was smaller than my coat closet back home so there was definitely not enough room for four woman to get ready each day luckily the bedroom did have a large mirror it was a warm week in new york during our stay the air conditioning was a joke so the room did get a bit hot this hotel is a bit north of time square but only about a 1520 minute walk the subway is easily accessible and its a 2 minute walk to central park;3
good value for money very spacious room with 2 double and comfy beds clean size of hotel made it seem a bit impersonal and although efficient staff we encountered were not warm or friendly waiting for lifts wasnât too much of an issue for use despite being up very high i would probably stay again because of value for money but would have lower expectations of staff;3
overall my stay wasnt too bad i did indeed expect more but i was still satisfied with my stay the location of the hotel is perfect and the lobby is very luxurious and welcoming but the rooms could have been a bit better the bathroom was very small and the shower only had one door which made the bathroom floor very wet and slippery after showering;3
famed as the hotel that received the survivors of the illfated titanic the jane is a wonderful old style victorian hotel with a touch of the indian raj the magnificent bar features tapestries of an indian maharajah an indian lady and a black and white photograph of an unidentified man wearing full masonic regalia the stunning fireplace reaches almost to the ceiling and features a large ram at the top surrounded by old victorian couches and aspidistras one half expects to see sean connery michael caine and rudyard kipling enjoying a gin and tonic the standard rooms for single travelers are reminiscent of a ships cabin but come with television inroom safety deposit box air conditioning and free bottled water the shared bathroom for this type of room initially;3
we were initially very pleased with this hotel until the third day of our stay when we had two separate disappointing customer service experiences the first two days we ate at the breakfast buffet the food and service was excellent oralia made our omelets exactly as we ordered them and was very friendly she had a smile on her face and was pleasant and cheerful to both coworkers and other customers the third day of our stay oralia was not working and elvira made our omelets she used an extremely high heat causing the entire restaurant to smell like burnt eggs when my daughter asked her to remake her burnt omelet she got upset and argued with us that the brown burnt part was the bacon she continued to argue with us about it and asked if we wanted the egg raw;3
the hotel itself is gorgeous the 1920âs decor is beautiful the staff are all friendly and helpful and some of the floors appear to be updated but not ours the 20th floor looks tired the carpets worn the paintwork chipped and grubby our room was clean had a comfortable bed tv alarm clock that you can plug your phones into which was just as well as i was too scared to use the sockets in the wall all loose and felt a bit dangerous to use the plumbing is definitely 1920âs the shower was poor and the bathroom dated there was no coffeetea making facilities it was only on checkout i learned i could have had them for an extra charge however plenty of places nearby to get a coffee including the excellent though expensive tick tick diner my sons were given a;3
the hotel was in a fantastic location just a short easy walk to universal studiosupon our arrival the greeting was tepid the room was ok tired and in need of a faceliftwe had a fantastic day in universal studios when we arrived back to our hotel room our room had been cleaned but we discovered our daughters special necklace was missing she had left a few items on her bed which were carefully placed on the bedside table all except her necklace needless to say this was upsetting we filed a report but have had no response we didnt realize the uncleanliness of the room until we were searching corner to corner for the necklace bits of dried food packaging debristhe room was in need of a thorough cleaning the beds were small but comfortable;3
the hotel is kind of a dump the rooms are older there is a lot of wear and tear in general but next time i visit nyc i plan on making another reservation here it is in a great location very close to the 72nd subway station and i never felt unsafe here you really are getting what you pay for id recommend this hotel to anyone who isnt planning to spend a lot of time at the actual hotel we just wanted a place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing in an area we would feel safe in at night and this was perfect if you are going to be spend alot of time in the hotel you might want to check around for a different place to stay the rooms were clean the staff was very helpful and friendly the lack of a showerbathroom in the room wasnt ideal but we didnt have any;3
this hotel is in a great location and thats probably why we would go back we were sceptical prior to arrival because some of the poor reviews that were coming in but it was okay the room was small with a small desk and tiny wardrobe so be prepared to live out your suitcase no full length mirror only a small one in the bathroom the bathroom was so tiny you had to use the sink side on however the room was clean enough most of the staff were lovely the girl is a bit nippy just be aware that you cannot check in to your room before 3pm check in and you must checkout on time 11am we witnessed a guy getting charged 50 for checking out at 1140am;3
stayed here overnight before an early morning flight the common areas and room were very nice however the staff were somewhere between standoffish and just plain rude the front desk refused to add my world of hyatt number to the stay because i had booked it through a third party although the remodel is complete they didnt do anything to cut the noise i specifically requested a quiet room to sleep and got one at the end of the hall with all of the noise of the traffic at the intersection of century and sepulveda i could also still hear the folks bumbling around out in the hall at checkout in the morning there was nobody at the desk i gave my key cards to a random maintenance employee who was nearby the shuttle does run as advertised but better;3
this is an older hotel that is clearly being renovated in some aspects the room sizes are incredibly tiny as well as the bathroom donât expect to fit 2 people in the bathroom to get ready because that isnât going to happen the room was clean and tidy however there was a lot of damage for instance broken ceramic tiles holes in curtains from previous guests that was clearly never repaired things like this do take away from the quality of the room there is no seating in the room other than the bed and one desk chair if youâre having guests come to your room to hangout with you this is very inconvenient and uncomfortable the view from our room on the 8th floor was nothing spectacular just the back side of another building looking into other peoples rooms definitely;3
this hotel is in serious need of an update it is old and tired and filled with clutter the events space spills into the foyer and there were chair barricades everywhere the breakfast buffett was filled with choice but was messy and the food was poorly presented making it very unappealing the reception staff were cold and unfriendly the lifts were slow and unresponsive which was annoying on the 23 rd floor the security is poor as the lift does not require key card access meaning anyone can go anywhere in the hotel on the positive side the room was large and comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a hilton property the bathroom was large and the bed was great room service was fast and tasty the hotel is good value for money but the location is poor;3
we were looking for someplace cheap for one night in manhattan we found the jane was everything they advertised cheap and very small rooms the rooms were no bigger than a sleeping car on a train we found the rooms and shared bathrooms to very clean hotel staff was wonderful and helpful i wouldnt stay here if i was going to be in manhattan more than one night very very tight quarters;3
as another reviewer noted you get what you pay for and if youre flexible about things you get a clean comfortable room in a great location at a very competitive price but youve got to be willing to roll with inconveniences that get thrown your way in our case a woefully understaffed and poorly managed front desk that was overwhelmed with a large number of people trying to get their rooms only to be told that they werent ready yet another 1015 minutes we were told i water an hour and a half no kidding others from germany waited two hours not fun when i finally got my room it was not what i reserved i threw a bit of a fit and received an immediate and modest upgrade to a small room with a larger bed the furniture appeared to be used upper west side faux;3
nice hotel located close to universal studios accommodations for a family with children are lacking though no microwave in rooms or in a room for guests to use no continental breakfast for guests breakfast price is 28 per person which adds up quickly for a family of 7 parking is also 28 per day shuttle to u studios is also not strictly for hilton guests its for the area so being it was always full we walked there and back besides what i mentioned above everything else was fine;3
stayed here for 5 nights in september 2019 the room we had was a double queen room so that our daughter could share with us the beds were definitely not uk sized queen beds more like 34 doubles the room was clean and a reasonable size for new york no fridge minibar or coffee making facilities though the hotel has a nice lobby with the tick tock diner attached we used the diner a few times and the food etc was fine very handy when returning tired after a whole day out sightseeing there is also an italian and a steakhouse attached which we didnât try check in was quick the staff member didnât really take much time to talk to us or point out any features of the hotel just really âhereâs your key and the lifts are over thereâ i had contacted them in advance to tell;3
the hostel is located really close to hammersmith underground station the position is excellent to get to city centre since accomodotion in london are so dear this one is not so bad being quite cheap but staff is very very rude and you can just pay in cash which in 2013 is pretty unusual;3
my husband and i stayed here for a one night getaway ill start off with the positive the location is prime the decor atmosphere are hip trendy the staff were welcoming friendly and contrary to other posts we found it to be clean sadly upon checkin we were sent to our room superior king only to find it occupied and sounded like someone was vomiting we immediately returned to the front desk told them what happened the staff seemed baffled but remedied the situation quickly by giving us an upgrade to another room we could have done without the cigarette smell permeating throughout the floor we actually were shocked that smoking was still allowed in hotels overall not too shabby but not sure if we would return;3
the rooms were clean the place was ok the breakfast selection was a bit average but the omelets were nice i dont know about the fruit selection a few black spoted bananas and some cut up in pieces sitting there for a long period of time the carpet in the dinning area were rinkled and could give an old person a real nasty fall the day staff were excellent very helpful and nice the guy at night that organised me a taxi for the next morning ripped me off sounded like he knew the guy personally 98 to go 36mile said that was the going price and there wasnt much cheaper i find out the next day it was an express limo the area is a little dirty but felt safe there black spots of chewing gum remains all over the sidewalks around the area the metro rail is close by;3
tiny rooms heat made loud noise all night most at front desk not welcoming or friendly except for one bellboy who was great nice lobby no free internet and then it didnt always work eds chowder great for oysters at happy hour but very limited menu rooftop bar very nice location great for lincoln center be prepared to pay for everything with no extra niceties;3
great location and friendly staff however the hotel itself and rooms are very dated grubby in places and could do with an update rooms get a cursory once over but could do with a deep clean also no teacoffee making facilities in rooms;3
this a good hotel that is clean and average room the buffet is excellent but the lines waiting for the buffet are all over the place and not organized which create confusion between people waiting for the food and the guest transiting to check in or going out to the park also be awarded that you have to pay full parking prices around 2000 a day as a guest while other people visiting for conference buffet has a discount the check in process was below average and the attendant was very rude but the check out was very different very professional and friendly overall is a good place to stay if you visiting the universal studios park i am looking forward for the new hotel building close to the hilton thanks;3
excellent localization if you want a midtow off travel my room had a great view from the river rooms are old fashion but large and clean bathroom is new i didnt get the breakfast service was average there is an interesting cafe on the lobby negative noisy good price for nyc;3
the hotel looks good from the outside and the lobby is imposing and grand the room we were told we had a newly refurbished one was fine very spacious clean and had all the amenities youâd need the shower was crazy it flooded the bathroom and was such a direct powerful stream it was painful on your skin the physical location of the hotel is really convenient for exploring however after many trips to new york i have never seen such horrendous levels of homelessness and so much litter i certainly wouldnât have ventured out of the hotel alone;3
we were very worried about this place because of all the negative reviews bugs etc we really had no problems here it is a budget hotel so do not expect more than that the room was small but the bed was comfotable enough there was a november blizzard raging outside but we were plenty cozy staff were helpful with restaurant picks it is a decent location for lower manhatten we walked to the world trade center location ran to battery park etc good subway connections within a few hundred yards of the hotel;3
looks arent everything the room looked clean including the sheets there were towels dishes toilet paper a wardrobe a refrigerator there were about 4 kitchens on our side of the floor the 1st floor the street wasnt noisy and the window was a little bit away from the street so you didnt feel you right there near the sidewalk the wifi was ridiculously expensive so i didnt bother there is a library not too far away but they dont even have wifi there the walls are super thin so you can hear talking and lovemaking etc and the showers are communal so all your biogrime swishes around with everyone elses sometimes passing over your feet before it hits the drain you have to push a button for the water to run at 1min intervals and the water;3
for the price of the hotel dont expect hilton it is a nice budget hotel rooms are small but ok rooms are clean every day new clean towels location is good between two subway stations if you travel fromto la guardia airport there is a bus stop nearby and the ticket price to the airport is only 275;3
it seems upscale but the food is crazy expensive and the staff atleast at the front desk is pretty rude there is a shuttle that runs to and from universal city walk but itâs hit or miss on a schedule if u want to get to universal studios early just walk itâs a super easy and fast walk donât rely on the shuttle the rooms are clean but the isnât anything i can say other that is fine just fine you wonât be disappointed if u use self parking and donât expect to eat there and donât have any customer service expectations then itâs fine;3
my boyfriend and i went with a couple of friends to this spot for new years eve i personally had high expectations for this place considering the many reviews saying this is one of the major spots to go to for nye honestly i beg to differ with the reviews ive heard thus far so upon arrival the bouncers were not very pleasant and very rude when spoken to similar as the last experience we had a couple months back when we justwanted to see what the roof top was like it took us 12 hr for coat check for both dropping off and picking up our jackets the floors were slippery because of all the drinks that were spilled i slipped myself but gladly wasnt hurt the venue was just too small you literally had to push people just to make your way through as if everyone was a;3
like most properties in nyc the rooms are small we were fortunate enough to get a corner room which had 2 large windows pros major chain backed clean rooms and corridors subway near by near msg walking distance to times square and friendly staff cons small room checkin was a process did not get my loyalty points;3
great lobby bar free wifi good place to relax rooftop bar is ok needs more shaded areas as its so hot in the afternoon pool is tiny and they need more sun loungers eds restaurant is excellent the rooms are comfortable comfy beds and fully equipped bathroom is a tiny box room but powerful shower and spacious the internal rooms are noisy from the aircongenerators external rooms are noisy 3rd floor from the road inspite of double glazing the lifts need servicing only two out of four were working one got stuck with 14 people in for 1 hour and had to be rescued by the fire brigade was overloaded but that was due to people having to wait too long for a lift staff are friendly but front desk seemed confused by the system which meant the service wasnt very;3
the location is a short walk to universal which is the main reason to choose this hotel finding the parking lot was ridiculous navigation systems will take you to the universal parking lot with their address the hotel was clean walls are very thin you can hear talking and tv which is a bummer dont pay the extra money for the executive level there arent any perks the complimentary breakfast was very minimal you will have to upgrade for 10 a person overall the hotel serves its purpose;3
this side of manhattan had all the amenities that a traveler would need including a postal office within 3 blocks we visited the riverside park it was clean green peaceful and friendly people walking their dogs it was very secure too the hotel facilities need some improvement the header did not turn on and when we asked for extra blankets none were available because the housekeeper services end at 6pm we waited for transportation pick up time sitting at the stair steps because the hotel lobby or hallway had no furniture the hotel receptionist made no effort to provide a chair for my 84 years old mother;3
my sisters and i stayed at this hotel for 6 nights during our california vacation at the end of june 2005 other than the pool being closed for renovations we had no problems the location is absolutely great it was very easy to get to the major highways and theres a metro station about a minute away we were worried about the noisy nightclub that wed read about in other tripadvisor reviews of this hotel but we slept soundly and noisefree every night the buffet breakfast was waffles eggs sausage and fruit it wasnt 5star dining but it wasnt bad either this ramada was a great value for a hotel near hollywood and universal studios id stay at the ramada hollywood again;3
the positive of this hotel is the locationquick walk to central park shopping and restaurantsthe hotel could use a renovation the infrastructure is very old and dated rooms are tiny especially the bathrooms do not get the city view as the noise level is off the charts the windows are not sound proof and you hear everything on the streets starting at 6am sirens cars traffic elevators are very slow in summary for one night it is ok but would stay elsewhere if staying longer;3
booked a conference at this hotel all food was off the hook outstanding there were bugs in my room and parking was expensive service was pretty good elevators were ridiculously slow and therefore i would not stay there again as they are not sufficient to support the number of guests in the hotel plan to wait up to 10 minutes for an elevator especially if you are on an upper floor;3
we stayed for 3 days and 2 nights for a weekend to universal studios the best thing we liked about the property is the distance to universal studios itâs about a 5 minute walk to universal studios and city walk but a shuttle is offered we never used the shuttle the room was a corner room and was clean we paid extra for a city view and got a pool view instead when we asked the front desk about it we were told itâs a citypool view the irritating thing about the room was the lack of hot water for most of the stay we had along drive in and just wanted to take a hot shower the water for me only stayed lukewarm and for my husband got hotter eventually the next day we had the same issue and let the water run for about 1015 min before calling the front desk they sent up an;3
very small rooms and noisy hotel with traffic outside otherwise location was good right by penn station not far from time square staff were helpful and restaurant on the premises was also a good place to eat would perhaps stay somewhere else ne t time though;3
i was a little uncertain about staying here given the mixed reviews but overall was pleasantly surprised and i feel the hotel offers good value for the money the room 1 queen bed was small but certainly sufficient in size and not at all out of line with similar priced nyc hotels ive stayed at in the past the desk staff were cooperative and generally friendly housekeeping could be improvedthe carpet needed a good vacuming and towel restocking was erratic and as noted in other reviews the sheets dont properly fit the mattress although they were changed daily also it took at least 5 minutes for the water to get hot but once it did it was steady and plentiful there was a definite smoke smell in my nonsmoking room which seems to be a common complaint it did;3
this hotel is in a great location rooms are small but most are in ny lobby nice but after you get past that this hotel needs a lot of renovation going to the room the walls and carpet are drab and dimly lit not at all welcoming they did not have our room ready when we got there we were early but they said if they did we could get in for another 50 we took our bags to the bell hop and that cost 5 a bag no matter the type of bag it is a shame when you pay so much for a room that all of that cost even more pathetic staff was good tick tock diner was below average have been there before but food was below average and the staff were not friendly at all and borderline rude;3
we had a one night stay in a suite overlooking the empire state building the view was the best part the hotel was very very busy check in was a very lengthy process due to the extended line the staff apologised and were friendly it was gay pride weekend so there were people everywhere security was tight getting to the elevators elevators were very slow and crowded and took a long time to arrive rooms were tired and old however it is an old building and some âcharacterâ should be expected whilst accommodation is expensive in manhattan this was not good value for money we chose this hotel due to its proximity to maddison square garden and for that it was perfect;3
location is perfect such easy access to subway and trains lobby is attractive and busy paid extra for a view and got it on the 29th floor looking at the chrysler building not too much street noise except when window was cracked nice to have a room where the windows open room was very small to the point i was not sure where to open the two suitcases we had bed was definitely not a queensize at best it was a largeish double i booked a queen but did not want to move after seeing the view and the long line at check in and wasnt sure if this actually was their queen size bathroom was ok but also smalli dont use much make up or product so the small shelf was okay but if you like a large counter top you wont get one water changed from scalding hot to cold in an;3
i stayed at this hotel with my baby cousin for three nights in june and we were perfectly happy with our stay i got a really great deal on the hotel and was very pleased that the hotel offered 2 double beds rather than just 2 twin beds or one double bed after reading some of the reviews though i was a bit tentative about what we would find when we arrived however we were both very pleased with our stay we arrived at noon and even thoug check in is not until 300 our room was ready so se were able to go ahead and check in the room was a bit outdated and in need of a fresh coat of paint and some new carpet but the bathroom was newly refinished which made up for the rooms shortcomings the beds were comfortable and the linens were perfectly clean our only;3
we shared a bunker a small room the two of us barely fit in the room but we managed a room good enough to sleep in the room was a bit moist which gave a bit of an oder the location was good a lot of restaurangs nearby and the metro wasnt far away the shared bathroom was clean not a lot of noise during the night good stay over all good value for the money you get what you pay for with the location as an extra bonus;3
the staff was very friendly and helpful the room was comfortable and spacious is within walking distance of universal studios and city walk and for someone who has foot pain i made it just fine one thing i will say is that the restaurant in the hotel is way over priced the food wasnt that great especially for what they charged we ended up usually eating over at city walk;3
gisel hernandez the reception desk was extremely helpful and friendly made our stay that little bit extra special;3
we felt the hotel although oppulent was rather impersonal the receptionist rushed the check in at a rather noisy lobby and we felt we were just another number not a personal welcoming warmththe hotel has good access to the subway and central park found the beds rather firm but we prefer a slightly softer mattress we also found our room dark we had to use the torch on our phones to read the coffee machine instructions look at maps and tourist information although the rooms were cleannot noisy and well placed hotel we wouldnt return as we felt the hotel was impersonaland lacked a welcoming feeling;3
i love the location but was disappointed in the room tiny dark cheesy furniture front desk was unhelpful when i asked for help with the wifi setup i paid the daily rate for wifi but the front desk gentleman knew nothing about and didnt try to connect me with someone who did the lobby feels dated gloomy;3
this hotel is reasonably priced for new york located on the upper west side its in a goodsafe location customer service is fantastic my room was on the second floor and upon arrival i was pleased with how much space it had in addition the room had a renovated bathroom with makeup mirror great water temperature setting and ac unit there were some minor inconveniences such as a very slow elevator outdated tv and slow wifi;3
this hotel was recommended to us by virgin holidays first impressions were okay although i was worried about the area the hotel is located in i was staying here with my teenage children and had booked 2 rooms when checking in we were given rooms 5 floors apart which wasnt ideal i have seen a lot of reviews about the lifts however we didnt have a problem with this and only waited a short time if at all the ticktock diner is very good reasonably priced and so convenient our rooms located on the 21st and 26th floors were small even though they were both double double rooms and dated the walls are paper thin and we could hear the people next door singing in the shower and using the toilet overall outlook stay was satisfactory but we would not stay here;3
this review may be a bit scattered as i wrote it throughout our stay rather than retrospectively and added to it each day we arrived early and went to drop our bags off expecting to at least have a discussion about early check in even if we would have to come back a bit later to get early check in but it was not mentioned at all they took all my details and id etc so we thought we were being checked in right then but at the very end of the conversation we heard simply âcome back at 4â couldâve been more polite about it we also were told on arrival that thereâs construction so the water supply will be disrupted and low pressure for many hours of the day why would a respectable hotel not at the very least email guests before they arrive to inform them of this i would;3
i was very excited to stay at this hotel but left feeling a little disappointed our room was nice but very small and there wasnt a lot of space to store our luggage the bathroom was extremely small which made getting ready difficult the beds are very firm and even though we booked 6 months in advance we were given a room with two beds which we did not need the rooftop pool is tiny and freezing cold it was a very hot day but i could not swim as it was way too cold the lifts are frustrating they take forever the staff were friendly and we did enjoy having gossip girl cocktails in the cosy lounge but i think there are better hotels in nyc;3
the good 1 valentina great friendly personality helpful and cheerful knowledgeable and always willing to advise and assist abdul very friendly too francesco always smiling 2 the roof relaxation area great view over the city fantastic ambiance too bad december is too cold in the evenings we would certainly hang out there if it were warmer 3 clean rooms comfy beds nice toiletries 4 charming decorations 5 the staff supplied cellphones in case guests were lost very appreciated because of the confusing location the bad 1 super cramped rooms sandal room felt like being in a closet 2 very dark lights we had to use flashlights to read books in our rooms no internet signal in the rooms had to sit either in the breakfast room on in the cold;3
this is a classic old ny hotel that is great if you need to be close to madison square gardens or penn station otherwise there is not much around if you are in ny to see broadway shows youre better off at a hotel closer to the theater district;3
i spent three nights here while in la for a wedding this hotel has seen better days the rooms are tired the pool is small the public areas are very congested the best thing going for this hotel is the staff very helpful and friendly and professional the location is obviously great if you are going to universal city we didnt and not as expensive as hotels closer to downtown so that is a plus breakfast buffet is ok nothing exceptional we had lunch in the bar one day that was pretty good selfparking is 28day i thought that was a little high for so far from downtown;3
beware not all the rooms are as good as that shown as standard queen on the website we checked in to this hotel on tuesday 17th july for four nights the room we were given was very small very dark and unbearably hot there were no mini bar or coffee supplies both shown on the website photo the air conditioning seemed to be on but was not working properly we complained and were told an engineer would be sent to sort it out on our return from dinner nothing had changed so we asked what was happening and were told nothing could be done but we would be changed to a new room the following day since there were no free rooms that night we asked for a fan which came but did not make much difference and we spent a very uncomfortable and sleepless night the following;3
i have always enjoyed staying at the empire hotel this visit however was disappointing because of maintenance problems the air handling system took two visits to fix and the shower backed up while waiting we had 100 degree heat or the noise of a jet engine from the radiator black gunk bubbled out of the shower drain it was eventually fixed but another issue was cigarette smoke this was supposed to be a non smoking room but both the room and the hallway reeked of recent smoke another guest in the elevator also remarked on it we asked twice to be moved but the hotel kept insisting on trying to fix things we should have been more persistent because it certainly took the shine off our visit all that being said the hotel staff were always pleasant and they;3
the hotel is good for location and view and that is it the hot water does not work and past reviews from a month ago validate this as an ongoing issue they sent a handyman to look at the shower but the issue is the hot water heater so that was a joke the front desk said they need enough people to complain before it can be fixed which is extremely tacky the rooms are very basic and stuffy like a basement or attic smell i was embarrassed that i booked this hotel for my family;3
excellent location and good value rooms are clean street noise is high on outside rooms does not have free wifi in all rooms lincoln center is a block away and there are many restaurants and good transportation in the area;3
the hotel for the most part was clean having to pay for everything in the room could be very pricey we didnt use anything in the room because we didnt want to pay for it all be very careful on this front;3
i have booked one room on this hotel on priceline for two double bed for me and wife and kids i have driven from toronto to new york after spending almost 12 hours on the road i wanted to have a place to relax when i get to the hotel the staff she didnt even have a smile or greetings to me she start saying that if i have double bed then i have to pay extra for each night otherwise i can leave and they will charge for a night i was so upset and tired that i had to go through this with family was waiting tired and looking at me what am i doing she went to talk to her manager he was saying same thing he strictly said this has nothing to do with them and i have to pay more to have double bed if they have this kind of issues then why they even advertise in priceline;3
hotels in ny are very expensive park west hotel is not the exeption booked throught booking and everything went well staff were a little rude on the payment options apparently they havnt had a great experience with booking so they asked to pay the nights in advance and to leave an open voucher for the rest of the stay;3
