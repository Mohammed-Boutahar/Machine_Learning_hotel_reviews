We did not choose this hotel but were sent there when there was a mix up with our hotel booking service. This hotel was clean and the service was good. Staff were pleasant. The lighting and decor were part of the styling of this hotel. It is a fairly standard four star hotel in a good location. Room service menu was limited and expensive. There are however a number of restaurants nearby. You have to pay for wifi which is unfortunate but you pay for each device which gets expensive. You also pay about $3 for a cup of tea or coffee in the room. The minibar is one of the most expensive I have seen. Again there is a Starbucks and Duane Reade just a minute away so you can stock up on necessities there. The room was extremely small and the beds were very firm which would be a problem;3
It is located in the heart of Manhattan, so very easy to access everywhere.  The personnel is very helpful.  The room is not that comfortable since it is too small. The hotel is very old and should be renovated. Although the it is not allowed to smoke in the rooms, our room was smelling cigarette!;3
"This hotel is a conundrum.  It is not glamouress but for a big rude city like L.A. the staff are absolutely wonderful.  However the hotel is right off the 405 which for a Irish country girl was rather exciting but very very noisy. The hotel does provide earplugs but like Karl Pilkington I can hear my heart beat so I don't like them.  It is convenient if you are a contestant on ""Wheel of Fortune"" or ""Jeopardy"" as there were several at the bar  hoopin and hollerin like they'd won the rodeo but that's more funny than annoying.  The annoying thing is the bathrooms are so outdated.  They are worn and rather sad.  The rooms are nice and the telly is HUGE for the room.  The breakfast was absolutely FANTASTIC and the restaurant staff were wonderful.  I love Hilton most of the time and I";3
You can feel the glory of the past, but the present condition is less impressive... The rooms look old. The view from the top floors is great and the location is very central and close to everything...;3
you obviously have your reasons  for booking to stay here ...........and  the location is very good  and yes it is conveniently close to universal studios  we stayed here because it is close to my family    first the good news rooms on executive floor are spacious .............very good   view from high floors are wonderful ................very good  the bed is comfortable ......................................very good  the linens are good  the bathroom amenities are pleasing........ peter thomas roth  swim area is adequate ...............my granddaughter loved it    on to the bad news  arrival poorly recieved....they were shambolic ........ after a transatlantic flight that displeased    btw   car valet service  is slow  food offering is dull  / weak  bathroom is uninspired;3
"So I will make this as fair as I can be unlike some of the other latest dubious reviews - Driving up to the hotel you wonât see the waterfall as shown on the pictures as this is in fact at the back of the property; itâs fairly non-descript from the front with a drive up to the front lobby. Checking in was fine and the two gentlemen on the front desk were friendly, you do have to leave a small refundable deposit ($100 at the time of writing) for your stay, however I did feel uncomfortable with the hotel taking my passport and making a photocopy of it - I donât know of any hotel outside of Eastern Europe who does this practice and see no reason for doing this with guests, that aside, check-in was completed and was I was shown where the lift was. My room (classed as Starlet Queen);";3
"The hotel is pretty tired. We upgraded our room from the last time we stayed, and the room was the exact same tiny size, with a ""view"". The tub really needed refinishing. The elevators were very slow, with only a few of them working. There is no gift shop, so buying a soda after the lobby kiosk closes is not possible. The staff were mostly pleasant, but our booking was difficult to achieve, as it was a bit complex.";3
Check in was easy with very friendly and welcoming staff. They also helped with the parking - there is a secure car park at rear costs $27 a day. Our room felt small compared to other hotels we had stayed in and the decor was 'tired'. There was very little space for our suitcases and hanging space for clothes was a rail over a sideboard and the ironing board and iron were stored in the space.. The bathroom was also small. We overlooked a small courtyard which is very pleasant  - they advertised a welcome drink between 5-7 but this never materialised the two nights we stayed. The breakfast was okay - reasonable choice and the chef on duty works really really hard cooking fresh omelottes and waffles. There are several places to eat within easy walking distance - there's a Wendy's,;3
Perfect value for money in Upper West Side Manhattan (though closer to Harlem). The onle serious drawback - they failed to find my booking made through budgetplaces.com, and we spent the first night in the available room (it was of higher category though). In the morning we were transferred to the booked room, thanks a lot it was available, as a lady at the reception was not sure it would be.   Tidy linen and towels, no smell, relatively tidy bathrooms  - as good as it gets for $80 per night for a double with shared bathroom.;3
The location is awesome, across from Lincoln Center, near Central Park and Columbus Circle/Time Warner Center.  It is not that inexpensive.  Lobby is beautiful.  Elevators are pretty good, but don't take the stairs!  Our room had a view of an air shaft and trouble with temperature control.  We had to use the air conditioning when it was 40 degrees out because there was some other source of heat that made the room uncomfortable.  Housekeeping sometimes came and helped us as late as 5 pm.  That was very nice.  The shower enclosure was strange - even compared to European-style showers. There was no way to avoid getting water on the floor.  They had run out of cream and sugar and didn't supply it for the coffee for several days!  They tried to charge us for extra decaf coffee and;3
After a delayed flight arrived at The New Yorker to warm welcome at check in. Room was basic, clean but adequate, bathrooms could do with updating. Had breakfast in the Tick Tock Diner, quick and pleasant service.  Dined in Biana Trattoria one evening service was slow, meal average and bar staff more interested in her phone than serving drinks.  Disappointing when we approached information asking how best to get to baseball game. Guy on information disinterested and said that reminded him to ring his son back and promptly picked up his mobile phone and made a call leaving us stood there. We walked away thinking this was very rude. Overall we enjoyed  our stay just a few customer service issues.;3
Poor value. Overpriced. Did I say poor value and overpriced from the quality of the accommodations to the breakfast buffet to the dinner menu to bar drinks to the parking...did I miss anything? Oh, great location near Universal and City Walk.;3
Clean and quiet for sleeping. The AC could have been a bit better if the curtain did not block the air flow. The Astor on the Park had everything we needed. Very close to the subway and in an area that felt very safe.;3
GOOD POINTS * well located on a subway line, Central Park opposite.  ROOM for IMPROVEMENT * dated rooms  * no water or tea/coffee making facility in the room * no free wifi - had to purchase $10/24 hrs per device;3
This is my first visit to the big apple (New York). We selected this hotel because of its closeness to most attractions in Manhatan. The rooms rate is reasonable for downtown New York. The only concern is the parking. There is no free parking or special price for the hotel. Parking is a concern in downtown New York. The rooms are not spacious and the service is below my expectations. I would not stay there again.;3
This hotel is conveniently located on 8th Ave and 34th St close to Penn Station. The lobby is pretty impressive and the staff at the front desk was very friendly. My room has everything I needed. It was small, but I guess that's normal for New York. If you have ever tried to find a good hotel in New York for a reasonable price - this is one. However, don't look too close: the bathroom was okay, but certainly not perfectly clean.;3
"We checked in to the hotel around 10 pm to be told to wait for more than half an hour since the room was not ready. I called beforehand to let them know that we will be there around 10 pm. We were given a $60 voucher to avail during the wait, but the ""generous"" voucher does not help when my old parents were tired of travelling and just wanted to check in and get some rest. Coffee was not refilled even after asking twice for room service. There was no microwave in the room, and the room was not well lit. The safe was not working when we checked in. Ambiance in the lobby is very good. There is a 24 hour cafeteria for purchasing.";3
Booked this hotel for my 50th as it looked nice and central and had good reviews. Emailed the hotel asking for an upgrade as it was a special birthday. Travel agent done the same to increase our chances. Didnt mind paying a little extra. On arrival staff were friendly and they gave us a bottle of champagne as it was my birthday. We were disappointed in our room. Very small and clean but needed updating and looked out on to an abandoned building with graffiti and smashed windows. Spoke to some other guests who said their room was like new. They also had a tea maker which we didn't. So disappointed after trying hard to make sure we had a lovely room before arrival. Expensive for a basic room.;3
The Jane is great in many ways - it's characterful, in a great location and the staff are friendly.  The room really is tiny. Think the size of a double bed. But the hotel is very clear about it in advance and there's plenty of space for storage, so I don't think that's a negative  But the hotel does have some problems:  - The AC is very loud, very difficult to control and not very effective. In a tiny room it really makes a racket, and is behind this wooden drill so the remote doesn't really work, and you can't see what it's set to. When you leave the room, you can't leave it running, so you have to have it on when you're in there. I'm a deep sleeper but it got on my nerves badly.   - The walls and doors are thin. You hear plenty from next door.  - The bathrooms are nice and;3
I stayed at the hotel for one night, instead of five, because they wouldn't let me leave my luggage for one night. Other than that, the rooms are very nice, price is reasonable. Wifi is NOT free, no breakfast.;3
We had 2 nights stay at this hostel. At the moment we checked in the staff told me that we never had a booking with them although I showed us us booking slip. They said they did not received my deposit. I ended up with paying again deposit and 2 nights stay. The room was acceptable with double story bed and shared toilet. There is a sink in the room and every time you want to go to the toilet, you need to bring your own tissues which are provided in the room. The location is near the Hammersmith tube station.;3
The Empire Hotel is old but quirkily refurbished.  A great boutique hotel..... but......  Unfortunately there were a few 'quirks' that weren't on the positive side.  The lobby area which also holds the bar / lounge is generally kept too cold to be comfortable (we were visiting in early autumn) and the staff do not offer refreshments.  On the other hand the rooms were uncomfortably warm, the airconditioner needed to be on high when it was less than 10 degrees outside. From 8am doors in the corridor were slamming for an hour or so, beyond what seemed normal for the amount of doors there were!!!  Rooms are small, but standard for NY and the bathrooms tiny, but all manageable.  Recommend that you purchase water from Duane Reed downstairs as the overpriced minibar is a ridiculous ($7;3
Tiny bathroom, poor designed sink/faucet, lever operated faucet splashes considerably when open, not easy to control without getting clothes wet. No available parking other than valet at $71 for 1 night.;3
A bit pricey, not noisy. Bring your  own bottled water, room water  bottles are overpriced. On site Restaurant food is great! No need to pay $33 for the buffet, menu items are really good. Desk is not the best for working with laptop so... don't expect to get much done there....;3
Only great thing I can say about this hotel is that itâs in a very convenient location! I was able to walk to and from everywhere. The trains are also very close by! The hotel itself is ran down. Itâs very tiny. Do not expect great customer service. This would be a perfect hotel is they did some upgrades to the hotel and worked on their employees customer service skills! Itâs lacking a lot !! The bed isnât that comfortable neither !!! I was actually pretty disappointed in my hotel but you get what you pay for !!!;3
We had big reservations about this hotel because of the poor reviews and Trailfinders contacted them before we arrived.   Doormen are very scruffy but friendly.   Told our room wasn't ready but they would expedite the cleaning and to come back which we did 5 hours later only to be told still not ready.   Eventually they said it was ready but they had to check it over - by this time nearly 7pm.   We had no kettle, cups and saucers or glasses in the room.   We were supposed to drink the complimentary wine from cardboard cups!.   This took no less than 4 visits to reception to rectify - they said they had a no china/glass policy in the rooms.   This is supposed to be a 4* hotel.   Took even more visits to reception to get teaspoons and then they bought a dessertspoon and a soup;3
The Astor on the Park was directly across from Central Park and 3 blocks from the Subway.  The rooms were small but they were cleaned each day and were quite acceptable.  It's a no-frills hotel and so you don't get coffee making facilities, refrigerator, or a safe but you do get a TV and a decent bathroom.  We stayed in several rooms due to our travelling and the beds do vary quite a bit.  Some were acceptable, one squeeked terribly, and one was so hard you could have been sleeping on the floor.  There's one lift in a busy hotel so get used to using the stairs and if possible ask for a room at the back away from the street as it can get noisy but it is New York and you get used to the sirens and the constant horn blowing.   The staff were very friendly and if you're not happy;3
My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights from 25-29 October. Hotel itself is fine, the room was great if not a little dark. We had an alcove room on the 17th floor with a view of the freeway. Nice and close to CityWalk and Universal of course and if you're feeling lazy there's a free shuttle to use as well. Otherwise if you don't have a car, it can get expensive catching cabs.  Check-in was fine, bell staff, porters and doormen all fantastic, as were the servers and housekeeping staff. Definitely felt well looked after. Had room service a couple of times, food is really good, very generous portions, could never get through it all!  The concierge staff were mostly good but we felt we were taken advantage of by one - when asking where we could go outlet shopping it was suggested;3
I have been here many times, however, during my most recent visit I had some problems. First I was not able to select my usual alcove room via the Hilton.com web site. There seemed to be a problem with the Hilton.com web site, since I was unable to check-into three different Hilton hotels last week.   When I physically checked in at the hotel an alcove room was not available. Also Hilton no longer arranged the usual fruit basket for their gold members, which I previously enjoyed. Also they no longer gave me a bar appetizer coupon as they have done in the past. I need to reconsinder my next visit, The nearby Sheraton may be my next best choice.;3
Little gutted there was no tea coffee in room.  But facilities were   downstairs  . perfect place right in centre.  Unfortunately there were no views out window ,just bricks.  Staff were lovely and helpful.  The hotel was dated. But wouldn't stay here again .;3
We (2 friends and I) stayed at the Empire Hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of February 2011.    When we checked in our room (a superior double) was not ready (laundry service problem) so we were upgraded to room #715 which is the largest room at the end of the hall.  It was still on the small side as far as hotel rooms go but it did have a sitting area w/ a couch and a small walk-in closet, and the view was awesome.    When we got to the room we just wanted to quickly clean-up and go eat.  We noticed there were no washcloths or hand towels so we called housekeeping.  It took 25 minutes for them to bring up what we needed...not happy.   After spending our first night there we noticed our internet connection was not good in this room due to it being at the end of the hall,;3
Stayed at the Hilton - check - in was at 4:00 and we got there at 2:30 because we were afraid of the traffic.  We are HHilton members and they told us check in is not till 4:00 and to come back.  We went to Universal Citywalk and came back at 4:30 and the room was ready.  My husband needed the luggage rack and was told he was not allowed to have it in self parking - the valet guy had to take the luggage rack down with my husband to the parking area and get the bags and then take them to our room. So the first tip in the wallet was given.  Then my daughter has allergies and wanted a snack.  I realized there are no microwaves in the room.  I took the popcorn to the front desk and asked where or who could pop the bag. The front desk said nobody can but for $20 you can rent the;3
Used to stay here all the time for work.  Havenât been here in years and have to say, this place needs a makeover big time.  Carpets are fraying, was no shower door in our room, ring the front desk during normal hours and sometimes no one picks up at all, no room service accessible, and it generally just needs to be re done.  The good news?  Itâs reasoanbly cheap and the location is obviously very good being close to the park and Lincoln Center.;3
It was exactly what I needed a place to lay my head get a shower ( Dont forget shower shoes). It was good and convienant to all the places I needed to be. On,a real quaint and quiet street for Manhattan;3
I went to this hotel in this last summer for 4 days. I expected a bigger room but it was OK. I stayed with 5 people in the same room, but I think it was enough for us. It is a pretty good hotel considering that is in New York, it is near to the subway station and there are plenty of grocery stores in the neighborhood. I highly recommend this hotel if you want something ship and fine. I did read some comments about the noise but it was't s very quite but also not strong enough to did't let you sleep. By the way, it has wi fi and it works fine.;3
Days Inn on 94th is a basic hotel with decent enough facilities. Staff are competent without being over friendly. Given the location it is decent value but if you are looking for comfort and luxury then this isn't the place. That said, it is perfectly good as a place to lay your head before getting out into NYC.;3
Its a great place to stay. But they do not have proper water, tea, coffee availability in the room.;3
I had a good experience with This hotel. We stayed 3 nights in a triple bedroom. It was clean. The employees are very nice and helpful. The location is good, very close to the metro and In a multicultural neighbourhood with easy access to Laguardia airport by M60 bus. But don't expect anything fancy. It is an old building with shared bathrooms and Internet is not working in the room. You have to go in the lobby or basement.;3
I stayed there for the second time, and just came home. The room is so small, especially the bathroom. There was a major construction going right outside, that the blaring noise of a jackhammer woke me up at 7:20 (This is not something this hotel could do about this). They didn't provide me a washcloth until the 3rd day. The pool was closed (again). The door of the next room (530 or 528) kept making a squeaking noise which was annoying. The water temperature for the shower was lukewarm in the morning although it was hot enough at night.  But, the location is the best, especially for someone like me who loves upper west side and east, away from the tourists. And the towels are decent. The staff is courteous. Price is right.   So, I know I will go back there after all.;3
Great location even if not going to Universal,but  pretty average accomodations. Had some issues when checking in due to a split reservation (points + $$) which took the front desk staff quite some time to figure out how to put us in the same room during the whole stay, so kudos to the lady who took care of it. Staying over the Xmas weekend probably explains some delays in service during breakfast. To my surprise Diamond members cannot get a full american menu but just a restricted series of items (e.g. bacon and eggs had to ordered as extras at $10 each!!!). Probably won't be coming back and opt out for other hotel/brand;3
Just make sure you are aware. We had a great stay but when we returned home we noticed a nice chunk out of our bank account. Having already paid for our hotel room through lastminute.com we were shocked.  We immediately phoned the jane to be brushed off by the receptionists saying it was the 50$ deposit we had paid. Â£330 doesn't = 50$. So we persisted and then spoke to someone else, who inmformed us it was 50$ deposit a day (News to us!) we were then told this money would be transferred back into our accounts after 10 days... 10 DAYS.  As irritating as it is calling the states to find this out we decided to wait it out....  10 days passed so I phoned them again. This time I again explained the situation to be told once again by a receptionist that it should be in my account, I;3
This was a nice hotel, needs some renovations and I saw them working on painting.  The staff was okay.  The breakfast was okay, nothing really exciting in the area.  I would not be walking down the street at any time and there are not any restaurants nearby.  The $22 per day parking is ridiculous that is for sure!!!  I did get a good price from Hotel.com, that was the best thing about the hotel.  I hate writing an average review but that is what this hotel is, average.;3
Had a fine stay at the Hyatt. Very convenient to the airport - shuttle was easy to get and it really is close by. Room was large and clean, bed was comfy, temperature control worked well. Restaurant was a good place for my business meetings in the evening. Big downer was the $35 breakfast buffet - was disappointed to pay that much for some eggs and OJ. Also they seem to have a 'no takeout' policy for breakfast so I had to scarf down my food to get out for my meeting in time.;3
We were four friends staying in a room on 10th floor. Rooms were very comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Overall stay was good but somehow Wi-Fi dint work in our room. When asked they said it will be fixed. We stayed there 2 nights 3 days but condition was same.;3
I'd like to give this Hotel a. 3.5 really.  You can't beat he location and it has genuine historical charm, which I love. The rooms are small, but nicely decorated, and clean.  It has a European feel. But several inconveniences detracted from our stay. The in-room AC was super loud and difficult to moderate. The AC was non existent in the hallway and elevators. In 90 degree heat and high humidity, that's a problem. To make matters worse, the elevators were slow, at least the ones that worked, and crowded.  We attended a wedding at the roof top restaurant, the ceramic floor tiles in the lounge and dance floor were loose and uneven making walking in heals and dancing a bit risky.  Overall, I enjoyed our stay and the price was reasonable for Central Park West accommodations!;3
Stayed here for 3 nights in july 2013 . We decided to treat ourself to an executive room during our stay and got room 2054 on executive floor 20. After our stay I can say that staying in an executive room added NO extra value to us. I am already an Hilton honors Gold member and the continental breakfast that was included in the room was of no value since I would have gotten that anyway. There are NO executive lounge on this hotel. So you sit in the general breakfast area and what worse is, is that you are treated like an idiot, I was 3 feet away from the bagels but since I had only continental breakfast  I was NOT allowed to stand up and go and get the bagel myself, A server had to do it for me !!!!  Another bad thing is that I had to wait for my room to be ready for 1,5 hours;3
My family stayed there while I was in the hospital for a few days.  The service staff were terrible! The rooms were overpriced, and mediocre. The neighborhood is edgy, and it's name does not do it justice. Not recommended;3
I have to be honest -- it was my first trip to NYC.  I had a seminar about 13 blocks away and then an event at the Lincoln Center and wanted something close to Central Park.  The location was great for me -- just what I wanted.  I didn't want to be trapped too close to Times Square or anything, and I don't mind a lot of walking to get to places.  Given that, the hotel was recommended by an associate who loves this place.  I'm in my early 30s, and I was hoping for a place where I can go see a show and then head back for some cocktails - except the lounges closed quite early (I thought NYC would be a late night town -- you know, 2-4am?).  Not the case here.  Also, the bathroom was very small.  Not that I expect a huge place, but I hate the shallow sinks that no matter what you do,;3
When we traveled here everything was great. But our fridge didnât work and our kids milk turned causing her to get sick. It took 30 mins for new sheets during the night. It was tough because we had kids trying to sleep and had to wait. We wanted to heat some food for our youngest but it was $20.00 to use the microwave. Seems like an excessive chargeâ¦;3
Great location. Tired rooms that need major updates to be clean. Old carpet, old decor, sagging mattresses. This was probably a gem in its heyday that is now in need of complete redecorating and overhaul of hvac etc.;3
We stayed here for 4 days and i must say the best part about this hotel is the staff. They were extremely accommodating, welcoming and helpful during our entire stay. The hotel is located right across from Central Park which is a big plus and looks soo cute from the outside.  However the inside is another story.   There really isn't much of a lobby but there is more sitting space downstairs in the basement area where the computers are located (however there is NO free wi-fi). The hotel is very small with a very petit apartment type feel. There is only one elevator which can fit at the most 2-3 ppl and can be veryy slow!!.  The rooms... Extremely small and fits literally just the 2 beds, and has barely any walking room. I think our heater was leaking because the floor was wet on;3
I was dubious of the Astor Hotel after reading reviews however it really isn't that bad...well our room wasn't. Amazing views of park and Manhattan with balcony. We were made to feel 'lucky' we had a big room (double and a bunk) very decent size, bathroom very clean, beds and clean towells changed daily.However on checking in they didn't have our reservation (possibly tour operator's fault?). It was sorted within 1/2 an hour though.  The staff were fairly friendly (conceirge maybe a bit too pushy with tyring to sell us trips etc?!)and helped with luggage etc, even when the lift broke-brings me on to my next bugbear - the noise...I've never heard such a noisy lift (there's only 1 slow, tempremental lift) and doors on each corridor bang all night long.Bear in mind that young;3
"I have stayed here twice in the past 5 years.  As above, those are the two reasons to stay at this hotel. The lobby and the rooftop bar area are super and great places to meet up with friends and hang out for drinks. The location, directly across from Lincoln Center, can't be beat. The service was good. BUT...if you are expecting a welcoming, bright room (forget spacious, that's not happening), set your expectations accordingly. The lowest price category has super tiny rooms.  One price level up, is OK (no views).  Mattress was firm/good; linens just OK.  The quality of the room/bathroom renovation is poor and evidence of the old bones of the hotel is everywhere (and not in a good way), if you look--whether it is the peeling paint on the doors or the dingy back hallways and";3
If you are going to NYC with the intentions of never being in your room, then this is the place for you. The location is fabulous. 2 steps from Lincoln Center, and also a subway stop, 2 minutes to Central Park and a 10 minute walk to Time Square. This hotel is very conveniently located. Of course, in NYC, everything is about location. The hotel lobby is great, the bar/lobby is fantastic and the rooftop bar and pool are amazing! The views are awesome and the drinks are great. The rooms are a bit of a disappointment. Make sure you know which room you are booking ahead of time. The firstroom we were given was the size of a closet. You can not walk in to the room with your luggage in your hand at the same time because there is no room for both you and the luggage. There is no room;3
My friend and I stayed here for 5 days from 27th November, booked the hotel through booking.com who advised the hotel wouldn't ask for payment until we checked out, we arrived & immediately we were hounded by the receptionist to purchase an upgraded room, as we'd booked a smoking room & requested twin beds we weren't interested, the receptionist asked for full payment, we paid it & got a receipt. The receipt stated the amount that was taken from my card which was the price I'd agreed with booking.com (for the room cost) & I signed to say I accepted that amount, a couple of days later I checked my on-line banking & realised that not only the room cost had been taken out but also another 151$ for tax, I was furious as when I popped my pin # in, the OMG amount that came up on the;3
Pricey. Views into other people's rooms. Small rooms. Cramped bathrooms. If you like a college room experience with the added extras of listening to your neighbours conversations, TVs, dogs (!?!) and awkward bed noises, you might like this place. However decent spot, next to Central Park and subway isn't too far away.;3
I would have graded this very good if the location and staff were nicer.  We stayed 4 nights on arrival i felt staff were a bit off and given we had just come from a super friendly hotel in san francisco. Our room was clean and looked onto the nice little courtyard. Wifi was a little so so didnt bother me but my son got grumpy about it Pool area lovely you arent even aware you arent in a particularly nice area.  Breakfast is really good loads of choice eggs and waffles cooked to order. The only thing is the breakfast staff are so utterly miserable. Especially when you smile and use your manners and you get grunts.  Area isnt nice but actually most of LA  is dirty and full of poor homeless people. There is a nice italian on the corner plus a little supermarket. We used uber to;3
Very noisy. Front desk staff not overly informative. Due to noise terrible for sleeping. (Outside noise). Very clean, but extremely small. Beds were comfortable but on low floor and all we heard was hooting and hollering throughout the night.;3
Overall, an average stay in the hotel.  The location is great if you need to catch a train from Penn Station.  The room was a typical NYC hotel room, smallish, but ok for two people.  The only issue we had was that the bed was very uncomfortable.  There was a significant dip in the middle of the of bed, we didn't bother complaining because we were only going to be there one night. It did make for an uncomfortable sleeping night.  Additionally, the bed felt on the small side for a queen size bed, I would have thought it to be a double sized bed.  Other than that the service was fine. The hotel did have free wifi, which I had no problem connecting to, however my husband was never able to log on even after speaking with someone at the front desk.;3
"Things I liked the most: Easy to access the interstate**, front desk was friendly, within walking distance to universal, always something going on, pretty views of the hills, beds were comfy and bathroom was roomy, also the walls weren't paperthin like some hotels  Things I didn't like: Maid service, down pillows (it was hard to get replacements-i'm allergic), parking was ridiculous, layout was confusing, air conditioner was either really hot or cold and never at the temp it said it was, definitely for families with kids, it was expensive for what you got (but what isn't in LA)  The only problems we ran into was that the maid would change our towels everyday even if we hung back up (we were trying to be ecofriendly since there was a drought going on); they kept replacing the one";3
When I first checked in the receptionist just dumped the key on the desk & said the number - not very pleasant at all! Ended up in a room of 4 beds by myself when I had booked a single room & was ensured I wouldn't get anyone else in the room, which luckily I didn't. The room was basic, single bunk beds that remind me of being a child, a small table, wardrobe & fridge (which was a pretty good thing to have). However, on hotels.com my reservation said in the room there would be a shower (although shared toilet) but in fact everything was shared and they do not offer rooms with a shower & shared toilet so don't be swayed by that!   The hostels location is great, 5 min walk from Hammersmith tube (zone 2) but unless you are looking for a cheap budget place to stay for a night or 2 I;3
"This place is always packed because it's generally one of the cheapest ""name brand"" hotels in Midtown and is close to Times Square, MSG and Penn Station.  Be advised, it isn't the terrific value it appears to be.  The affordable rooms here are TINY.  If you are staying as a couple, one of you will literally need to stay in bed while the other moves around.   The hotel has a nice lobby that borders on ornate, which is deceiving.  Inside the hallways and rooms have frayed carpet, banged up walls and chipped porcelain in the bathroom.  Speaking of the bathrooms, the rooms I've been in still use fixtures that must be 50 years old, and show it.  Many people come to New York for the first time and stay here thinking this is what you get if your budget is less than $300/night.  Trust";3
Our room was directly next to the elevators--which we heard day and night. Others talked of hearing the sirens of emergency vehicles day and night. On 20th floor and above as well as lower.;3
This is a 3 star hotel directly across from the Lincoln Center and 3 blocks from Columbus Circle.  15 min walk to Times Square, 1 block to Central Park.  Surrounded by good restaurants.  The staff is great, professional and friendly.  The decor of the hotel can be described in a lot of ways - eclectic, odd, bizarre, ugly?  Rooms are NYC small, although comparable to the competition.  It's not great value for money, but not bad either.  You just have to get your head around that in NYC $200 doesn't get you the same as in a lot of other places.  Some details of the finish were shoddy - the bathroom door had been repaired with drywall mud or wood putty and not sanded, as had a large section in the main room.  Not terrible, just not quite the quality of details I would expect.;3
This hotel was very accommodating with late check in. The room was nice and comfortable. Although the ensuite showed signs of wear and tear, everything worked - no maintenance was required. I was given a choice of which room I wanted  and that was a nice surprise I hadn't expected. The complimentary internet service was good when it worked. The system kept dropping out and when I called the IT Support it was found the server kept putting my laptop into the spam filter and dropping me off. When it worked it was reasonable fast. The complimentary breakfast buffet was somewhat disappointing. There was not a large range of items to choose from and there was never any bacon on offer which I would consider a breakfast standard item. The food was cooked well. I was hoping to get dinner;3
Could hear a pin drop in the hallways. Heard everyone walking by at night, people talking 6 doors down and the damn maid service would even be loud yelling back and forth in the mornings. Only good thing was the breakfast.;3
Iâm partially disabled, so I called the hotel prior to flight to ensure shuttle was running from airport. It was, but the driver blew right past the labeled stop in the left lane - grr. I attended a conference whose experience was marred by the major HVAC failure that left some meeting rooms at 91 degrees all afternoon - really hard to concentrate in a saunaSome hotel room lights didnât work - no soft reading light. It was there but no switch to light it up;3
Iâd stay here again, but only from Sun-Thu in the fall or spring, i.e. when the nightclub is closed and thereâs no need for climate control. The A/C was incredibly loud, ineffective, and impossible to turn off without shutting off power entirely. I imagine winter heating is similar. In all other circumstances Iâm going to pay a bit more for my old standby in Midtown East.  Pros - Good check-in experience: I arrived in the morning and dropped off my bag, went to a diner recommended by the front desk, then came back a few hours later to see if there was a room available. My room wasnât ready yet, but Monique at the front desk gave me a free upgrade to a captainâs cabin. - Charming and comfortable room: slightly hard mattress, fantastic pillows, butter-soft sheets - Fast wifi in;3
We were looking forward to the Empire hotel because of the pool. Once we checked in we were informed that it was closed. Rooftop bar was open only to guests of a private party. Ok location. Ok room size.;3
We stayed 3 nights here, the rooms weren't the cleanest and could do with a damn good refit, but we weren't expecting much for the price. If you pay so little, you don't expect to get 5*, especially in a city like New York. The shared bathrooms were clean, we had no problems, and our room had a little sink in it which was handy. It had a fan on the ceiling, we were there in the midst of Summer and it was really hot, the fan seemed to just move the hot around, but it was better than nothing. As long as you're not expecting a first class hotel, you'll find this suits your needs, otherwise you'll need to splash out more.;3
Location was absolutely superb. Literally overlooks Central Park and surrounding area is nice. The hotel itself was dated though and the room I had was small for a double. Did not pay so cannot comment on value but if you can get a good deal and don't mind being in a hotel that needs a refurb then you could do worse.;3
My husband and I were arriving late and only staying one night so we figured the bunk rooms would be fine, plus we stay in private rooms in hostels a lot when in Europe. They were impossibly small, smaller than I expected. The problem is not just that they are small, but they could've done a better job with using the space. There was a tiny shelf above the door which was about 8 inches deep. The shelves could have been bigger to store luggage, because if you travel with more than a purse, you have to put the luggage on the floor. There were hooks along the mirror to hang things though. There were TV in each bunk, for the top bunk, that space could've been used for luggage. If you have back problems to do not take the top bunk b/c the mattress is thin and you can feel the boards.;3
We stayed in 2 rooms for two nights whilst visiting Universal Studios.  The valet parking is smooth but the head doorman who unloaded the car only pushed the trolley through the door before he had his hand out for a tip.  Only later did i ralsie I would alos have to tip the bellman who took the trolly to our room.  Check in was good and the rooms we had were spacious although you had to stand against the coerner fo the window for the view of the park we had been promised.  The room was clean and comfortable - the charge for wifi is annoying - the cookies left in the room each evening were a nice touch.  At check in a big deal was made of the remodled pool area - what a let down!!  We stayed here 6 years ago and the pool area looked exaclty the same apart form being less well;3
When we arrived, the front desk person told me that my reservation was cancelled and that they where full, so they couldnât give us a room. After arguing and making a few calls (the booking agent) the same person told me that she can give me a room but the price was 30% higher... I took it, it was Friday and I had no place to go. On Sunday when We checked out, a guy named Kevin was in charge of us, when he heard what has happened, he made a decision that helped us a lot, he gave us a discount on the rate to match the price that we originally had. Thatâs caring for a client! If Iâll ever go back, for sure Iâll consider to stay with them, but just for people like Kevin.;3
We arrived early at the hotel and was greeted by Afora who was very nice and informed me that our room had been upgraded which was very much appreciated. I was then told it would be 5 dollars per bag to leave them until check in or I could check in early for an additional $50 which was nearly as cheap which I did. The room 3509 was a good size, had views of the Hudson river, Maddison square garden and was spotlessly clean and cleaned everyday although like the rest of the hotel was a bit tired and could do with some TLC. We had booked for 4 nights b&b and was given vouchers for a continental breakfast in the Ticktock diner. After ordering our breakfast it was brought to our table by the waiter who barely even spoke to us. We tried again the following morning and this time after;3
"My wife and I have stayed at least six times, strictly because of location. Nearly every time itâs been on a pre-booked deal - so perhaps weâre getting the worst rooms by design. But after a half dozen stays Iâm ready to conclude that every room is mediocre. The temperature is never right, often too hot; the in-wall heating/cooling units are loud. The carpeting has a slightly tacky feel. The bathrooms are cramped. The decor is dated. On the upside, the front desk and bellmen are pleasant, the rooms are always made up, the beds are crisp and comfortable enough. And we clearly appreciate the prices! We use the Empire strictly for sleeping, and thatâs enough.";3
Room was small for a King bed. Only window with light was in bathroom. 1 window in bedroom held air conditioner. The other was covered with window shade. Two side chairs were good. No drawer space for clothes. I paid an extra $25 to be on 13th floor, but fail to see what extra value I received. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Lobby is attractive. Vending machine for snacks would be nice.;3
I'm from suburbia where the hotels are expansive and paying tourists are hard to come by. So I got in the room and was a little shocked at the size. But it was immaculately clean, had a view to a courtyard where you could see some ritzy folks' pool and you could spy on superheros smoking cigarettes. I did run into a guy on the way to the restroom without pants, but he was clean and nice despite his lack of attire and looked more terrified than I was at our meeting. Bathrooms were sterile but smelled unpleasantly like bleach, but better bleach than something a little more organic. I got scalded by the hot water twice, then learned to take shorter showers. Mornings I awoke to a string serenade - my neighbor apparently practiced the violin 7 hours a day. At least he was in tune so;3
This place is really close to Universal, we booked it so we could just walk over each day, We had a rental car too and the self parking was super easy to use.  The rooms are dated, but still pretty clean and nice.  The pool is big, but there are not enough chairs, the pool service was quick though.  The breakfast and dinner restaurants on site were nice too.;3
We were looking for an affordable place to stay in NY for a week over Christmas. The price was under $100 a night and we couldn't find anything comparable with a private bathroom so we booked it. I was nervous about staying here after the # of negative reviews but we decided to take our chances. The guys at the front desk were very friendly but we were not rude to them about any of our problems/questions. Ex. the pipes rattle at night, they explained that it's an old hotel and that's just how the pipes were built, but have plans to update these things. The carpets need to be replaced but I brought house shoes so it wasn't a problem. We thought this was a great location for never experiencing the subway before. Easily take the Red line down to Times Square and change over to any;3
The Hotel is in a good location and on the whole the staff were friendly. We were slightly disappointed with the room which was a lot smaller than anticipated and a little tired and for the price did not feel like value for money. The lack of tea/coffee making facilities was also a negative.  The bathroom also felt like it needed an update.;3
The rooms are small but clean and comfortably adequate. No frills but none were expected. We got what we paid for by way of great location and a New York experience with great cafes and small grocery stores where we stocked up on fresh fruit and water to take with us on our sightseeing trips downtown.;3
Never been to a hotel without coffee pot or coffee.   I have now.   Housekeeping doesn't keep coffee on the cart.    Have to call front desk for coffee daily. And ask for coffee pot.   All vents need cleaning badly.   Location is great for site seeing.  The hotel does need upgrading with decor.  The door men were helpful.  The front desk people answered our questions but had no personality.   I would probably stay again but would try to get reservations somewhere else.;3
Small room. Difficulty with coffee machine. Disturbed often by housekeeping when I slept late one morning. Front desk unfriendly with laundry and airport shuttle. Great location though, just off Lincoln Centre;3
We arrived at 13.30.  They said we would have to wait until 3pm (check-in time) as they had no idea whether any rooms were already available.  Their computer systems were down and had been for 2 days so everything had to be done manually.  We waited and then tried to check in.  What a fiasco.  The line got longer and longer as it was taking so long to check everyone in.  We finally got a room.  It was under construction when we got to it so we had to request another.  Evans (thank you!) was very helpful.  We got another room - but when we opened the door discovered it was already occupied!  So, back to reception.  Unfortunately Evans was now off shift.  We asked for a manager - I think 4 times and over 15 minutes (he never came).  Eventually we were allocated to a suite and all;3
the hotel could use a room facelift as once you leave the beautiful lobby area and walk down the corridors to your room you feel like it has not been redone in a long time. I almost wish hotels would get rid of carpets all together. I wish they had windows that at least opened a little bit as I like fresh air. Having to have recycled air all night was a problem for me.  They do have a good housekeeping staff that keeps it very clean. The hotel employees are all super nice.  The pool area was disappointing as was the hot tub that looked like the water was not clean. They allow smoking around the pool so I kept having to change my seat so I wasn't breathing smoke. Since it is near Universal expect allot of kids around the pool. It did't bother me as I like kids. There is a;3
I have found writing this few extremely difficult as the location of the hotel and the price were both absolutely amazing.  We stayed for seven nights and the room was large and comfortable. The restaurant was good for both breakfast and dinner and most of the staff were extremely friendly. To be honest, if it wasnât for the point Iâm going to make next, I would have given this hotel five stars. We decided to go with housekeeping each day as we were staying for a full week.  This worked really well for the first four or five days but unfortunately one of the days when we returned at about 6 pm our door had been left on the latch so it did not shut properly. This meant that our hotel room had been open to anybody passing by for the whole day. This is a serious security breach. I;3
After swearing the place off for a few years, I decided to give it another try.  The service was much better. The rooms are small, but if you just need a convenient and comfortable place for a couple days it's fine.   I had booked the hotel through a travel site and paid in advance - I like to have the room charges and taxes out of the way before any of my trips. I arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or I could pay a $50 fee and they'd put me in a room early.  I've not seen hat option in a long time. I decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as I had places to go and things to do.   The morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door. I expected the $50 plus tax for the early check in I did not expect an additional;3
Ok had no clue here and the hotel is not willing to do anything about this ridiculous cost. My truck was slightly taller than the allotted height for parking so it has to be valet parked for 44 dollars a day and the gal at the front desk said there is nothing they can do, I really find this to be appaling and had no clue my truck would not fit, it fits in all other parking garages. C'mon Hilton really, were even honor members.. It's the little things that matter here do be such penny pinchers..;3
Extremely helpful staff and although the hotel looks inviting from the outside and lobby,the rooms are in need of renovation. The bed was hard and old and I could not sleep because of this. The bathroom was OK and there are .. plenty of clean towels There is no breakfast available. I found the man on reception very helpful.;3
I stayed at the hotel last week, everything was fine, until when I hired the car I went to the front desk to ask about the amounts to park (15/11 - 17:15), the receptionist told me at 26 dollars, I said I had seen 18 dollars a day (my agency mistake), it was then that the same was very uneducated with me, very rude, so I asked his name, he said it was 'Ali', So thanks to this man I never stay in the hotel again, I have trip to Los Angeles again in a few months and I'm going to look for another hotel, same for my friends. thank you.;3
We had a one night stay in a suite overlooking The Empire State Building.  The view was the best part! The hotel was very very busy, check in was a very lengthy process due to the extended line. The staff apologised and were friendly. It was Gay Pride weekend so there were people everywhere. Security was tight getting to the elevators. Elevators were very slow and crowded and took a long time to arrive. Rooms were tired and old. However, it is an old building and some âcharacterâ should be expected.  Whilst accommodation is expensive in Manhattan, this was not good value for money. We chose this hotel due to its proximity to Maddison Square Garden and for that it was perfect.;3
A comfortable old building in an easy access to all New York. Using the lifts was sometimes a long wait. Credit card was photo copied which isn't normal practice, but I was told if I didn't let them I couldn't stay. Soon after I had to cancel my credit card as it was compromised  but I'm not saying it was because of this. In all a very pleasant stay.;3
Rooms are small, barely any phone service in my room, and view of another person room. Maybe my cell service wasn't working because I had an inside room. Bathrooms are cute, bed was comfy, room was clean, great location, nice wine selection, etc. This place doesn't blow me away, but I do like the Empire. Rooftop is always a good time. Loccatane beauty products in the bathroom are a nice touch. Walls must be made out of steel or maybe no one was staying on my floor because it was super quit which I appreciated. As a single girl traveling this place is perfect. I don't know if the Empire is good for a family trip. I'll be back to stay here during Fashion Week.;3
Positives: My daughter and I shared a private room with two twin beds and private bathroom with shower. Room was clean. Beds reasonably comfortable. Location in Hammersmith was excellent. Walk to many shops, Kings Court mall, pubs, places to eat. Tube station less than 5 minutes walk. Price was best we could find.  Negatives: Staff is downright surly and rude - be prepared not to be given any information about how to find your room or hostel amenities and you may even get yelled at (we were!). Also room is very noisy (doors are constructed in such a way that each time they are opened or closed it sounds like slamming doors) - this happened throughout the night - made it really hard to get any sleep. Also housekeeping vacuums at 8 am in hallway right outside your door. No free;3
The rooms are fine, if a little boxy and nicely designed. TV reception is a bit terrible.  However, the hotel is just a bunch of rooms. And nothing else. But try telling that to the hotel staff - they seem to expect a tip for trying to help you.;3
We stayed at the Empire for 3 nights in June, as a group of 4 girls we had requested 2x queen rooms next to each other. Upon arrival we were told that the only rooms available were on the smoking floor. As non smokers we weren't particularly happy with this but we reached a solution whereby we would be in smaller rooms (not on the smoking floor) for the first night and the following night we could move to larger rooms, a category above what we had booked.  The concierge had warned us the rooms on the first night would be small - we initially struggled to find them as they looked like cupboard doors rather than rooms! There wasn't much space at all in these rooms - trying to get in and out of the bathroom was quite a test of agility. The showers only had a half screen, there was;3
Just back from a great visit to NYC. Nice hotel, great location between Times Square and Central Park on Broadway. Really nice friendly staff especially Said and Julian. One downside is, if like me you aren't the type to be up and out at 7am is that housekeeping knock on your door really early, was fine with the do not disturb but then generally they didn't bother with your room. Beds are extremely comfortable and shower amazing.   Now the disappointment. After returning home I noticed the hotel had taken Â£190 from my account- there was no reason to do so as if only had a $4 box of snacks from the room. Tried contacting the hotel via Facebook and email just to be totally ignored. 4 days later and still no answer or refund. This was going to be the place I stay on my frequent New;3
Hotel stay was 2 nights - mid-price range with a coupon code. Hotel lobby, floors and room were clean. Attended an event in ballroom which had a weird 2 floor climb to reach a rest room.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Cons were: 1. Room was tiny including bathroom - small length tub and narrow/shallow sink. Space around bed was no more than 20-26 inches for movement.  2. The elevators are SLOW - wait times of 10+ minutes easily .;3
I especially liked the location of the Empire Hotel.  It was close to everything: restaurants, shows, Lincoln Center, Central Park and many other places you just got to see.  The staff was very helpful especially Daniel wh helped me with my bags and cab needs.  The rooms though and the shower area is small.  You won't get a free breakfast here but there's a good Strabuck's around the corner.;3
I recently stay 6 night in this hotel with group of my friends. I really like the location, The mail staff are rude, If you ask something with him he replied 'I do not know' the female staff are ok and polite. The internet do not work in this hotel, this is the poor internet service I found in my 21 days in USA.  The towel which they provide us every days is really old one and was damaged on the corner and some time whole in the middle, this is funny.  I arranged the taxi to JFK airport from the hotel gave us good price but taxi driver says we have to pay the highway tax which is 8 USD Extra on the way, Luckily I had some cash.;3
Great location for walk to Theatre Land if you are fully mobile. Clean and comfortable room. But bed and pillows very hard so didn't sleep well.  Breakfast areas were clean and good choice of hot and cold options. But chilled fruit / berries etc were still frozen. Good to have non diary milks available though.;3
Good points: The hotel looks onto Central Park and is located in a safe neighborhood with plenty of nearby amenities and transport links. My room was clean and reasonably well decorated and equipped. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent deli one minute away.  Not so good points: Public areas of the hotel are on the shabby side. Rooms are small, have no stand to put a suitcase on and no desk or chair. Hefty fee for internet acces.  Bad point: The noisiest heating system I have ever encountered. I thought it was about to explode during the night!  Conclusion: OK for a short stay, but only if you need to be in this part of town and can get a good rate;3
We stayed here nearing the end of a 3 week vacation in the US. We found the hotel to be good value for the rate we paid, although the general maintenance and upkeep of the property could do with improving - very dated & tired.  Free wi-fi and free breakfast always a winner! Handily located just up the street to the Metro - just a few stops to downtown Hollywood.  We went downstairs to the bar on one evening, the atmosphere is awful and the bartender seemed too busy playing an instrument next door to care about serving us. He acknowledged we were coming in, said hi and then disappeared for over 10 minutes to play his instrument. Avoid the bar area.  All in all, we were satisified with the hotel, we were able to quickly access Universal Studio and Hollywood Downtown on the Metro;3
"I picked the Empire because of its great location to Lincoln Center -right across the street. I was going to the Opera and I wanted something very close and available, especially if the weather turned bad. I've stayed here before but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed in my stay this time. Let me say that the staff and workers at the hotel are very nice and the room was not too bad but I just thought that many of the ""extra cost"" were unrealistic. Valet parking at 70.00!  I parked myself on the next street for 56.00 a night!  They have a Kureig machine in the room but the cost is 3.00 for EACH cup of coffee!!!!  There are bottles of water left out in the room, ordinary size, at 7.50 EACH!!!!  While the location was good and the room fine I would say that this hotel is at";3
I returned to the Empire Hotel for 3 nights in early May, thinking that the odd circumstances I encountered while stayng there at the beginning of April were just anomalies. That was not the case. First the good news, this is a great location, at the entrance to the Upper West Side, excellent subway connections, a block from the Lincoln Centre, easy access on the west side highway from GW bridge. The staff are genuinely friendly, enagaging and helpful. The beds are are great, among the best I have found in any hotel anywhere. When I checked in was the first hint that all was not well. Although I arrived at the hotel at 7:00 in the evening, my room was not ready. I was offered a smoking room, but my wife is hypersensitive, so that was not an option. I was told that it would take;3
This is a good overall hotel.  After reading some of the posts here, I must say it is neither as bad as some say it is nor as good as a 5-star.  It is great in terms of location.  It sits right across from Lincoln Center and 5 minutes away from Columbus Circle (subway stop).  Few minutes walk to either Central Park or the Museum of Natural History.  Furthermore, it got a Starbucks and Duane Reade (Drug Store + Convenient Store) - a big plus in my book.  Once you step inside, it has a very chic lobby. I suspect they are aiming for the W-Hotel crowd here.  The room is definitely on the small side, but on par with other hotel rooms in NYC and some European cities.   The room was clean with decent amenities.  As per some of the comments, I laughed when I observed the non-closing;3
The rooms are small and the pool is more like a kids paddling pool but I have to say that our stay here was fantastic. Although the pool was tiny my 9 yr old made good use of it. Great location for getting around and we loved that it was such a short walk to central park. The staff were friendly and the concierge really helpful. The bar on the roof was a fantastic way to relax and take in A New York sunset. The room was clean and comfortable. All in all a good trip I would stay here again.;3
Location was good as next to Subway. I booked and paid thru Priceline and was surprised by the facility fee I was asked to pay at checkout.  Price paid was thru bidding so it didn't give me a choice to reject the purchase if I had noticed the details did mention there may be additional charges from the hotel. When checking in, the front desk said that it was a big room but it was one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever been in.;3
"Check room when you arrive  before committing..  Some rooms, termed ""deluxe"" are anything but. Lighting and amenities in some rooms are poor. No night tables, no lamps, low energy bulbs in overhead light. Front desk very slow to pick up telephone.no milk, sweetener for ""complimentary"" coffee";3
I stayed here for three nights over a weekend in June. The hotel is perfectly nice but the rooms are tiny, in need of renovating, and sound travels too much.  ROOM I was surprised on asking for a good room and offering to pay more to walk into a tiny room reminiscent of the 70s. After having read the website about flatscreen TVs a horrid little television was in the room. There would be no connecting the HDMI cable to watch movies that night. The room had a small safe, vertical style, that managed to fit my laptop and other valuables, inside a tiny wardrobe. The room also had a small desk to work at, and ironing board. The bed and bedding was comfortable enough, thankfully I planned on spending very little time in the room.  SLEEP I had a room relatively high up (I suppose;3
Location is in a crappy part of town. Rooms were dingy and not particularly clean. Service was fine and security was in place to get to elevators. Price not out of line, but still with taxes over $300. No fault of the hotel but it was 94 degrees outside which didn't add to the ambience in the area.;3
Rooms are big and so is shower. Beds comfortable. Charged to park and no place on property for dogs to do their business. Over priced for what you get. Stayed in another national  name brand hotel in New Mexico, that was 10 times better for half the price.;3
We were very pleased with the staff at this hotel, but for the three nights we were there, we could never get the thermostat to work correctly.  It was always too cold, like the heater didn't work at night.  Woke up freezing every morning.   When we first entered the room, one of the light bulbs was burnt out, and staff replaced it shortly after we reported it.  It is a typically small NYC hotel room with charming dÃ©cor.  Comfortable beds.  You can see how historic the building is by the marble trim, old doors, showers, etc.;3
The Hotel is ideally placed for exploring Manhattan and the other Boroughs as the Columbus Circle subway station is a 3 minute walk away. The Hotel would benefit from a serious upgrade as it is looking a little tired.The room I had (221) was ok but who ever designed the bathroom should be sent for retraining. The shower was in the wrong place and the (designer) wash basin was no use at all.The staff on the front desk were excellent.;3
Ok but pricey for the service that you receive was a great venue but seems like there is a new management team in that really doesnt know what they are doing. pitty great location. The concierge is great and helpful;3
We booked a room with a private bathroom. We can't stand shared bathrooms and we knew in nyc where most building are ancient it was best to have our own private bathroom. The room is certainly tiny but it was clean and tidy. We couldn't expect more for a standard nyc hotel for $95 a night. Every night our wall panel heater will make this loud noise and that threw us off the first 2 nights then after that we just ignored it. It is a basic hotel, staff are not friendly, so your best off using the free wifi and doing your own research. Overall, we would not stay here again. There's 2 good points in terms of location of this hotel. It's close to a subway and there's a deli/fruit market around the corner of the hotel as well as a bagel shop called Absolute Bagel which serves;3
This is a nice hotel for an overnight stay to catch a flight the next day.  This is not a destination hotel.  If someone is vacationing in LA, you donât want to stay here.  In my case, I had an overnight layover.;3
Great location but tiny room.  Not suitable for working. Desk needs a light. Designed for very tall people with very few clothes.  Keurig machine but no coffee. Pool looks large in pics but really just a splash area. Should convert to a jacuzzi!;3
Stayed here to be next to Universal Studios and it is a perfect location. We had a view of the park and it was awesome. What was not awesome was the fact that they charge you $40.00 for valet parking is your vehicle is over 6'. While the self parking was only $28.00. So not happy with this charge. Will go looking for another place when I come back in a few months.;3
"My wife and I have stayed here many times because of its convenient location but our room has never been ready upon arrival, even when we have been assured via email that it would be ready.  Have always had to wait 1-2 hours or more past the official check-in time of 3:00.  Staff is friendly and pleasant and always promises that the room will be ready in ""few minutes"" but it takes hours.  Besides beefing up housekeeping management should replace the garish wallpaper in the hallways and rooms and replace the half enclosures for the showers, which allow water to spray all over the bathrooms.";3
I had the worst check in experience because the staff does not know the computer system.   Normally I really don't mind but this time we checked into this hotel around 12 midnight.  We were tired and hungry with our young son.  Keeping us at the reception for a very long time was no fun.  We order room service after that and it was fast service and the food was better than I expected.   Overall, the location was good and the other staff was very friendly.;3
I stayed at the Empire Hotel during a business trip to NYC.  It is a very convenient hotel for it's location across the street from Lincoln Center.  The rooms are a little tired and the elevators are almost scary.  Most days i wasn't sure if i would make it up or down depending on the time of day.  The upstairs club is a hot spot that I didn't visit so i can't comment on.  The restaurants nearby are plentiful and varying in tastes.  Close to the subway, Central Park, Broadway Theaters and all New York has to offer.  With all the other hotels in New York I will probably pick a different one next time.;3
* +*  * Great location if you are visiting Universal Studios => 7 min walk or few minutes transfer car * Clean rooms and bathroom * Tasty room service (Chicken Ceaser Salad) * Self and valet parking available on site. 28 USD for the night + tax (self-parking)  *-*  * Charged add-on for the internet ($7.95 + Tax)  which is shameful. I rather they offered higher price than ask me to pay more for the wifi which is available free in most places around *  Room service took a long time to arrive  Overall, they key advantage is location only! Very standard and basic hotel.;3
Great location near Times Square and Central Park, however there is no double glazing on the windows and the noise every night from police sirens and ambulances, not to mention people in the streets below meant very little sleep.  I guess this is New York and you expect some noise but not being able to sleep means  next  day's sightseeing is accompanied by a lot of yawning!;3
Great location, quite friendly staff, dirty sheets, noisy. We took deluxe room, but it wasn't very clean (especially sheets which looked dirty). Location is really great, only two minutes from Hammersmith subway.;3
The hotel location is awesome! It IS relatively close to Hollywood.  My daughter and her boyfriend stayed in a king bed suite while I had a double queen bed room. The two rooms are not joint. And, I only stayed there one night prior to checking into my conference hotel, which was what brought us to LA. They stayed 4 nights.  First of all, the staff is very friendly and responsive. The hotel and room we stay in are clean and relatively spacious. But, there is a big stain on one of the chairs in my room. And, I only have a small tiled shower stall in my room. The phone has not dial tone either.;3
Impressive frontage and well located across the road from the Lincoln Centre. Close to Columbus Circle near by along with Central Park all within a walk.   Room located on 12 floor was good but needs renovating but is comfortable and tight in space but the view overlooking the Lincoln Centre and back look down to Midtown was outstanding and a highlight. Heating was noisy as it isolated and needed to be overhauled.   Staff were outstanding and made up for any faults and were perhaps some of the best I came across whilst in New York.;3
"Great location to access Universal Studios, however the walking ""path"" doesn't have any signage.  When I asked I was told to take the shuttle.  I didn't want to take the shuttle so figured it out on my own.    Check-in wasn't great.  There were about 6 parties in front of me with 2 check-in stations.  I waited about 30 minutes to get to someone and that was only because a third station opened when I was the next in line.  One station had 3 people standing around it, so not sure if they were training them but it was very slow.  I would have used digital key, but when I did online check-in I was told I had to go the desk anyway.  So no real value in digital key.  No acknowledgement from valet when we drove up if it was ok to leave my car there while we checked in.  My daughter";3
Stayed here last week, the website photographs of the hotel are very deceiving.  The rooftop pool was no bigger than a bath and the rooms are in serious need of updating/redecorating. Wallpaper coming off of walls, aircon unit rusty and paint coming off of bathroom door and bubbling, cracking of the wood. The shower in the was amazing though, very powerful and easy to use.  Toilets on mezzanine floor were disgustingly dirty so more attention needed in this area.     Arrived at 8.30 p.m. and decided to have a look around area nearby, checked in at 10.30 p.m. given card key to room and couldn't access room.  Spent ages waiting in lobby for security/maintenance to fix the door, so not a great start.  Very, very expensive mini bar.  They state they will remove items from mini bar;3
"The hotel is a great home base for exploring Manhattan especially if you are coming into the city via Penn Station.  The room was actually larger than expected (based on reading other reviews).  Check in was quick and there were always elevators available.  I have 2 main negatives for the hotel.  First, the ""queen"" bed is ridiculously small.  Both my wife and I felt like we were sleeping on the edge of the bed to not disturb the other.  If you are used to sleeping in a queen or king at home, you seriously may want to opt for a room with 2 beds.  Second, on our first night at the hotel I called for an extra blanket at 9:40 PM.  I was told it would be right up.  At 10:20 when I hadn't received a blanket I called again and was told it would be right there.  At 10:40 when I called";3
I'd recommend The Jane for two types of users.   First, anyone who can't face a late night train ride back to Long Island, Jersey, upstate or Connecticut after a night out and wants somewhere to crash for one night.   Second, people who understand about travelling on a budget on a short stay.  The Jane is located in a very nice area next to the Hudson, surrounded by the Whitney, High Line, Meat Packing District, Pier 51 park and Greenwich Village. There are hundreds of nice cafes, bars, restaurants and independent stores within 10 minutes, although Jane St is residential.   The rooms are tiny, about the size of a walk in wardrobe, or a Queen Size bed. Their design is genius and in fact you get an amazing amount of storage space, plus a mirror which makes the room seem twice as;3
Very old hotel which require urgent renovation. Bath taps are terrible. Wi-fi is the slowest on earth. Staff are friendly. Location is central. Room is medium size and convenient. Room is fairly clean.;3
Stayed here in August  2014, decided we wanted a decent  room so opted for the executive  suit on the executive  floor. This promise good views and good rooms with excellent  service . It's a pity they didn't uphold there end of it. The rooms were not very clean and you couldnât  see out  of the window  as they were so dirty. So the view was hampered.  The food was good though and it was handy for universal studios,  just a 10 minute walk. I don't think I would  stay again, as there is so many hotels in LA to stay in.;3
I was at the hotel on a long business trip. Location is great, just near Lincoln center. But my first impression was awful. The room was not ready on check-in time, I waited about a half of hour at lobby. Then I saw the room - it was tiny, with a window to the internal courtyard, with only two meters to the wall opposite. No light from outside despite a sunny day. Impossible to switch on light without closing a curtain because of a row of windows opposite. In addition there was the constant noise in the room from the hotel ventilation sistem, just under the windows. I asked to change the room immediately and they did it from the next day, for a room much bigger and with great view of Lincoln center, without any additional charge.  Another significant problem - WiFi in the room;3
"We stayed for two nights during Columbus Day weekend.  I've stayed in my fair share of rat trap/shared baths in this city.  I've seen pretty much everything and judging from the reviews on TripAdvisor, I started chocking up Riverside Studios right alongside the likes of West Side Inn.    And come to find out, I was wrong.  Yeah, there is absolutely no ambience when you walk through the doors and the lobby area.  The guy checking us in on Friday was nice; the guy checking us out on Sunday could've cared less about us. The hallways are shabby but well lit.  Our room wasn't a luxurious suite at the Ritz.  But it was CLEAN.  My boyfriend and I checked that room up and down for bugs, or any bug-like entity and found absolutely nothing.  In fact, the mattress actually looked new.  The";3
We booked 6 days through Agoda.com. The payment was meant to be made at the Hotel. When we reached the hotel, there was a booking but was told that no room rates were contained in the booking and that we will have to pay a much higher rate. (There were room discounts on the hotel websites however.) We later produced a copy of booking information and an email from Agoda.com mentioning the correct rate. However, the hotel manager on duty refused to accept it. My credit card was charged arbitrary rates for the six days.  When I went to return the keys before leaving, I saw another customer arguing with the counter staff on a similar issue.  The hotel is in a good location hence use it by all means. But be aware of the trick and use a good website and take up the option of advance;3
Booked a conference at this hotel. All food was off the hook outstanding. There were bugs in my room and parking was expensive. Service was pretty good. Elevators were ridiculously slow and therefore I would not stay there again as they are not sufficient to support the number of guests in the hotel. Plan to wait up to 10 minutes for an elevator, especially if you are on an upper floor.;3
The location of this hotel is amazing - but the small bathroom and peeling paint, broken fixtures, and slow housekeeping service took away from the experience.  The overall room (superior double double) was ok  for the 3 of us, but the bathroom is so tiny and impractical.  Also, found the response time for housekeeping requests (e.g. replacing an iron whose cord didn't come out) to be very slow.;3
We were in NY for a black tie wedding and had very little space to dress. It was difficult to put makeup on in the tiny bathroom and the lighting was very poor. When we checked in, I was told that the bigger room on the 11th floor would be noisy at night when the bar was open.;3
"The Empire was in a good location with subway close and really good restaurants close; however that's the best part.  We were there during the snow storm and the front door was frequently open sucking in the smoke from the people standing outside smoking. Generally, only two of the four elevators worked; usually only one. We stayed on the fifth floor and it took a good 3 minutes for the water to get warm.  We actually wondered if the water was hooked up backwards!  Yuri, at the concierge, seemed to be the only employee who liked being there. No one was rude or mean, but they by no means went out of their way for anyone that I had noticed. Our room was very warm even with the heat off. We had to prop our window open with the bar of soap we found on the window ledge that someone";3
Pros: The hotel is right across the street from the Lincoln Center, and a block away from the central park, so it is a vety nice location.  If you have a room facing away from the street, it is very quiet.  The lobby was cozy and cute. Cons: The room was comfortable enough to sleep, but needs renovation badly.;3
We were recommended this by Trailfinders. It is central and the upfront costs are reasonable. However the whole affect is shabby - and very much not chic. Even the door men, who were pleasant, were unkempt. The lobby is gloomy, the service there ranged from helpful to indifference, depending on the person. The rooms are small (but it is N.Y.) but cleaning is good. The bed was comfortable but the bathroom was miniscule and the shower got everything in sight wet. The room safe failed. But the overwhelming thing was the notion of  extra unwarranted cost. Make coffee with the machine and  pay 3 dollars! WiFi is 10 dollars a day in the room!!. The chowder house provided good food but nearly 100 dollars for 2 soups, a drink and 2 appetizers!  It is good for a central position (Central;3
Best thing is the chef Hugo who made breakfast every morning in the hotel. He mad the best omelettes and waffles and was very charming and friendly. Excellent customer service skills. thank you Hugo.   One thing that would be helpful to offer free internet access in the foyer rather than charge so much for 10 minutes access.;3
I would not stay at this hotel next trip. Very outdated and room is small. There is a foot between bed corner & dresser... banged my leg to walk around to get in bed!! Bed was comfortable though. Didn't get a call that room was ready...finally got room at 10PM!;3
The Empire has its ups and downs. The location is fantastic. The overall decor and cleanliness is not the best I've seen but the sheets and linens seem clean which is most important. I was quite dismayed to find out my room was directly below the 12th floor dance club (I was never warned about this) so my most recent stay was fraught with noise and a shaking room. I would have definitely requested a different room type/location had I known this prior to getting my room key.;3
I booked the Days Inn due to its location near Central Park for my last trip to New York with my wife.  I paid extra to upgrade to a 'superior' room and it was not the greatest room I have stayed in.  The furniture in the room looked as if it had come from a skip down the road.  I had requested a low floor as my wife does not like heights but as I had paid for the upgrade we were on the 12th Floor.  After the first night I asked to change and was told the upgraded rooms were only available on the 11th and 12th floor so we switched to the 11th floor.  This room was better but still the furniture had seen better days.  I could not fault the service from the staff but dread to think what the non upgraded rooms looked like as the receptionist told me I would not like them after;3
We stayed at the Hilton one night, to see a concert at Hollywood Bowl.  We did walk City Walk in the day time so it was a great location for Universal City attractions.  This was our 5th hotel of the trip and we were a little disappointed in the personal feel of the hotel.  Based on the experiences we received at the other hotels, this felt more of a large franchise that farmed you in and farmed you out.  The only reason we received free wifi was because we were HHonors members and in this day and age, free wifi should be pretty standard. The hotel were working on their elevators so people had to wait long periods of time to get leave or get back to their room.  I commend the staff because they were cognizant of the waits and had someone assigned at all times to get you to where;3
"Good location ( near Penn Station /Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Empire State) but noisy!   I booked the hotel at website and prepaid it.  During my checkout I asked the hotel bill receipt to check it and everything was okay! It wasn't a ""great experience"" but it was okay. The next door room noisy bother me a little during the night and early morning.  The hotel room's soundproofing needs to fix.";3
I stayed here in 2013 for my 21st birthday. Upon arrival we waited around 15 minutes to check into our room. When we got there we were disappointed... tiny room and the view was of a building maybe 15ft away from the window... so you couldn't see anything and there was no light coming into the room.  We phoned front desk and mentioned our unhappiness with the room and the manager advised us that if we sit tight tonight he will try do sort something the following day. The next morning we met with the manager who upgraded us to a suite which was incredible! Views across the entire city!  Had I of had a room like that I would have given it 5* but due to the first room I was given I can only give it an Average score.  In terms of location I would say it's around a 10 minute walk to;3
Had a lot of misses mainly with the cleanliness. The service was lacking (requests went unfulfilled). And the room was not clean. There were crumbs, stains, and dust on the furniture (was hesitant to even sit on the sofa because of the mess). And the toilet area had stains (gross). But the hotel room was very quiet (except for hallway noises but no airplane noises) and conveniently located. Just wished the service and cleanliness had been better.;3
Very cute hotel, great location...need big improvement . Staff in the first day was good and after that not so great...second day they were father behind the counter and I walk into them...it took too long for them to acknowledge me;3
We read all the reviews and were quite apprehensive but any worry was quickly dispelled.   The apartment was basic but what do you expect for the price. Plus we didn't spend all day in it, we were there to see the sights. One thing that has been mentioned in previous reviews which we think would be an improvement is free internet and access to a printer to enable booking online for the flight home.  The apartment block was about 200 yards from 72nd Street/Broadway tube station (Red line) and a 5/10 minute walk to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History.  The area has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from with a range of prices. We would thoroughly recommend Josie's and Lansky's. It must be reported that cooking would have been a problem as the apartment had only;3
I would stay her again, but they need to step up their hospitality service, it is very poor.  You call the front desk and the phone is ringing like no one is available.  The hotel was very clean and the location great.  The rooms very nice, every morning housekeeping comes and clean the rooms and change the sheet, i like that.;3
The location of the hotel is great if you are visiting Universal Studio. The hotel provides shuttle ride to Universal City Walk. The stay was good overall except the wait for the check-in took forever. It didn't help if you were HHonor member, they just had everyone waiting in the same line. They should get rid of HH sign if they weren't going to use it.;3
The location just perfect to visit all great points. The hotel staff friendly and helpful, was clean room, but very uncomfortable and hard bed. If you want to use a WiFi is $10 charge for 24 hours.  Just few mins walk is subway station and the lovely place for the breakfast and late night sit with free WiFi, just beside the round about.;3
Our room was nice and clean. Check-in / check-out were relatively pleasant and I'm happy with stay overall. However, do not come here and expect to use the pool for relaxing! It is full of rowdy kids from early morning to late night. Parents don't care and seem to just be happy that they don't have to deal with them. I really think the hotel should have family hours (maybe morning) and adult hours (maybe afternoon) around the pool area. We specifically picked this hotel because we were hoping for some chill time around the pool but that was impossible (I even overheard one kids telling another that he went to the bathroom in the pool...).;3
"Seems to me this hotel could really benefit from some TLC.  To be fair I've only ever stayed there this one time so I don't know what other rooms were like but if my room is typical, then I'd say buyer beware. The location is unbeatable; next door to Lincoln Center, two blocks from Central Park, easy access to subway, etc.  The lobby bar is great, the attached restaurant (Chowder House) is 1st rate and well run if a bit overpriced (but everything in that part of town is).  But its clear to me that whomever is running this place is cutting corners when it comes to maintenance.";3
"I know Manhattan is expensive... but my experience there has been if you're willing to pay the money, you'll usually get something nice.  Not so with the Empire Hotel.  This place is scrappy... it really really needs an update.  It felt like the whole place was a bullet hole with a band aid slapped on it.  Window sills with painted over rust pits, rotting bathroom doors.. also painted over.  Pealing wallpaper... lots and lots of it.  Oh, and let me tell you about the missing shower door:  I go into the bathroom to take a shower and notice that we've got no shower door!  Half of the shower is exposed to the bathroom.  I call the front desk and am told that all the showers are that way and that it's a ""design flaw"".  What??  Now I know why the bathroom door is rotting... from";3
"Pros - visited for our honeymoon last year and they gave us a bottle of champagne, the lobby is gorgeous with so much character, the rooms are lovely, they do a ""Chuck Bass"" cocktail for Gossip Girl fans, great location.   Cons - very expensive - the room, the items in the room, the bar, the pool is tiny, the hotel was very busy in the evening as they have a rooftop bar, we had a cockroach in our room but they did upgrade/move us quite quickly and offered to help with our luggage, staff were ok but not overly friendly, terrible wifi.   Overall I was quite underwhelmed. We visited as part of the Gossip Girl tour and perhaps I should have just left it there and stayed in our other hotel for the whole honeymoon. I wouldn't return.";3
Positives - clean room, good amount of space, very decent breakfast, free/cheap street parking and central location Negatives - stained bath towels, grimy neighborhood, expensive hotel parking and current construction;3
My mother and I just returned from our stay at this hotel on the 6th September and overall can say we had a pleasant stay! However, upon arrival we were allocated a room which was not up to standard at all. I had previously stayed at this particular hotel a week before my mother arrived in NYC and therefore, I had a good idea of the expected standard of the room. After complaining to reception, they gave us a new room on the 6th floor which was so much better! The room was bigger, the bathroom was nice, the air con was brilliant, there was a safe that could be used easy and the TV worked fine. The room service in this hotel is good too, we had clean towels everyday and the beds were made. The concierge lady was very helpful when asking about general advice including the subway;3
The Hotel is in a very good location: close to the subway (red line, 1-2-3), and to central park. Nearby there are many restaurants and a Starbucks for your Frappuccino :) Our room was really silent, but the view was terrible (we saw only other courtyards). It was big and comfortable, but in our opinion not so clean ( fitted carpet on the floor). The staff is really kind and there is a person dedicated to organizing trips for tourists and answering questions, really useful. Maybe too much expensive, we paid almost 100 $ per person per night, but is upper west side in  Manhattan :);3
No car needed. Superbly located for fun at Universal Studios and Universal City Metro station, the Hilton Universal City is just a few minutes walk away from both.  The hotel could use a bit if a spruce up and is showing its age. The decor is a bit drab and out dated but is fine from a practical use point of view. Places to eat at the hotel are limited, but with Universal CityWalk mere minutes walk away, there's no shortage of choice.  Room was large with full bathroom. Staff helpful and friendly.;3
I stayed here because of location matched with fair pricing. The room was ample enough. Doormen were friendly and helpful. Front desk wasn't unfriendly, but not cheerful or welcoming. Room had a major cold draft from the heat/ac unit. Heater was very noisy and we couldn't keep a constant temp in the room...always too hot or too cold. Bottom line: I would stay here again.;3
The room was very small and had no fridge or coffee maker. No free WiFi in the room. There was no view despite the very high price for the room. Staff was friendly and helpful though and the location was good..;3
This was my second stay at the New Yorker hotel in one year. Mr Miguel and Ms Nayab (both staff members at the check in counter) promised me to reimburse the facility fee of USD 29 per night but somehow I still got charged. During the check out, I addressed this issue and Ms Shamagne said she will asked Mr Miguel and Ms Nayab if this was true. They would come in at 3 pm and I would already be flying back home. Ms Shamagne wrote down my e-mail address and phone number and promised to get back at me. She never did, even though I asked her two times before leaving the hotel!!! Itâs really unpleasant to deal with unreliable staff, especially when you are there for a short perioud and trying to enjoy the city.   I had to solve this issue when I came back to the Netherlands.;3
SUPRISE!  $20.00 To park each night. Rooms were nice but not worth $260.00 Per night. I spent 1/2 hour trying to get one of the lights to work. Nice patio for evening glass of wine. Pool area is very nice .;3
"In Europe this would be a 3-star hotel, but with caveats  - Pleasant staff; no restaurant; a bit long in the tooth  - No plugs at desk for charging devices  - Desk chair broken  - Carpet has seen better days  - Very small but clean room and bathroom; some rooms on Broadway (noisier) some face an alley (no view but quiet)  - Around the corner from Colbertâs Late Show (Ed Sullivan Theater)";3
I was a bit concerned about this hotel as I'd read some poor reviews, particularly as we'd booked a cheap room through a third party booking site. My concerns were well placed - you get what you pay for. Positives - the hotel is in a bit of a middle-of-nowhere area but is well-located for many of the main tourist attractions in north-central LA. It'll only take you 15 minutes in a car or taxi to Griffith Park or Downtown, 20 minutes to dead central Hollywood. The communal areas of the hotel are also good: the pool area is clean and attractive, as are the outside frontage, reception, courtyard, bar, breakfast area and corridors. Their prices are good for the area the hotel is in. Service was good during our stay - even if it was obvious that housekeeping only turned the;3
"The Sites photos online made this Hotel look amazing, but was completely disappointed upon arrival. Rooms were very small and super out dated. This is an Apartment / Hotel, with too many issues to list. Parking is a MAJOR issue and becomes very frustrating. Hotel only had One elevator for the Building! Not Cool.  The Staff was very polite, but due to the condition of the Hotel, really couldnât be of assistance. The only positive is its location; close to Subway, Central Park, & Great Restaurants. Not a good choice for a Family Stay.";3
"The air conditioning was pretty much non-functioning. the hotel is a bit shabby -not too bad -but not at all expected-the doormen and the location couldn't be better -your advertising of the pool is very deceptive it is way too small and the stairway is never mentioned -i spoke to some guest that never found it-your front desk was not helpful -and when i do not have air conditioning for one night and most of the next day and then have to move three peoples things to another room I expect more than ""well we moved you"" as a response- i also thing you overcharged me for the ammenities";3
"The staff at The Empire appeared to go out of their way to ensure that our stay was enjoyable. The bellhops, doormen, concierge staff, housekeepers and front desk staff were exceptional.  Unfortunately,  the Rooftop Bar was obnoxiously loud and had over priced drinks; whatever you do, avoid the ""prohibition punch"". However,  the staff, view and appetizers were incredible.  Unfortunately,  there were obvious flaws at The Empire that had little to do with the front end staff. For example,  our bathroom was extremely small, did not contain the generic hotel hair dryer and the sink was installed incorrectly. Throughout the hotel one can see that there are problems in overall maintenance.   I fear The Empire might be falling.";3
A Monterey Bay Hotel Nestled within 22 acres of soaring Monterey Pines, the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa on Del Monte Golf Course is a destination hotel providing the most discerning traveler with the quintessential Monterey experience. Its Central California Coast location offers guest close proximity to downtown Monterey, Monterey Airport and easy access to some of the Peninsulaâs most well-known attractions..... âThis is what our stay should have been;3
Ultra mini small room. Smallest bathroom I've ever seen. Shower needs mold remediation..electrical outlet in bathroom requires repair.  AC system is quite loud. Bed was fantastic! And the welcome upon registering was very pleasant.;3
The style of the hotel did nothing for me like it did for some other reviewers.  The lobby was nice in a retro way, but the sleeping room was run down and not overly clean.  The location is very convenient, as is having a quick, well-priced, 24-hour diner in the lobby. You can grab a quick bite to eat and be on your way for the rest of the day.    The service is just OK.  We arrived before our room was ready so we checked our luggage with the bell stand.  When we got into our room later in the day, we were trying to relax for a bit so we called the bell desk about 5-6 times over the course of 10-15 minutes.  No one answered. So, I went down to get our luggage, by myself because the person I was traveling with has an injury.  The guy gave me all our luggage and basically walked;3
The hotel is in a good location. Our room was comfortable if a little cold. Although we were on the 7th floor the traffic noise,in the City that never sleeps ,could be a bit intrusive at times. All in all it was an enjoyable experience for a senior couple celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary. The highlight of the trip was an evening dinner cruise on the Bateaux NewYork.Magical.;3
We arrived at 1pm, the check inn was fast flowed nicely. We got to our room opened the curtains and we were greeted with a wall, I had specifically booked a room with a view, I went back down stairs spoke to the receptionist who had given our room, and she actually argued with me and didn't believe me that we had a brick wall as a view, I really wasn't impressed. After waiting an hour yes an hour she finally believed me and gave me another room that was before she checked it her self literally couldn't believe it. The rooms are so so small it's very cramped, the photos need to be changed on the website very misleading. No facilities no kettle or fridge very annoying. The beds are super comfy. The bath was awful once you got in the water disappeared so kept the tap on.  Tick tock;3
"All,       We booked a Standard Queen last April for 2 days, and they kindly upgraded us to the Superior King.  Let me tell you, this was a great time!  The room (#223) was spacious, clean and had a nice view.  This year we booked again for a Standard Queen, and we were not so lucky in getting an upgrade (probably because of peak season).  We arrived at 3 PM, and guess what?  The room was not available.  They had a smoking room, but that is just disgusting!  So they told us to ""check in our bags, and come back in about 45 minutes, and we would get a much better room.""  So we did just that.  About 45 minutes later, we received a phone call that our room was ready.  We arrived back to obtain our room cards, and I had asked about the log in credentials for the wireless.  She told";3
Really enjoyed our recent stay in London. Picked this premier inn for location alone I mean right at the London eye canât get any better just a shame we didnât have a view of it.  Upon arrival at the hotel the staff informed me of a Â£14 charge that was due as we had to change dates due to having covid- not the staffâs fault but it wasnât something I was aware of so not the best start. The room was good size for 1adult and 2 children the smallest bed was so flimsy though any time my 10 year old sat on it, it creaked and moved certainly couldnât hold an adult thatâs for sure.  Couple of down sides although the air con worked it was still super hot in the room and that was in the lowest setting (19 degrees) the windows had to be closed every night as we faced onto the street people;3
The elevator transportation system is woefully inadequate. Although the staff realizes the issue and provides a letter with the hotel key, the waits of up to 15 minutes for an elevator is unacceptable.;3
The hotel is top located near Colombus Circle and just a stonethrow away from Central Park. They have a super nice end efficiant frontdesk and bellman staff. All very friendly and helpful. The rooftop too, is a highlight of the Empire Hotel, even though the pool was a bit disappointing as it looks different on the photos. To lounge and have a pricey drink in their cosy lounge corner, the rooftop is a must-do when you stay there. Disappointing was the room. Definitly way too small for the buck and for a 4 star hotel. Glad, we had only 2 luggages as it wouldn't habe been possible to keep more luggage in the room. The bathroom too was far too small. The room photos we saw beforehand, left higher expectations. Kinda funny the floor works, that took place while we were there. The fun;3
In some ways, I had no choice of where I was since this was the conference location.  Upon observation, the Hotel is dated. Fire took place and the emergency system didn't work and I had to call the front desk to get the news to leave my room.;3
This was our last stop on a US honeymoon tour. I knew NY was going to be hustle bustle and noisy. What I was hoping for was a good hotel to retreat and refresh.  At check in we had good idea of how busy this hotel is. Flight crews, conference groups blocking reception area. There were less busy moments. When we were checking in I mentioned we were on honey moon and Afrosa did her best to find us a good room. The hotel was sold out. She did say room was good and sent us a complimentary bottle of quality red wine. The outcome of room was not what we expected. You couldnt get a cat in there let alone swing one. 27 floors up in alcove looking down on 8th and 34th street. The street noise was louder than expected, the room and bathroom were tired, the bed was small, though very;3
The staff is very helpful, and the room is a pretty decent size. I love that this hotel is away from the crazyness but still surrounded by great shops and restaurants! We walked to Times Square and it wasn't too bad of a walk when your taking in the city.;3
The price is right for the location, the rooms are a little out dated but they do the job just fine.  I went with a few co workers for business and we ended up staying here the first night due to our booking with Air BnB was booked until the next day. Really nice grounds and friendly staff, the pool area was very nice as well.;3
The positive thing is the location in the universal city walking distance from the theme parks. One room was ready, the second one we had to wait for about 20 minutes. They don't provide bottled drinking water. Bathroom roped only provided for executive rooms and was not there we had to ask for it. The reception staff were good and smiling however the other staff need to learn how to smile. The breakfast food selection was very limited and expensive. The wifi is not free in the rooms. The rooms cost are high compared to the services provided. It really not worth the money paid.;3
Great location if your visiting Universal Studio.  Short walk to the park..  Staff was friendly.  Parking was a little expensive.  Our 1st room was great but the air conditioning was not working, they sent up someone to check it but he was unable to fix so they moved us into the room next door.  This room was a different story it had a stale smoke/wet dog odor, something brown and sticky spilt on the carpet and up the wall by mini-fridge. This room just was dirty.  It did have view of the pool and hills that was a plus and the beds were ok.;3
Clean, comfortable bed and friendly staff. Very near the subway and Columbus Circle and all of downtown.. walking distance. Next door to Starbucks and 24 hour pharmacy for all you need as well as an ATM;3
The Jane has an amazing location - close to the highline, a few blocks from the subway, reasonably priced for a NY hotel and on a pretty cobblestone street in the west village. Lovely. However, if you are planning on staying in a bunk room, please prepare yourself for how small they are! We are usually pretty easy going, but after a few nights in this tiny room, we were feeling claustrophobic and annoyed. (For a short stay it might be ok - especially if you arent the type that needs personal space.) We would stay again, but only in a larger room! Having said that, Cafe Gitane on the bottom floor was great, and the 2 bars were also a nice spot to have a drink.;3
"The room was clean which is most important to me but there was a lack of service which bothered me. My used cups were not replaced and my used towels and washcloth were not replaced. After the first day, I placed them on the floor the next day and they did not replace the washcloth. Aside from making the bed I am not sure they did anything to the room each day.  The appearance of the room was ""ok"" but you could tell it was just surface level improvements. The bathroom updates are not to code and the vanity is less than one inch from the toilet making it extremely uncomfortable to use.  With plenty of choices in NYC, I will not be going back.";3
I had really high hopes for what sounded like a cool, funky place. It is funky. I stayed in a Captain's Cabin, so I had my own cute bathroom.  The room looked good, smelled old and stale. I had a french door to a patio that was chained from the outside, so I couldn't use it. The glass panes on the door were filthy, with spider webs hanging. That, with the heavy chain locking me in, gave it a creepy feel.  The bar and the rooftop were closed for private events my entire stay. There are bars and restaurants close, but not on the street, so grabbing a drink or appetizer at the end of the day wasn't easy.  The doormen were warm and welcoming, but not so the front desk.  The price is good, the location is OK.  I will try something else next time.;3
Clean room and clean bath room. The place is near subway, supermarket and easy find halal food. Near to central park and hanson riverside park. Small room no AC and no TV. For sleep and bath only ....;3
after reading several bad reviews on this hotel i was very nervouse however when i arrived at the hotel i was plesently surprised i stayed for ten days at the end of june begginning of july and i didnt have any complaints the cost is very reasonable the room was of an average size with a fridge the towels were changed everyday and the bedding was changed every other day i found the staff to be friendly and helpful ron especially, and its a good location for subway to take you into midtown manahttan etc, i would have no problems with reccomending this hotel to other people and think that for the price that you pay you carnt expect any more. i can see what people are saying about it being dated but it was clean and comfortable and priced very reasonably.;3
First impressions of The Jane are great. The staff are dressed in old fashioned uniforms. The rooms are very cool, all shabby chic but with modern amenities. The location is great in the Village with trendy shops and bars around.  The problem is there is a noisy club on the ground floor that we could hear in our room until 3am. Not cool. It's unclear what the relationship is between the hotel and club - it's not even mentioned in the hotel info in the room and the hotel said they could only ask them to turn the music down. We went to the club and it's great but just not for guests!;3
"What promised to be treat turned out not to be.  Convenient to everything we had planned, and at first look, appeared to be a perfect fit.  However, our first room was disappointingly small for the price and description, i.e. don't believe ""deluxe"".  Bathrooms were small with dysfunctional, small sinks.  Comfortable enough the first night, but we were glad to accept an upgrade to a junior suite for the rest of our stay.  Much better despite the same small sink, and they tried to charge us $40 for the use of the laundry bag to move some of our clothes.  A nice mini-bar and wine selection available, but no wine glasses, just heavy paper cups !!  Now about the Lobby Bar.  For some reason, perhaps weather related, the owners have not been able to replace the front doors so that";3
The hotel is not in the most desirable of areas. Our first night was in a room overlooking the main road. It was extremely noisy, and even though we were exhausted from the journey, it was close to impossible to sleep. The upside was that when we mentioned this the next morning we were moved to a much nicer room, that overlooked the inner court. The room was much cleaner too. When we first arrived we wanted to sit quietly in the bar, but that was closed. No offer of an alternative, and no food either. The breakfast was good and plentiful although woe betide anyone who asks for additional scrambled eggs, a firm no was the response! The weather was very hot when we stayed, but the swimming pool was freezing, I am not shy of outside pools, but this was impossible to get into. The;3
The location of this hotel is very convenient,  not to far from Times Square (about 5-6 blocks), near the port authority, Madison square garden, Penn Station. Based on hotels being over-priced in New York I'd say it was a good value. The hotel is dated- It could use some remodeling but I'm sure that would increase pricing even more. My biggest complaint about this hotel was the noise! I stayed on the 22nd floor and could hear EVERY noise outside, police cars, people closing their car doors, people talking/coughing. The noise was so clear that it seemed as if the windows were open and I was on the ground floor. Closing both sets of curtains helped a little and pure exhaustion from walking around the city all day helped a lot! If you're looking for peace and quiet- this may not be;3
Located in the heart of Manhattan NYC, this Hotel is 2.5 Blocks from Central park, and 1-3 blocks away from the subway depending on what line you need. Plenty to eat around the hotel, easy access to anything. The rooms were kinda small, no mini fridge, and rooms could use some updating, and don't expect a continental breakfast. But those are small gripes to me given where you're located and how easy it is to get everywhere you want to. Parking is best taken care of in one of the nearby garages as there is no on site parking (it's Manhattan, and it's to be expected) the staff is friendly and fast if you need help or extras like more towels and such. I recommend anyone to stay here as long as you're not expecting the newest and fanciest amenities. I'd really give this place a 3.5/5;3
"Many hotels have facility fees now but when I booked directly with Wyndham these fees were hidden. My reservation receipt clearly stated ""Total for Stay"" = $348.67; charged $410.26 at check-out. Explanation I received via email: ""Thank you for contacting The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel Customer Care regarding your concern. When booking on the web site for any Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. property there is an optional link in blue on the Pay page, which is the second step of the reservation process, where you can click to get a complete break down of both the room rate, individual tax charge amounts and cancellation policies including any deposits or fees.  It is here where it lists the facility charges of $ 34.08 per night plus tax."" Ridiculous.";3
"For the price it was more than enough. The room was clean and warm (during a snow storm). The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was excellent; right near the central park north entrance and near the subway. No free wi-fi (about $10 a day!) the pillows were hard and too high, and the radiator whistled all night. The price was so cheap that it was well worth it though. Just bring your own pillow :D";3
"I wouldn't stay here again. We arrived with a car full of luggage to unload and there is no loading zone...you have to double park on the street. They had no cart or help for unloading. This is an apartment building where some of the apartments are rented out for short stays, so you can't expect the same amenities you'd get from a hotel. We went through Hotels for reservations and we, plus 2 others guest who arrived when we did, didn't get the type of rooms  promised. We complained and they were able to switch us, but one family had signed up for a 2 bedroom apt. and ended up with 2 studios. We got a studio that ""slept 3"". There was a queen size bed and pull out single bed sofa, which was very thin and uncomfortable to sleep on. It is very small for 3 people. The studio for 2";3
The lobby and room were very beautiful but the reception check-in woman was increbibly rude. Also, since we were on an anniversary trip, we asked to be put away from the street if possible or in general just a quiet section. We were put in 315, a corner with Windows level to the bar next door. It was so incredibly loud we could hear the lyrics and bass to every song all night.;3
I booked this hotel through the Universal Studios website which had a great package deal for the hotel and tickets to the park. The package included a room on the executive floor with a view of the Studios. That was truly the best part of the experience! The Harry Potter ride, the Waterworld show were visible from the room itself which was amazing. IT also included free continental breakfast which could be upgraded to full buffet for $10 per day, which was also very nice. There were good choices for  breakfast. There is also a shuttle that goes from the hotel to the Studios every 15 mins. Overall, the location was the best value from this hotel. Room was clean and spacious. Parking is $28/day but then it's L.A.!  Hilton Honors Issue: Here is my biggest peeve with this;3
Hotel was in a good location near subway stations thus quite handy to jump on the train to head to Universal or into main L.A. city. Good value at the rates we paid.  Lots of cheap little shops around the hotel in regards to massage, haircuts etc.  Variety of cheap places to eat but nothing fancy around there. Some of the staff probably shouldn't be in customer service as were quite ignorant.;3
We had an executive double room and it was large for a New York hotel room.  The beds were very comfortable and very clean.  The bathroom was very small and the shower was odd as you had to be physically in the shower to turn it on and of course the water was ice cold.  Loved the Tick Tock restaurant attached to the hotel.  Best pancakes around.;3
"Have you seen a tiny room, crowded and without any reasonable space to store luggage or clothing? Have you ever been in a bathroom where you could not fit between sink and wall. The Empire provides such an experience in a room they called ""deluxe."" Granted they moved us when they could to something a bit better but far from optimal. Not a hotel for me.";3
A few years ago I gave this place a very good review after staying in one of the large Suites on a high floor.  Planning a trip back to New York to see Hamilton with a friend, I called the reservation office and talked to somebody personally about booking a suite like I had before.   She looked at my history and saw where I had stayed.  I felt very confident that it would be fine to share with my friend giving her the bedroom and I would gladly take the sofa bed because the view was so great and there was a bath off the living area as I had recalled.   What a surprise when I checked in and got to the room on the 22nd floor.   They called it a suite but it was really not suitable for two people to share equally.   It looked like it had been two separate rooms with one door;3
Like many Manhattan hotels, the rooms are small and the spaces are cramped.  The lobby is pretty and the room decor is up to date and upscale.  The location is excellent for Lincoln Center, Central Park, and a Whole Foods is nearby (it's in the basement of the shopping center, there are no obvious signs outside.) if you plan to visit in the summer, don't unless they have upgraded the air conditioning units.  Under the decorative cover inside the hotel room is a dying relic of a bygone era.  Red and blue buttons offering selections like heat, cool high, and cool low.  Our unit did nothing.  We called the front desk and let them know and went out for dinner and drinks.  We returned ad midnight and nothing was working.  The front desk said they would reset the breaker.  They did;3
Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in April, I had booked a room with 2 twin beds but when I checked in I was given 1 double bed. The hotel was fully booked so they couldnât give me alternative room so gave a fold out bed to compensate. The room was rather small and a bit dated but served its purpose. On the plus side itâs a great central location which is worth the booking.;3
"I guess for the price and location it wan't too bad.   The place was not great with filthy soiled and torn carpets on the landing. The rooms were not much better, but at least the noisy air con worked, the shower worked, and the bed linen and towels were clean and fresh.   There was a Turkish deli about 100 yards up Central Park West road which was handy for free wi-fi and great coffee and food.  The hotel is straight across the street from Central Park and is handy for the underground station on 103st about a 10 minute walk in downtown direction, (turn right as you leave the hotel). Just use the Blue C  Line and make sure you go downstairs once through the station ticket barrier and follow the signs for ""Downtown"" on the level below.  The staff were very helpful and couldn't do";3
A bitter-sweet experience. This commentary refers to the single or double cabins.  CON: -The noise of the A/C unit, whether it's on High or Low, makes the same obnoxious dinning noise.  Wearing earplugs, it faintly sounds like you are on a night flight.  PROS: -If it's anything that would bring you back for the affordable rate and the amenities that match it, is the Rain Shower, ....beautiful! -The loos are clean and quite presentable.  -The two sinks on the marble counter in the bathroom area are nice and clean. -Cafe on the premises. -The Cocktail lounge hall is DECADENT!  (and the grotto-esque bar area). -Staff are pleasant. -Nice flat screen TVs with cable in each room, ... and TWO TVs in the double-bunk rooms.  HEADS-UP! -If you're a man (lucky us), ...have an empty bottle;3
the setting is very special and the view from the bathroom is wonderfull, the room is very small and narrow as if your in a 3th class cabin of an old cruise ship, but convenient, the staf is very friendly and helpfull. The room has no view, and the bar/restaurant doesn't really match with the setting and the atmosphere of the hotel, could be coster.;3
Quality Inns promise a budget friendly price with little to no frills.  On that basis this hotel delivers.  Yes, the hotel is in need of repair, yes, the elevators are small and creaky, and yes, the rooms do have problems.  However, the price reflects this and given that, the hotel is a real value.  The rate is a real bargain.  We paid less than $100/day for our room. Our room was clean and kept up every day.   There are little amenities like a coffeemaker, hair dryer and refrigerator in the room.  Another plus is that the hotel is in a good location, fairly close to the Museum of Natural History as well as Central Park.  Itâs also just one block from the subway, and although located in the upper west side, travel to Times Square is just a mere 10-15 minutes.  On the other hand,;3
Very nice hotel in the heart of Manhattan.The rooms are a bit small and old, but are kind of warm. There are locations from where the view is great - though our room looked in the side of the street. The breakfast that served at the place at the lobby, was really awful.  The overall experience was good but eat breakfast somewhere else.;3
"Good location but no coffee making facilities in room, beds were short for someone 5'10"" or taller, the wardrobe had a safe taking up valuable space so couldn't be used and not deep enough for the hangers and our room with 2 double beds was tiny. The whole place needs new carpers and paint.";3
I paid in advance for 2 rooms on their website.  Most hotels give you extra incentives to reserve online (priority rooms, shoe shines, etc).  However, we were given two rooms literally the size of closets facing another building.  I realize it's a very old building and 'that's NYC'.  But I learned my lesson here - I could have saved lots of $$$ on a discount website but paid hundreds more for no reason at all.  Hair in bath tub and no room service was a surprise too.;3
There wasn't very clear instruction on the Wi-Fi passcode.  I ended up paying for it as the sign-on drop box was wonky.  The front desk apologized after I complained about having to pay for internet.  They credited/gave me breakfast each morning.  Not super fancy.  But boutiquey.  And enough,  Not super hand holding staff...  But I like that.  I don't like to be accosted when I come in.;3
I was petrified about going to this hotel after reading all then reports on here, from clean to bed bugs and creaky lifts. It was our first time in NY and i really thought i was going to a borstal. plesaed with reception which was nicely decorated if a little dated. The staff were okay, i requested a low floor after hearing about the creaky lifts, and when we got there they had put me on 11th floor, after arguing with a lady who said she had nothing else the manager came over and told me i could be on 2nd floor - thank god, as my husbanc used the lifts and they were very scary - rickety, unreliable and very small! room was clean - no bed bugs but i did pull off the dodgy looking blanket, room had 2 queen beds which were very comfortbale. The carpet was very sticky so i wore;3
My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and we loved it! The hotel is perfect if you're staying in New York for a few days. It's next to Central Park and at the top of Broadway so you can just follow the street to find everything! Ricky the receptionist was amazing and really helped us out on what to do and where to go. The hotel is what it is but perfect for a short trip!;3
I reserved a King with a city view using Expedia. Upon arrival, we were booked into 235 (I think the room number was) and it had a view of some trees. I went back to the front desk and asked if we could have a room with a view, since that is what we paid for, and this was the response: When you book with a 3rd party, like Expedia, those are just requested rooms. There is nothing saying you will actually get the type of room you paid for. Well, that is frustrating! He said that for $30 he could upgrade us to a corner king with a city view and he would wave the 2nd nights upgrade fee, and also throw in free WiFi. We wended up doing it and the new room (1457) is great, but buyer beware. You might not get what you paid for, and it might cost you an upgrade fee to get it. The;3
We checked into the Empire on Valentineâs Day, previous to our arrival I requested twice that we have a bathtub in our room and had no response and showed up to a shower in our room.. the shower leaked every time you ran the water and there isnât a shower door which was before baffling to me..   The mini bar in the room was not stocked with drinks, we called down to reception for some cokes to be delivered and an hour later our door knocked for a woman to say there is no cokes in the whole hotel left? Another hour passed and a different lady shows up with one can of coke in her hand.. we let her know that it was now too late as we have taken it upon ourself to go to the shop across the street for our own drinks  Rooftop bar in the hotel is very nice and has a nice atmosphere and;3
1. Old and tired everywhere you looked. 2. Intake staff bored, minimally polite, long lines for no obvious reasons. 3. Long line to check bags into coat room. 4. For nearly $600 a night, the room fixtures seemed quite old and threadworn - and I had the 29th floor Suite!  5. The bathroom was clean, but again old, barely functional fixtures. Shampoos average and cheap, better ones in cheap motels. 6. The AC was just barely adequate - the thermostat claimed 60 degree. It must have been closer to 70, and could not be lowered. 7. No food or drink options as far as I could tell.  ë1. Location. Location. Location. 2. Tick-Tock diner next door for breakfast.;3
"Lili is a disgusting woman! I  dont know how she still works there. She's very unprofessional and feels very entitled. Unnecessarily aggressive even before I even walked up to her and when I checked her and put her in her place to show her you can't talk to me anyhow, she played the ""Karen"" card. Keep a close eye on her. She's not a good representation of The New Yorker AT ALL!";3
Street noise from Columbus was terrible.  Even with earplugs on, it was loud at night.  Staff we excellent.  Food at hotel restaurant was excellent (salmon appetizer, scallop entree). Both highly recommended.  The partial glass shower door - like in many European hotels - didn't provide enough coverage to prevent the bathroom floor from getting wet.  This was annoying.;3
If given the choice, I would not stay here again.  There was construction in the lobby and service was slow.  Check in lines were long at times and elevators did not work at least twice.    Great distance to Universal Studios and breakfast was a plus.    Pool and hot tub area need a face lift next.;3
Used the hotel tonight app to get a last minute room at the empire hotel.  The location is nice and our room on the 7th floor was much quieter than I expected.  The window faced another building and not the street - which helped. Travelers should be aware that the room was tiny.  While the decor was nice, it was hard to even go into the bathroom the space was so tight.  Our room also had no closet - just a tiny alcove with a curtain.  There is a charge for the coffee and tea for the keurig - which is absurd.  The HVAC system is also really old and on one of the hottest nights of the year the room was only cool on the lower half. When we stood up, it was hot.  For one night- just fine but wouldn't recommend for those staying for a few days.;3
I stayed here overnight 5th October 2022 on the way to Hawaii. You can get a shuttle bus on the lower level of the airport. The shuttle bus back stops right outside the main door. The hotel is quite modern in design inside. I did however find the staff cold and unwelcoming. I felt like a number on a conveyer belt with no recognition. This only added to my anxiety as I was travelling on my own! Please make your gusts feel welcome - smile at least.  The room however was amazing and my view was overlooking the airport. I could even see the âLAXâ famous sign from my room. This was only a base for one night and did the job. I found the food and drink very expensive in the hotel. So just made an average tasting coffee in my room. The room was large with a king bed , hard sofa and;3
The hotel location and appearance were excellent.  However, the check in process was awful!  We had to cancel our dinner reservations and almost missed our show time.  If you are coming to this hotel for a show, arrive the day before, not the day of, as check in cannot be guaranteed.  All other aspects of our stay were adequate.;3
The hotel and room itself was nice and clean. I did like the dÃ©cor, too  It's proximity to LAX is definitely a plus. The noise from the airport was not a bother at all - you barely noticed it.  Our biggest issue was the attitudes of every staff member that we encountered. It felt like any time we had a question we were a bother to the staff member we talked with.  Also, the valet service is expensive - $50/night.  They tried to charge us for two days when we acutally only used the service for one day.  It took some time to get that straightened out.  I do not think we would choose this hotel again, simply based on the treatment we received from the staff.  I would rather stay at the Glendale Hyatt, even though it is farther from LAX, because there is where we received excellent;3
"The Wyndham New Yorker has a lot going for it.  It's location literally across the street from Penn Station is very convenient.  The hotel has been renovated since I stayed here about ten years ago, with many of the old art deco features retained.  The lobby is especially nice.  The hotel also has an interesting history which you can read about in a exhibit.  My only complaint, and the reason for my rating, is that I was charged a mandatory $27 ""resort fee"" for services that I didn't use such as wi-fi.  I don't think this was disclosed when I made my reservation through a hotel booking website and had no option but to pay the fee.  I think the only way a mandatory resort fee can be justified is if it's at an actual resort, for example, in Hawaii, not in New York City.";3
Large art deco hotel.  Conveniently located across the street from Penn Station. 24 hour dinner in hotel was great for breakfast. Arrived early and had to wait to check in.  I was told at the registration desk that they had upgraded my room.  When check in time arrived I was told they took the upgrade away. My grandson and I went to our room, which was the smallest hotel room I was ever in.  The view from the window was a brick wall.  My grandson turned on the TV and it didn't work. I called the desk and they told me to come back down and they gave us a different room. The new room was a lot bigger and the TV worked.  The staff were very nice.  The added on resort fee and taxes  brought the price of one night to $300. It's NYC and all the hotels are pricey.  The location was;3
This hotel is an affortable hotel in expensive Manhattan. Its location is close to subway lines and many good restaurants. Except for just remodelled business rooms on the top two floors most of the rooms look worn out. Hallways can be very hot in the summer, making you sweat while waiting for the elevators. Also, one of the elevators does not work most of time. Overall, if you dono' want to spent too much for hotels, this hotel will work for you.;3
Positives: Fantastic location. The shower pressure is amazing considering we were on the 25th floor. Not a long wait for lifts. Hand gel/sanitiser at each floor. They even have a 'museum'/ 'memorabilia' collection in the basement for famous moments from the hotel's history but it is not really advertised.  Negatives: Definitely feels like a has-been hotel - we stayed in the room next to the one where Muhammad Ali stayed which was a pleasant surprise! But otherwise the hotel has definitely had its hay-day. The place is in need of a complete renovation - new paint/ carpet etc. Whats more we stayed during storm Henri and had water dripping from the celling/wall (see pictures). Told the front desk and they said someone would come and have a look, 10 minutes later front desk called;3
My little brother and I stayed at the Days Hotel Broadway In NYC for one week from July 1-9 2006. We stayed on the second floor and I have to say it wasnt the nicest floor. The elevator missed our floor the second day we were there and we noticed the floor above it were much cleaner and more well maintained. The room was not the best but hey.....we weren't there to be in the hotel room anyway and yes....it smelled a little and yes....but i did not see one insect and our room was cleaned, I should be us to the ghetto being from East Los Angeles..... beds were made and everything was left extra clean and tidy by the time we got back from running around trying to get laid, checking out the NYC sights and the NYC girls. The locations was great. the 1, 2, and 3 subway station is;3
Top location mid town where you want to be. The rooms are clean if not a little tired. If you ride the lifts you will notice a number of the floors have been turned over to some form of student hostel / university accommodation. Which whilst nothing against students seeing pad locked Room doors from  the lift is not what you expect from a 4  Star Hotel. Effectively not a 4 star hotel when compared to other 4 star hotels I have stayed in in New York it is cheaper than the others I have stayed in but not by much.  Overall good location and clean;3
I visited this hotel as part of a school trip in February 2016. My first impression was that it was very old - definitely needed a redesign! The lifts were old and quite creaky. In the room the TV was old and not the best quality but I suppose in the inner city you won't have much time to watch it! The bathroom was small but seemed to be okay (at first)!!  Throughout our stay things began to reveal themselves to us. For example the shower was never a good temperature. The temperature went from boiling hot to freezing cold every ten seconds or so leaving you with 2/3 seconds of tolerable water at a time, despite how hot you have the temperature set! After speaking to my friends, this was the same in their rooms too and was unbelievably irritating! Secondly, our toilet wouldn't;3
Considering we did not use any amenities and used the room to sleep in this review will be based on cleanliness, location and breakfast. Great price to stay near highways, sunset strip and Hollywood. Very close to Griffiths Park and Observatory. Hotel also included a hot made to oder daily breakfast. The room was clean, spacious and bed was comfortable. The actual location of the hotel seemed a bit questionable but we were able to park our car in a gated area inside hotel lot for $22.00 per day. All in all if all your looking for is a decent, clean and affordable place to sleep while sight seeing this is the place for you.;3
This is a very well located hotel. Generally getting old and run down in appearance and decor but value for money as LA hotels are expensive. Pretty much a $10 Ã¼ber to anywhere from this location. WiFi worked well, service was great. Gym is not much at all, Golds Hollywood is $5 away. Glendale Galleria is $10 and worth a visit for shoppers.;3
The only reason I am marking this hotel as average instead of poor is because the management was nice enough to upgrade our room for no additional cost when we were first placed in an EXTREMELY old hotel room/floor. From what I can tell, half the building (or less) is renovated while the other half is not. They typically charge more per night to be on the renovated floors which is ridiculous given how much the non-renovated rooms already cost. The non-renovated floors look like old office buildings and the rooms are unacceptable with the faucets making loud noises, etc. I would not recommend staying here unless you are willing to spend more to make sure you have a renovated room. The area is good if you want easy access to penn station but because of that is extremely busy and;3
Never been to a hotel without coffee pot or coffee.   I have now.   Housekeeping doesn't keep coffee on the cart.    Have to call front desk for coffee daily. And ask for coffee pot.   All vents need cleaning badly.   Location is great for site seeing.  The hotel does need upgrading with decor.  The door men were helpful.  The front desk people answered our questions but had no personality.   I would probably stay again but would try to get reservations somewhere else.;3
Smells of smoke on some floors and rooms. Very outdated needs an uplift but clean and great location. Was there for my 50th Birthday and didnât get off to a good start due to having to change rooms due to smoke smell;3
Yes, you get 50% off room size (expect a tiny room, mabye 100sqf), 50% off tv size (mine was aprox 27 inch), 50% off service (we had to carry our four bags ourselves, no room service), 50% off room amenities (NO fridge inside the room, but yes, al least you have a safe box).  What gives a three star? Only location, a block away from MSG and Penn, and Macy's... Also, if you go expecting to see an Art Deco historical place, please, look for another Hotel. You will only find an old Hotel with no service at all.....;3
We booked this hotel three months ago through trailfinders. After a long trip from London we arrived early on a Sunday evening to be told there was no booking for us.With further investigation it appeared they had the dates wrong and our rooms were not made up.We then were asked to remain in the lobby for nearly an hour while they prepared the rooms.The helpful Louis promised us a room upgrade in the morning. We had a double and our adult daughters had a double double.Our room was tiny and overlooked a grotty courtyard with many noisy air conditioners which resulted in no sleep that night. The following morning I spoke to a very grumpy Pasquale who had no handover notes of what our predicament had been and told us these were our rooms so get on with it. Later that day I met;3
Walking into to the hotel we thought we had booked a 5 star hotel instead of a 3 star.  Check in was very easy.  We got to our room - so disappointed in it - very poky room for 3 ladies - only 2 beds.  We didn't mind sharing the bed but we had asked for a triple room.  Breakfast was served next door in a diner but it was excellent and we were served by the same host every morning - he was brilliant.  - would recommend the hotel but if booking a triple room make sure it is a large room.;3
We came for a short visit to NYC, just 3 nights. Morningside inn did the job perfectly. We rate it 3*- one for great location, one for fantastic comfy bed (rock hard!), one for friendly and helpful service. It's very basic, shared bathroom (it has seen better times too and could do with some fresh paint), unreliable hot water, shower handle fell off when in use, internet signal very poor and slow speed. Overall ok, well priced city option.;3
Slow and steady normally wins the race, but for me it was a small L.   I had flown into LGA around 9am and got to the hotel around 1130 thanks to heavy traffic and side street adventures, so by the time I arrived they were clearing out the rooms.  I stored my luggage and walked around the area to get lunch and mingle with friends. Shopping in the W70s is great, I wouldn't recommend taking a cab since it's nearly impossible to flag one down at certain times. Location wise it's nice you can definitely walk at a slow pace here.  By the time I returned it was 1pm, surely they had something available, but they told me no and I sat in the tiny lobby for an hour!! Even though I sat and watched her check someone in ahead of me. The rooms are great, kind of roomy really, the one;3
Check-in welcome was miserable & as flight got in late we couldn't have 2 rooms on same floor let alone next to each other! Think we had what is called a metro room for 3 people it was very small & totally outdated however, it was clean & beds comfy. Location was great for Penn Station Sub, Macy's & Empire State. It was pricey for what you got so I'd look to stay somewhere different if I go again!;3
They have a lot of rooms. Their hotel is not bad but the area especial the restaurants in from like Mc Donalds is so iffy. I arrived late and was so hungry so I have to cross there.  But the hotel in general is ok;3
Stayed here while in New York for 3 nights. This place grew on me over them days.  At first my impression was bad, nice decor downstairs in lobby however the room was so so small that suitcase didn't fit in properly when we was both in the room, the bathroom was very dated and the old fittings hadn't even been removed when changed. Was quite dirty too.  However as the days went on I loved the diner located inside the hotel and the staff were nice too especially when we had an issue in our room it was sorted out almost instantly.  Good location however I was concerned about how safe it was around there.;3
Pros:  the hotel is well situated for sight seeing.  It is also well priced, with a friendly staff and a plentiful breakfast option for not much money.  Cons:  the room was quite dumpy, with a fairly poorly constructed mattress.  The air conditioner was quite weak.  The wi-fi was terrible, even the paid option.  The breakfast was not particularly well cooked or seasoned. And vitally, the hot water for the entire hotel shut off for almost 24 hours, right during shower times.;3
I usually stay at the Empire for business and convenient location - not for the Gossip Girl appeal. The amount of people in the lobby is always annoying. However, they can usually give me an early check in which is convenient if arriving from an overnight flight. The room is on the small side but of a good layout and normal for NYC. The inconveniences this last stay were erratic water temperature in the shower and lack of a kettle - no ability yo make a cup of tea!;3
I booked the hotel through online travel agency, the rating is excellent. However my experience is not as good as I expected. The room is clean, I have double bed. Breakfast is complimentary, free WiFi. The one that surprise me the parking is not free for the guest. I paid about $12/day which is supposed to be free for guest. The breakfast staff is not friendly and very intimidating. Though, location is good, it is nearby several restaurant, about 20mins to Universal Studio and about 15mins to Hollywood Walk of Fame.;3
The Abercorn House is located in Hammersmith. The underground station isn't far away. It takes about 10-20 minutes by tube to get to the main attractions of London.   It can get really noisy in the morning (cleaners, other travellers and construction work). Even in the evening, you can hear people slamming doors.   We had a double bed room. It was nothing special, but enough space for 2 people. One cockroach was spotted! But it wasn't a big deal for us. Hehe.  The flush in the toilets was very weak. And the shower rooms were fairly clean.  There is no entertainment such as TV in the room. And WiFi was only available for 1Â£ per hour. We managed to go to some local pubs that offered free internet..;3
This is my first time staying at this hotel, the only thing that creeped me out was the elevator which is small and makes you feel claustrophobic. However the room was clean, I am glad I received one of the updates rooms which was perfect. It's in walking distance to stores, eateries and train station. I loved it. I would definitely stay again.;3
Very affordable hotel in great part of Manhatten. Wireless access was not in the room, but you have to go down into the basement which was a pain. Bathroom was very clean. There is no coffee maker in the room, but there is a fridge. I don't recommend this for a business stay, but if you don't care about amenities, I would recommend it.;3
My family and I stayed there for the survivor season finale. The hotel is beautiful, clean, modern, and has excellent service. The down side was that the couch bed in our room, there was dirt and crumbs on it and the blanket was nasty. When they brought me new linens they handed them to me at the door, and I had to change them myself. Other than that staff was really friendly, the gift shop is wonderful and it is right across the street from the universal studios.;3
Stayed there with my husband for 6 nights.  We checked in early and was happy that they had a room ready for us.  Great location as it is just across the street from Penn station and within walking distance from Broadway.  Was disappointed that the breakfast special they had was only available on-line and that we could not use it anymore after we have checked in. (I saw it on their website and thought that I would organize it when we arrived at the hotel.  Unfortunately did not work out like that so we did not have breakfast at the hotel at all.) The queen room that we had was very small, but comfortable enough.  Good bed.  The bathroom was also very small and had very little space to pack out anything. The big shock came when we checked out.  We received a invoice for daily;3
The Hotel is just on the corner of 94th street onto Broadway, though do not think it is in the middle of the action, as it is a good 4 km from dowtown humdrum. This is a good base if you want to be somewhere quiet to relax after a hard day sight seeing. Central park is 1km east. The Metro line 1,2,3,4, is just on the corner so a metro card is a good addition. There is no bar or relaxing area, but the a 40inch TV connects you with the Newyork atmosphere. The draw backs are, 4 6 person lifts, one which broke down frequently, a long wait to got to any floor, if you are on the 11,12, floors then this can become tiresome. Hot water is tepid! The King bedroom was well equiped, and very clean. Staff though are friendly, and helpfull. Breakfast can be bought across the road or opposite;3
We stayed here for 4nights for a girls night. The hotel is in an OK location. The  reason for 3 stars is the service.  When we checked in early they said that they did have a room available but it would cost us $50 to get into it. I've stayed in hotels all over never heard of that. My sister called the reservations department and they told her that that is not true a fee should not have been charged. Also, to hold our luggage they charged $5 per luggage. As we didn't use anything at the hotel the $29 a night was also pointless, not like Vegas where your using a pool, gym, etc. The rooms are very outdated.;3
I needed to crash for 1 night in NYC and was arriving at midnight, so this hotel seemed ok. Affordable. However, I was immediately worried when I was offered the opportunity to inspect my room before deciding to stay! I went up and had a look and the room was as basic as you can get - basically a bed and a dressing table, showers down the hall. The bed seemed clean and I was to be out in a few hours so I decided to stay. However, when I went to get into the bed I noticed the sheets were stained. That was it for me unfortunately. I slept on top of the bed with my clothes on. I would not recommend this accommodation. The rooms and showers really need refurbished.;3
Go to my Instagram page for pics at firstclass001. After staying here for 2weeks I have a few things to say:  Pros: You can't beat it's location. Nice bedding  Great bathroom toiletries  Staff are mostly friendly  Regency club lounge  Airport shuttle  Cons: If you are a Hyatt member no recognition nor appreciation shown by staff for your loyalty.  Screwed up room reservations at checkin with poor follow up. I had to insist and request compensation for their unacceptable mistake.  If you ship a parcel to the hotel good luck in getting it. Disorganized mail room is an understatement.   Regarding club lounge with little to no variety each day.  Parking is costly and a nuisance to use.  I would not stay here more than one night.   I've seen and experienced much better Regency club;3
"The Jane is a great rate in a great location in a great city, but the rooms are so tiny you can barely move. If there are 2 of you in the bunk bed room, forget it. One of you has to leave the room so the other one can turn around.  Pack soft luggage so you can stow it under the bed or hang it on the hooks that serve as the ""closet.""  Bring a good toiletry kit because you have to carry everything to and from the shower and bathroom. Stay here if you are on a budget or adventurous.";3
Our family vacationed in LA for five days and stayed at the Hilton, mainly due to its close proximity to Universal Studio/theme park and City Walk.  Being able to walk to the attractions in five minutes was a plus as well as drive to other popular areas in 20 minutes. The highlights of the hotel are the outdoor heated swimming pool(which the kids enjoyed just about everyday), Candace at the Transportation and Tours desk(she is a wealth of information), and the Vroom package(a great deal if you need a rental car). While the hotel/restaurant have done a great job hiring friendly and service-oriented employees, they have missed the mark on keeping the hotel updated.  The rugs throughout the hotel either need to be cleaned or replaced, the paint/glaze on our bathtub was peeling in a;3
"I was here for a seminar, so I didnât choose the hotel. Big pluses: comfortable rooms, deco design, pleasant and helpful staff. Negative: itâs an awful neighborhood and taxis are hard to get since people leaving Penn Station grab them first. The Tick Tock Diner claims to be the largest diner in NYC; itâs certainly the archetype.";3
We had a good five night stay at the hotel in September 2012.Its away from the hustle and bustle of downtown manhattan,so, much quieter at night. The room had clean bedding,towels and a newly renovated bathroom.If you're on a budget and plan on being out and about until late every evening,this is the place for you. We had breakfast at the deli a couple of streets away,good cheap food with free WIFI! Used the subway during peak hour to and from JFK,easy commute and a two minute walk to the hotel.  Will definitely stay again.;3
This hotel is a mixed bag.  Convienent to Lincoln Center and all the things one would want, but everything is a la carte.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept well.  The room is super small by even NYC standards and it is cluttered with things for you to buy - you even have to pay for your first morning cup of coffee ($3) in the Keurig provided.  Virtually every space is covered with things - it was almost impossible to put my iPad anywhere to work.  Every outlet has somethign plugged into it so it was difficult to plug in devices unless you wanted to sit them on the floor.  One word of warning about the lobby bar - they put a 20% fee on the tab and then still have a line for gratuity - I almost missed it.  All in all, this was an ok stay - I travel a great deal and this;3
Stayed at the 2nd floor, couldnât find a safety box ( I told the friendly staff and they promised to fix it twice maybe it was well hidden). The toilette was broken but fixed. The room where in a desperate need for a renovation at least some new paint. The hotel is really close to Central Park if you like a walk or run in the morning. Personally I prefer Hudson hotel instead.;3
I went to this hotel with my partner for 4 days, room okay but no kettle to make tea or coffee which was a disappoint as most hotels have this was advised  when booking the pool would be open that's why we booked the hotel in the first place but to our disappointment it was closed, when checking out we never got asked if wee enjoyed our stay, just took our key.;3
Its a nice hotel, not too much going on, close to Universal studios.  We stayed here for 3 nights in Jan.  Its an ok hotel.  The rooms are good size, the service is welcoming and warm... but its not gonna set the world a blaze... That said, its very good value for money.  We arrived in the morning with a hire car from LAX.  The concierge took care of the car and unloaded our bags, its was done politely and professionally.;3
This hotel is basic & in need of modernisation. The rooms are a good size but the bathrooms are poor. The hotel is not centrally located however it's well located for buses & metro links. It is only 4 stops on the metro to Central Hollywood where the Chinese Theatre & Hall of Fame is located. The staff at the reception were really friendly & helpful. Breakfast was included however basic with long queues for egg station as only 1 cook. On the 3 days we were their they ran out of pastries each day;3
Usually the service is seamless and the rooms are clean with everything working..  However recently there are problems at late evening check in where World of Hyatt expedited check in is not available.  I have had to wait in line behind people with complex problems who take more than a half hour to finish their business while my check in takes 2 minutes at most. As a tired traveler with only a few hours to sleep before getting back to the airport, this is upsetting. On this visit the room was not as clean as usual and the phone was not working.;3
We stayed here for five nights in room 4003 which is a one bedroom queen suite on the top (40th) floor. We chose the Wyndham as it was cheaper than some other options  Pros: - great location couple of blocks from the Empire State and Times Square and in walking distance of Central Park and the restaurants on 9th Avenue. - great view of downtown and the Freedom Tower (from our room). - great adjoining diner (Tick Tock) which is open 24 hours and provides does room service.  Cons: - Slowest lifts/elevators in the world! - Limited hotel staff on hand - don't expect anyone to help to get your bags from the kerb to your room. - Rooms are quite old (but functional). - Limited in room facilities - no kettle and just a random coffee machine which we didn't use!  Would stay again...;3
Had just spent three nights at the Park Vue, Anaheim, before switching to the Hilton. Park Vue had more comfortable beds and pillows, bigger TV screens, free WiFi, free breakfast, many low cost restayrants in walking distance, and free parking. The Hilton had a nicer bathroom and a bigger bedroom witha nicer parking lot view. The desk & phone staff were short and unhelpful. The concierges were nice.;3
The big stuff Elefant of my daughter (which she used as pillow for years with an very emotional value)disappeared out of the room. The front desk were friendly and appologized. They said, I have not to worry about. But that`s it, I heard nothing from the front desk or security, if they find something out. I almost had to demand and the last day it was finished without any result. I got nothing as a consolation or apology.  Further we were very disappointed that the pooldeck was closed. The pooldeck was one of the decicive reason why we book your Hotel in summer. Our last day we got a breakfast voucher for compensation.;3
Third time staying here.  The first two times were better, though this one was not bad...just very average.  Rooms are on the small side. Bed linens were lacking, IMO.  No top sheet, just a duvet cover and no real mattress pad. No extra blankets either so it was a little cold overnight. The windows leak lots of cold air so glad that there were insulated window treatments to cover them.  The room did not seem vacuumed when we arrived.  Overall not a terrible stay, just average.  Glad that I found a discounted rate, would not have been pleased at full price.;3
This is my second visit to The New Yorker. I think I booked more as it held very sentimental memories of my first ever visit and this Rhine I was lucky enough to bring my daughter and was excited to show her bits of fond memories. The first being when I was 21 and I am now 37. nothing has changed at all.  The room itself was very clean and comfortable.  We were 4 in a room and it was tiny. We had no where to hang our clothes so had to live out of our cases which was also hard as there was no where to put them! Didnât spoil our time as we literally only slept there.  Location is brilliant and the pizza place across the road is amazing!!! My issue was with the staff on reception. Clueless and rude come to mind. Iâve been Charged the equivalent of Â£15 for a bottle of water which I;3
The Hilton Universal City is a bustling property that was filled to capacity at the time of our stay.  It was a bit maddening for my taste.  Room needed updating and smelled of smoke, despite the no-smoking policy.  The staff at the hotel is wonderful and do their utmost to ensure a good stay.  Excellent variety at breakfast with an equally excellent wait staff.;3
Stayed 4 days at the New Yorker...small room by our standards but well appointed but you had to pay extra daily for a tea/coffee machine in your room.  Great location to Penn Station, hop on hop off bus route.  Very clean and comfortable bed.;3
Bathrooms are very small and inconvenient   Bring your shower cap for the overhead shower.  The lighting in the room is poor. Beds comfortable . Location very good for uptown location. Staff very pleasant. Rooms very soundproof;3
"I most always try to see a silver lining but so far our stay here has not been good.    1.  I'd phoned ahead by a week, confirmed our stay and me toned that our flight would arrive close to midnight -- so our check-in would be very late.  We had prepaid via Priceline.  Lo and behold our purchased nonsmoking king was no longer available when we arrived; we were out into an old nonsmoking full bed room and I spent most of the night praying for no bedbugs.  The carpet was filthy and pulled away from the tack board.    2.  We were told to leave that room in the morning, checks our bags with the bell captain and return after noon to get our king room.  We did so, and then returned at 2:45 pm. Checked in and couldn't get into our new room -- housekeeping was still in there.  We were";3
Aside from not being let into our room, because my brother failed to put my name in his reservation, when we got back to the hotel, 3 elevators were broken, and we had to walk 1 flight up to the service elevator! Our room was nice. The people working there were nice and Jeff the porter was especially nice!;3
Well, I didn't read reviews about this hotel because I assumed it was just a last-minute special. After I paid for my trip and got on here, I was nervous to say the least. Well, it wasn't horrible. I am a New York enthusiast (plan to live there in 5 years), and just needed to go back for a couple of days. This was a good experience to get away from the usual tourist traps surrounding the Midtown area. The area is primarily resedential and quite charming. The room was definitely nothing to write home about, but it was good to call home and have a quick laugh! Just don't forget to bring your toilet paper into the bathroom, because there certainly isn't a backup supply. A word of advice, bring your own backup pillow. And some sleeping pills. The matress was awful! The pillow needed;3
"My sisters and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights during our California vacation at the end of June 2005.  Other than the pool being closed for renovations, we had no problems.  The location is absolutely great!  It was very easy to get to the major highways and there's a Metro station about a minute away.  We were worried about the ""noisy nightclub"" that we'd read about in other TripAdvisor reviews of this hotel, but we slept soundly and noise-free every night.  The buffet breakfast was waffles, eggs, sausage and fruit.  It wasn't 5-star dining but it wasn't bad either.  This Ramada was a great value for a hotel near Hollywood and Universal Studios!  I'd stay at the Ramada Hollywood again.";3
stayed Dec 2018 loved everything about this hotel, stayed again Jan 2020 and the only thing we enjoyed was our room, service was minimal at best no communication between departments, made to feel like an inconvenience more than a guest. Sent in an email to Wyndham and was basically told I would be better off contacting the hotel directly so pretty much passed the buck. I figured my concerns would fall on deaf ears and I was correct;3
I stayed 4 nights at this hotel by myself and was sceptical given the reviews... The concierge was pleasant at check in, given it was 1am in the morning and I was given a room on the 6th floor and handed a piece of paper with details of the wifi codes.  I took the elevator to the floor and it was a challenge to find my room, the hallway was dimly lit and the numbering was all over but eventually I found it. Upon entering my room the air conditioning was on full blast so it was freezing and the radio had been left on, there were 2 double beds and other furniture, a closet and the bathroom was tiny, you tripped over the toilet to get to the bath.  I noticed the window blinds were broken and the curtains did not draw and were just for show, I immediately called reception and asked;3
This is the hostel I usually stay in when in London. When I first stayed here maybe 5-6 years ago, it had recently been renovated and was the best and cheapest hostel (better than all budget hotels too) in London. Now it's starting to need a new renovation, especially the private bathrooms. Still better than most hostels though.   But they have nice, comfy beds and all linen and towels included. And an in-room fridge which is really good since they don't have breakfast. And they have no full carpets âºï¸ (which I find disgusting to have in a hotel) And there has been something new every time I get there (the reception area has been changed, a cafÃ© is added and has been expanded, and so on). I just wish they had 3-beds rooms as we are usually 3 friends going.   It's just a couple;3
Just returned from a visit to Washington and New York where we stayed at the Empire Hotel for five nights. The location is very good close to Central Park and the Columbus and Lincoln Metro stations, The staff at reception were friendly and efficient, and Chris the concierge was extremely helpful at advising about places to visit and how to get there, His advice on the best bagel place Midtown was spot on! The downside of the hotel is that it is rather dark and tired. There is a preponderance of dark browns both in the rooms and in the lobby which can become rather depressing especially when your room looks out on to a central well and is overlooked by other rooms. Our room was rather small but probably similar size to other similar hotels in New York where space is at a;3
The hotelâs location is very central, right across from the street from Madison Square Garden. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, i found a few staff members to be lazy and rude. Both times I stayed in the New Yorker, the transportation manager (John?) who booked cabs for guests spoke to all guests, not just me, with sheer arrogance. Upon booking my taxi by card, he literally *threw* it across the counter back at me. Any small questions I asked were answered with a tone that he was being inconvenienced by simply having to do his job. In a nutshell, he was full of his own self-importance.;3
My husband and I stayed here in early November. The location is across from Lincoln Center, a subway stop and a bus line.  Couldn't be better for getting around town.   Liked the fact that we weren't in the mix/near Times Square and could escape to a real neighborhood. Lots of really good restaurants.  Cafe Ronda on Columbus Ave ROCKS!   Didn't have much interaction with the staff except check in and check out, but they were competent and friendly enough.   The shower is CRAZY!  Be sure to check to see which way the hand held is facing before turning it on.  Our last day nearly flooded the bathroom.   One thing that I found annoying, was that ice could only be gotten through room service. Silly if you ask me!  The hotel stay was a gift from a friend and they Pricelined it so I;3
We paid for upgrades and did not get them. The park was advertising to be open until 8 pm but closed for a private party at 6pm..(no big deal, unless you are ten years old and this is the trip of a lifetime and you have already been kicked out of your hotel room by a grumpy older sister((who was rightfully grumpy when the hotel âswappedâ our original rooms)). I (me alone) worked for years to take my family on the perfect trip, I felt like every step of the way eroded away at our ability to over look the small stuff. A burnt burger (not edible)from the hotel is no big deal usually, unless the cost of that burger is 2 hours of pay (before taxes).  No big deal to pay extra for bigger seats (unless the seats are actually the same size) for $380 round trip.  It should have been tough;3
Me and my partner came here   Got a good deal and tried the upper westside. Friendly staff to be fair. Lift was as slow which was annoying. The corner cafe next door was good tho so worth popping in for breakfast. Was good for the price.  Didnât like the snoop dog look a like in the reception area. Was there everyday in the same leather jacket and sat in the same place eye balling everyone .. funny;3
"If you're expecting a luxury hotel on the upper west side, Days Inn isn't for you. If you're looking for affordable lodging in an amazing neighborhood, this is the place.  Pros: Location, location, location, room is decent size and price.  Cons: Doorman smokes non-stop in front of building, despite NY's ""20 feet from door"" law. Basic cable only on TV. Elevator slow.  But it's a good half/price less than any other decent hotel I've found in the city, and you don't have to share a bathroom.";3
"My husband and I stayed here for a one night getaway.  I'll start off with the positive.  The location is prime.  The decor & atmosphere are hip & trendy.  The staff were welcoming & friendly.  And contrary to other posts, we found it to be clean. Sadly, upon check-in, we were sent to our room (superior king) only to find it occupied and sounded like someone was vomiting.  We immediately returned to the front desk & told them what happened.  The staff seemed baffled, but remedied the situation quickly by giving us an upgrade to another room.  We could have done without the cigarette smell permeating throughout the floor; we actually were shocked that smoking was still allowed in hotels.  Overall, not too shabby, but not sure if we would return.";3
"This was or second stay at this particular Hilton. When we stayed here, two years ago, we were told at checkin that the hotel was ""sold out"" and they weren't able to give us the type of room we reserved (two double or queen beds). We ended up with a single king size bed for my wife and me, and our two kids. They brought in a single cot but later took it away, saying it was a fire hazard. So, we took turns sleeping on the couch.   When we checked in this time, we were given a room on the second floor (two floors down from the lobby). It was dark, depressing and literally faced the loading dock and dumpsters. When we asked to change rooms, we were told that we had booked a ""handicapped-accessible room"" and that all of those rooms were on the second floor...and they were ""sold";3
We were there for a single night. The room was clean and basic and Manhattan small as expected. Our room had zero view the window looked out to a flat roof and brick parapit..  Bathroom was small but clean.  Again nice clean and completely average.  Would stay again.;3
We literally just stayed here between flights since it was close to the airport.  The staff is very welcoming and nice.  The room is okay--but once again I am a very picky hotel person especially when it comes to the bathroom.  There was no hand or bath soap so we ended up having to call for it which I found a little odd as this is probably the first time I have ever had to request it in all our travels.  The great thing about this place is it has a 24 hour market place for food and drinks which is perfect if you have an early or late flight or just need warm milk for the baby!;3
We had read that this was a nice rooftop spot for cocktails. Unfortunately we were greeted by a relatively hostile seeming bouncer at the door. Once at the top the server was very nice, but the locale needed much sprucing up. The martini was huge mind you and the gypsy music that was playing was excellent. Mixed review at best!;3
The shower design is not very good. Extremely tight. There was no second door or shower curtain to avoid water coming out.  The air conditioner wasn't working very well. It looked like an inferno.  The location is very good.;3
Just back from 4 days at the new Yorker hotel.Check in was great no probs, lady at desk was great, quick & helpful,Room was on 36th floor with some great views over new York, 6 lifts only 2 working(being updated soon)witch resulted in queueing & long waits especially morning time(so allow more time). The Room was very small but adequate for time were there. The bed was very comfortable clean & tidy with good house keeping every day. We only slept & washed as out all day & night. We used Tic tock dinner for breakfast as it was convenient But tasty with a typical New York menu or what ever you wanted & coffee refills.The hotel is OLD & dated & in need of renovation but don't let that put you off. The LOCATION is wonderful if you're visiting New York city with all big attractions;3
Remodeled rooms are too small. Older rooms are better but not always having the feel of clean. Canât beat location if working near Penn Station or mid-town Manhattan. Also, hotel impresses on security.;3
I think it would be hard to beat the location of this hotel.  The subway is a 2 min walk from the hotel providing access to main tourist sites.  Itâs also not far from Times Square on foot.   The hotel seems to undergoing some upgrades.  I paid for a room upgrade and they offered a city view room on their âexecutive floorâ. Given the shape of the hotel, the view was actually a brick wall.  However, if you stood at the window and looked to the side you could see a few buildings.   The room and bathroom were small but housekeeping was efficient and the rooms were cleaned daily.;3
I should be grateful about the location, but talking about the customer service given by the receptionist was really poor, Is the first hostel I ever stayed with a grumpy receptionist. Paying extra for WIFI c'mon it's ridiculous.;3
It is like dead end of the park location.. and it is pretty big park.. when you are planning to use underground ok if you go with taxi.. better just pay more for hotel closer to Time Squere..and you can walk around  Room is tiny even smaller then it seems on photo because it is filled with your body! :D and if you are two..not much space for luggage .. Air was so dusty l don't know if its hotels problem or  whole NY is just one big dust bin?People say you don't spend much time there so it doesn't matter how nice  room you get..true (we came always after midninght or 2am)but then you need to feel comfy.l just couldn't breath (and my Astma was bit problem-before we came was ok my man is healthy and couldn't stand that dust too) So l didn't sleep well and we spent all days walking;3
Very good location in a friendly part of manhattan, close to the metro and in walking distance to central park. Rooms clean and quiet. Elevator is slow and always with a queue as the hotel is a bit crowded. Internet did not work for 3 days and nobody seemed to care about it. Ugly and partly sexistic (in front of the elevator on 14 th floor)  fotographs on the walls. Price is too high for the standard but thats manhattan.;3
Great location - short walk to central park, subways and not too far from Midtown. Very aesthetically pleasing with inviting earthy tones. Loved the very friendly staff, everyone greeted each time we went in and out of the hotel. Exciting to see the hotel for Gossip Girl fans and they still even have the 'Chuck Bass' cocktail at the lobby bar. Room was a bit smaller than expected, but was nice and clean. We booked a standard and my friend and I shared a queen bed and were also only given one room key? Bathroom was clean and tidy, not too small. No in room free wifi which was disappointing (and quite frankly very dated) as the hotel advertises free wifi. Free wifi can only be found in the lobby or rooftop bar. As a result of this when internet is slow as lots of people using it;3
The rooms at the Empire are small and in need of updating, and rooms on the 11th floor are miserably hot with no solution. We moved to a lower floor. Quiet and clean. We could only get internet in the lobby (although no prob using internet on the phone). Friendly, knowledgeable staff.;3
"We visited this hotel as part of a short break to New York. The plus points being it is in a convenient position for Times Square and very clean. The minus points are, the rooms are small,with no tea or coffee making facilities, when we returned from a days sightseeing,we asked at reception if we could purchase a cup of tea or coffee and we we were told that ""there is complementary tea and coffee on offer at breakfast time"" ! The air conditioning in our room was extremely loud (good job I had taken ear plugs). The receptionists who we dealt with were not very helpful and rather obnoxious-something which we have never experienced on previous trips to the states. The doormen were totally different and were really helpful and charming especially Jeff- maybe they should be on";3
"The location of the hotel at 63rd near the Lincoln Center was great.  Easy walking distance to Time Square, Central Park and shopping provided you are up to it!  The regular Queen room we had was cramped - certainly no bigger than rooms in small Paris hotels.   The shower was only 31"" wide and the sliding glass door part was missing so it was impossible to keep water off the bathroom floor.  The sink and toilet were also crammed into a very small space.  In room conveniences like bottled water, coffee etc. were all quite expensive - $3 for a Keurig coffee (but the Starbucks was right around the corner) and $7.50 for the Fiji water. Bath towels were nice and fluffy but really, single ply toilet paper!   The lobby area was quite busy at times, with friendly staff and a bowl of";3
Nice Hotel but its getting old and it seems like nobody cares about the conditions. The Sounds of the climaconditions are terrible... nearly no long sleep possible. Take a room with look to the streets!;3
"We stayed here 3 nights in August with our 10-year-old. Overall, a pleasant stay. Hotel is very nicely decorated and feels very ""New York"". The location was perfect - a quiet little spot with a Starbucks around the corner and excellent shopping at Columbus Circle within walking distance.   We stayed on the 9th floor in a room that was far from spectacular. It was small (not a big deal), but the bathroom was horrible. Zero counter space and the shower was super tiny. One day we didn't have hot water, no shower curtain - water everywhere. Not the most family-friendly bathroom at all.  On the first night, our air conditioner didn't work, so we told the front desk. They sent an engineer and it worked beautifully the rest of the stay.  Getting to the pool was very strange and the";3
Hotel location was perfect for our needs however being an older hotel, windows are double-hung, single pane and had little to no weather stripping. This resulted in a very noisy and cool evening since it seemed like the windows were open and the typical NY traffic was constant all night long. A good upgrade to the windows in this facility, particularly on the lower floors may increase my rating of this venue. Other than that, rooms were typical NY style (small) but comfortable and generally an ok stay for the one night we were there. If we stayed longer, we would have been exhausted by day three.;3
This was our 2nd stay, the first being about a year ago. The location is very convenient, close to family we were visiting. I had asked for a room like we had last year on one of the renovated upper floors but none was available.  We had a room on the 9th floor which was old looking but turned out to be ok. The bed was comfortable, A/C fairly quiet, and bathroom clean and presentable. Hot water took some time to come up but once it did, it stayed hot.    For NYC the hotel is a decent value compared to the much higher costs of better hotels. But there are trade-offs you should be aware of.  The hotel is run down looking. Hall carpet torn here and there, past water leaks evident, walls heavily scuffed and patched up in places. TV had just a few over the air channels with grainy;3
For 13 floors of rooms there are only two working elevators! Housekeeping staff must use these as well. In fact, the service elevator has a permanent sign stating it is temporarily out of service (has been there at least a year). If you stay on the 13th floor (PH) then only one of the two elevators is available to you. In previous trips during the summer and fall it was not uncommon to wait 15 or 20 minutes to get an elevator going up or down. During our last stay (Feb) we caught rides much quicker most likely because there were fewer people staying there. The rooms are clean, the water is usually hot, the sheets are comfortable, and the towels plush. Theupgraded rooms are the only ones we have stayed in. The rooms are quite small. Great location to subway station and good;3
Small room and very small bathroom. Reception gives a feel of 1960s which is different (the only thing I liked) but I would recommend staying in a newer hotel as the prices are similar but the amenities will be better than this hotel. I guess my expectations were too high with it as I liked watching the tv series where it was featuredl! Won't stay here again. Also the wifi even it is paid is too slow. I used to go to nearby starbucks to use internet.;3
I stayed at The New Yorker on 8th Avenue New York City when visiting to attend the AES convention at the Javits Center.  It was very convenient for this as the Convention Center is a short walk away from the hotel.  The hotel is also just a 2 minute walk from Penn Station and also right by the 34th Street Subway Station, making it a very accessible Hotel.  Built in 1929 it has an art-deco feel in places but the rooms are in need of a good refurbishment.  I stayed in room 3305 which had a nice view towards the Hudson River but the room was very tired.  At over US$300 a night for room only I really do expect better standards, hence my 'Average' review rating.  Check-in was very slow and at check-out they only had one person on the front desk.  There are some great restaurants a;3
Though the room was pleasant and clean, the AC was weak at night, the room was a bit noisy, the only morning coffee provided was a minuscule urn of coffee for all hotel guests in the lobby, finally,  i had to request an extension cord to plug in my laptop by the cramped desk.;3
Gisel Hernandez @ the reception desk was extremely helpful and friendly. Made our stay that little bit extra special!;3
Stayed for two nights arriving Thursday 23 June â¦ the down side we were allocated rooms on floors two and three - the third was a building site lots of dust.. we were relocated  to floor 4 and the room was fine. All in all the location, cleanliness, and staff were great  However from Thursday till after lunch Friday no hot water â¦ not even warm â¦ when we checked in they must have been aware but did not say anything to us. When we went to reception to report it we were in a line of others it was clearly impacing on  the whole hotel this is a basic need.  If it had hot water this would have been a four plus rating from me but sorry Premier Inn it is best to share the problems than take the money and await the dissatisfaction of your customers;3
"I am a college student from Ohio who stayed with two other students while we were on a weekend internship in NYC.  We were on a tight budget and this ""hotel"" was the only place that seemed to fit in comfortably.  We weren't exactly uncomfortable but it wasn't the Ritz either.  The room was ok for the price.  The problems were minimal...no heat in the room was ridiculous but other than that, we were actually pleasantly surprised.  We were three in a room and had plenty of space to move around in.  The bathrooms are what you would expect in a shared facility.  The occasional stray hair here and there.  The shower was crazy wild, so much for not getting your hair wet.  And nothing is more frustrating than stumbling out of your room in the middle of the night only to remember when";3
"The Empire has a cool lobby vibe. Too bad not so much in the room. We got a great $205/night rate on BookIt.com, so can't complain too much for the super cheap price, given the upper westside Lincoln Center locale. Very clean albeit worn.  The AC went off 3 times in 2 nights, along with one bedside lamp. The lighting in the room and bath are dismal, no desk as it's full of crap for sale.  The sink is a mess as the water pressure is too high. The counter for stuff like a tooth brush and paste - none. Many reviews complained about the shower, but we found it great with the high water pressure and plenty hot.  $3 for one Keurig ""K"" cup...really? $8 for a small bottle of water, really?  The staff was kind and responsive - see AC above, but never got the in-room safe working. If";3
"The staff has been wonderful.  However my ""up grade"" feels more like a down grade.  I was originally booked for a standard king, but they moved me to a upgraded king.  Which is just a little larger room.  This ""up grade"" put me on floor 2.  No view, right above street level looking on to a car dealer ship.  Thin walls and they put me in a room with a adjoining room door.  I was by myself.  Not what I want. I would have asked to move to a non adjoining room  But I didn't see it till the next day. As I was whipped from driving.   The food from room service to the lounge was mediocre.  Not bad, but not good. I would only come back for a night if we are coming to Universal Studios again, then move on to a better hotel in LA.   Oh the shower hardly had pressure, good thing I didn't";3
The location close to a subway station and Central Park is the best thing about it. More positives: the bed was good and it was calm. The shower worked and in the end we didn't spend much time in the room... The room and at least our floor was in great need of renovation. The hairdryer didn't work which I reported and I was told someone would fix it, but that never happened during the week we stayed there. The hotel was included in a British Airways deal and therefore we had expected it to be better.;3
Everyone has their own point of view on things. We have stayed in New York a few times and this was a whistle stop 2 nighter whilst we are touring. Hotel itself is clean and ok.  Location is alright probably a bit to high up for visiting the sights. The hotel says free wifi, when i see this i expect it to be in the rooms. Everywhere we have been in US so far has had free wifi in rooms. The only place its free is the lobby.  The rooms as expected are small but these are really small. Couldnt swing a hamster rather than a cat. When you have 2 adults and 2 teenage kids its no way near big enough. The bathroom is daft aswell. You have to lift your arms when sitting on the loo and the shower like others have said has no door. The problem is the shower head is directly in the middle,;3
The rooms were VERY small even by NYC standards.  I've stayed in several others that were better.  The room was shabby and looked worn.  The bathroom was REALLY small.  The sink had a partial wall in front of it so that you had to stand off to the side.  My husband couldn't even shave in front of the mirror.  The rooftop bar was great though.  Staff was friendly and helpful.;3
Our flight was delayed so we arrived around midnight, thoroughly exhausted to find we had been allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the one we booked on the website. There were no drawers at all and only a tiny wardrobe with no shelves. As we were at the beginning of a 12 day stay in NYC and New Jersey we had hoped to be able to unpack! We complained and the night manager said he would write a note for the morning staff. In the morning we took it up with the day staff, who said they would be able to let us know if there was another room about 2pm, and gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers. When we came back we were shown to a very pleasant room, with storage facilities so we took that one and enjoyed our stay from that point on. The doormen, (hello Jeff!), are;3
"Except for the fact that it is very close to universal studio, within walking distance, I cannot say it is a great hotel to stay. No slippers, even after you requested for it.  It was never delivered.  No free bottle water.  I can hardly find any hotels nowadays that does not give free bottled water. Staff are friendly though which is a ""like"". Water is running very slow and water pressure is bad.  You basically cannot control temperature of your water tap in the shower.";3
The hostel has both pros & cons. Excellent location: Hammersmith (Broadway), Fulham or Chelsea are simply among the best places to stay in London. It takes 5 min to get from the hostel to the tube station in Broadway Shopping Centre (Piccadilly line). Our room was cleaned each 2 days which was sufficient for a longer staying. We took the room with a bathroom. There was a fridge in the room. The fridge was clean and it was actually one of the brightest points of the room.  There was a common kitchen and surprisingly it was kept very clean - it must have been cleaned several times a day. In the kitchen there were available: 2 ovens and 2 microwave ovens and an electric kettle.  There are several serious remarks that both budgetplaces & the host should take into account: 1.;3
We stayed here in November 2018. I honestly don't have a problem with the place just don't know how to qualify it. It is definitely not a hotel as it has bunks in rooms of 4 (maybe other room types too, i can't confirm) so if you're 2 you'll still stay in a room of 4 with empty bunks. The other guests we met were mostly eastern-europeans, etc and kept only to themselves, couldn't really chat with anyone. There's a TV room but we gave it a pass, we rather went to the excellent pubs nearby. i cannot really complain about anything else than the softness of the bed. For me it was waaaay too soft, I had back pain in the morning. The shared bathrooms could get busy in peak hours when people leave for work but are cleaned well regularly which is a big plus.  The walls are rather thin;3
We arrived after 10:00 p.m. on a Sunday night after a long drive. We looked forward to settling down for a restful night. But, after there was no staff at the door to help us in with our luggage and security at the door scolded us for leaving our car at the curb while we carried in our bags, we knew we were in for a long night. The staff were more concerned with accommodating the long line outside who were there for the rooftop lounge than the hotel guests. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful providing us with internet access as we were there to bring donations and volunteer to help with Hurricane Sandy victims. The room was very small and the 2 of us were tripping over each other trying to get from one side of the room to the other. No closet to hang our;3
Stayed four nights. Was allocated a room on first floor. Air con units right outside window. Romeo gave us complimentary breakfasts so it felt churlish to complain.  Superb location.  One little tip. We required tranport to the Cruise port at Bayonne, New Jersey. The concierge quoted $124. We asked the bell boys and they got us a limo for $80 including tolls and tip.;3
Don't upgrade for a view - $80 extra and all I saw was a tree line.  Room was not ready at 1.5 hours after check-in.  extra parking fees and incident fees upped the price of the room. No breakfast included and no microwaves in rooms.  It's great being that close to Universal Studios and their beds are very comfortable is my positive for this place.;3
From my earlier review this was a conference for my hubby we stay a couple of days in San Francisco than did a couple of days LA stay at the hotel from 2/19-2/22 near everything great location had more than bagels for breakfast only issue we had with this hotel was no air it was in the 80's and we had a fan when my husband called the front desk they told him to eave his window open we did not gave a window we had a balcony that was connected to a row of balconies with no screen how were u suppose to leave it open while u slept would I stay here again probably not I need my air condition;3
Iâve stayed at many hotels in midtown and this one is just ok.  On the positive side, the rooms are in good condition, the decor is quite nice, rooms reasonably sized for NYC, and the location just off broadway on 54th is convenient.   The negatives:  when we were there the room was expensive ($400+) for almost no amenities (no restaurant, no coffee maker in room, call for a bar of soap took almost an hour for a response) and the staff (outside of the excellent bartender at the tiny bar) were not friendly or helpful.   Think two employees at the door almost always and no one opens the door for guests...  There are so many options in the area, I donât think Iâd tried here again.;3
I've been a couple of time a the Empire Hotel and each time I had the same sensation, it's a bit pretentious, you can easily find fashion models in the elevator and a would like to be starlet at the lobby, but the room are very small, elevators always busy and the most annoying think is that you have to pay for a lot of things that are free in other important hotel , 30$ for internet 8 $ for a bottle of water prices who are not reasonable for the place.;3
Check in was a breeze! Was walking distance to all the touristy places Very disappointed with the roof top bar walked in around midnight could tell they wanted us out as fast as possible (to go home) and the drinks were very expensive  We asked to sit outside and were denied. As soon as we got a drink they handed us the check. The pool on the roof top was a nice touch the view from the pool deck was really nice. Room is very small but perfect for us since we were just sleeping there. The shower has some water damage in the upper right corner and the bottom of the door was rotten out. The shower design was nice but the excess water flooded the floor each morning. Wish they gave us a few extra towels. When we booked (trip advisor) said we would have a view o the park...instead we;3
The hotel was in terms of Price one of the best options for this period of the year (between 25 and 31 of dÃ©cembre) The room We had was ok not more and it was noisy since for ex you could year your neighbor taking a shower ! Aldo the Windows are not at all preventing from external noise or weather conditions I could feel the outside temperature from my Bed and also outside wind! It is hard to have a final conclusion but again for the Price it was the best option knowing that We only spent Time to sleep and the rest of the day was Fully occupied with business activity;3
I stayed in this hotel because I got quoted a good price by New York standards. I would describe it as basic with no frills. Its clean however and the rooms are made up daily. The staff are very friendly and you can leave your luggage in storage if you have a late flight on the day you checkout. Its located across the road from central park and the metro stations at 103rd and 110th Streets are only a five minute walk away. There is a small deli one block to the north which is good for coffee and free wi-fi.;3
So I'll begin with the pluses of this hostel, proceed with the minuses, and close it out with my overall opinion, which will hopefully be useful to anyone reading this.   PLUSES:  - Nice neighborhood and in very close proximity to trains and buses (2 minute walk)  - Building is nice, has marble flooring throughout and has plenty of nice bathrooms, showers, and cooking kitchens  - Rooms are mostly private, and affordable! (Â£17.50 per person) Great deal for people who prefer this but are on a budget  - Towels, soap, and shampoo are provided. This is rare in my experience.  - MINI FRIDGE in each room. Sweet Lord! A place to chill my beverages before a long night out!   MINUSES:  - There was construction that began at 8:30 am. OUCH. It is very loud, even with earplugs. Knocking,;3
From the subway I walked the several blocks from the Eighth Avenue stop at 14th Street to The Jane, located on Jane Street and West Street - overlooking the Hudson River. My room was small - the single mattress was wider than the floor space, but I had room for the suitcase under the bed, and there were 2 drawers. The bathroom was a quick 10-steps around a corner, with two toilets and two showers. Economy at its best? Well, it was an experience for 4 nights. There is a rooftop bar facing west to New Jersey open evenings until midnight - open to the public - and a nice place to relax and have a drink. Staff were friendly and polite. Single elevator was ample and efficient. Quiet streets, and fellow guests weren't too noisy after hours.;3
"We paid $173 (tax included) for this room, which is inexpensive for NYC.  The room was just that â a room to sleep in and not much else; no frills at all so don't expect otherwise.  I have read other reviews of this property and was surprised at what people expect for this price - sorry but this is NYC and if you want the Waldorf than you have to pay the price.  However if you are in need of just a place to sleep, then this does the job.  There was an unnecessarily huge dresser that took up a large part of the small room.  The room was clean but very outdated.  The elevator was very small and slower than molasses.  The Wi-Fi code they provided did not work.  Since we have been to NYC many times, we didnât need to be down where all the action is in Midtown.  We needed to be near";3
Great Stay-rooms need some updating/maintenance. Early check in and late check out-much appreciated-staff were great. Rooftop lounge was not open but would have been great for nightlife and the view of area.;3
My baggage did not make it so I was left with no clothes or toiletries. Hotel did not have even the little basic disposable  emergency toothbrush for guests.  Cannot use electronics in your room as WiFi is free only on the lobby.  Breakfast costs $18 and really is a poor attempt at a;3
We were very excited to visit this hotel as we were gossip girl fans. We went in April, temps were in high 60s and mid 70s. We werenât  able to get to the rooftop. The roof top breakfast was amazing with lots of choices, buffet style. The bathrooms are coming apart, door and walls and warped from the water and way past needing to be redone. The drain in the shower didnât drain well either. Room was spacious and clean. Great pillows. Bed was on the harder then we would have liked. We never really spoke with staff and the ones we did werenât very talkative. I canât say enough about how great the location is though. We felt very safe in the area. No microwave and no coffee maker in the room.  We would probably stay again.;3
The staff was almost always exceptional. I was so impressed with almost everyone we interacted with. The room was fairly meh. It had a great view of the Lincoln Center but was was teeny tiny. I visited with my eight year old daughter and it was tight accommodations, not sure how two adults would make it for more than a night. We experienced a number of issues with our room - shower didn't work properly, sink didn't drain well, curtain rod was hanging awkwardly out of the ceiling. All those issues were fixed promptly after reporting them, though we were essentially kicked out of our room so maintenance could make repairs. Later we realized the shower wall seal didn't work and the bathroom flooded anytime someone showered, so we showered quickly each time, them mopped up the water;3
We stayed here for a London city trip. Room was small, but affordable. Bed was not very good and quite some noise from the corridors. Shower was ok. Staff was efficient. Facilities match a backpacker hotel;3
We booked this hotel via a travel company for our school trip to New York 7th Feb - 11th Feb. After reading the reviews on this site, i was very nervous to stay at this hotel. Me and my mates all had rooms on the 9th floor. Throughout our stay we had no problems with cockroaches and nobody had bed bug bites. The rooms got cleaned everyday, new bedding everyday too. The rooms did get quite warm so we had the a/c on most of the time. If your looking for a hotel just to sleep in, I would recommend this hotel.;3
If you're looking for cheap accomodation in New York, this is it! It is very close to Central Park and the 1-2-3 subway line that runs all the way downtown. Is it a nice, romantic, cosy hotel? Not whatsoever! The room smelled of smoke and the carpet was stained. The linen provided was ok but the shared bathroom definitely needs some work done. We saw many bussiness people walking to their room and walking straight to the front desk asking for an upgrade or a refund ... you will not get one, don't even try!!! The hotel is good for a maximum of a two night stay, if you wanna stay longer in NY spend a little bit more. We only needed a bed and a shower ...;3
"Three friends of mine and I have been in this hostel, in a four-bed room, so the experience has been a little bit different from what you usually have in a hostel.  The room was enough clean, but very small for four adult, male people; it was very warm though. There were not a lot of people in the hostel, so the common kitchen and bathroom were quite comfortable to use, even if there wasn't any pot in the kitchen. When it comes to service and staff... Very disappointed. Some members of the staff are very impolite, and I think that 1Â£ for a hour of WiFi, in London, in 2018, is a shame.";3
I stayed at this Days Inn as part of a conference in NYC, and I have to admit being disappointed when I walked through the door. The room smelled musty, and looked as if it hadn't been redecorated in 20+ yearrs.  The A/C didn't seem to be kicking out any really COOL air, the wi-fi seemed to sporadically stop working, and the bed linens looked rumpled, as if they hadn't been changed since the previous guest.. It was adequate for my one-night stay, but the property is really in need of repairs and updating, especially in a tourist city like NYC. The staff, however, were extremely friendly, kind and helpful.;3
"I stayed with my my then 11 y.o. daughter (Spring, 2014) at the Days Hotel. I was concerned upon arrival as the lobby had a slight ""hostel"" feel. However, we upgraded to the club level and were pleasantly surprised. The hallways were freshly carpeted and painted, and much different than the lower floors. The room was roomy and the bathroom was large. The wi-fi was horrible and spotty.  The front desk person that evening at check-in was very nice, the others the next day weren't as hospitable but not rude either.  I am writing this review now as I will return to the hotel next week and will post any changes or improvements.";3
Location to Central Park, Times Square, Empire State and Broadway was key.  The decor, particularly the wallpaper was offensive at best.  The pool was so small it was  unusable and bud of many family jokes.  The front desk staff was not nice.  Checked in at 2:15 and room not ready, said she would call but she never called. I finally went to desk at 7:00 and they apologized.  Gave us one adult and one child breakfast which we never used.  The bathroom was the size of a closet.  I would definitely not go back next time in New York.;3
My boyfriend and I both live in NYC but needed a place to stay for the night as we were renting out our apartments. I had been to the Empire hotel rooftop before and have had fun, but this was my first time staying in the hotel. I approached the desk to check in and there was no one else waiting, and I stood in front of the check in desk and the woman wouldn't even look up for her computer, even when I said hello and I would like to check in. The woman next to her said she would help me which was fine, but even if you're busy you look someone in the eye and say I'm sorry my colleague will help you-it is common courtesy. The lady who checked us in wasn't much better to be honest. She asked for my ID and when I couldn't find it quickly enough for her she asked again. She also;3
My boyfriend and I went with a couple of friends to this spot for New Year's Eve. I personally had high expectations for this place considering the many reviews saying this is one of the major spots to go to for NYE.  Honestly, I beg to differ with the reviews I've heard thus far.  So upon arrival,  the bouncers were not very pleasant and very rude when spoken to, similar as the last experience we had a couple months back when we JUSTwanted to see what the roof top was like. It took us 1/2 hr for coat check for both dropping off and picking up our jackets, the floors were slippery because of all the drinks that were spilled I slipped myself but gladly wasn't hurt.  The venue was just too small you literally had to push people just to make your way through as if everyone was a;3
I actually enjoyed most of my stay at the Jane...liked the room (549) and its proximity to the bathroom but had a serious issue at the end of my stay.  The hotel uses a funky key system that involves an electronic key and a metal rod that turns on all of the power except for an overhead light that works all the time. I had the option of lugging it around with me or dropping it off at the desk and picking up a new one on my way back in. I picked the latter option.  Everything was fine and dandy until I came back late Thursday night/Friday morning  to find that there were no keys left. The man at the front desk looked high and low for one but ended up having to let me in the room with his master key. However, no rod, which meant no electricity other than the overhead light. Since;3
Location great. Hotel OK. Room good size and comfortable. Jeff the doorman was superb and helpful. Cleanliness in reception was poor. Expensive hotel for what it was. View from rooms terrible. Minibar and snack prices hilariously expensive;3
Great place, but didn't have an ATM in the Hotel, which was frustrating cause I had to leave the hotel to find one. Other than that, it was a great place. The hotel was located in a great place which was very nice.  Was able to go to central park and the subway was very easy to get to.  The hotel is is decent shape for being so old.  Would I stay there again, yes.  I've stayed in many hotels in New York and almost all have had an ATM there which made it so convenient for me, so I was a little disappointed that this hotel didn't have one.;3
"Pros: nice hotel, clean rooms, friendly staff, free wifi, fridge in the room & great breakfast. cons: location; the hotel is not in hollywood but in little armenia, a neighboorhood that is a bit sketchy. also they charge you $20/night for parking.  Ok hotel but next time i'll get something within walking distance to nice reaturants etc";3
Location is fantastic if you are going to the Lincoln Center. Lobby and roof top bar are beautiful. Front desk is very friendly.  Rooms need some serious updating. We switched rooms twice because of filth. The staff was very friendly when switching.  New room was ok. Housekeeping did not clean our room one of the days. Ownership really needs to step up and invest in their hotel rooms......new bedding, etc, paint, etc.;3
I stayed here recently and want to give accolades to Gunita, the front desk receptionist. She was charming, warm and hospitable and I am only writing this because of her. Being a New Yorker I booked this hotel as a staycation.  When I arrived Gunita upgraded my room, and when I called for ice she sent up a complimentary bottle of wine... Thank you again Gunita!! You are the definition of hospitality!;3
When we first saw our room - 2 doubles - our hearts dropped! We had requested a park view - a must to do - we were on the 8th floor - next to the lift - not advisable. The windows were dirty and the one blind did not work. The air con was noisy and the only facilities was 1 glass!  I thought about checking out immediately but because it was pre-paid and we didn't know where to go we stayed! And it grew on us! The beds were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was big enough and the shower worked well, as did the white fresh towels daily. We left at 9am each morning and only returned at 10.30pm - so a place to sleep and get ready it is perfect for. Not for relaxing in your room! The position is far up the park - 106th street - but it is a residential true new york suburb! Nothing;3
"The Jane has been lovingly restored to its former glory and as such lacks many of the mod cons you may expect; however it makes up for this with its period character and charm. The front-of-house staff all wear 'traditional' bell-hop uniforms, and are polite and courteous with a good knowledge of the local area. The rooms are clean and our bunk beds were comfortable, but the communal bathrooms were a little ropey (although the showers were always warm). All-in-all for a budget hotel in its location, you cannot really ask for much more, and the Jane does what you expect in that regard. Just don't go there in the hope that there is more to it than this: it does exactly what it says on the proverbial tin, nothing more.";3
"The hotel is pretty tired. We upgraded our room from the last time we stayed, and the room was the exact same tiny size, with a ""view"". The tub really needed refinishing. The elevators were very slow, with only a few of them working. There is no gift shop, so buying a soda after the lobby kiosk closes is not possible. The staff were mostly pleasant, but our booking was difficult to achieve, as it was a bit complex.";3
"My wife chose this hotel for its location, and it was brilliant. Near the river; near the Whitney; near the subway. Perfect.  In other ways it might disappoint: very hot and stuffy rooms and corridors. The air conditioning fought to contain the problem, and probably lost. The shower was trying to cope with too many people, and people who were slow to work out that they should speed up under the circumstances. The bell-boys were charming. The desk staff were vague. A bedside light didn't work; we asked for help. A handyman switched two bulbs around so that the other light didn't work instead, and left his master key behind! .  The restaurant is a different business, attached to the hotel but independent.  Like a lot of New York it was over-priced, especially the drinks, but very";3
brilliant location, we had to move rooms 1st night due to the noise moved to 28th floor no noise when was great , very small room and hotel is dated although staff are very friendly and helpful, the tick tock rest is great :-)  hotel could def do with makeover   massive down side was not getting deposit back stayed 16-20th December  tried to contact hotel a number of times via email and phone, no replies or even got to speak to someone. they took $633 for these 4 nights.   today I actually got through on the phone and spoke with Ramona Collado and she was great, there was a fault in system and had charged instead or card put on hold, this has now been returned.  Ramona was great and was nice to act talk to some one and for this to be fixed straight away.;3
First let me say the Empire was very accommodating to us. The location is convenient, close to the #1 subway line, easy to get down town from here. Central park is a quick walk, and Lincoln Center right there. This older hotel is a mixed experience the staff were friendly and helpful but the infrastructure was hit or miss.  The elevators were slow and some out of service. The room was very nice but the shower leaks water onto the floor due to a bad design during a renovation.  I heard other guests at the front desk looking for other rooms as there AC wasn't working and such. Getting to the roof top pool is an adventure, elevator to 11 floor then several flights of steps.;3
OK hotel, nothing to write home about.  The elevators weren't working my last day there and there were no signs directing you on how to get down to the lobby (they were out for at least 6 hours).  Our room keys stopped working twice (over 4 days).  They said they demagnitized but I've never had this problem at other hotels.  This was especially annoying on the last day when I had to take a second trip down the stairs to get a new key. The room was updated but the bed was uncomfortable and the walls were very thin.  The bathrooms were very small.  The lobby bar was nice.  The hotel is in a convenient location and close to a subway which was great.;3
We have just returned from The New Yorker and there are lots of things we liked but on balance the bad knocked the good points down to average. We had our resort fees included in our package with Virgin which was great, however, I do feel the fees are not value for money. We contacted the hotel before we arrived to ask for rooms close together and a nice view. We got one of those requests and had a great view of the Empire State Building. The hotel is clean and staff helpful, it is in an excellent location, so convenient for the attractions and subway.  The not so good now, the smell of weed seems to seep into the rooms through the vent, the rooms are very small and there is no fridge or kettle/coffee maker unless you pay for them. Also, the lifts were a nightmare when we;3
We travel extensively for work and vacation. We aren't picky, but having a hot shower is a must, or at least more warm than cool/cold. We called the front desk in the afternoon and they said the maintenance man would come. He didn't come, so we called again later that night. He came, and said he would need to replace a part the next morning. He didn't come the next morning, so we called again at night. He still didn't come. That's the 2nd day. On the third morning we called again, and then he came. He said it was fixed, but we felt no difference in the temperature. His supervisor came and said this was the legal limit of temperature, there is nothing they could do, and was pretty rude about everything. We have stayed in so many hotels over all these years, and we know the;3
Great location which really can't be overstated, but the other reviewers are spot on. Elevators were not reliable throughout our four night stay. They offered free water for our stair journeys (there are eleven floors in this hotel).  Extra towels and the linens for the foldout sofa were slow in coming. I called at 1030, again at 1130 arrived around 1230 am. Air con was fine, water was hot and plentiful.  The Chowder House was good. The concierge seemed nicer to some than others. The business center purchase system is not efficient. There are some shabby spots that need repair and surely they should rethink doors on the showers.  The cost in just answering the phone calls saying 'my shower door is missing' and in laundering the many towels that people put on the floors should;3
"No tea and coffee making facilities in rooms despite what website says or mini bar but get 2 very small complimentary water bottles each morning. Billed as mid range 3 star hotel but carpets hard and well worn,,low lighting masks some very tired decor posing as ""boutique ""...in the U.K. This would definitely not pass as a boutique hotel. Booked in Feb 2019 for new year 2020 asking for them high floor room and a bottle in the room for partners birthday,got neither,told that hotel was too full. Got 4th floor with a view of the back of the other rooms and a very noisy air con outside that NEVER goes off so take earplugs. Roof top bar great place to relax but this is NOT part of hotel so no special discounts or treatment. Nice views of the Lincoln centre and broadway. Good location";3
room description not accurate & misleading, room clean and safe. no facilities ie computers/breakfst facilities or vending machine facility, as a bit of a scary area after dark. staff not very helpful;3
Hotel is OK and lobby is actually very nice BUT the hotel rooms defy description for smallness of size...2 people can barely fit inside (with one person it's crowded)...I've seen small hotel rooms in Europe BUT these are smaller than anything there...you'll be shocked...if you are attending Lincoln Center this hotel is great...we got a deal on HotWire...if I paid full price I'd be very angry.;3
It wasnÂ´t as bad as I expected after reading reviews. The hotel has a very good position on Manhattan - close to a shop, close to nice resting area near Hudson river, close to subway... Staff was helpful. The only problem was cleanness of room and of common areas. Our friend changed her room three times before she get so-so clean room.;3
Pro's: Location - 8 stops on the subway to Times Square.  The rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels & linen. Con's: The rooms are tiny. No kettle, toaster or utensils in shared kitchen. Wifi is very poor and the TV's didn't work work the entire week we stayed;3
The best thing was the location with a subway entrance on both sides of the hotel.  Only 1 of the concierge staff was much help, but the security staff was helpful.  Both my daughter and I took hot showers right after each other one night after midnight and due to the small size of the room and being an older hotel, we caused the fire alarm to go off.  Although security showed up as soon as we called, the only way to resolve the problem was to turn down the temperature on the thermostat and open the windows as that was the only way the fire alarm would go off., which took a while.  Not a great experience for neighboring guests I am sure.;3
"I most always try to see a silver lining but so far our stay here has not been good 1. I'd phoned ahead by a week, confirmed our stay and mentioned that our flight would arrive close to midnight -- so our check-in would be very late. We had prepaid via Priceline. Lo and behold our purchased nonsmoking king was no longer available when we arrived; we were put into an old nonsmoking full bed room and I spent most of the night praying for no bedbugs. The carpet was filthy and pulled away from the tack board where the walls met the floor.  2. We were told to leave that room in the morning, check our bags with the bell captain and return after noon to get our king room. We did so, and then returned at 2:45 pm. Checked in and couldn't get into our new room -- housekeeping was still in";3
Room was nice but small and somewhat outdated. I was somewhat upset they charged $2 per bag to only keep it for a few hours after check-out! AND no room service! Would recommend Wyndham's TRYP hotel down the street. Much newer, bigger rooms, and friendly service.;3
Pros: The location is perfect for Lincoln Center.  Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Luggage storage is available. Cons: No free wifi in rooms. Charge for computer access.  Dreary fitness center in basement.;3
I had internet access in the room for a total of about 30 minutes on the first night of a 3-day stay, spent about 40 minutes on check-in with just one party in front of me, and shared my room with at least two, seemingly drugged, cockroaches. The location of this hotel is extremely convenient, and some of the staff members were very friendly.;3
Don't expect to be in your room much. The perfect hotel if you just want a place to sleep between exPloring New York.;3
It was my 4th stay at the Jane and this might be the last. Unfortunately, the level of service seems to have declined. I was particularly disappointed by the rude attitude of one of the concierge / reception desk clerk (a young bearded man), who never made eye contact while speaking to us, never answered our hello, never said thank you while we were giving him our key, nor wished us a pleasant stay or a good day. I hope this is not his standard behavior, otherwise I suggest that he starts looking for a new job in a different kind of industry than service.  Iâd like to add that the room was awfully warm (again !) : we had to open the window + put the airco on cold mode (in February !) to reach a bearable room temperature. This seemed to us very un-ecological in these days of;3
This Hotel is close to many top attractions, Empire State Building, Times Square, Madison Sq. gdns. A lively neighbourhood of bars and restaurants.  The Hotel staff are very efficient and friendly, especially Mohammad at the front desk. This is my 2nd time staying at The New Yorker. This time we traveled with our 2 grandkids for a special trip. We booked a double suite, which was expensive. We were disappointed, the furniture is worn and âtiredâ carpet  is all browns and beige drab and overall in need of renovation.  The sofa bed in living room area is uncomfortable. No lamps  in the living area, just a yellow  overhead light. The lobby looks much more attractive than the rooms. Security is good, room key must be shown to enter the elevator.  We enjoyed our time in New York.;3
Unusual decorative style but not unpleasant in any way. Always clean and housekeeping staff seemed very efficient. No free coffee making facilities in room but for $3.00 per cup you could use the coffee maker. Minibar prices absolutely extortionate so bring your own (Starbucks and Walgreens just around the corner) Wifi only free in lobby. If you want internet access in your room it's another $10 per device per day. Good location close to southern end of Central Park and metro station also fairly close. 15 minute walk to Times Square.;3
"We heard there was drinks on the menu named after all the Gossip Girl characters, and being such a fan of the show I couldn't wait to try some and be in the hotel that featured so much in the shows!  The decor is nice but dated (we sat in the lobby by the stairs and bar) and its very dingy.  We asked the waitress about the drinks but she said they had stopped servicing them 6 months ago! Why was it still on their website then?! She said if we knew the name we could order it though. We couldn't remember the names so took a guess for Chuck Bass and got 2 ""I'm Chuck Bass""s for $15 each! And they were tiny! After 4 drinks the bar girl asked us to either go upstairs or leave as they were shutting the bar! How can they be shutting the bar and asking people to leave the HOTEL LOBBY!?";3
Opposite to the Lincoln Center, nothing could be more convenient if you are attending performances at the Center. You can cross the avenue in your evening attire, avoiding the non-functional garderobe services, particularly in the opera. - The property is old, and althouhg newly painted and carpeted, you can feel the uneven floor surface and see the uneven ceilings. - Room service is inferior, I stayed 8 nights and only once was the minibar refilled without separate call. Apparently one bottle of juice should suffice for a week. - Housekeeping left something to be desired, too. - Restaurant not recommended, but luckily there are several nice establishments across the Broadway, Boulud Sud, Boulud Bar, Fiorello's, Smith, Atlantic Grill - and the Lincoln at the Center. - Room;3
Having stayed here pre pandemic  we were looking forward to staying here again , sadly we only had an average stay. No housekeeping unless we asked and that took two days of asking . Room furniture tired , shower leaked and my biggest bug bear is the connecting doors , where you can hear everything of your neighbours . Why put a couple next to a large family !. Staff remain friendly . We had breakfast included , we ate there once , wasnât worth being free. Could have upgraded to a hot breakfast for $10. We came here for a few days from a Hyatt hotel , wow what a difference . Best thing about this hotel is the location to Universal and the staff .;3
Highly priced for what I got/ View from room was terrible, internal next to wall Some staff excellent. Others horrible Great location Lost electricity for 20 hours, but they managed crisis well Water not available one day;3
The location of the hotel is perfect! Walking distance to Central Park, the Lincoln centre, the main shopping areas, the Rockefeller centre and the Empire State building. The cocktails at the bar were also very nice and we had one every evening in the luxurious bar area before heading out.   The rooms unfortunately did not live up to the standard we were expecting. We moved rooms on the first night as we were right next to an air conditioning unit which was very noisy (I understand we were in central New York and it was bound to be noisy but this noise was unpleasant). The next room we were in was on the 9th floor which was absolutely fine until I found a cockroach on the sink whilst getting ready.   The staff of the hotel were great and tried their utmost to sort things out for;3
"I have been staying at the Empire during business trips since right after the renovation.  Over the years, I have seen a steady decline in overall experience. Rooms - turndown service used to be customary with a nice b&w cookie.  No more. Linens seem nowhere near as fresh or pressed. The latest trip, the linens seemed constantly ""damp"" not comfy. Paper cups in place of glasses. 7.50 for a bottle of Fiji....need I say more? I had to request a robe, whereas in the past, the robes were fresh, fluffy, and AVAILABLE upon arrival. Ok...hotel used to provide free wifi in room.  Now $13 per day, per DEVICE. laptop,iPhone, iPad, you're looking at $40 a day to work. Times are tough, but there are different, behind-the-scenes ways of cutting costs without sacrificing guest experience.";3
I have a hard time picking my overall rating for this hotel. I dally between average and very good. I think good might be right if 'good' happened to be in the rating scale but it's not so I have to settle for average. First off the location is ideal. Situated near drug stores, shopping malls, coffee shops, subway it is hard to beat. The hotel is nice. Doormen polite as well as reception staff. The bar down in the lobby looks nice if a bit dark. The room was small and basic but very clean. The big problem was the noise from the air/heating vent outside. It was so loud that we asked to be moved which we were without any effort to a room on a lower floor but the noise was still an issue and it meant I had to wear ear plugs at night (hardly appropriate for a romantic getaway). The;3
"First impressions are everything and mine was not good.  Arrived earlier than check in time and was told to come back at 3pm which was absolutely fine.  Came back at 3 and was told I had to wait as they were in the middle of a shift change.  What sort of hotel schedules shift changes at check in time?  I stood at the counter waiting while 4 staff members stepped away on their computers and talked amongst themselves.  Every now and again one of them asked what I wanted and I just kept repeating that I was waiting to check in, by the time the fourth person asked me I quite loudly stated ""I am just trying to check in""!!  The woman then checked me in but was very abrupt and did not bother explaining any features of the hotel or where anything was, very bad attitude.  The hotel";3
Stayed here overnight before an early morning flight.  The common areas and room were very nice, however....  The staff were somewhere between stand-offish and just plain rude.  The front desk refused to add my World of Hyatt number to the stay because I had booked it through a third party.  Although the remodel is complete, they didn't do anything to cut the noise.  I specifically requested a quiet room to sleep, and got one at the end of the hall... with all of the noise of the traffic at the intersection of Century and Sepulveda.  I could also still hear the folks bumbling around out in the hall.  At check-out in the morning, there was nobody at the desk.  I gave my key cards to a random maintenance employee who was nearby.  The shuttle does run as advertised, but better;3
I get there ate at night.  From the street Idid to see any sign. There is a carpet at the entrance that has their name on it. As this is New York this is an older building. I thought that the entry way could be cleaned better.  I think they'd the after the first night. The desk is open 24 hours a day and is helpful and friendly. They appreciated that I was there. The room was basic and clean.  I asked for help for operating the cable TV. It worked well once someone went over it with me. The provided refrigerator was not on. I did not use it so I did not ask for help with it.   The longer I was there the more comfortable I felt there. i was there for four nights.  It was very content less than half a block from Broadway. There was a nice natural food store on the corner that had;3
Great renovation of the historic lobby. Outstanding location next to Penn Station. Good quality bedding and towels. Small room (typical for New York) but incredibly dark with one window and view of HVAC stack. Second room in a row with this same depressing feature.;3
Classic hotel convenient to Madison Square Garden and the Pennsylvania Station.  However, room is very loud (even for NYC standards) and incredibly small, bathroom especially could stand an update and a shelf that could actually accommodate a toiletry kit. Wonât fit more than 2 people (even if it were a baby) in a queen room.;3
Hotel has good Manhatten Upper West Side location just next to central park. Nearest subway station is only 3-4 blocks away. Rooms look not big and old, but acceptable for this price. Staff is friendly. No breakfast option in hotel. WiFi is not free.;3
Having flown in from Nassau disappointed about the Atlantis hotel there, we were looking forward to coming to New York to a 'reknowned' hotel that we expected would put our faith back into vfm stays. A good sign then that Virgin Atlantic cabin crew use this hotel for their layovers. The fact that a large number of guests checking in on a Sunday evening with us also shows a hotel in demand. Check in was done reasonably efficiently although waiting for a lift to the room on the 21st floor wasn't. It would appear that all the new guests were booked into floor 20 and above this causing a scrum for elevators...(the other bank for floor 20 and below were very frequent with very little demand). Upon gaining entry to the cubby hole room 2144 we were greeted by the mess let by the;3
"Clean, pleasant staff, close to Lincoln Center.  Silly, but they did not have coffee, which was annoying. Told they were waiting for a shipment; dah it is NYC!  Also said the bar would be open but it was not.  What was cool was the bar on the top floor with beautiful views of the city!  This, however, was not run by the hotel.";3
"I have stayed at the New Yorker many times. The one thing that always strikes me is how friendly and polite all of the employees are. Whether it is the housekeeper, concierge, security, front desk etc, everyone greets you with a smile and an attitude as if they really enjoy working there.  This is an old world hotel with the ""mood"" of the 40s, a step back in time. Beautiful old marble and decorative accents in the lobby. Don't expect contemporary appointments. Many rooms at this hotel are quite small. The size of the room I'm given directly corresponds to my enjoyment at this property. I was given a small room this six day trip. In the past, I've had larger rooms which typically generates a 4* experience. (And they know I'm a trip advisor reviewer! When I checked in they told me";3
If you don't know LA then be prepared to pay a little more to stay close to your main attraction. Literally a 2 min walk to Universal studios is what made this the perfect place to stay. Did find the decor very dated and only 2 of 5 lifts were working due to some upgrades. So the 23rd floor took some time getting to. Staff were fairly friendly but no free WiFi unless you join their club...Rooms were clean and neat. Might shop around a little more next time.;3
as it is a cheap hostel we can't ask much but there are things you can work on. The kitchen is definitely not prepared to cook anything, you can just do things in the microwave or in the oven, the cleaning part must be more regular I've been there for 6 nights and my room was just clean once, the showers must be separated as the toilets are, for ladies and gentleman, and I would definitely change the place to put the mirror in the room. Beside that it was a nice place to stay, nice people, nice prices, really warm room witch was the best quality, and the fridge in the room is also a good one!;3
The Hotel was clean, the staff was friendly. Breakfast was beyond continental, omelets or eggs in what ever style you want. Hugo, the chef, really had his system down pat, and really knew what was going on in the breakfast line. It was a great way to start the day. There are water conservation signs everywhere, the hotel does it's best to be echo-friendly. One problem that I had was that they charge for parking, $17 a day, it was an additional cost that we were not expecting. We did not find the hotel located in the best of neighborhoods, we did not feel safe walking around in the evening. The hotel is about 4 miles from the 101 (major freeway), depending the time of day, it took 40 minutes through traffic, just to get to and from. Hotel Very close to Hollywood Walk.;3
Good enough for city trip. But not good enough if you plan to spent more time on the room. Bath room was very outdated and not everything worked as well. Wifi is pretty poor unless you take the paid one.;3
A little run down but rooms were quite spacious. Average service, average continental breakfast. Didn't really like the location - not within walking distance of any nice shops or restaurants! We hired a car (a service that the hotel provides) which is a must in LA - unless you don't mind spending lots of money on cabs!! The hotel is close to a metro station but we didn't even bother with the metro/public transport - even the staff at the hotel told us that the public transport system in LA is crap! Won't be staying here again on my next trip to LA.;3
Stayed here for 5 nights which was a surprise treat organised by my partner for my 50th birthday. Apparently my partner advised the hotel of this but no upgrade or acknowledgement from the hotel (a card would have been nice) Room was small and the heating/aircon system was so noisy we couldn't use it! Shower was good but the bathroom was dusty with a number of rogue hairs I assume were belonging to the previous guest!!  The concierge was quite dismissive and a little rude.  The only really good point of the hotel is the location, close to central park and the Lincoln centre.;3
Very average hotel for the location and cost. I would recommend staying somewhere else, and paying half of the cost. Not much advantage being close to park, shuttle service is the same for all hotels in the area.;3
When your paying the money we have for 4 nights you expect luxury. When you arrive you feel like the entrance is luxurious. You get I  the ornate lifts and then open your room door. Small is all I could say. Then look out of single pain windows with wind rushing through the gaps. This isn't going to be a quiet hotel. Then into the bathroom to freshen up on what looks like he original bath and taps from when the hotel was built In the early 1900's. I wish I could say it was spotless I can't.  The stains were everywhere. So time for a shower, you can have either boiling hot or freezing cold. No in between.  If I had kids I would be taking a lawsuit our for third degree burns right now. So if you like listening to Hill St Blues whilst trying to sleep stay here. 2nd night I had;3
Hotel it not bad it about 15-20 mins walk from Times Square staff helpful and very kind. Rooms not very big for double room bathroom was very small we didnât like it personally clean and tidy hotel. Not ideal if you want to be closer or in Time Square;3
First of all the staff here are just amazing! We were worried due to the lack of email responses however apon arrival we had a great South African lady help us out. With no surprise due to the lack of emails our booking had been messed up but she was able to fix the solution (which doesn't happen a lot we've noticed). Even all the maids are lovely and helpful.  - Transport - good heaps of local train stations at $2.25 per trip - Locations - Its cheap so ok but further south (downtown was nicer) - Staff - Fantastic - Rooms - Preferably get the upgraded rooms with ensuits.. alot better (we stayed in both) - WIFI - Doesn't actually reach your room you have to sit on the floor in the lobby - 2nd Floor - DO NOT STAY ON THIS FLOOR - everyone shares a bathroom and forgets that the;3
First I would like to say it is no Hilton, Marriott, or W hotel property. However, you aren't paying those prices at least when you book thru a 3rd party like hotels.com etc. The Hotel rooms me and my friends had wasn't by any means grand but they were comfortable enough to stay in and gave us a real feel of how it would be to live in New York. I felt the rooms were spacious enough though they were dated. If you are on a budget and want to stay damn near in the center of manhattan just to experience the city of New York this hotel would be a good choice. There were several stores and restaurants near by also it is no where from the subway and express train into times square. Another thing the staff accidentally tore my friends bag handle and we were accommodated with a free;3
The New Yorker is well situated, especially if you are attending events at Madison Square Garden or wanting to shop at Macy's. It's also an easy walk to the Times Square/Broadway area if you are reasonably fit. Security is good, with entry to elevators monitored. The staff is personable and helpful overall, but be sure that you approach the information desk and not the Wyndham sales desk closer to check-in, where you will have to escape a fairly-high-pressured real estate pitch. When first built, it must have been a real top-tier hotel. Its features reflect its age. It has an elegant lobby. Some rooms that are quite spacious and some that are quite cramped. Ours was one of the latter, and we could hear the guests in the next room well enough that we could probably have;3
Stayed for the 1st time on May 15th for 3 nights....Room was nice and great view of Universal Studios...The people at front desk were nice and helpful ...Loved the Free Shuttle and was always on time..HOWEVER...My family felt very uncomfortable with the Horrible service at the Cafe/Restaurant...we had Free breakfast ,but paid the upgrade free to Buffet Breakfast...Don't even bother asking for a to go box ,they say NO and then make you feel like your trying to steel food...Only after asking why,did they give me a small box to fit what I couldn't finish..They were quick to get us out and rude when I tried to tell a manager about the service...Because of this I will not be coming back to the Hilton...;3
"The building is excellent and traditional from the period. However, extra facilities and charges for extras like coffee that are standard in most hotels, let the hotel down. The lack of welcome pack was unusual; I received a key card and directions, there was no further contact until I checked out.";3
Hotel is a standard corporate airport offering. Rooms are functional but not luxurious. Restaurant has limited offerings in big sized servings but a surprisingly good wine list. Front desk staff are appalling. Couldn't care less, dismissive, seen too many guests and hates them slow and robotic service - worst I have seen in an age. Bag porters exactly the opposite affable, happy to please and service with a smile. Whoever supervises the front desk staff needs to do some serious customer service retraining. Hey guys, its a service business remember! Regency club is nice with good food and drink options so recommend that. Pool is good but is really close to runway so you feel and hear the take off thrust which if you like it is quite exciting. Again it is a standard offering and;3
"Amazing location, hotel itself not worth price. The lobby area was gorgeous and very nice, but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated. My room had a gorgeous view, but looked nothing like the rooms the hotel posts pictures of; it was much more outdated, the shower had dirt in between the tiles that could've been scrubbed away, and the bathroom also looks much older. It wasn't super dirty or anything, but definitely could've been cleaner, especially for the price. The TV was older and I had issues with it being so grainy at some points (not the whole time?) that I couldn't read the guide. The diner was nice. Facility fees (none of which I used -- it's basically the office and gym plus Wifi) for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing $100, which";3
My teens and I have just come back from New York where we stayed at the Astor on the Park from March 5 to March 8, 2008. I was so concerned about the negative reviews of this hotel that I tried to change my reservation but it was too late. Overall, the hotel is rated 2 stars and it worths 2 stars. Rooms and bathrooms are very clean (although the carpets need to be changed). We first had a room with a view at the back of the hotel (awful), I asked to change the room and it was done with a bigger room on the 8th floor. I recommend that hotel only if you don't want to spend much on your stay, otherwise, maybe pay a little more to have a better hotel. Astor is located near the 106th Street, Broadway is on 42nd Street.;3
"The hotel is in the heart of the garment district, a block from Penn Station and there's a subway stop on the same corner; the New Yorker would be a good home base for your exploration of Manhattan. The staff is courteous and helpful, much more than I expected in NYC. There was no coffee maker in the room as in the website photos, but when I asked they brought me one in five minutes. The room was tiny, with about three feet on all sides of the bed. The bathroom was dingy, with stains on the tub and rotting grout in several places.   The New Yorker would be great for someone who only needs a place to sleep and will spend all day out an about in the nearby sights.";3
We stayed 3 nights at the Empire. Overall we were happy enough but we had a few comments. Room was very small, the air con was very loud even when it was switched off. Bathroom tap was really powerful and splashed water everywhere. However, bed was very comfortable, the cocktails were good and strong at the bar (pricey though). Location great for central park and about a 20 min walk to times square.;3
Room was a little small for a family of 4 the picture above was a lot bigger room, the bath shower was a bit grotty.  Air conditioning was good, the location was really good very near to Macy's round the corner from time square. There was scaffolding outside when we were there so our view was impacted which was a shame as the Empire state was right in front.;3
"When I made the reservations I made a note in the ""Special Request"" box stating it was my birthday. The woman checking me in never acknowledged that, did not state where the amenities were or their hours of operations. She simply asked for my last name, I.D., and credit card. Once she charged my card she told me my room number and that the elevators are behind me to my right. My room was fine but there was a broken pen. I ate at the buffet in the morning, I passed house keeping on my way down. When I returned house keeping was about to enter my room. I still had an hour before check out. Wasn't the best introduction but the morning and grave yard staff in the Lobby and buffet were very helpful.";3
"Very seedy, very small, very old.  I walked into the lobby and I actually thought to myself, ""Hmm...this might be ok afterall.""  Nope, not the case!  The room had water damage to the ceiling, not to mention other parts of the hotel were damaged as well (the bathroom door, etc.) The bathroom was actually nicer & cleaner than the rest of the room.  That's not saying very much.  I couldn't beat the price for a last minute holiday weekend trip though, but now I learned my lesson.  This hotel needs a makeover BAD!  The hallways are gross.  The location is okay though, two blocks from the 96th Street station and 3 or 4 blocks from Central Park.  There is a deli across the street that had good desserts and pizza that stays open until 3am.  Hopefully anyone staying here will have a";3
The Hilton Universal City has a nice location but needs to be renovated.   The rooms are boring and the interior needs an upgrade. The bed is way to soft: I couldn't sleep at all. Hilton Vienna has way better beds. You cannot open the windows and the air-con is unpleasant. The elevators are painstakingly slow. Staff did help but rushed your requests.   The only reason to stay here would be the location in the hills and the nearby Universal Studios. It's only a five minute walk.;3
we picked the hotel because of its rooftop pool and bars as our trip was  in August but its taken me time to get to the review, There were 3 of us in a twin double and it was very snug with very little wardrobe space. rooms were ok but the air con seemed old and was noisy and you had to take the top off the window ledge to access the controls. the roof space was also very small and we didnt use the pool because it was jammed packed. we had a cocktail every night before hitting the town and the bar area in the lobby and the roof were very nice but expensive. the roof bar seemed to be the place to be seen and we saw queues to get into the lift to take you to the roof. the hotel is near to subways and a pleasant couple of blocks walk to central park. over the road is a really nice;3
"The room looked quite nice and everything was clean and in good shape.   I liked that it had ample charging stations for USB as well as plugs on the end tables and the desk.          They also had a coffee maker and left many coffees per day as well as a couple bottles of water per day.          It is in a great location... I was able to walk in about 10 minutes to Times Square or to Empire State Building... extremely close to MSG and to subway station.    I had an executive room... it was very small, but I expect that in NYC... (I would hate to see how small the basic room was).   The bathroom was especially small... the sink was so shallow that it was nearly impossible to run water without it splashing all over you...  No counter in the bathroom, except for the 3"" wide brim";3
I had read on trip advisor to see what this hotel Was like..what I read wasnât good so wasnât really sure what to expect ð³when I arrived the staff where friendly an reception was very clean an tidy..the rooms are very dated but also very clean which was my main worry ..it could do with a total refurbishment in rooms but honestly I would go back as clean an I only needed somewhere to sleep ..only other problem I had before I went was ..thereâs no response to any calls, emails or txt messages at all before you go I tried for 4 months but no joy..;3
The hotel is in the best possible location: right next to Madison Square Garden and a Metro entrance, which makes moving around very easy. We even walked to Central Park, which was only 30 minutes away on foot. The room was quite small, though, and the bed and pillows had seen better days. Some of the staff were very nice and helpful, but others could really improve their manners with guests.  It was also FREEZING cold in the lobby, especially, and corridors. Caught a cold from coming to the August heat in the street into the hotel.;3
We decided to take a road trip down to New York city for the Victoria day long weekend.  We left Fri afternoon (5pm) and decided to drive until we couldn't anymore.  lol.  We finally stayed in some dumpy hotel in syracuse.  The next day we ended up in New Jersey but couldn't find any hotels that were available.  finally we found the Days Inn broadway.  They gave us a renovated room which was really nice (small of course)!!  We paid $350 for the Sat night which we were expecting to pay.  Check in was a breeze but we couldn't check in until 3pm which was fine. The guy put our bags in a safe place and we were off to visit the big apple!!  We got a bus tour which brought us everywhere !! I mean everywhere. We say rockafeller center, world trade center, stock exchange etc etc.  It;3
What we liked: clean rooms, no bed bugs, comfortable temperature (it was winter), good bed, fair size, good location, good service and very good price (less than $60/night).  What we didn't liked: the noise and the slow and undersized elevator: you'll probably have to wait several minutes to use it during the rush time.  There is a subway entrance 2 1/2 blocks (3 min) uptown and another one 3 blocks downtown (4 min). You can find a Deli (to have breakfast) 2 blocks uptown and a Subway restaurant (plus some markets) in the corner of the Central Park.  We could also find a good skating rink at the central park very close to the hotel for less then $12 (entrance + equipment). Less than half the price of the other rinks we visited in NY.;3
I was interviewing at CHLA and this was a 3 blocks away so convenient. Safe neighborhood. Clean hotel. Nice updated rooms. Breakfast buffet was a nice touch. Staff was friendly. Excellent central location. My only complaint is that the wi-fi did not work.;3
We are a family of 4 who stayed here in October 2019. The rooms are compact but clean and we had a partial view of the empire state. We were lucky enough to have a coffee machine in the room to get us started for the day but I'm not sure this is in every room. This hotel is in a really good location for all attractions and we would stay here again if we had another trip to the big apple. The only negatives would be the extra price of the city tax which I think is high and the fact they charge you to hold your luggage (per case too) in a room on check out day is ridiculous. Never had this in any other hotel in the world!!;3
"I recently stayed at this hotel, and had a GREAT time.  It was my first time in NYC, and I traveled alone, so naturally I was scared to death, (I actually threw up 3 times before I even got on the plane to go)!  Yes, this hotel is run down, and not the Ritz, but I feel it get's a bad rap here in these reviews.  I booked it before reading them, but once I arrived, and the ""shock"" wore off, it's simply NYC.  The Management is on-hand 24/7, and it is in the quietest, safest area in the central part of Manhattan.           Yes, the rooms are small, the restrooms are shared (don't forget ""flip-flops"" for your feet), and there is a slight odor of ""old building"", but, otherwise, I felt extremely safe.  My room had fresh linens each day, the baths, rooms, and halls were cleaned each";3
Picked this hotel because of its proximity to Universal Studios.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Itâs very close to universal studios, and self parking is a fee but is easy to do.  2 issues- the walk to Universal Studios wasnât as efficient as it could be- you have to cross 2 streets to get to the same place.  They should put a sidewalk in to eliminate one of the street crossing.  Cars go fast and donât pay attention to cross walks.  Go figure.  Second problem is the same problem I always have with the Hilton (and only the Hilton brands it seems.)  they never seem to clean my room until after 4 pm.  And I get their line- they have until 5, but geez. I always seem to be last on the list.  Itâs insane and Hilton needs to hire more people or;3
The property is in a great location and even better if you have a street view.  We enjoyed our time but were met with some silly issues like lack of certain amenities (like a working phone) in the room.  It was satisfactory over all.;3
The only reason to book this hotel and pay accordingly is to avoid having to travel to Universal Studios by any shuttles. It is the closest hotel to Universal Studios' entrance, a very short and easy walk.  If that is worth it to you, by all means book it. The hotel itself is very average.  Our room had an excellent view of Universal, but it was not very well cleaned (we found various pieces of papers under and next to the bed, for example).  The room was of a motel quality, let's just say.  But again, if you want close proximity to Universal and just need  a place to crash (for the price of Hilton), this is the place for you. If you don't mind traveling a bit to Universal, there are other less expensive options. Oh, and unless you are a Hilton points member, you do not get free;3
We had a good stay overall but were disappointed with the size of the room which was quite small and the bed which had a sag in the middle. The real kicker was the large roach we found in the shower on our last day. Definitely disappointing. I informed the front desk as we checked out and was told they would have the room treated.;3
"I travel to NY often for business and struggle to find a hotel worth the price.  This is why I Airbnb majority of the time I travel to NY.  The New Yorker is a decent hotel with a friendly staff.  Hidden ""facility fees"", tiny rooms and paper thin walls.  My first night I had to call security because 2 families nextdoor to me where up until 2am with screaming children running in and out of the hallways.  The hotel couldn't move me into another room, but happily did the next morning when same families were up at 7am making so much noise.    The art deco style is charming, but not worth the stay.";3
The location of this hotel is great, but there are lots of hotels in New York that are situated well. The lobby is nice, and there is a 24 hour diner on site. The manager I dealt with, Meghan, was sympathetic and helpful. Unfortunately, thatâs all the good points.  There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room( tough if youâve been travelling for 10 hours) and although there is water, this is chargeable at $5 per bottle. The lifts upto floor 20 are frequent, anything above that, you best be prepared for a wait. If you want to leave your luggage, perhaps because you have a later flight, itâs charged at $5 dollars per bag, per hour, first time Iâve come across that in Manhattan, perhaps we have been lucky.  Late checkout is charged at $50 ( I think that gives you 3 hours on;3
This hotel is in a good location for seeing the sights. But thatâs all it has going for it. The rooms are very small, not enough wardrobe space, no tea or coffee making facilities and a dusty bathroom. I donât think housekeeping realise the door has a back to it. We had to change rooms as ours was so dark. Donât go to the bar as the drinks are far to expensive, 20 dollars for 2 small drinks. One guy on reception was very rude. They even charge you to leave your luggage on the day you depart.;3
VERY BASIC, no microwave,(we had to pay $10 and $100 for a deposit to have a microwave) no water provided in the room, limited toiletries, poor water pressure in the shower, no choice for lighter comforter, cheep quality coffee in the room and restaurant, no robe or sleepers...Lighting in the room is very poor, carpets looked dirty even under those conditions. Some of the elevators didn't work, long wait time for each trip. Dinning menu is very basic, some breakfast items were reused from the night before buffet dinning. Some food items on display were cold, the heating from underneath went out. Long wait line for dinner buffet, inadequate planning for a big crowd.   People from outside sneak in and use the pool. Cleanup around pool is sporadic.;3
The hotel seems ok to me: it is rather well located, close to times sq., many deli shops and right next to penn station and the moynihan train hall, just a small walk away from the 5th ave. and very close also to hudson yards and the high line. The lobby is good looking in a nyc art deco style. Once inside the elevators seem a bit old and not very well kept but they have many cars to serve the whole place. The floors look a bit odd with large aisles with no atmosphere. The rooms are rather small but good enough. They are simple with just a few spaces for stuff and a decent bathroom with a gas station-like wc but clean enough. (The shower had an amazing pressure I haven't seen before). They charge you for keeping your lugagge either at check in or check out but, with me, they;3
Make sure when you eat at this restaurant for their breakfast buffet that to not do it 30  minutes before they end the breakfast buffet because they will give you a rude hint to leave your table. Our server was sweeping under our table while we were still eating our breakfast. Even though my husband voiced out his frustration, he kept on sweeping under our chairs and table.;3
"I stayed in Room 406 late May early June 2012. The room was clean, and it was cleaned satisfactorily every day.  The room was modest: See photos.  The bath towels were small, but when I asked for extra they gave me extra.  I used the microwave in the basement to cook my cereal. The front desk people were courteous.  They stored some perishables for me in a small refrigerator at the front desk.  My bed was firm but I slept well on it.  There were NO BUGS, of any kind, that I could perceive, in my room.  Repeat: In my room I did not get bitten or grossed out in any way.  This place is very convenient to the Grand St. subway station.  And I had a view of the park across the street, where people exercise in the mornings and play soccer.  This is smack dab in Chinatown; it's likely";3
So disappointed .....New York has  been on my bucket list for year's....room was teeny tiny,our view was of windows directly opposite usð Tiles in bathroom dirty...lifts an absolute nightmare...waiting for ages. Staff so-so,the doormen outside we're the most friendly and helpful.Would not return;3
Hotel was great for location, just 2 blocks from the metro station. Very nice and helpful staff at front desk.  Helped me book 3 tours for my son and I, and also car service arrangements, making things very easy. The tours we took with Starline picked us up at the hotel, so that was also very convenient.  No frills room, but very comfortable and clean. Breakfast, complimentary, with a made to order omelette and waffle bar, very nice omelette chef, delicious. Coffee, really bad. There is a Starbucks very close by.;3
Be forewarned....the elevators are super slow.  They have 5 but when you call the elevator, only one comes at a time and during peak hours, it can take forever to get to and from your room.  This hotel is a bit dated so I guess the elevators are old too.  Could use an upgrade.    I came down to Universal with my two kids on a whim and thought it make for a fun getaway.  Upon arrival, everything was great.  There was a bit of a wait during check-in (we arrived around 1:30PM).  We got an upgraded room with the Universal view!!!  Great right???  Well.....as we went up to our room, we put the card key in and it turns out, THE ROOM WAS ALREADY OCCUPIED!!!  How crazy is that?  We have stayed at many, many hotels all around the world and this has NEVER happened to us.  Very;3
CONS: I still don't understand why they only had one glass shower door for the shower.  Water got ALL over the place and I spent at least 10 minutes every time wiping up the floors.    Elevators are ridiculously slow  Sub-par in room air conditioning  PROS: Great Location  Friendly Staff  Rooftop Bar & Pool;3
"decent size room and a good location. The bathroom was very small but the shower worked well; bed was comfortable; staff offered waters to couple next to us checking in but not us-- I had to ask for water. I did not like that first impression.";3
It was a family visit to Universal Studios - first time for the kids. And we thought staying in Hilton is always a pleasurable experience! But this Hilton didn't live up to our expectations! Booking was made on Hilton website and it did not tell us 1) Breakfast is not included 2) There's no executive lounge.  Upon arrival the room was not ready and inspite of being a Hhonors Gold member, didn't get room on time or any extra perks! I was given breakfast coupons for two and the check in clerk didn't bother to mention that kids breakfast has to be purchased. Only when asked again on the second day I was sheepishly offered discount coupons! But since the breakfast was pathetic for vegetarians - which is a first for me in any Hilton worldwide- I did not bother picking it up later!;3
Unfortunately this was a bad experience for me and my girlfriend.  The location of the place is of cores convenient and some employs are very friendly, but the management of the hotel is really far from ideal:  - Breakfast is very poor. No hot food, only serials and milk, some bread, tea and coffee. - Hotel doesn't give proper forks/ plate/ knife in the room, only plastic ones. This is embarrassing! - room cleaning service was never this annoying. First day, cleaning staff showed up at 4:30 pm, and if you can't let them in at that time, they won't clean your room as the working hours for cleaning are till 5 pm. I guess hotel doesn't take into consideration the fact that guests not always available to jump out of the room immediately. We went through a long debate with the day;3
Our reviews can be little influenced by the fact that we were in NYC for the first time and we were completely thrilled by it all. It is true that the hotel is a bit older, but still performs its function well. We had a room on the top floor, where, we later learned, was reconstructed, so the room was very spacious and newly furnished. The lower floors areapparently awful and you can feel cigarette smoke. From our own experience we have - we were very excited. Only the bathroom is tiny! Breakfast we did not manage to taste, because short walk away is the supermarket, which is open 24 hours a day and you will find there really all, and there are many restaurants around. Metro is a 2-minute walk away, so too great. If I may recommend, if you make a reservation, write, that you;3
The location of this hotel is just great. It is 12 minutes walking distance from Times Square. We walked to the Empire State Building and to Central Park also. Best Bagels and Starbucks are just right in the corner, so you will not need to worry about breakfast. The room was just OK. It is clean enough however do not expect much. It is a little bit noisy but it is totally understandable since it is in the middle of Manhattan. The room was also cold and the heater just stopped working in the middle of the night. But it was working the next day.;3
"We spent six days at Wyndham New Yorker. That was a very pleasant stay.  Apparently, we were told when we cheked out, we got af free upgrade. The room was very good. Very clean and nice. Good shower. Space enough for two. Very comfortable bed. It was on the eigth floor. There was some noice from the street - earplugs solved that.  The hotel charge a ""service fee"", 29 dollars per day. That cover for ex. fittnes-center. You have to pay even if you do not use any of the ""services"" the fee cover. That is not satisfying. The  hotel aught to charge guests that use the services. But we were informed about the fee when we booked, so it did not come as a surprise.  The hotel is places very central on Manhattan. It is easy get aorund from there. If you want to stay in a relative (NYC is";3
They charged extra for everything, even the kuerig coffee that was in the room. The room was clean, but really beat up. The room was very warm (in March) so we had to run the AC, unit was so loud that it was difficult to sleep on the very hard bed. No ice makers, had to order from room service, when they remembered to bring it. The location was awesome, but that was about it.;3
This hotel could easily rate higher by just replacing the mattresses and pillows. The property is well kept, the rooms were clean, but the beds were the cheapest imaginable and difficult to sleep in. The location is great, right next to Chinatown and Little Italy. Very quiet, sitting right next to a small park. Metro entrance 100m down the street. Walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge. Staff was very friendly. A great bargain for NYC hotels, if you can sleep on an Army mattress.;3
This hotel is located within walking distance from central park and the 96th Street Subway station. The staff were helpful. The rooms are outdated but ok for an overnight stay. There is no parking at the hotel.;3
elevator was out of order when i arrived, and the staff didn't offer to help me with my luggage as I climbed the stairs to the auxiliary elevator, BUT, to their credit, they listened to my concern, and offered me two comps to a continental breakfast. it's a nice enough hotel, with cheaper room rates than their neighbors. if you want a no frill, clean room, you'll be fine here, just not excited.;3
We stayed at the New Yorker for one night.  We got a great deal right on the hotelâs website for a suite on a Friday night, which is a plus.  So it had 2 bathrooms, and a separate living room.  That was really great because the regular rooms are small.  It is in need of some desperate updating though.  I donât mean to say that it is dirty, it is neat and clean.  It just feels like it has looked the same for such a long time, it needs to be modernized.  The one thing that I didnât like, and it might sound silly, is that the handle to flush the toilets were like the ones in a public bathroom.  To me, that is just not classy for a hotel at all.  Also, the shower heads are terrible.  The water squirted everywhere and the pressure was really hard.  The walls are also paper thin, so;3
Pretty on the outside and beautiful general area but the details on the inside fall short. No coffee makers in room.  Coffee $8.00 from room service. No climate control in room. Very loud outside if you can open the old and very heavy window. Towels thin and like sandpaper. Beefcake bartenders who prioritize beautiful women. Bellmen are the exception, friendly, helpful and accommodating. I travel a lot and this hotel is a head scratcher.;3
Nothing special about this hotel except for the staff. Really nice and eager to please! The rooms were not as clean as I would expect from a full service Hilton - but the bed was really comfortable. I will return to this hotel simply because I found the staff to be so wonderful.;3
A nice modern airport hotel with open plan at ground floor with a nice breakfast buffet and a good shuttle to the airport. However check in in the early hours was totally unacceptable and a terrible way to experience the hotel on arrival. An airport hotel MUST work as well at 1:00 am as at any day time hour;3
Room was very small, heater was very loud but seemed to have a calming effect and block out some of the outside noise. Our window didn't stay open so had to roll up a towel and stick in it.  Bathroom was tiny, no shower door so water went everywhere, also looked like a lot of water damage. Positive - room was cleaned thoroughly daily.  Close to central park, a bit far from Times Square.;3
Rooms were extremely small and somewhat outdated.  I was expecting small as its NYC, but much smaller than other hotels I've stayed at in the city with hardly any room to walk around when your luggage is open.;3
Let's start with the good staff.  It's an art deco kind of place, the interior of the lobby and the restaurant are fabulous.  The staff are great and the concierge, Chris, is worth his weight in gold.  We ordered a standard room and it was small, so small we couldn't both fit in the bathroom at the same time and we had to walk past the bed single file.  It was tired and could do with some love.  But it was comfortable.  We stayed 4 nights and went to DC.  Returned to the hotel on our way back for 3 nights and our room had a leak, from the ceiling.  They fixed the problem really quickly, moving us to a superior king suite which was luxurious compared to the standard room.  Overall if you have a good sense of humour, the hotel is OK.  It's located close to Central Park and 5th;3
Transportation shuttle was very nice and hotel is bright and airy.  Our room was also wonderful and quiet with a view of the airport. Great bed and shower.  Buffet breakfast was a real treat.  Our check-in process was not good - desk staff were not helpful with their issue - that was surprising as Hyatt service is usually outstanding.;3
I've learned not to expect a lot from NYC hotels unless I want to spend a fortune.   My husband and I were going to a concert at the Beacon, and needed a room to accommodate 4 on the Upper West Side that didn't cost a fortune.    This fit the bill.   The staff was courteous and helpful, and the place was relatively clean.   It could use an update and a better TV, but then they'd charge more.  Also, it was the slowest elevator ever.    Otherwise, OK.;3
My husband and I stayed at the Jane Hotel after reading reviews that it was trendy and in close location to a subway stop. While all this is true and very cool there are some things I would like to point out to help future travelers. First-the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Springs were sticking in my back and my husband actually ended up sleeping in the floor because it was so uncomfortable. Second-the front staff. Although there were typically two attendants in staff, it seemed that they couldn't multitask and take care of more than one quest at a time. It is typical that guests will turn in their key when they go out or come back in but having to wait in line to get a key reprogrammed was not time efficient for the guest or the staff. If I may suggest that even though the;3
Visited 3 years ago and upgraded before arrival to one of the newer rooms and wanted to do the same when we return in September as I've booked with virgin and they don't offer the upgrades but advised I could do this directly but I can't get in touch with the hotel - I live in the UK so can't call and none of the email addresses I find online, I get a response to. We're travelling for a celebration so I'll be gutted if we can't get a better room as I know the unrefirbished rooms are tired and disappointing so really hoping the hotel can respond to this with a way to help me upgrade for September!   The group Wyndham email response just told me to phone the hotel and when I explained I couldn't in my second email it went ignored so I feel like this is the only want to go to get a;3
The hotel is kind of a dump, the rooms are older, there is a lot of wear and tear in general. But next time I visit NYC I plan on making another reservation here! It is in a great location, very close to the 72nd subway station, and I never felt unsafe here.  You really are getting what you pay for. Id recommend this hotel to anyone who isnt planning to spend a lot of time at the actual hotel. We just wanted a place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing, in an area we would feel safe in at night and this was perfect.  If you are going to be spend alot of time in the hotel, you might want to check around for a different place to stay.  The rooms were clean, the staff was very helpful and friendly. The lack of a shower/bathroom in the room wasnt ideal, but we didnt have any;3
Rooms require renovation, particularly air conditioning and bathrooms.  Internet was fast. The restaurant was closed, and I was not informed of that when booking, would have been good to know, as I am a room service sort of person.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.;3
We paid $126 a night,  for that rate it was an OK hotel.  It's on the older side. The bathroom is just big enough to have one person standing in it at a time.  It had some kind of red dirt could be blood running down the door jam of the bathroom.   Not the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. The location I think is the biggest draw for this hotel it's a great location,it's central to everything. I would stay again only if I had a very good rate again.;3
The rooms were too small. You had to pay extra to get a coffee pot or refrigerator. Bathroom was extra small too. But the bed was very comfortable. Didn't like that they put a hold on your credit for amount of stay even though you were paying cash. Location is good.;3
I stayed at this hotel with my baby cousin for three nights in June, and we were perfectly happy with our stay.  I got a really great deal on the hotel, and was very pleased that the hotel offered 2 double beds rather than just 2 twin beds or one double bed.  After reading some of the reviews, though, I was a bit tentative about what we would find when we arrived.  However, we were both very pleased with our stay.  We arrived at noon, and even thoug check in is not until 3:00, our room was ready so se were able to go ahead and check in.  The room was a bit outdated and in need of a fresh coat of paint and some new carpet, but the bathroom was newly refinished, which made up for the room's shortcomings.  The beds were comfortable, and the linens were perfectly clean.   Our only;3
Originally, several incidents were the cause for me to write a harsh review of this property (which has now been deleted, thank you TripAdvisor).  While, there in fact were issues at this location, like the plumbing being exposed and the property not having a full time door attendant (they do, but they must have been on a break). The other issue that I had with the service was when requesting to be notified about my transportation but referred to the concierge to put in my request.  The most serious issue was in their Hotel Bar, when there was a shouting match between another patron and one of my colleagues.  The other patron was a jerk, and we were not comfortable in that establishment anymore, so we took our party to another location. The Bar manager and bartender tried to;3
We made a last minute trip to go to Universal Studio Hollywood and saw a good hotel/airfare package on Expedia. Had no problems at check-in/out. Everything went smoothly. Had parking fees at the time of check out since we had a rental car during our stay. We stayed on the 21st floor, king bed with views of the city. The bathroom was remodeled, it was nice. The hotel is old but it's okay. We were not expecting much since our main focus was the park. Overall experience of the hotel was comfortable and good enough. I would stay here again in the future.;3
Art Deco style building - rooms are small but ok - entre like in the 50s - bathroom small and old - bed are a bit slept over - tic tic bar ok for a quick bite - staff friendly - close to the Empire State Building and Times Square;3
Ok, let's get this out of the way - I only booked this hotel because the people we were traveling with had already booked it. We got there and the hotel was clean enough, i suppose, but the rooms were freexing. i called the front desk because the heat and air is regulated down stairs (you only have control over the force of air, not the temp) and I was told that they were not turning on the heat yet but I could use the space heater. Excuse me? A space heater? Are you kidding me? They were not, so we slept in a freezing room b/c space heaters dont heat very weel AND I was not going to sleep with it on all night. The next night, I spilled something on the comforter and was told by the front desk that they did not have extras? Really? No extras? Amazing. The breakfast was fine and;3
The location was great, right by the train station and in such a relaxed beautiful area. It wasn't busy and right next door to Starbucks and nice restaurants. The room was very averGe but I mean that's why it's pretty cheap for New York. The wifi was not working at all so that was a real pain in the backside because I had to go to Starbucks all the time. No breakfast facilities and the staff were nice but the concierge lady was so hard to understand.;3
A great base to explore NY from.  Room was small but it was clean.  Staff- great uniforms!  Shared bathroom- not a huge problem, it's worth the reduction in price to share.  Room secure and nice location.   Check in and check out was easy.  Room had Wifi!;3
We stayed here two years ago and had no complaints! However, we were slightly disappointed this trip. We were here right before Xmas, so the rooms were obviously extremely expensive. We were put in a room that was SO small we could barely walk around the bed. Though the rooms are modern and funky, they are now looking VERY tired. We also had a major problem with the AC in our room. We would wake up in the middle of the night in a sauna.... there was no way, however, to control the temperature in the room. We made a complaint the next day, but the second night was no better. If we were going to stay a third night I would have demanded to change rooms....;3
"Fantastic to be across the street from Lincoln Center! Actually like the feel of the lobby.  Rooms are quite tiny, but acceptable. Bathroom is minuscule. Rooftop Bar transmits noise directly into 11th floor rooms to the point that fixtures in the room vibrate. Elevator unreliability impairs ability to exit the hotel at a predictable time. But I'm not trying to be overly harsh, because the proof is in the pudding; I would actually return to this hotel.";3
"Double bed very small, no channel on TV (no signal), no kitchen utensils provided, not every room has airconditioning, no hangs on the wall. Location is good; shops, cafÃ©s, pubs and restaurants on Broadway";3
"I booked online at the Ramada website. The reservations page showed an average nightly rate and a total including tax. When I receive the confirmation email seconds later the rate had increased! Both average and total with tax were higher; not significantly but it was different. I called to explain and my concerns were ignored. On a 13 night stay the hotel could at least have honored the originally displayed rate.";3
"Pros: - location is very convenient to Hollywood ;pleasant and helpful staff ; clean ;very near metro line  Cons: -expensive parking ; smelly room; not enough lights;noise Overall, its okay to stay for the price (except for the parking fees).";3
I spent here 5n on a business trip. No doubt the location is great, right in the middle of Theatre District, 10â walking from Times Square, 5-7â from two different subway lines. Room was ok size, typical NY I should say, clean and modern, nice bathroom with rainforest shower. However, the noise from the street was terrible, almost like there was no window! Really annoying, unless youâre so gifted to be able to sleep with any noise conditions. You have to pay $20/n for council tax and fees (newspapers, WiFi, use of the gym, two bottles of Fiji water?!?). Definitely I would not go back if I wasnât given a quieter room.;3
The rooms are rather small for the price.  As a result I do not consider this Hotel good value.  Check in time was 3:00pm,  Many rooms were not available at that time.  I personally do not like a facilities charge which is NOT optional.;3
We stayed here for three nights. We got into town early and were able to check in with no problem. We had a bunk room with the shared bath. Rooms are extremely small and are for sleeping and resting only. They do have a lot of hooks and drawers under the bed to store your clothes and items. The lighting in the room is low and the window is small so there is not a lot of light in the rooms. Our air conditioner worked very well, kept the room nice and cool.   The hallways are not air conditioned and have open windows throughout the building. The bathrooms have two sinks, two doors for the toilets and two shower stalls. They were always kept clean and you never had to wait. There isn't much privacy if you need to use the sink and/or hair dryer. You should bring with you a hand;3
Myself and 3 friends stayed there for 4 nights at the end of Feb. We were aged between 23-25 and weren't fussy.  We were only looking for somewhere to sleep and leave our bags. After reading the reviews I wasn't looking forward to it. When we got there we were pleasantly surprised. The room were tiny but clean and warm and the bathroom was nice. The bed was fairly small too but very comfortable. We asked on the second night for a smoking room and we came home to find they had moved everything for us - great. The lift was very slow & I nearly gave myself a coronary climbing to the top floor. The radiators did bang very bad a night but we copped on after the first night and turned them off going to bed & on in the morning which worked, the room was always warm. It was about a;3
I was quite wary of this hostel, myself and my boyfriend where staying in it for 3 nights before we got set up in an apartment for the summer living and working in NYC. I was pleasantly surprised how clean it was, we booked into a double room with a shared bathroom. The bathroom was cleaned a few times a day and the bed had fresh sheets on every morning.  I will stay again on a budget.;3
The hotel is dated and could do with modernising. The location is not too bad and it is very easy and safe to travel downtown at any time. There are many stores and retails outlets and other places to hang out in the area if you want to stay local. There is also a prity good cinema near 84th St. Central park is walking distance around the corner and is handy if you want to go for a walk. The hotel itself could do with a facelift and general cleanup. The staff are friendly and helpful, our room was cleaned to a good standard everyday without failure. I wanted another room because my room was close to the main road and was offered one almost straight away. The lifts are slow and i had to go down 6 floors by the stairwell a few times. The rooms are a good size and clean. The;3
Great place to crash before an early morning flight...but....don't eat there. Rooms are clean and bed is great - also view from room was great...restaurant was so disappointing...I had dinner with my son - and it was bad from edamames to the rib-eye - even my drafted beer was bad...;3
Overall, I liked the property. The staff was friendly and the location was great. They are also pet friendly which is a plus. My only issue was with warm water in my room, but I would recommend this hotel to a friend.;3
Booked here because of proximity to Penn Station / access to EWR. Figured rooms would be tiny in an old hotel and they were. No problem there. Downsides: once they have your email address they just don't let up in their effort to squeeze every last nickle out of you. Frequent offers to buy upgrades, meals, tours, etc., etc. Arrive daily in the run up to your stay. Want a check-in prior to 4pm? That will be $ 50. Late check out? Same.  If you're above the 20th floor better budget up to a 15 minute wait for an elavator. And hell awaits those with animal dander allergies. Decades of visitors for the Westminster and other animal pageants make this place a severe challenge to breathe in. Getting our train to the airport was a breeze though.;3
The private room was ok, but the tv was not working during the 11 days I spent there. The wifi was ok. The receptionists are not too friendly, they don't say even a good morning. The local is very safe and easy to get to the subway. There is a kitchen in each floor, but the microwave was not clean. The housekeeper staff was friendly differently from the receptionists.;3
"The rooms are very small, but if you are travelling light, as I was, and alone, there isn't much need for more room. I was worried that the bed would be too small for my 6'2"" frame, but I was quite comfortable.  I liked the funky retro feel of the place (bellhops in uniforms, stuffed animals in the lobby). I wish that the check-in person had said where the shared bathrooms were...took me a minute or two and I was desperate.  Worst thing...the restaurant staff was insulting and inept. No more than four other people in the place when I went in, and the staff was rude, slow, and didn't seem to understand the idea of customer service. Inexcusable.  I could hear thumping from the club downstairs. Any louder and I might have been bothered, but it wasn't too bad.   That said, I will";3
Beautiful art deco hotel built in 1930s slap bang in the centre of Manhattan. Stayed on the 34th floor which has good views albeit the rooms are a bit small but its New York city so space is a premium here at $1000000 per square foot in some areas so not a bad deal at $230 a night! Rooms are in need of renovation, staff are friendly and the tick tock diner is a great place to eat and watch the madness of a city that really doesn't sleep.;3
An unpretentious main entrance leads in to a modern open plan ,nicely decorated reception /bar /seating area . We were checked in by a curtly efficient, but charmless automaton who did not create a wonderful first impression. A lot of other reviewers rave about the staff..I found them so-so...neither better nor worse than anywhere else. The rooms were slightly on the small side , but this is New York after all, so maybe they were the norm.  Well enough decorated , just not a lot of space to store luggage or clothing if your stay is more than 2-3 nights. The wet room looked quite recently modernised and was fine except for the fact that spray from the shower soaked almost the whole floor, no matter how you angled it. Location is good if you want to be close to all the Buzz of the;3
I've just returned from 5 days in NY with my Mum, and 4 nights staying at this hotel.  I really cannot understand why it has been given such bad reviews.  The price you pay when booking this hotel indicates that it's not 5* luxury but it's nothing like the terrible reviews it has had.  On arrival the doorman came out of the hotel and wouldn't let us carry our bags in - he then started chatting about our visit with us.  The lady on reception let us check in early and she was so nice.  Our room was basic but clean, with two double beds.  The bathroom was also clean with a decent size bath and a very hot shower.  There was complimentary shower gel/soaps etc. The maid came in and cleaned every day.  There was plenty of wardrobe/storage space too.  To be honest, for the amount of;3
Pros: Premier Plus room as expected, large, very clean and comfortable with a great walk in rain shower.   Cons: Arrived on the coldest day of the year and the check-in queue was down the street. Took around 30 minutes standing in freezing temperatures before getting into the building itself. Only one self check in machine open and one other staff member checking in. Really need more.  Hotel up steps with no step free access so a struggle with a heavy suitcase. Hotel entrance, lobby area and corridors very shabby and not very clean. Same with lifts. Strange smell in corridors, certainly not usual level of Premier Inn clean. Very noisy during first and last nights with children running up and down on floor above at 2am. Eventually stopped when an adult yelled!  Last night, woken;3
A good example of it's kind. Staff are an asset, but the travel concierge was less than helpful. Knowledge of local transport was very poor and could not accept we did not want to drive.. She was clearly committed to her commission!!!!  If you are visiting Universal Studios this is excellent,  if not it is miles away from everything. Breakfast is way over priced and there is limited choice nearby.;3
On arriving at the hotel the interior looked amazing. Very dark looking and cosy... But on arriving in to our room which was a superior twin double on the 11th floor, we found it very small and dark even with the curtains still being open. Having two suitcases, the wardrobe space was very small with not enough hangers supplied for a room that's meant for two, in which your clothes fold as the safe is nestled underneath. I had to put 4 dresses on one hanger! The bathroom also being very small and tired looking also had no space for products (the shelf was too small).  Also, I found it very annoying that the wifi was free for the general public, being stated as 'hotel lobby - complimentary access' who were using the facilities for meetings or drinks, but for people who are paying;3
I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Since the overall rating is 4 stars, I went for 3 to average it out. Too many reviews of this place (and everywhere) are for 5 or 1 star.  There is not a single thing about this hotel that would prevent me from returning. There's also not a single thing that would make this an automatic top choice when staying by LAX.  The good: the shuttle service is really excellent. The rooms are pretty spacious and higher floors have a nice view. I also appreciate that there are sufficient outlets and power ports by the bed. The pool is large. And if you have lounge access, it is spacious and not overcrowded.  Not as good: Instead of a desk, the rooms have a round table with two funky and not so comfortable chairs. The water pressure in the bathroom is;3
The Empire Hotel is in the prime location for Lincoln Center and Central Park access, and for most of your shopping needs.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Check to make sure the elevators are all in service.;3
While I always enjoy the âold New Yorkâ feel of this hotel, the hidden facility fees put a damper on my trip, especially since they refused to put it on the company card that booked the trip without 19 authorizations and a spare kidney. Better to just raise the room rate and be transparent with guests. The $30 per night doesnât bother me. The principle does. Poor form, Wyndham.;3
We stayed at this hotel for two nights because of its location (opposite Universal Studios) It is very easy to get to by metro line from Downtown LA at a cost of $1.50 per person.  The rooms were clean but dated.  We were supplied with one T bag and 2 coffe bags and 1 paper cup between 2 adults and 2 children, two attempts to the front desk to request more supplies.    The Seafood buffet is very good but expensive considering the amount of restuarants at Universal Studios but gave it a try.  (Freshly prepared lobster brought to your table)  and heaps of other choices for a 3 course meal. The pool area is a real let down as the outdoor furniture is so dated though fresh clean towels were provided and the spa was heated to a beautiful temperature.;3
THE GOOD:  Across the street from Universal Studios, comfortable bed, room, and bathroom, great views of the freeway and Universal Studios itself, easy in/out of parking garage, fitness center  THE BAD:  Extra charge for wifi, parking fees.  I did not bring this up with management, but there was a very noticeable draft coming from the taped up windows.  Yep, the window that used to open was TAPED!  Weird for a Hilton property - I'd expect this to come from a roadside motel.  THE UGLY:  Parking garage isn't convenient to the hotel.  You have to take an elevator to the lobby, then walk past the restaurant and the lobby to get to another bank of elevators to your room.  Getting to Universal Studios involves walking through the lobby, past the restaurant, through a corridor past all;3
Supposedly a premium hotel, so we expected better...  The rooms are non-smoker, but ours smelled musty, and there must have been smokers there before us.  The air conditioner fan was so noisy, we had to turn it off to sleep.  The shower controls are ancient with no temp control, and I would be boiling one second, freezing the next, and then boiling again.  On the day we were leaving, the maid just walked in on us at 9AM. One knock, then used the key and walked in. No calling in. No verifying that we had not yet checked out.  She saw us naked, but that was her problem. She had no business coming in at that hour, let alone unannounced when we were checking out 3 hours later.  The location is excellent. That is about the only positive thing I can find to write... :(;3
First of all the hotels location is great for universal studios. It's a 10 minute walk to the park entrance and city walk.   The rooms are big and modern. However, the amenities are shocking for a chain of this size.  No wifi unless you want pay a large fee for 24 hour access. They charge you nearly $4.00 for water in your room.    We stayed in smaller hotels dueing tge course of our near threeweeks in California and had complimentary wifi in hotels except here. In others we even had complimentary champagne.  Would only recommend staying here if you are going to universal studios and being close is important.;3
This is exactly what it says it is: A budget hotel.  It's run down and extremely basic, but it works if cost is a concern and you don't plan on spending much time in your room.  There is no individual climate control and the AC units don't work (you can open your window).  Check your room and bed thoroughly for bed bugs. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and there are some great bodegas close by.;3
Be sure you have the bell person wait will the a c fan comes on to see if you donât need to change rooms in order to sleep well or even hear the tv      If cleanliness is important, Iâm not sure this is your first choice;3
My husband booked the room with the Hilton directly for the 2 of us.  Upon arrival , we were given a room with 2 double beds, even though we had requested a king or queen.  They have no wait list , so we had to check everyday to change rooms.  Finally two days later a king was available, though they had no record at all of our request!  After speaking to no less than 6 people!  None the less, the rooms were very clean , very spacious with decent views.  Room service menu is extensive and the food was excellent (pricey, of course). The pool is very nice with an oasis like feel with lawn and cabanas , but poolside service is lacking.  You have to really hunt for menus and a phone to place an order.  It seems it would benefit everyone greatly to have easy access to smoothies,;3
Good location near to Macy's and Times Square. Downside is bathroom badly needed updating couldn,t have a bath because enamel peeling so could only use shower . Walls paper thin when next door used shower at 2am. It woke us up thought they in our room also bathroom shelf tiny and floor in bathroom needed replacing. This aside the ticktock diner was good for breakfast and we had cocktails in italian in hotel which was nice also. I paid 160 pounds for 6 nights resort fee which I think really steep . Would only return if better bathroom;3
We went to the U2 concert at MSG, just a 1 minute walk away. And that is the main strength of this hotel: the location. Nearly everything is in walking distance! We walked to shows on Broadway, to restaurants and to many stores for some shopping.  The room on the 8th floor was very small (nearly European style) and the bathroom was really too small (cruise ship size). Also because it is an old hotel, the windows are not sealed, so all the noice from the streets comes in at night (some awful drilling going on the last 2 nights). We stayed 4 nights and the room and bathroom were clean and neat. Nevertheless, besides the excellent location, we would not recommend this hotel.;3
Location of this hotel is great, particullarly if interested in Broadway shows. The hotel staff is very helpful, especially when checking in & out. Hoever the room we had even on upper floor with nice view, was just a bit on the small size. But even over looking the size of the room, it was difficult to overlook the size of the bath room, which appeared to be dropped into the room as if it was a small converted closet.Again many plusses to this strategically located up scale hotel, but a bit pricey for the accomadations.;3
I found on Hall way trays and next I found again exactly at same position, carpet was nasty, inside of the room the bathroom wasn't clean enough, no Microwave, The hotel has a nice decoration and nice architecture but not enough cleaned like others hotel of same category, anyway its was bad experience.;3
This hotel has an excellent location and great ambiance, but the rooms are somewhat weathered looking and the elevators are old and take FOREVER. I would give this hotel a much better rating if the service people were slightly more friendly and the rooms were repaired to look new - oh and if their elevators worked properly and promptly.;3
Stayed in this hotel last year for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon as they were offering a free night and so our travel agent was able to get us this 4* for the same price as 3* we had seen. The location was GREAT! Really close to Times Square and Central Park but the room was teeny tiny, looked loads bigger in the pictures AND it backed onto the air conditioning units (or at least that's what they looked like, can't say the rooms were overly cool!). The noise from the upstairs bar carried a long way and we heard people coming and going all night, but we were near the lifts so perhaps that is why. The concierge wasn't great, giving us information about the subway ticketing system that was over a year out of date BUT that said, if you are just looking for somewhere to rest;3
Can't beat location. Proximity to Penn Station made this very easy to get to when I arrived. I walked to the hotel. Also, centrally located to get to Times Square. Hardly any yellow Taxis. Need Uber. I was surprised at how old the hotel looked once inside. The rugs are very old and worn. However, there was no musty smell.  The room was clean and small as expected. No mini bar. No water for the guest. Ice machine on another floor. Staff were nice. I liked the extra security at the entry of the elevators. Ate at restaurant for lunch, Bianca (right off hotel) and I thought it was good.;3
On the face of it, the hotel has a lot going for it: location just across Lincoln Center, a couple of blocks from a subway, and a decent rooftop bar. However, the hotel is very dated, the corridors dark and the windows dirty. The lobby area obviously had a touch-up, but not much else of the hotel (or I was just supremely unlucky with the room I got). Staff is fine, though.;3
The breakfast was pretty great, thanks Hugo! The rooms are not bad and good comfy bed. I think it stated the pool is heated and it wasn't! But the pool area is nice and great to relax in.   However... I am giving a lower rating based on the following.  What really annoyed me is the house keeping. I'm not talking about the room cleanliness but the lack of following directions!!! I am the type of traveler how does not need my room to be cleaned everyday which we requested. I hung the little sign indicating no house keeping and since we did no request anyone coming in I did not put anything away assuming no one would come in. When we returned our stuff was moved so that the bed could be made and I happened to leave some change on the counter which the housekeeper took assuming it;3
Hotel has gone downhill! Used to rate this hotel highly but since they changed and cheapened the Regency Club with their putrid food selection no more! The staff is still great especially Cairo and Derek too bad they did this to the club.;3
Beautifully remodeled rooms, beautiful building, nice staff, good continental breakfast. Not a place to be walking out after dark, especially alone. I was alone on this trip and didnât even feel comfortable driving near it. Drug users and homeless everywhere. I think you may be ok during the day but being single I did not try it.  Also, if youâd like to sleep past 6:30 without doors slamming constantly, you should find a different hotel. The beautiful, heavy doors have nothing on them to keep from slamming loudly. They have a sign saying to respect the others but obviously that isnât working. They need to actually put something on them.  All in all, it was a great nights sleep until 6ish. ð the bed was very comfortable if you like a more firm mattress.;3
Stayed here with my adult family for 3 nights. Reception staff are very helpful (and apologetic)! Breakfast staff OK but could be better. Rooms are clean but tired and need updating particularly the bathroom. Shower, skirting boards, door frames all need attention. Rooms on small side but fine if your stay is short.  Breakfast is good... If you live the all American. Small amounts of the 'healthy stuff' is available. They had no fruit one morning and when I asked for some I was told the produce didn't arrive the day before! Really??? We're talking LA here not the middle of Africa! I did complain at reception and the next day we had fruit.  The gym was NOT clean! Again complained 2 days on the trot as nobody attended to the matter. On the third day hooray it was cleaned;3
After an exhaustive search, we found this hotel in our price range. It was really affordable for the excellent location, just a stone's throw from Central Park. You can also pick up a bus or subway entrance within 2 blocks. There was a great coffee shop nearby as well. Clean white duvets. Pleasant lobby and staff.  Now, the downside - there were absolutely no extras here. No complimentary breakfast. I never found a nice machine despite being given a bucket. We had towels but no washcloths. The carpets were filthy. The a/c was a small, outdated window unit so the room felt hot and stuffy. The bathroom was way too cramped for three guests to get in and out of. There is an elevator but two people with one suitcase each will be stuffed like sardines. We had to wait a long time for;3
I love the Empire, it's been one of my fav. Hotels in NYC since the 90's. The lobby, bar, and service overall are spectacular. But the rooms REALLY need some TLC. They are just weathered.   The hotel is in the perfect location to explore. Upon check in we asked for a room with a view as it was friends' first trip to NYC. They did not disappoint and we had a very nice view on the top floor. The doormen and front desk staff were top notch.  I do feel like they Nickle & Dime you a bit though- but that is common in a lot of NYC hotels. I do think for the room price you should get bottled water! The mini-bar prices are higher than any other hotel I've ever seen in my entire life. I was also surprised to see service automatically added into our drinks tab in the lobby bar. Then a;3
Stopped here for 4 nights at the end of September. Arrived late due to delays to be informed that they only had a smoking room left. I was not happy with this but the front desk said that they would try and sort something out the next day. Our first night was spent in a really small room that needed refurbishment. When we moved to a different room, this was a little larger but still very small, dark and tired. The wardrobe was tiny. The smallest I've ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom was also the smallest I've ever seen. It had a shower with no door so that the water went everywhere and no place to put any toiletries.  We booked this hotel for the roof bar and pool as it was recommended by our travel agent and we thought it would be a good way to relax. Unfortunately it was;3
"This hotel was extremely nice and high end; the employees were great!  We had reserved a 2 queen room and received 2 full size beds.  We could not make the shower work and the mini fridge froze our food.  Could have been better with more attention to detail.";3
It seems that the reviews on the Days Inn Broadway are 50-50 on the experience.  The rooms are average, but adequate.  The front-desk service was great, and the security staff were all cordial.  The bed was comfortable (and NO BEDBUGS!!!!), the bathroom clean, the water hot and the noise level more than acceptable for NYC.  You are steps away from the subway, and can be to the north or south of Manhattan within a half-hour.  Some great restaurants (try LongGrain (mixed Asian), right around the corner) a couple decent bars (the Dive Bar has good music and friendly staff on weekends, but the patio service is slow on Sundays) Like just about everyone else, had some concerns with the speed of the elevators, but other than that, no complaints.  The hotel is tired, but it appears that;3
Great position and nice and clean rooms, showers and toilets could be better but there's no free wifi, you have to buy it at 1Â£ per hour. Reception is 24h but they are very slow at replying emails, if they do. No elevator!! In september 2014 there was a construction site right next to it so be prepared to be woken up by the noise!;3
"First impressions set the tone when I checked in early in the day (not expecting my room yet) and the registration clerk tried to up-sell me early access to ""a great room"" for $50 cash only. I declined and checked my bags as I had a day of work meetings and didn't need the room until later.   Little did I know that I'd be downgraded for having declined.  When I finally returned to claim my room key, I was surprised to find I'd been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home.  It had a lovely view, high on the 35th floor which I appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold, very cold, even though the thermostat was set at 72.  I could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the un-insulated, painted over bathroom windows. The bed";3
"There is no doubting that the hotel provides a brilliant location for sightseeing in New York; situated across the road from Madison Square Gardens and 5 mins away from the Empire State Building. However 'hidden' costs for basic essentials such as WiFi take the sheen off your stay. 95 dollars for 4 days' worth of WiFi is a pretty rough deal. The charge also covers international phonecalls, but then how useful this is to tourists on a sightseeing trip is a matter of opinion.   On top of this, a petty 2 dollar charge per item for left luggage on check-out isn't exactly accommodating, given the nightly charge for the room and the hotel's (inflated in my opinion) 4* status.   My wife and I have been fortunate enough to travel the world, and we have never come across such blatant";3
The one ting that I liked is the hotel location, quite and easy to access, however, the services, rooms condition and furniture isn't five or four star, I just rate it average and being a Hilton member I didn't get any privileges instead treated as a guest;3
We were also a bit hesitant about staying here having read the earlier reviews!  However we found that the room, although basic, was kept clean throughout our stay, & the hotel was in a quiet, leafy residential area with some fantastic restaurants and diners nearby.  It was a welcome break from the hustle, heat and noise of uptown New York, and we had no concerns about safety returning on the subway for the 10-minute journey late at night (which was a pleasant surprise).  In summary, a good budget choice which was perfect for a 5 night break and the money we saved from staying downtown allowed to us to experience more whilst we were away.  DO GO TO THE KEY WEST DINER - turn right out of hotel and right again onto Broadway - fantastic menu, good value and open 6am-midnight daily;3
The rooms at the empire are very clean but small. The bathroom seems to have a lot of water damage and again is pretty small! There is free WiFi in the lobby of the hotel but not in the rooms. They charge $10 per device for wiFi in your room. Overall I felt that the location was the only selling point to this hotel and I don't feel you get value for money.;3
Don't want to review because it would be negative.         Lighting is horrible, can't even read in the room.  Rugs frayed.  Lousy room service hours. Excellent staff, good housekeepers, maintenance good service.;3
"This place is nothing fancy, but is in a great location in Chinatown and the subway is 100 yards from the front door. Clearly a 2 star property in terms of services (of lack there of). However, room was very clean, the 1 person at the front desk was very friendly and helpful, and all of the fixtures were in good working order. The 30"" flat panel TV seemed relatively new. I've seen older posts that the hallways were run down and the beds uncomfortable. However, that was not our experience. Both double beds in our room were comfortable and the hallways were clean and well kept. Perhaps there has been some recent renovation since those posts.";3
Hotel location was fantastic i/e walking distance to time square and across the street from central park. Rooms were  small, house keeping was unseen and never replenished complimentary amenities. Hotel is in need of some updating.;3
"It was ok, nothing stellar.  Rates happened to be good for the 2 nights I stayed.  Best thing about it was adjacency to Met Opera, which is why I was in NYC.   Nick at Front Desk very helpful.  One of those slow draining ""flat"" sinks was annoying.  Channel changer on remote was balky.   Lots of noise from hallway, rude guests running, yelling, talking loudly late at night.....so the general clientele isn't the greatest (school groups maybe?). It wasn't horrible, I'd probably stay again, but will check out another place that was recommended, next time.  Not as close to Lincoln Center though.  That is definitely the best thing Empire has going for it.";3
Great location, but plenty of flags to consider staying elsewhere if you can. Housekeeping and general upkeep leaves much to be desired. $55 per night parking is obscene. Great views of LAX runway take offs and landings and nice club lounge.;3
We arrived for a late check-in at the hotel and the staff was helpful and patient as we sorted out some technical issues.  The hotel room was small- but that's a pretty typical New York City- sized hotel room.  The room had been updated and we appeciated the laminate flooring.  The bathroom had some minor issues but worked just fine when it had to.  We would have appreciated a second bar of soap but that's pretty minor.    The hotel's location made up for any minor defects in the room- minutes from the Subway line, about 10 min walking to the high line and with the Gardenia Deli around the corner we were able to get up early, grab a bite and hit the city.   The hotel room's air conditioning units worked wonderfully (we were visiting in the midst of the wonky Sept heat wave).;3
We stayed here two nights while seeing several operas at lincoln center.  the narrow halls, metal fire doors are a little weird, but the room was decent-sized, the mattress OK, and the bathrooms clean, and they stored our luggage for an afternoon after we checked out.  I've stayed at similarly-priced places in manhattan not so well located for walking to lincoln center, with much smaller rooms.;3
We just stayed here with our 2 kids for a trip to the theme park.  The hotel is a very quick, 5 minute walk from the entrance to the park (and Universal City Walk) so you can't beat the convenience.  We stayed in a king corner room with a pull-out sofa.  The mattresses could stand to be replaced, but the bed linens were great.  The sofa bed was so uncomfortable that it wasn't fit for an adult to sleep on.  With the sofa bed open, you can't walk around the foot of the king bed, so the room is tight.  Overall, the hotel's convenience to Universal Studios theme park overcomes the few  discomforts we experienced with the sleeping amenities.;3
The hotel has let itself go over the past few years, but the roof top and the location make it worth a stay. Pros : it's right next to the subway station, walking distance to many amazing locations, next to Central Park  a 24HR drugstore and a Starbucks. Cons: Hotel needs some updating, no hot tub, and Wifi and coffee in your room is an additional charge.;3
I called the hotel beforehand to ask if I would need to bring a vaccine card since I'm from out of state the the women on the phone told me that would be against HIPAA for a business to ask about that. That is not a true. I had another issue about a lost item and the man at the front desk had no advice to give me and kept bothering the poor security guard. Room was fine, not the cleanest place I've even been but good enough for midtown New York. Convenient to Penn station and the Amtrak station;3
The positive of this hotel is the location---quick walk to Central Park, shopping, and restaurants.The hotel could use a renovation. The infrastructure is very old and dated. Rooms are tiny, especially the bathrooms. Do not get the city view as the noise level is off the charts. The windows are not sound proof and you hear everything on the streets starting at 6am (sirens, cars, traffic). Elevators are very slow. In summary, for one night it is ok, but would stay elsewhere if staying longer.;3
Stayed here over July 4th 2012, traveled alone and this is my favorite neighborhood in NYC! I felt safe walking by myself. Got a good deal on booking.com. Room was small but had everything I needed. Staff was very helpful.  Would definitely return to Days Inn Broadway.;3
The only good things about this property could be the pricing and location which is near to the train station.  Requested a low floor room but given a high floor instead. There's no lift and i have to drag my luggage all the way up to the 5th floor which was quite a hassle. There's no window blinds in the bathroom and it's exposed to anyone from the outside. The water pressure also very low and don't really enjoy the shower!  Breakfast was not included in the price. The same goes to Wifi.  People smokes within the property and at times I felt suffocated.;3
The WNY is in an excellent location 5 minutes walk from the empire state building we had a view of it from our room also walking distance to times square and Madison square gardens. And Macy's is literally a block away. Central park is a $2 subway ride away.  On arriving we had to wait 5 hours for our room to be ready and having booked a 3 person room for 3 adults we got 2 queen beds. Not great when travelling with your 17 year old son and 17 year old step daughter so I had to share a bed with my son. Complained to reception and was told hotel fully booked nothing they could do. Bathroom although fully functional and clean was tiny. You literally couldn't swing a cat. Extra charges were everywhere. To leave your cases until room was ready was $5 per bag. To collect cases was $5;3
Being that I was just using the hotel just to sleep at it was fine. As a single woman at the hotel, I felt safe. Yes granted the rooms are small but what do you expect its NYC. You can't beat the price and right across from Central Park. You have to wait a few minutes for the water to warm up. There were some ambulances that were very loud but miraculously after 11pm it was fairly quiet. The bed was pretty comfy. When the elevator was slow I would just take the stairs. The staff was friendly. Only a 15 min walk to Columbia University.;3
I do not typically post negative reviews of hotels as I don't feel it necessary to hurt a business unless there has been an egregious cause.  I am a global traveler who stays at exclusive properties however I have realistic expectations with regard to cost / value.    My daughter relocated to Manhattan over the weekend and requested that we stay at the Empire.  I wish to say that the staff was excellent, professional, and friendly.  I was most disappointed with the bathroom.  The shower was actually rather disgusting.  The mold and grime was evident completely around the top of the tile where the tub meets the shower wall and along the glass base.  The lav / wash basin was clean but it was so shallow that it was difficult to wash one's hands without touching the basin or the;3
We picked this hostel because we wanted something a little cheaper and weren't fussed with having to travel into London to sightsee. Thankfully we weren't in the room very much as it is incredibly small (so much so we could barely open our suitcases) and not particularly clean. There is no air conditioning and our window couldn't open so it was like a sauna. There is no lift and wifi must be paid for. A couple of positives, the bathroom was modern and light, we found the hostel very quiet despite visiting during peak season and the best thing about this hostel is its location, only a couple of minutes walk from the tube and only a couple of minutes from a large selection of restaurants and shops. I must admit, I have seen worse so if all you need is a bed and a hot shower then;3
It was an OK experience. Tub was clogged but it was late when I checked in so I did not bother reporting it until check out the next morning.;3
This cheap hotel I can recommend for it's location near the Central Park, the hotel is situated in very beautiful and silent street with nice buildings... Hotel room is simple, the restroom is on the floor, but no problem, very clean, and not so much people for one restroom...;3
Check in a night mare, other then that when you finally get to your room, I had an updated one it was nice and clean;3
Good Points: Room was big with fridge, balcony and clean Breakfast was great but get there early! We went down about 10am one day and it was so busy but everyone complaining and taking all the fruit!!! Pool was lovely and relaxing Close to metro and buses small shop in hotel, laundry room   Bad Points We had no hot water for 2 days due to maintainence - this wasnt conveyed to us and no compensation was offered Staff are OK but not exactly informative  Internet is good when it works but when it breaks no one knew what to do The downstairs bar is not relaxing - there is always a comedy show on which isnt very funny - in fact its actually quite tasteless. They could make it so much better Neighbourhood is dodgy - stay safe at night! We didnt have a car but overheard people;3
We stayed here for 4 nights from the 20th April. When we arrived reception was very busy, and loud, I had sent an email before travelling asking for a city view and explained it was to celebrate our 40th birthday and our friends first overseas visit since having major surgery and suffering with a chronic illness, when we checked in the receptionist had said they hadnât allocated our rooms and couldâve get us on the same floor, which was fine. As it was so busy I didnât ask about our request, as lots of people were waiting to check in. On arrival to our room on the 29th floor was shocked how dark and tired the hallways looked as the reception area looked quite grand. The door to our room was covered in dark brown peeling paint, so not a good first impression.  Our room was small,;3
This place is greatly located near Times Square, but I think that means it attracts a certain group of people - the very touristy bunch or maybe first timers to New York. The internet here is not very stable therefore frustrating for business travellers.  The downside to me is the location -because of its nature, it is too hectic therefore attracting random crowd. You don't get to experience good restaurants or quirky cafes of New York around the hotel area.  Just a couple of international food chain restaurants which you don't need to come all the way for. Stay somewhere else if you have the choice. NYC is too fun to be stuck at this place.;3
Was billed upfront rather than on arrival as my booking indicated. This caused an issue as my colleague was from our Irish office in Ireland and had a different Expense route so I had to put through as one as the UK which was not ideal.;3
Was there for 2 nights for a small conference.  I can only speak about the room I stayed in, but it was tiny.  No closet, no iron or ironing board, no tub, just a shower. Lobby area was modern and had several people milling around.  Some staff spoke poor english.  Chowder House Restaurant was good for lunch.;3
Reception staff are very friendly. The bedroom was adequate although the windows could do with more soundproofing. The bathroom was a big let down. Door missing on the shower. You had to be either stick thin or very bendy to see yourself in the mirror as you could not stand in front of the sink, the gap was ridiculous. And who ever chose the wallpaper for the hallways must of been having a giggle when they said yes to that.;3
Hotel very central.  A bit dated.  Cracked tiles in bathroom which has caused DAMPNESS in bedroom. We booked a double queen suite and never got the room we booked . Got $25 a night off for as a result.  Still wasn't happy though.;3
$500 a nite and we were never in our room ! Great location to the park but this hotel charges u $30 a night for parking and an extra $35 for a roll out bed, wasnât aware of this when we booked it. If I had to do it over again, I would of never spent this much !;3
The Hotel is very well located. It is close to Madison Square Garden and Pen Station with access to the subway system. The Hotel is huge with around 560 bedrooms. Our room for 3 people was small and the beds were also quite small. The bathroom was in need of an update and had leaky taps and shower. The TV/on demand system didn't work properly but the rooms were clean. The air-con was very efficient. Security is good. Everyone entering the lift area has to show their room key. There is a bag storage area available. It costs us $20 to store our bags on the day of departure. We had breakfast in the Tick Tock 24 hr restaurant which adjoins the hotel. The food and service there was first class.;3
Tiny bathrooms even by NY standards.  The rooms are tight as well.  The beds and linens were perfect.  The bathroom door was rotting, the curtains became detached from the ceiling just from pulling them open and the desklamp had a broken switch and would randomly turn on in the middle of the night. The public spaces of the hotel are very lovely and we hear the rooftop bar is fantastic but we never made it up there.;3
The hotel is a bit more expensive, the double rooms are very small.  The bathroom was dated, needs to be renovated.  Had to pay extra to leave our suitcases at check out reception on last day. This was not ok.;3
Excellent customer service.  Central location close to subway, shops etc. An excellent base for our stay. Noisy due to large volume of traffic and use of vehicle horns. Windows could do with being updated to reduce the noise.;3
after ordering some ice for a cocktail, and wait for over a half hour ant then doing a reorder it a good 45min. from the first call.Second night  same results  and at the time of ordering they said it would be up shortly;3
We chose this hotel because of its price and we were not disappointed! We stayed in a family room that had two double beds, a sink, a fridge and a television all as standard. It must be said that the building is quite run down and the sink and shower were rusted in some parts but it is not unbearably shabby. Toilet roll is provided for you in your room so you must remember to bring it with you to the toilet down the hall. I forgot it a few times, which was a bit annoying!  The hotel is located near the Hudson river, close to a highway and only two blocks from the subway. The highway can be quite noisy, especially at certain times of the day, but the noise never got so bad that it prevented us from sleeping or enjoying our stay.  The best area to stay in New York would be near to;3
Stayed for four nights on a business trip. Check-in was super fast at 8pm for me, but not for my colleague the next day because computers were down. Not sure how often that happens, but very inconvenient since he was arriving from a long international trek.   Definitely a historical feel, but standard rooms are tiny and not many updated features. Showers were very difficult to get a decent temp, several TV channels didnât work (ESPN), outlets questionable, etc.   Beds are comfy and rooms are quieter than other similar hotels in the area. Staff was friendly in hotel and connected establishments. Location is solid with tons of options within walking distance, but not sure itâs worth the price, especially with the mandatory daily fee. Just include the $30+ per day in the room rate;3
Great location, close to malls, dinning and other attractions, staff is Great, however Hotel is a bit outdate, problem with the hot water, light out, and other maintenance problem. Concierge staff could be a bit more helpful, there seen not to care mush about assisting guest.;3
I recently stayed in this hotel for three nights to attend a business meeting. I ended up changing rooms three times. The first room, though decorated beautifully, was unbelievably tiny, and the second much the same. In these rooms, there was about 18â of floor space around the queen bed, plus the desk, and the room was so small that there wasnât room for a full length closet, so if you had anything other than short items to hang, you were out of luck. The bathroom, while nicely equipped and also decorated very tastefully in a very up-to-the-minute style, was so small that the small bathmat took up 100% of the available floor space. Sitting on the toilet meant your knees extended into the hallway.  The shower had a very chic fixed ceiling mounted shower head that was a lovely;3
The best thing about this property is the location and the lobby. Room was small, 2 full beds, with one tiny window. That wasn't an issue. However, I don't think the room had been dusted in months. There was dust on the walls and doors. The beds were clean but not comfortable. I'm glad we were there for only one night. The staff was amazingly pleasant. The Art Deco style was beautiful.;3
They charge extra for internet and business center. This makes them unacceptable to me for future stays. Most hotels provide these at no extra charge. I dislike being taken advantage of especially when I am already paying a premium price for a nice hotel.;3
Abercorn hostel is located minutes away from Hammersmith station which is probably its best selling point. The appearance of the hostel could be worked on- at first it appears quite unwelcoming and run down. The layout of the hostel (because it is so large) is a bit confusing. However, the toilets, kitchen and shower rooms by our room were very clean and modern. The room itself was basic but fine- you are getting what you pay for so cannot really complain. probably the worst thing was the noise at night! Fine for a short stay but wouldnt want to stay there for too long!;3
My first impression was that the hotel was so much more impressive than I had expected, great location on a lovely cobbled street, a stunning lobby and very friendly and helpful staff.  The room was as described, small but functional. Some nice touches: the bathrobes, slippers and complimentary water was appreciated. The bathrooms were small but clean. There was only 1 hook in the shower to hang any clothes, towel etc, a bit more space to put items/get changed would have been great.   The big issue came at night: the walls were paper thin and I could hear everything happening outside my room: doors slamming, people snoring, shouting in the corridor. I 'm by no means a light sleeper but was unable to get any sleep. The room was also extremely hot, even with the window left open.;3
The room was adequate, had a bed and bathroom.  Late on clean-up each day.  NO ICE MACHINE,had to take Ice bucket and find some one at desk to fill it. Elevator to outside bar area not always operating. We were attending a graduation at the Lincoln center which was close by.  Would not put this at the top of my do overe list.;3
It's my second time here, we came to spend Christmas time here in NYC, it is basic but good, clean and hospital one. If you want just a room, hot water and basic utilities it has a good service with a good price, best choice if you have limited budget and you want to spend time in NYCâ¥;3
Tiny room with shared bathroom facilities in a great part of the city.  The housekeeping and bell staff were excellent, front desk staff not so much.  I stayed for 8 nights and, for the cost (in pricey New York), this was a fine option for travelling alone.  My booking clearly stated that there would be a hold on credit card of $50.  This was incorrect and a hold of $50 PER NIGHT was applied, which I thought was rather steep as there were absolutely zero incidentals in the room (no mini bar, for example).  It snowed for 4 of the 8 nights I stayed and great emphasis was put on central heating in the lobby/hallways but the room itself was far too cold.  I asked the front desk to turn up the heating on three occasions and then gave up, instead requesting extra blankets from;3
The hotel is right in the heart of NY with easy walking distance to all attractions and land marks.  No coffee facilities unless you pay for the upgrade. No fridge in the room.  The staff are super friendly and very helpful.;3
Hotel has a neat history and the lobby is really cool. Our room was small and the bathroom was extremely tiny and needed renovation. It had a fairly recent WC but the tiles looked original and had been painted over. The bathtub was from the 50's. Shower head leaked. Our floor smelled of smoke when we checked in, we complained and to Wyndham's credit the smell was gone by the next day. It appears the hotel rooms start at floor 19. Below that it seemed as though some of the floors were for long term residents - a good number of college kids get of the elevator on  the lower floors with take out. One said he is going to Columbia. Concierge was very helpful. Location is great if you come to NYC on AMTRAK to Penn Station.;3
Despite the mediocre accommodations, the staff is absolutely stellar. They let me store luggage even after I checked out, for more than 12 hours! Plus, they let me doze in the lounge while I waited for my ridiculous 3:40am shuttle ride. Even when there was a leak in our bathroom, they were able to move us immediately to a larger room. Decent rooms and location, great personnel.;3
The location of the hotel is perfect. Very near to Central Park, very near to Metro stations on 59th and 66th street. There are lots of fancy places to eat nearby. Hotel rooftop is a nice spot to have few drinks after 5 pm. Just to mention one negative point about the hotel is the rooms look old, furnitures are old, bathroom is old, air conditioner  is old and all of them totally create an neglected, a little dirty look.;3
"Overall not a bad stay.  Rooms are older but adds to the ""charm"" rooms are very small.  Bathrooms - no counter space, water pressure low, felt like you are taking a shower with a garden hose. Toilet paper is behind the door, which is inconvenient at 2am!  The rooms are noisy, not sure where or what the noise was just a lot of banging and knocking. They are also very warm, but the windows open.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is good.";3
My boyfriend and I have just spent 5 nights at the Quality on Broadway hotel. From reading reviews I was very nervous about staying there. When we arrived I was expecting something a lot worse. The lobby was fairly large with a reception and concierge desk. It was not in bad condition at all just a bit old fashioned and for a 2/3 star hotel it was fine. We were asked if we required a smoking or non smoking room which our request for a non smoking room was delivered. We were then directed to the Elevators which i can honestly say DO NOT USE the elevtors next to the public toilets USE the ones next to the information leaflets (where the luggage room is ). The lifts next to the public toilets were not safe and stop for no reason on each floor. The corridors were very large with ice;3
I stayed at this Historic Hotel on the 26th of June. As a native New Yorker I have always been curious and impressed by the history of this hotel however I was certainly not impressed with the accommodations. I paid a $20 upgrade for a Metro queen bedroom with a view. When checking in I was told that they did not have single beds and I was given a double bedroom. I was assigned a room on the 34th floor. The room was extremely narrow and everything was very close together. The bathroom was not very pleasant to look at as it too was extremely small and had chips of paint missing from the fixtures as well as a missing towel bar that left protruding ceramic end pieces in the shower. The only thing pleasant about the room is that the bed was fairly comfortable and I did have a nice;3
Hotel was clean. Staff was all friendly and attentive.  Parking extremely expensive.  Food was above average but food & drink extremely expensive.  Convenient to LAX.  Not convenient to any other restaurants or bars.;3
"Just stayed here for 4 nights; had room 301. Service was good: fresh towels every day, bed made up. WiFi worked for me in the 3rd floor, even though they admit it might not reach higher than the 2nd. No problems even with larger photo uploads.There is an alternative lounge/room for Internet too. Cell reception is non-existent though! The fridge in the room is nice, but I only used it as a table. A table and a chair would have been more useful actually. Walls and doors are really thin. You can hear people walk and talk when passing by like they are inside the room. Luckily other guests were pretty civilized. Water pressure and temperature is excellent, but the shower has only a fixed head, I don't like that. There is a TV in the room, but unfortunately mounted left and pretty";3
I stayed for 6 nights. Would have changed my reservation if I'd realised how far away it was. I don't mind walking or using trains but not at night so I had to use taxis each night. I was on the 9th floor in a room outside near the stairway. Difficult to get my suitcase along the narrow passage way . The room was reasonably clean but in need of repair, especially the bathroom. The  bed was comfortable and the room big enough for one but would be a squeeze for two. If you want ice be prepared for a trip to the 11th floor as that is the only ice machine. Overall, not too bad but very overpriced as I saw other hotels that friends were staying in which were much cheaper and offered better location and facilities.;3
The rooms were a decent size for nyc.  Elevators are extremely slow.  Beds on the firmer side.  Employees are very friendly. Great location for metro station.   You also get a discount at a nice restaurant attached to the hotel.;3
The rain was bouncing down as the Met Opera ended so we searched the net for somewhere nearby where we could enjoy a drink and wait for the crowds to clear. The bar at the Empire was perfect for our needs. A group of Dutch marathon runners with infectious laughter were the only other customers and it was a nice atmosphere. We would have stayed longer but before long the bar closed so we ordered an Uber and made our way back to our apartment.;3
Good stay for universaL HHN.I only wish you got a better rate with breakfast for this HHN stAy.  Coming from a Comicon crowd I like the event/hotel pkgs that are worked out between the 2.  I expected at least a free breakfast for my stay.;3
The Empire Hotel is my go to when visiting Manhattan.  The location is the number one reason and the staff is the number two.  Danny and Luis at the front desk are willing to work with me and find solutions to whatever issues arise.   The general manager Scott takes great pride in the establishment and it shows.    And yes.......... The rooms are small-itâs NYC!  The air conditioning is iffy at times-itâs NYC! The street can be a little noisy-itâs NYC.  Having said all that my most recent visit was marred by terrible non functioning air conditioning. Terrible shower (in the room we were switched to because of no air conditioning in my original room).  How about this...no hot water.  No fun taking a cold shower.    This place is a dump any where else on earth.  They gave me 100;3
This is a great hotel if you're on a tight budget and have use of a car. I stay in LA/Hollywood about 5 times a year and have never found a cheaper 'decent' hotel so it's great value if you don't want to go as low as a motel. The rooms are clean and spacious with comfortable beds and cable TV, the free breakfast is great and the hotel itself is clean and well maintained.   However, this is by no means a luxury option so it's important to be aware of that before your stay. The main problem is the location - it's quite a long way from the attractions of Hollywood, and not in an area that you'd want to walk around in at night. A car is essential here to avoid this (and high taxi charges every time you want to go anywhere). However, with a car, it's an easy drive from most places,;3
The elevators take forever and ever and are super crowded  The room was tiny but that is ok in New York  The sink will get full of water and will take an hour to drain....  Do not get the top floor or you will get noise from the nightclub above!!!!  Great location;3
My hotel visit/stay was for conference attendance for a weekend. The hotel was not prepared for an attendance of approx. 1,000 attendees. The restaurant/bar did not have adequate staffing and the registration desk should have had more staff for arrivals.;3
The location is pretty good, with a subway line not far away at Columbus Circle and Central Park is a very short walk. Julliard and Lincoln Center are very close, (Lincoln is just across the street). The view from the room was up Broadway and Columbus and from the higher floors quite nice.  The bathroom was incredibly small. The showers don't have doors which means a very wet floor. The room was also small, but that's not unexpected in NYC. The bed was comfortable. Wifi was fairly expensive. Better to find local cell service if you can.;3
We stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed the handy location. It was a quick walk to the Subway, bus or train. Due to its location we walked to a lot of NYC attractions.  Concierge was very helpful with all our questions about getting to different sports events.  Room was very small and bed was hard but that didn't ruin our experience. As said by others there is no tea/coffee in room but with Starbucks and many other places to grab a coffee near by it was not an issue.  Thanks for a great first time experience of NYC!;3
Stayed at the Hyatt Regency for 1 night waiting for a connecting flight at LAX.  The room was large and clean, beds comfortable and showers excellent. Check in was easy and quick and check out a breeze.  If you are staying here, there is a free shuttle which is supposed to stop at terminals to pick up people for the short trip to the hotel. When we were waiting in the designated pick up zone, we watched several shuttles drive past in the lane furthest from the stopping area on their way back to the hotel. The shuttles weren't full with 1 or 2 people on board. We waited approx 20 minutes for a shuttle to stop, waving at each as they drove past seemingly not caring to stop. We tried to call the hotel but were put onto an automated system. Eventually we gave up and got a taxi to;3
The Hotel is dated and need to be totally renovated, The hotel has massive potential. Some one at the top level administration needs to wake up and spend some of that money they have made over the years from it.;3
The hotel has a convenient location and a fair price. Rooms are small and bathrooms tiny. Hair dryer didn't work. Tv has only a few channels. There's no elevator and the stairs are very narrow. It was clean and the bed was comfortable, so it worked out fine for a few nights. What I really didn't like was the impossibility of an early check in or a late check out.;3
Rooms are nice and clean, shower pressure is rubbish and staff could do with being a bit more friendly.  I mean, most staff were friendly apart from a few that were not.  Breakfast was nice, bread stale but than again it's a 3star hotel..  Not much to write home about.  All in all an ok Hotel.;3
The good news first.  The hotel is in a great location right across the street from Lincoln Center and just a block to the subway.  The king size bed in our room was very comfortable and after complaining just once to the front desk and confronting the a very noisy neighbor we had nothing but piece and quiet for our three night stay.  Everything worked.  Doors opened and closed.  Drawers did too.  The bathroom faucet brought plenty of water, both cold and hot.  I did have to fix the sink's drain cover so that the shallow sink wouldn't overfill.  After that it drained rather nicely.  The TV worked and after tightening the cable connection on the back of the TV, the picture was acceptably clear.  The decor was a little dated, dark and verging on dingy, but the room was clean.

The hotel has good location. The stuff are very helpful. Room service is good . They clean it every day. However they provide coffee  machine only after a few requests. The room is very small. Old fashioned bath. They donât serve breakfast. You  have to add extra money for the continental breakfast at the attached diner and to add extra money for every item.;3
The hotel was ok. The rooms are a bit small but we dont spend much time in the room so guess so no big deal. Beds are a bit hard so overall could have been more comfortable. Nicole at the front desk was amazing, she gets an A++. Paying for parking is ridiculous and should be included in the stay since the price per night is above average already for such a small room.;3
We stayed here for a pre Christmas shopping weekend in December. Our room was very small, so much so that we kept tripping over the bed legs when trying to manoeuvre around the beds. The mini bar in the room was extortionate with a small bottle of water costing $7 !! We had no view from 9th floor room .... just a view of a brick wall.  However, the location was so convenient for mid town New York and we could walk to most places we wanted to see from our hotel. The bell men were helpful and friendly .... location great .... hotel basic;3
Hotel was located between 1-5 miles to everywhere we wanted to visit.  Metro stationâs less than one block away.  Breakfast was delicious.  Offerings including fresh made omelets, waffles, hash browns, sausage links, assorted bread, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, juices, tea and coffee.  Be aware that you are only allowed to have one omelet per day.  My boyfriend went to get a second omelet and the chef Hugo yelled at him and told him he could only have one per day.  Small gym with weight equipment and treadmills.  Pool is nice. Has comfortable lounge chairs and umbrellas for shade.  My room overlooked the courtyard on third floor and was very quiet.    Surrounding area is not very nice. Saw a roach the first night. My room was not upgraded as I had seen in some of the recent Trip;3
The hotel itself is nice and has the facilities you would expect. The problem is that the hotel lifts are VERY slow and a number appear to be out of service. This is not just in the main bank of lifts but also for the garage to get to your car. It was a problem for our entire stay and only on occasion did the lift come in a reasonable time and not nearly full. The lower floor guests often could not get on the lifts as they were always so crowed. There was no convention that I saw and it happened in the morning, afternoon and evening. You had to plan an extra 5 min to get to the lobby.;3
Overall it was a good experience,the location of the hotel is very good The room was clean and everything worked although the manager was quite rude and arrogant to be honest  Food was a bit overpriced;3
Stayed at the Empire Hotel NYC from 10th July - 14th July 2012, taxi cost around $60 (including tip) from JFK airport. Bellboys greeted the cab and offered to carry our bags in. Check in was speedy. We were allocated a room on floor 4, next to the elevator. I was slightly worried by this, but I have to say that there was no additional noise from the elevator. There was however, from the the large machine which our room looked out onto, appeared to be powering the air con. It was so loud, we thought there was another air con unit on in our room! Having said that, I got a great nights sleep so it wasn't that bad.  Elevators are awful, slow and tiny. We opted to use the stairs a lot of the time as it was quicker!   Had breakfast each day at Ed's Chowder House, was slightly worried;3
Lovely attentive staff but the hotel itself was disappointing. Dark communal areas, small rooms, noisy location, none of the usual hotel room facilities.....wifi, coffee/tea maker etc. Cleanliness of the toilets was also disappointing.  Shame!!;3
Stayed two nights. Good location, generally friendly staff. I payed $450 per night. According to these posts people are paying 50% less. What I payed was too much. There was one wash cloth the first day and the next the maid left none. The room was on the small side- no window view- reasonably quiet.There was a defective short bureau door which did not close properly and I kept hitting my  leg on it. Also difficult to get ice . Had to call twice. They only bring you a little bit. Also you have to que up and take a special elevator to the roof. I didn't bother - no access through the hotel elevators;3
You absolutely need to be sure this is what you want. Yes, the survivors of the Titanic stayed there. Yes, they have bellhops in fancy uniforms. Yes, everybody is friendly and helpful as far as they can. But, ...  I stayed for four nights after a six week trip through the south/eastern US with 20 different hotels behind me and actually ready to go home. I think it's important to know that for the review. This was not the worst stay I had, but the most expensive for the return.  The location is nice, but in considerable distance to the next subway. Be prepared for a few minutes walk up the Jane St to 14th stations of the red or blue lines. There are a few small coffee places and restaurants around. So it's a good place to for discovering the village and the nearby Meatpacking;3
The staff was very nice and welcoming, but the rooms were very outdated, (Showerhead was broke water sprayed everywhere, dim bulbs) and a lot smaller than I thought, but clean. I would have to say that for the price it is a great location directly across from Central Park and close to the metro. There are not many taxis in the area, so I suggest Uber. But this is a great place to stay if you are on a budget.;3
I stayed here for a week in  private room. The check was easy and the staff friendly. I wasn't expecting housekeeping service considering it is a hostel, but our towels and bedding were changed daily. The room and bathroom was clean and the noise is very minimal, a little noise from the busy road not too far away, but nothing i would bother complaining about.  The location is superb! 5 minute walk from hammer smith tube station and bus station, and there a nice little pub that does very good breakfast just across from the station also, very cheep too. All in all, a very nice little hotel. I cant fault them at all. nicest backpackers I've stayed in in a long time.;3
Great location, the sheets were very low quality and extremely loud to sleep on. I didn't even know that sheets could be loud before staying here. The bathrooms are so tiny- but it is New York. One set of elevators were broken and the remaining one elevator was tiny and slow. Wait times were over twenty minutes- I took the stairs six flights after running the marathon bc of this- not awful but not ideal and many runners were staying here.;3
This hotel is quite old and needs some work. The rooms are tiny but cozy enough for a place to sleep - that's about it. I was stir crazy a lot of the time. The bathrooms are decent but still cramped.  We are also provided cut up/shredded small pieces of scrap towels for wash clothes. The outlets were busted and seemed like a fire hazard, i was too scared to leave anything plugged in.  It was close to the subway lines and taxis passed by regularly. All three days we were there housekeeping would knock and then immediately open the door, on one occasion there wasn't even a knock, she just opened it.  If you are looking for a more affordable but less luxurious place to stay, I would recommend it,.;3
PRO: - location is good. There's a subway station in front of the hotel, takes you to Times Square in 15 min. - few blocks from Central Park, nice to walk - nice and friendly staff - Hotel Shuttle service (but it's not free) takes you to the three airports (LGA,JFK,NEW), you can choose your pick up time - low price.   CON: - really really cheap and small room, just enough space for 2 bags. - Windows were almost coming off, there was Duct Tape on both windows to hold them together.. :-) or to isolate most of the classic NYC noise? - You can't complain about the noise as it's on 94th/Broadway, so there will be a lot of police and FF/rescue alarms.  - AC was bulky and loud - Room service forgot towels and toilet paper on the third day, but was friendly and provided it immediately;3
Welcoming by the staff, Rooms not the greatest in terms of cleanliness but the room was secure the shower worked with hot water, the toilet was clean & there was a secure safe for your personal things. Everything provided was adequate for a short stay in the city. Staff were helpful & willing to help with any issues. Free wifi too. Good location in Chinatown with subway stations Bowery/Delancey & Grand Street/Chrystie street a 30 second walk in each direction. Overall I was satisfied at $100 a night.;3
I've stayed here twice, both times on business. The first time I stayed was for 2 nights in September 2009, and last time was for 3 nights in July 2010. My first stay was great, the last stay was awful. It really depends on the room/floor you get. On my last stay, I got one of their very last rooms since they were fully booked, and it was near some sort of generator, could not sleep even with ear plugs, had to have my room changed the next day, but the second room reeked of smoke even though it was supposed to be non-smoking, the third room was great.   Rooms: typical Hilton rooms, comfortable beds, modern decor. They do have some rooms in really noisy locations though. The first room on my second stay smelled musty and was not very clean, and one of the outlets in the bathroom;3
Stayed here 4 nights in December in a un-refurbished Metro double room (2x double beds).    The hotel is well placed at the junction of West 34th St and 8th Avenue.  A large number of subway access points if that is how you intend to get around.    Most of the must see places are easily accessible on foot indeed the Empire State Building is only 10 minutes away, Madison Square is less than that (5mins).    Housekeeping kept the rooms clean and tidy and bedding was changed during the stay.    Suppose the question of whether I would return is definitely but might look to stay in a better quality room, but that would depend on cost as you only there to sleep;3
From reading the other reviews I am sorry to say that they speak the truth with regards the downsides  - The lifts are always breaking down and date from many decades ago - The room furnishings are all heavily worn  - The bathroom suffers from water damage due to only a single pane of glass on what should be a sliding door shower enclosure  - The boiler broke down (which I presume is also old and in need of replacement) and there was no hot water in the entire hotel the night we arrived - Very expensive room snacks  On the positives: - Great location and once refurbished (which starts next year) will be an option worth considering - Beds are comfortable if you like them firm which I personally do - Great roof top bar with a popular club for those that like to party - Newly;3
I stayed at the days inn for 4 nights in November 2015 as part of a leaisure trip to New York with my girlfriend.  The hotel itsself is conveniently located right outside a metro stop, so it is easy to get to and from it for sightseeing. It is also within a couple of blocks of central park.  The room was clean on arrival, and the bed very comfortable. I would however describe the whole hotel, and the room as feeling a bit worn out. Whilst nothing was technically wrong with the room, and it was cleaned to a good standard every day, it certainly wasn't anything special either. It served perfectly well as a reasonably budget room from which to base ourselves. The curtains were oddly, completely fake and couldn't be drawn accross the windows. They did however have blinds, but these;3
the hotel was very nicely kept, a+ housekeeping and complimentary breakfast was great as well. I left something behind after checking out and the hotel staff were friendly and helped to return the item to me without issue. it did not take long for us to travel to Hollywood or Universal studios with the metro a 5 minute walk away, though it was not the nicest area it was a very nice hotel and would stay again;3
Ultra small room and smaller bathroom. Good location, inexpensive, no issues other than wifi was so slow my email would not send.;3
I go to Fashion Week twice a year and I enjoy making The Empire Hotel my home base. First of all, it is directly across the street from Lincoln Center. Second, it is quite an outstanding value for the location. Third, you will be able to get a good breakfast downstairs. Is it a great hotel? Absolutely not! There are many, many things worth noting that are frustrating from the miniscule closets (even when selecting a larger room) to the slow, expensive Wi-Fi. But if you are looking for value and location, this is the place.;3
Had a nice stay and good price but the room was ridiculously small - a step above broom closet and we are fairly small.  Bed was horribly soft and sunken. But the room was clean as was the whole hotel and staff very friendly and helpful. Especially Jeff I. The LOBBY who was so helpful with caring for bags after checkout while we went to lunch.;3
We stayed here for a week in November. Get room 1230, view to the Broadway.. Room clean, bathroom very nice but we didnt had hot water so they have to fix it , which they did immediately. No breakfast, and you have to pay for internet and printing which should be included if they charge so much per night. Also when we payed to use the pc and try to print out they just tell us sorry but the internet doesnt work at the moment. We had a package delivered to the hotel a day later we left and asked to please send it to our address, they send it back instead of send it to me. Overal nice room , unfriendly stuff, ok location, overpriced.;3
"We stayed at the Empire Hotel during NY Fashion Week 2011.  The hotel was fully booked and very busy.  They had 3 models greeting guests in the lobby.  The models, Lauren, Brooke and man were very help; maybe even more so than the hotel staff.  They did a great job helping the guests.";3
"I have stayed in this hotel for many times.. the breakfast is the key where they got customers..even sometiemes you hear ""one ommellete per customer"" haha a small omellete can make a huge diffrence in other reviews..  when stayed during old weather the airconditioner was turned off to save money.. and it feels a little lack of air in the room.. one time I got a really bad room since it was so cold and I got an upgrade due to the maintenence tech Anibal who requested a better room in my behalf so nice... he was a really nice person got a bigger room and a a bit warm.. since those small devices for warm smalls bad..   anyways you got what you pay... but also the parking lot is akey to keep customers too expensive and when having invitees need to pay each 2 for parking...";3
I have provided my feedback - please see earlier page. Average room, dark and dingy and toilet smelt. when told hotel staff. no one advised outcome or if they fixed the problem. Or upgrade to a different room, poor service given the amount you pay for per night,;3
"Usually we stay more north (last 2 trips have been 42nd The Grand Hyatt & 59th The Marriott)  We thought we would stay a little closer to the main attraction ""Times Square"" And also the added bonus of Macy's being 2 short blocks away!! :)  Ok so the good points, upon entrance the lobby is beautiful, very clean & fresh looking, we arrived from the UK on an 8hr flight so really just wanted to get to our room, freshen up & head out, check in was smooth, not the quickest but the lady on reception was polite!  We made our way into the lift heading for our room on the 19th floor, I'll be polite in saying that you can clearly see the hotel are making changes however the appearance of the hallways doesn't leave a lot to be desired! Now I know I said we'd stayed further up at (The";3
Perhaps I expected too much from a top of the range hotel but the rooms allocated were disappointing as they were both below ground level with a view of a service road into the basement, the only positive being that it was only one floor to the swimming pool. The other negative about being below ground was the noise from above from what must have been the gymnasium and one nigh't sleep was completely ruined by the racket from above. The atrium is impressive and the decor by the ballrooms is a sight to behold. We didn't eat in the hotel as prices were beyond our reach but there appeared to be plenty of choice. What was also impressive was the unlimited internet access and, of course, the ideal location to Universal Studios along with the free bus service though as it was shared;3
It would be fine for an overnight stay to connect flights. I was there longer for a business meeting, and the limited menu and lack of daily room cleaning made it a little more rocky. Staff was friendly.;3
Hotel staff in generally were very good. But they were very slow at front desk. staff at restaurant was not very knowledgeable about dietary restrictions and very aggressive compare to other hotel staff. Majority of room service staff where excellent and went over and above. But one was having trouble giving us towels when we asked for 4 as we were four people in the room. So our experience varied form excellent to poor depending upon the staff we were dealing with. But we like the the location;3
Disappointed as it was the first time in a long time I have done premier inn. It was not the standard I have come to expect from them. Check in poor. Room poor. Yes location location but thatâs it everything else is low quality. Better hotels around for similar price;3
Somehow the lack of smiles followed us from the first second. All staff expect 15-20% tip, but they seem not to want to give anything more than absolute minimum. Checking in I felt they put us in the segment of guests that will never tip, so they need not be friendly. And - honestly - I do not tip such manners.;3
My room is a good size for New York hotels . Bed nice and comfy . Air conditioning very good .  Great view of the Empire State from my room .  Lots of banging of doors .  Bathroom very poor , definitely needs updating , not a pleasant experience having to use it .  Not many sockets to use .  Good wifi , mine was free but not sure if you have to pay for it .  Great location. Very busy lobby , busy hotel .;3
I was sorely dissapointed with this hotel for the price.  No valet for parking.  Room was tiny,  old and dingy.  The carpet was dirty and there was hair in the bathroom.  The door to the bathroom was crooked and barely closed.  The area was a bit shaky as well.  I didn't feel comfortable walking around with my wife after 10pm;3
The Empire is an interesting boutique hotel.  It is one of those places that I really hoped to love.  I ended up not loving it....I have mixed feelings which is why I gave it the 3 rating.  It has some really great points and some not so great points.  The short version is this....location is great.  Just off Columbus Circle literally a 1 minute walk from Lincoln center.  The lobby is very cool and has a nice bar.  The beds are comfortable and rooms facing the inner courtyard are very quiet.  The staff were good.  They accommodated my early check in request.  The primary issue is that the rooms are very small.  And not that well designed.  The bathroom and the shower both provide a source of irritation and frustration.  Closet space is almost non-existent.  If these things don't;3
Stayed for one night. The staff were friendly enough & the location is excellent. The room was clean & tidy but the bed itself was incredibly creaky. Prices are okay for the location. You pretty much get what you pay for.;3
"We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel (standard room) and after the first night started to think about other optionsâ¦  So, starting with the good things: 1)Â Â Â  Although the room was tiny and had not much extras in it (like tee / coffee maker, glasses etc.) the staff was very friendly and helpful and brought everything at the request (and no extra cost). Thus, my suggestion is if you stay there and feel that something is missing, just ask :) 2)Â Â Â  Central location. Some might like it, others might hate it, but I would place being in the centre of Manhattan as a positive; 3)Â Â Â  The history of the hotel. They have a long and rich history that theyâre proud of. And they have a small, but interesting exhibition downstairs dedicated to that; 4)Â Â Â  Room, although had seen better days,";3
the location of the hotel is good, the stuff were polite and helpful but the cleaniness of the room was awefull. The breakfast was meh, lot of the time there was no fruits at all. To be honest I expected more from this hotel.;3
"Ups: Awesome location. This is a lovely safe neighbourhood that I felt totally comfortable coming back to even very late at night. Also, incredibly cheap room rate. Yes, the rooms are tiny, but unless you're over 6'2"" or claustrophobic this shouldn't be an issue. Excellent free wifi. The only noise issue was the rattly old airconditioner, despite the club in the basement.  Downs: Almost all service-related. Room partially cleaned once in three days' stay. No fresh drinking water left after check-in. No clean towels entire stay. No bath mat (kind of an issue in a shared bathroom when the crappy 'sandals' they give you don't last one walk down the hall). Rude, unhelpful service at the front desk (seriously, kid, you're a receptionist in a cheap hotel, lose the hipper-than-thou";3
"This property gets a mixed review. I reserved two rooms for a family visit to Universal Studios for a couple of days. If you are planning to visit City Walk & Universal Studios; it may be for you. If not, you can do better elsewhere in LA. This hotel is a tourist trap.  The positives: location, friendly staff, 5 minute walk to Universal Studios, Free Shuttle to City Walk, clean rooms with refrigerators, pleasant pool and large hot tub.  Negatives: $300+tax/ night price, expensive mediocre food, daily parking fee of $28 self, $40 valet, very slow check-in and very slow elevators.";3
I stayed in this hotel only one day when returning from Indianapolis to Moscow, so I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to choosing.  The place was neat and well-kept, but don't get fooled about the location. It's quite far from the central parts of Manhattan, and the northern part of Broadway where it's located is in fact quite gloomy and without much places of interest (or, even, places to eat or have a drink). Surrounding streets are just an average quiet New York neighborhood. And it takes a long walk South for the impression to change.  The hotel itself is quite standard, with standard features and polite staff. Nothing exciting. May be a good stay if you're okay with the location.;3
The room was clean and kept to a good standard. The doormen were very friendly and helpful. Tea and coffee are not included in the price and cost $2.00 per sachet. Easier to go to Starbucks on the corner of the street. The room was hot so had to turn the heating off, there was a constant whirring sound which disturbed your sleep. The hotel is in an ideal location to explore NY.;3
"The hotel is nice, but nothing spectacular; I was certainly expecting something better for the price.  The room was spacious and well kept but the hotel staff at the front desk and bellman stand could not have cared less.  They weren't exactly rude; just crystal clear that they would not put forth an extra modicum of effort to make our stay easier or more pleasant.  We were there during the weekend before Christmas and, because the front door and valet parking were inadequately staffed for the the holiday parties occurring at the hotel, it was impossible for a taxi or Uber driver or the shuttle between the hotel and Universal City to get through.  We trudged back and forth in the unseasonably cold and rainy weather because the hotel apparently didn't realize that big parties";3
I booked this hotel because it was in close proximity to Madison Square Garden where we were going to see Billy Joel. When we arrived, I realized there was no elevator, which was ok, it was only a 3 story building. We checked in and proceeded to our room. When I opened the door, I thought it was a joke, the bed literally hit both walls foot to head. No room to  move around to the other side of the bed. We just assumed they were all that small and got ready to leave for the concert. Walking down the hall, another room had the door opened and it was a normal sized room so we immediately went to the front desk to ask them to change our room. They did so with no problem and no upcharge to us. It made the rest of the visit so much nicer.;3
Great Location, cool service and nice room but real small bathrooms that is really a minus, unfortunately. Roof Top is cool but could use a revamp. Restaurants at hotel are decent. Gotta love Pasquale @ front desk.;3
We arrived at 5pm and still had to wait an hour for our room. Booked a room with either empire state building or river, didn't get it, requested extra sheets and blankets we were told they were in high demand they will deliver it later....never happened. Bathroom very uncomfortable with one tiny shelf to put your cosmetics and toilitries.  Rooms very clean and spacious with a walking closet.;3
"We stayed here on Halloween night--it was a bit warm and there is no a/c, but left the window open and it was ok---the beds were terrible (hard and lumpy), but we got the room for $100.00 (with two beds)--no decorations or extras--old beds and old carpet---generally old place---BUT--was clean and the staff friendly enough.  The location is good and the neighborhood is GREAT---and the Pizza place at the end of the street is good too.  Even though it was old and rundown, I would probably go there again, just because of the good neighborhood and cost.  We were shocked at first, but when you think about how little you really are in your room, it seems like a smart choice if you are on a budget. We definitely felt as though we got the full ""flavor"" of New York in this hotel.";3
The highlight of this hotel is the really helpful and friendly staff. It is conveniently located near most main attraction. Some area around the hotel look a bit run down but over all not bad. The breakfast is great especially the made to order omelet bar with all fresh veggies. The rooms and hotel infrastructure is kinda out dated and could use an upgrade. Over all it's a very comfortable hotel for the price and location. One problem was the tub didn't drain but that was repaired within 5 minutes. Oh and the free wifi is spotty is some areas. I'd definitely stay here again if in the area.;3
Some issues with my stay. Was badly jetlagged and put the 'do not disturb' sign in my door. Staff completely ignored it and disturbed me anyway- waking me up. When I complained to staff their whole focus was on making excuses rather than owning it- made a bad impression. Was asked to move to another room  midway through my stay unexpectedly- no gesture of goodwill was offered (a free drink or something) which would have been appropriate in the circumstances. TERRIBLE snooty service from an rude, arrogant barman and a tip-focused waitress in the cafe downstairs. Customer service in general feels a little 'forced' and not that genuine. That said it is a convenient hotel offering a competitive price in a great location. Staff have some things to work on.;3
"This is an old building.  It resembles more of a ""dormroom"".   The lobby is small but the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms that end on 06-09 face central park.    Elevator is slow.  Carpet needs replacing.  Rooms are small (10X10 or 10X12).  Bathroom is 6X7.  Even though the building is old, bathroom and bed were VERY clean.  Room was quiet and bed was comfortable. TV only has 12 channels, there is no closet, no iron, blowdryer available in bathroom, window A/C unit bearly kept the room cool.  No free internet (however there is a Turkish Deli 1 block north that has free internet and good sandwiches).  Internet in the hotel is available for a charge.  Use of hotel computer is $2.00/8 minutes.  The closes train station was 3 short blocks away (A,B& C line) and 5 long";3
We stayed here for location to Universal Studios & perfect for this & all staff very friendly. Rooms are of good quality although one stain on carpet. We ate breakfast every morning a la carte & enjoyed. We had 1 buffet dinner on 4th night (only because of the previous night room service debacle!) & we enjoyed the buffet dinner quality items on offer . We had 3 room service & on the 3rd night it became very disappointing we were advised 1 hour wait & we accepted this for 2 toasted cheese sandwiches, they had been kind enough to accommodate our request & we ended up waiting 2hrs 45mins, this was ridiculous & such poor service.  Then returned to our room & room service dishes still in room. Very very disappointing.;3
This was our 2nd visit to the hotel. We were disappointed with the room. It was tiny. The room should have been for 1 persons, but 2 of us in the room. No bedside cabinet, having to use window ledge to put water etc. Tiny bathroom. Its ok for just sleeping, very disappointed,  esp after 1st visit.;3
Stayed here for 2 nights while in the city. The room and hotel looked nothing like these pictures! The place was old and run down. The room was the size of a shoebox too! Terrible! I wish I had taken a pic. The bathroom was old too. It looked like the tile had paint over it to cover up grime. The beds were old and hard as rocks.   The reason they didn't get 2 stars was because the staff was very friendly.;3
The hours scouring the net for reasonable accommodation in NYC I won't get back.  With a heavy heart I reluctantly plumped for this hotel as being the best of a bad bunch.  The other options were either too awkward location wise or ridiculously expensive.  Taking the still-too-high costs out of the equation for now the hotel is tired but I found the staff and the room to be adequate.  All the staff I had contact with were courteous and helpful - although I didn't have any pressing issues to test that with -  and the room size/condition/cleanliness ok for the obvious high turnover of occupants.  The location of the hotel was pretty darned good, as others have said, several subways close by taking you main-line into the very centre in just a couple of stops.  Central Park is;3
Good value for money. Very spacious room with 2 double and comfy beds. Clean. Size of hotel made it seem a bit impersonal and although efficient, staff we encountered were not warm or friendly. Waiting for lifts wasnât too much of an issue for use despite being up very high. I would probably stay again because of value for money but would have lower expectations of staff.;3
Me and my wife were last week in this hotel for 4 nights. It's clean hotel with simple and small rooms. Room was equiped by aircondition, satTV, bathroom, fan. They cleaned room and changing towels every day.   Personal on reception was unfriendly and boring. Hotel is equiped with free wifi.;3
"Me and one friend spent five days during our short vacation in the Big apple. We used it just as a simply bedroom so we couldn't appreciate all services. The building has a good and useful reception but on the floors you can notice that the envrionment is not more young and the rooms appear not yet ""refreshed"".  The position is amazing, some minutes walking from Central Park. In the Corner CafÃ¨ on the Broadway Corner people are friendly, good food. Open 24h.";3
Nice historical building. Great location, right next to the subway. When we arrived to the room maintenance was unexpectedly there. The sink in our bathroom was always clogged, so that was most likely why. Reported it to reception a few times but the issue was never fixed. It didnât bother us much, as the pipes in the building are definitely not new, but itâs an inconvenience if you need to shave. Great views if you get a top floor room.;3
The staff we dealt with were nice. Kind, friendly and helpful. So that's a plus. The hotel is in a perfect location.  The room, wasn't exactly ideal. I mean, it was okay but could've been better. The lighting isn't great, the light fixing casts a sepia tone over the room, it could be brighter. To open the window gives a view into a rundown building... the view was awful - but I didn't come to New York to look out a hotel window - so that wasn't too much of an issue. There was a fan outside which was constantly making a loud noise, thankfully I was able to zone it out to sleep. There's a comedy club near by which is SO loud but thankfully it stopped around 11pm.   Wasn't so happy about the room only being cleaned once during our trip 'due to covid'. Every other hotel I've stayed;3
We stayed here for one night for a wedding.  The location is ideal.  The staff were professional and very helpful and they let us check in early which is a huge help when you travel with small children.  The whole place has a night club feel - not really the place to come with kids.  The decor is all very heavy and dark.  You can't help thinking about how dirty it might really be if you could see properly.  The size of the rooms are about what you expect for NYC for this price and location.  They are small but we had enough space to set up the pack and play for our toddler at night.  The single biggest problem with this place is the bathroom.  The shower does not have a curtain, just a half door.  The water sprays all over the bathroom and soaked everything in sight in less than;3
This hotel is a great place for the budget traveller who donÂ´t want to stay in a dormitory with 11 other people. Our room was clean and comfortable, but not so much more than that. A big plus to the hotel manager who followed my wife to the supermarket some blocks away in the late evening, just so she could feel safe and I could stay in the room and watch NBA.;3
The New Yorker hotel is located just across the Penn Station and close to many major attractions. The hotel is however outdated and in need of urgent decoration and renovation. The staff is somewhat casual but helpful,  However  if you would like to have an experience of the past and to feel how hotels were, this ls the place to come.;3
Stayed one night before alining home. Seems we used to stay at the Hilton down the street, but now we are staying here?  Room was super clean with what looked like new carpeting.  Didn't like the windows in the room. Made it feel cell like.  They put me in a handicap room even though I presented my Hyatt Platinum Member card when I checked in.  I hate when they do that.  But room was clean and new.   Sink area in bathroom had very limited counter space to put toiletries and even less since the bath towels were stacked there too.   Bed seemed stiff. Bed stands had plenty of places to plug things in.  Room had bath robe, slippers, and an alternate blanket that was nice. A lot of tile in the bathroom to have to walk on because of the toilet placement since it was a handicap room,;3
Great location , rooms and bathroom small  , in need of refurbishment and a good clean.Very busy area of the city , near to Lincoln Centre , good outdoor music venue and close to the park. Not many places to eat in local vicinity of a reasonable price range , all top end price tags .  Major plus for the hotel is their staff all friendly helpful and polite . Thanks to Yuri and Holly at reception .;3
I had a ticket to the opera.  A Noreaster was forecasted.  Booked the Empire Hotel because it was the absolute closest to Lincoln Center. Seriously,  right across the street.  The valet was courteous and the valet parking was $60.00.  Front staff was limited so service was slow.  The room (super double ) was very small.  The bathroom was microscopic with no flat place to put toiletries .  I asked for an extra blanket several times.  Staff was limited.  Sink was clogged with a bottle cap from a former guest,  but was fixed very quickly . Chowder House is closed in the Empire.  Immediately next door to P.J. Clarkes so dinner was convenient during the storm.  I would definitely stay here again if I had tix to Lincoln Center.;3
Stayed at this hotel due to the proximity to the theme park. Overall the hotel is nice BUT it is very dated , our room had a slightly odd smell to it but the layout was perfect not the best view but that really wasn't a problem the In room toiletries were lovely and more than enough towels to cater for our needs. My biggest issue was that there was no free wifi on this particular trip we stayed in more inferior hotels and every one of them had free wifi and in this day and age I consider it to be a given bearing in mind that this hotel was not the cheapest, I also had a loyalty card but this was not enough as we had booked through a third party. The location is absolutely perfect and the pool area very nice too. Adequate parking was also available self park or valet we self;3
This hotel is for those looking for location,price,and cleanliness, not 5 star. This hotel was on central park west, 2 blocks from a subway, basic but clean, helpful staff, fuzzy tv reception, private bath, requested room with a balcony and overlooking central park, got both. Paid with tax $134 in nyc november. I saw hostels with shared bathrooms for that price.;3
Hotel was walking distance to universal studios and metro but nothing else. We had to take taxis everywhere which was quite expensive. Hotel itself was clean and beds very comfortable. The restaurant was overpriced and no 'good' restaurants around.;3
Tiny rooms.  Chaotic elevators.  Fantastic views.  Incredible location close to subway and hotspots.  Macdonalds,  starbucks and Cvs in front.  Very clean.  Cheap for the zone.  Crowded.  We were 4 in the room and is difficult to live with that space.;3
Empire Hotel was fairly decent, and in a great location across the street from Lincoln Center, but it wasn't a 4-star hotel. Though the room was small, the beds were comfortable and clean.  The bathroom, however, was ridiculously cramped and poorly designed. There was only a partial glass shower door, so water sprayed out of the shower stall from the other half all over the floor.. The  shower knob didn't turn and work properly, so we either got scalding hot water, or freezing cold water. The sink was designed poorly, so when you turned on the water, it automatically ricocheted off the sink onto the person using it.. The bathroom was so small that you had to close the door to get access to the toilet paper behind the bathroom door. All in all, it was a very poorly designed;3
First a few positives:  The location is excellent -- minutes from two subway stops and directly across from Lincoln Center.  Also, we had a great room overlooking the front entrance on the second floor -- it was quiet (as long as the window was closed), but with a lovely view.  But, really, this is the cougar of NYC hotels.  The decor is a bit garish with extensive use of gilt and leopard prints -- I knew this going in and was fine with it.  But when you look a bit closer you notice that it's got some wrinkles beneath the surface.  Our bathroom was clean -- but kind of gross in that paint was chipping, there were some permanent stains on the door frame and the caulking was tearing apart.  It could use a little TLC, not a smothering of fabrics and bright colors.  Overall, a fine;3
"My biggest ""but"" is the fact that internet access shouldn't be charged additionally and the room could also have a mini-fridge and microwave. Really good location! Room (double) clean and small, yet not too crowded, so you can easily move around. Stuff nice but not too eager to attend you. Overall OK for the price.";3
You can't beat the location here. You are one street away from Penn Station. Times Square is a ten minute walk away. Unfortunately the hotel seems run-down and in need of a major renovation. It just looks worn out (worn carpets, cracked tiling, creaky elevators). Speaking of the elevators even though there were supposed to be six of them it only seemed like a few were working. Be prepared for long waits and once you do get one it will be packed with people stopping at every floor. The room itself was incredibly tiny. If you are with someone I hope you are very close. The bathroom is tiny as well. The sink has no vanity and really no space to put your toiletries out. They also nickle and dime you for stuff here. To check your bag at the bell desk is $5 per bag..I gave it three;3
For the first time in the hotels history there is a TV in the bar Area !And great people working at the front door ,the front desk very helpful !And the guys at the front door very helpful in every way !;3
Contrary to the first time I visited, I was greeted with a smile and given a room that I could actually turn around in! It was still quite small.  The problem with boutique hotels like this is that one of the things you expect in NYC from a four star hotel is space. I realize that space is at a premium in NY and that we are not in Omaha, but if your regular rooms are not adequately sized, then you have no business calling your self a four star hotel.   The AC is the room did not have a thermostat and was one of those old fashioned types that you used to see in the 70s and 80s. It made quite a racket!  While taking a shower on the first night, I noticed a great many flying insects which were coming from a small hole in the corner. Also on that first night, my television remote;3
I stayed for 2 weeks at the hotel, and got an online rate of about 90$. Breakfast is good, large variety but same everyday. The staff are terrible. Extremely bad customer service.  Housekeeping went into out room before we checked and threw out some of our things that were in plastic bags, and then had the audacity to say we threw it out because it was rubbish.   I would however stay there again. The location is very practical for sightseeing via public transport or by car as it is very closes to the 101 highway. Lots of places to eat, supermarkets, etc., close by. The rooms are clean although the bathtub could do with a good scrub.   On the whole good value for money.;3
"Nice little (the emphasis is on the ""little"" (approx 10 ft x 10ft) room, on an excellent location and economic price. The heating of the room could only be controlled by turning on or off at the stem valve; when on it made noises suggesting rodents' presence. The elevators need improvement.";3
I came to the Jane on a Friday night, having booked it at the suggestion of a friend who wanted to share a bunk bed room with me. My friend had to cancel at the last minute due to a family emergency.  The restaurant was very good.  It was a pleasant enough room, well appointed but certainly designed for the minimalist traveler. It would be hard to share the space with a second person and have any sort of privacy or room for baggage.   I could hear music from multiple sources until 3-4 am and people chatting in rooms as I walked by despite the heavy wooden walls and decor. It's a great hotel if you enjoy clubbing and meeting new friends while brushing your teeth.   I likely won't stay there again unless my husband (a diver) wants to check it out -- or I have a trip to New York;3
This Hilton property is just okay. It's expensive and parking even moreso, but it's a good choice if you want to be within walking distance to Universal Studios Hollywood and CityWalk. You can reach it by foot within 15 minutes, but note that the walk is a bit treacherous. There aren't exactly good sidewalks, and it's mostly uphill. If you think it's convenient because you're planning to walk, you may want to think twice if you have very young children or the elderly in your party.  Our room had a cool view of the park, and was very clean and well maintained. The air conditioning wasn't great, which meant a slightly too warm and uncomfortable evening. The breakfast buffet was good, but if you want the tasty hot items you have to pay an extra $10 per person. I enjoyed the fresh;3
Just spent ten nights at this hotel with my teenage daughter.  Our room was adequate but no more.  It was on fourth floor at the front of the hotel so had a view of the Lincoln Centre - lovely.  Best feature of the hotel is the location - excellent for access to subway, close to amenities and Central Park.  The rooftop 'pool' is tiny - I would guess approx 4 feet by 10 feet and was full of children on the one occasion we visited.  All the sunloungers were occupied by people or 'reserved' by towels - not worth the trek up to the roof! Have not previously stayed in NYC so nothing to compare with but not a patch on London hotels.;3
"My wife and I stayed here in August of 2013 as part of a wedding party.  First impression of the hotel as you walk in is that itâs a nice place with a good atmosphere, even if the reception and bar area are a little dark â¦ well, quite dark actually â¦ although in fitting with the dÃ©cor and atmosphere.  The staff seemed attentive and very helpful; nothing was too much trouble for our wedding party.  Our room was basic although comfortable; the only downsides were that there was no wardrobe in the room, only a small clothes rail and a few coat pegs on the wall.  The view from the window overlooked the internal aspect of the hotel, so not the best either.  One other thing worthy of note, do not eat / drink any of the complimentary items in the room as they are extortionately priced;";3
Booked this hotel very last minute after going through a couple of reviews, the hotel itself is located on the outskirts of Hollywood , but when I say Its conveniently located I mean it's easy to get to most places from here, cos it's 10mins drive from downtown as well as central Hollywood , so it's like somewhat in the centre of both , 6-7min drive from sunset strip... The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable , the AC is a bit noisy and may turn off at night , but once you inform the reception bout it they change the settings and have it on.  The breakfast is very average, just had it for one day The front desk staff can be more courteous, we were checked out by someone named Gisel, who didn't come across as very friendly. All in all it's a good option for the price your;3
Decent value for the money. Good Location. convenient parking. computer experience was poor - Windows XP and very slow internet. I was impressed it had 3 electric charging stations. The pool would be an asset in the summer;3
We stopped in NYC to visit our daughter on the way home from Europe. The Empire has been nicely remodeled since my last visit. However, I found the service and staff to be less than efficient. The price was good and the location was excellent.  Rooms were tiny.  In spite of all, I would stay there again.;3
"Is that your Vehicle; What are you doing here words said as I first entered the doorâ¦.This started my trip pf bad and is something that should never be said to anyone especially at arrival the lady at the front door as Security should not be the front of the business";3
This historic hotel has a beautiful lobby, but long waits for check in and for luggage service. We waited 10 minutes before anyone came to the luggage station, despite other staff telling us it would be just a few minutes. Also, during four different showers, the water was crazy. Flashing between freezing and scorching makes for a very uncomfortable experience. The location is great, and we had a nice view.;3
The location of this hotel makes up for what was an ok stay. I stayed at Empire about five years ago - wonderful experience. This trip - the room was small but clean and comfy. The roof top pool / deck was great for a sunset view. We came to this hotel for a two day work trip. We needed to use the wifi provided by the hotel/ work from the hotel, which was not working. At first the issue was not handled well, then when management took over it was handled appropriately. Overall an ok stay with the help of starbucks wifi. I'd recommend this hotel for a weekend / NYC holiday because the hotel location is great!;3
I must admit when you first walk in the foyer is impressive. Overall our experience of the hotel was great. In the room however there was no complimentary tea or coffee and the standard of decor really needs updating lots of scuffs and marks on the furniture which really takes the shine off things especially for the price you pay.;3
A historical and old hotel with the standard charm of the 1930's (and the hallways will instantly remind you of the Shining!). We stayed on the 25th floor. Rooms were considerably larger than expected and clearly requiring substantial maintenance. Comfortable and clean nonetheless. Bathtub was shallow but water pressure and shower head was excellent. Taps are old so even the smallest nudge will either scald or freeze you - pick the setting and do NOT touch the taps lol. Check-in/out was fast and easy and the staff at that desk (on the right as you enter) were pleasant and helpful.  The cleaning staff were very nice and rooms were cleaned daily.  Location is good, DO NOT go to the McDonalds across the street unless you are comfortable with individuals who have untreated;3
Do not waste your time ordering food.  Service is below average.  It took over 40 minutes for my order to be taken.  Three people at the table and food came out about 20-30 minutes apart.  Manager had to be summoned about an hour later as my food had not arrived.;3
This hotel is in a very convenient neighborhood and the staff is great. Nothing electrical in my room worked. First the bedside lamps had to be fixed and then the hvac had to be fixed. The desk lamp  had issues and the hair dryer never would turn on. Worst of all the remote just didn't work and I had to get out bed to turn off the TV!!! Is this the 19th century?!? Otherwise, I liked it- close to food and the subway, Little Italy just down the street, straight shot to Columbus Circle and Wall Street. I'd go back again if they promised me a working remote.;3
we stayed here for 3 nights at double room with private bathroom. room and bathroom was quite large and clean. bed was uncomfortable and door at hall was noisy and woke up us all night ....  Location is very good, near bus station, tube stations and many shops and nice shopping centre (tkmax, poundland,primark,sainsburys). room include fridge, dishes (plate,fork,knife and spoon, cup);3
We chose this hotel for its proximity to Madisson Square Gardens and the Billy Joel concert. From that perspective it fit the bill perfectly. However, the rooms themselves were very cramped and basic and it looked like the whole place was in need of a good clean. As is typical in the city, things like Wifi and even the business centre came at a sizeable extra cost making the headline rate much less than the final bill!;3
We stayed here and found it very convenient and nicely appointed.  The second time we requested a room by the courtyard on the second floor.  When we checked in she said that there were rooms around the courtyard but we couldn't have one.  So we asked for a room by the pool, meaning in the back away from the traffic noise...When we got to our room we were dead in front with an air conditioner pointed at the  bed, hence I left sick, The closet is in the bathroom??? The one good thing I can say about it is the breakfast is good.  We won't be back.  By the way, the desk clerk gave us $51.00 on our way out and when we landed at home they called and wanted their money back.  Stupidest thing I ever heard.  I was in the hotel  business 25 years, this was tragic.;3
Stayed in a captains room for five nights recently - this is a double room with private bathroom. Both room and bathroom were good sizes and I loved the decor which presumably has been refreshed since the Titanic sank, but not restyled. No kettle in room, but kettles in rooms seem to be going out of fashion based on my recent experiences. Drinking water is provided. The room did get cold but heaters are available if you ask.  The worst thing is probably the noise.  It is a very noisy hotel - there is a busy road outside and a bar and a nightclub on the ground floor.  Staff and other guests add to the noise throughout the night.  Take earplugs if noise bothers you, but besides that, the location is great, cafe Gitane is excellent - have the avocado on toast- and the staff were;3
Very dated but has all you need for a base , rooms big and very clean staff were excellent and the breakfast buffet was great the chief will cater to whatever you want .. Cereal and bagel s also available.there is no bar and although it advertised happy hour ,it never materialised..;3
I stayed at the New Yorker for four days when I visited Manhattan with my mom. It's located about a ten minute walk from both Times Square and the Empire State Building, so I'd say the location is good, but other than that, this hotel is just that: a hotel. The staff is average (the concierge was nice, but the lady who checked us in was quite rude), the rooms are small (normal for New York though) and the wifi was awful (you had to sign back in all the time). Overall, the hotel gave the impression that it was once a luxurious building, yet is now just old and kind of mouldy (showers!!!!!!!!!!!!). I'd still recommend it though because it is inexpensive and New York is a place where you spend most of your time sightseeing, and not in your hotel.;3
"To be honest - this was a 2-night stay because we needed to visit Universal Studios; the Hotel gave us what we expected.  Clean room - with a park view Breakfast - very busy though and some waiting time.  Location was the key and it was good, in walking distant to the park and back - that was what we wanted and we got it.";3
My room was very small and a bit noisy.  I was on the first floor right next to the elevator (room 110). Room was quite dark even when opening the curtains to reveal a bank of A/C fans.  The front desk staff was friendly and the location was excellent being right across from Lincoln Center.;3
"The best thing about this hotel is location - right in the thick of it and subway on the doorstep! Lots of elevators so no waiting around to get to your room. Staff generally polite and helpful although we did have to wait 45+ minutes for toilet roll when insufficient for 24h left in the room when cleaned in the morning. Room was pretty small and pretty basic - apart from the lobby pretty much all communal areas and certainly our room were in need of redecorating and updating. Despite the age however everything seemed pretty clean. Overall we had a good stay but be aware of the ""mandatory facilities fee"" of $45 a day which was not in the small print of the website we booked through- maybe expected by US citizens but we certainly didn't expect it on top of their high rate. Not a";3
Charged for checking in early, put in a suite that had this annoying constant ringing sound, only to be moved to another room with a view of get this the roof! Which we'd paid for a view, it also had constant horrible noisy sounds. We had to complain so very many times, but was not receiving NO LOVE! Finally, my husband had to show some aggression, which he and I both were uncomfortable with him having to do, and we too felt violated by this. So, we were atlas given a room with a view,(Which like I'd said, is what we paid for, but the front desk manager lied to me and said that we didn't ask for that option while making our reservations online), all of this after having to complain to hotel staff, and on my birthday! Which I also kept reminding them of! In clothes that we;3
My friends and I stayed 2 nights at Astor over Memorial Day weekend for about $200/night. At the time, the average going rate for a decent hotel in Manhattan was at least $250, so we decided to save some money and chance it. What I can tell you is you get what you pay for.   We booked the stay online and got confirmation of a room with 2 double beds. When we arrived, we were forced in to a room with just 1 double bed, as the receptionist said they were overbooked.  So we decided to camp up in the unacceptably small room on the 7th floor (for 3 people) while we worked on getting the room we were actually confirmed for (ended up being Room 702). The doorman was very nice in bringing our luggage up to the room and ended up helping us get the room we needed with 2 double beds.   The;3
Got wrong room at first, way below adequate for pre paid rate, not clean, about 120 sft smaller than suggested in booking process. Upon complaint we were relocated to the correct room - great size, great view. Unfortunately hairdryer and small things missing, and only provided after walking down to reception (after calling twice in vain).  Wifi low and unstable in our room on 10 th floor/corner - useless unless in the lobby.  Overall, still a lovable place - but you just notice itâs been great in the 2000s and thatâs been a while. Pool area closed (again) for one of our few days there. Lobby bar closed. Restaurants closed.;3
We had tickets to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden and wwere taking the train into Penn Station. Since I was just recovering from a back injury we wanted something close and this hotel was less than a block away. We loved the old New York feeling in the lobby but the long walk to our room and the size of room reminded us of what we didn't like about that old New York feeling. The room was clean but worn. Finding a place to plug in our phones was interesting when after crawling around my daughter realized an extension cord was being used for lamps and house phone. The room served it's purpose and I would stay there again if the price was right. There was a $25 room fee that I have no idea what was included. If it was the Internet it was a waste since we couldn't access it;3
This has 4/5 on trip advisor but is not a 4 star hotel, possibly a 3 star.  The room was fine but nothing special, the bathroom needs updating.  Breakfast was also fine.  All in all for the price I expected  bit more but it was ok.  We didnt have a car but saw they charge paying customers for parking? Really?;3
Overall not bad but HVAC system in the room was very loud all night long.  Loud vibrating and clanking noises turning on and off every 10 minutes made getting a good sleep impossible.  Bring a set of ear  plugs if you want to sleep soundly.  Other than that not a bad hotel.;3
First off, this really is a historic hotel with an incredible story to tell, unique architecture and style that somehow feels New York even on the first visit to the city. The location is incredible: walking distance to Empire State Building, Times Square and Broadway (by European standards walking distance, at least). If that's not your thing, Penn Station is literally across the street with all sorts of local, long-distance and subway trains available as well as cabs, ubers and whatnot in abundance. The hotel itself is clean, the staff helpful and polite.  Now, the first time I checked in, I got one of their new corporate suites: up to date, nice and exactly what this sort of hotel should look like in my opinion. Unfortunately due to some plumbing issue (leaky shower), I was;3
Hotel is tired but under renovation  Arrived from Australia after 15 hr flight at 930am to be told no early check-in, wasnt happy,was told room be ready at 2pm  Room was comfy and looking over court yard.

The New Yorker has an interesting history with many celebrities lives intertwined. Roaming around certain areas provides visual cues about a fascinating background. The Art Deco features are also very attractive.  It is an older building and those are challenging to maintain.  While we had issues with bedbugs, we did get moved to better accommodations and the last one did not have bed bugs but bed bugs are a new challenge in warmer climates. The specialists did not find evidence in the first room but my husbands reactions on his arm from the first bedroom and mine from the first and second led to a horrible experience. The last suite on the 38th floor (there are 40 floors) provided a breathtaking view of New Yorker. The managers tried to provide better alternatives and the suite;3
The location is ideal however some of the services could do with an upgrade. As one of the reviewers already mentioned, the fitness room was cramped which causes inconvenience. Also the treadmills and bikes need repairs. Food was not bad but the cost was bit on the higher side.;3
Small room, slow and rude front desk employees. Made service came way to early and were very aggressive to get their work disspite the fact that I was still in my pjs in bed. I needed a toothbrush but had to but the smile kit for $17.;3
Hey people, Woogo Central Park is an apartment building NOT a hotel...why do people out there think why will get hotel like service from an apartment building...thats the reason why  this place is cheaper than a hotel...you get a doorman (very helpfull guys) and reception desk in the foyer and thats it. The apartment i had was very small but clean and functional and everything worked so i was happy with it all. Its basic in all aspects but i just needed a bed and shower and it delivered. Its 1 block from the 72 st subway station and plenty of eating options close by.....would happily stay again....cheers all;3
The room was small but clean. The furnishings were outdated and worn, the shade over the window was in shambles, walls were scuffed, carpet was worn but clean. The bathroom had been updated fairly recently and was nice. The view was of other windows. But we were looking for a cheap place to stay so I would have to say it is average for it's price. The elevator was small and slow, but still much better then the steps!;3
The hotel is conveniently located near Universal city studios. The continental breakfast was below average, lunch and dinner buffets were good. There is a bus station within short walking distance. However, you would need to drive to all Los Angeles attractions. We liked the fitness facility.;3
I stayed here for a few days while in London and I enjoyed myself. The rooms are reasonably nice with communal bathrooms down the hall. The location is excellent, 2 minutes walk from Hammersmith station. Easy to get to anywhere in London. It's a budget place so don't expect too much. The location is what makes it.;3
This is a boutique hotel, that is in an amazing location.  Which I believe is what you are paying for.  The rooms are small and if you go above the 3rd floor, unbelievably hot and uncomfortable.  The beds were comfortable, firm, but comfortable.  Bathrooms small, and I could not even stand in front of my sink and brush my teeth or use the mirror.  Overall clean, but rooms are dark and interior of hotel is dark.   The valet's, doorman extremely nice and the concierge's were amazing.  Front desk staff, well some were great, but the one's who were not left a bad impression on the rest of the staff. Note, if you stay here and get a lower level room on the front side, you will have to deal with traffic noises etc.   Which I think you would expect in NYC.;3
Stayed here twice in February and feel I have different views on both stays. The first stay at the hotel was uneventful. Our room on the 33rd floor was on the small side, but clean and comfortable. The second stay was somewhat different. We had a room on the 22nd floor and was similar to our first stay. Unfortunately on our last night we returned to our room having been out sightseeing all day to find that our room had not been seen by housekeeping. We thought that they perhaps were just running late so changed for dinner and left the hotel. On our return at 9.30pm, we realised that housekeeping had overlooked our room so we phoned them to advise them of this . A chambermaid was despatched and our bed was made and fresh towels were given. Not entirely satisfactory, but just;3
This Hilton is old and dated and also expensive if you are travelling alone. Should you be on your way with small(er) children a room with two queen beds is a good choice and worth the money. Sorry to say, but here you pay for the location. Breakfast buffet is very nice, but they also know to charge for that(too much in my opinion). Service is great as it always is at Hilton, but they need to refurbish and look at the pricing. The elevators are under renovation, so that should be better in the near future. The rooms are quite spacious, but the walls are very very thin.......;3
After booking our stay at Days via the net.  I decided to read up on some reviews (I KNOW! should have checked it out first!!) Upon reading the entries about cockroaches and poor service I was put into a state of panic!   The reality I'm happy to say turned out to be completely different! I have certainly stayed in plusher venues than Days.  However, we were more than happy with the service provided by Pavel and the desk staff.  The room was cleaned and bedding and towels changed daily.  We were looking for somewhere to sleep while we spent the rest of our time on vacation!  Lets face it NO hotel is ever as good as home.. and we did not expect it to be! This hotel has had a bum rap from some of the reviewers and I would simply say.  This is a nice friendly hotel, NOT the ritz,;3
Initially I would have given this hotel a very good review. If you book the King room, the room is spacious and the views of the mountains are quite nice. However if you book a room with two beds, the room is half the size and the views I had were of the parking lot. If you can get the king room, then book here, if not, then stay at any holiday inn or the like because you'll get the same basic room for a lot less than staying here.;3
I have stayed at this property about 4 or 5 times. I live in San Diego and my friends and I occasionally drive up to Hollywood for the weekend. This hotel is a great choice if you want to party in the Hollywood, West Hollywood and (especially) the Silver Lake area. It is blocks from the Vermont Metro Subway  Station which takes you to Downtown, Hollywood Blvd and even Universal Studios in minutes. The staff is hit or miss - there have been times when they have been helpful and others when they have been indifferent. Don't expect gold star service, but I have never had a horrendous experience. Once we even upgraded to a larger room when there was a problem with our booking at no extra charge. The property is a little dated and unspectacular, but the rooms are clean and adequate.;3
The hotel is located in a strategic location near penn station so if you are using the trains it's pretty good. other than that it's not the best part of town... you are bound to run into some funny characters all around you.  We had a double queen bed room which was pretty spacey. The room is VERY uncomfortable - there is no light in the closet room (although it is nice to have one, but it has no shelves, so it's basically just a suitcase hideout). and there are no shelves in the bathroom... you got nowhere to put your toothbrushes or whatever. The shower head in the bathroom is something you might use to clean your car with.   it really feels like the hotel is putting patches on anything that breaks instead of really giving a decent fix.  We stayed on the 36th floor and had;3
Lovely hotel who cannot seem to get their room temperatures under control.  This is the second stay at this hotel due to the location.  First time was in the summer and very hot in New York.  The hotel rooms were extremely hot and air conditioner could not keep up with the temp in the room.  Now stayed in March when cool outside and the hotel room was again very hot.  Read 80 degrees entire stay.  Maintenance turned off the heater in the room and the temperature never changed.  Time for the hotel to invest a little in the heating and cooling system;3
"I stayed her for almost a week for a trade show.  The shower was continuously blazing hot then freezing cold.  I had chalked it up to me getting ready at the same time as hundreds of other people...until I had to shower at 4am to catch a 7am flight.  Same horrific shower experience.  NEVER had one that was consistently the same temp.  Also very noisy.  When I was in the bathroom I could hear everything from the next door neighbors.  Also the in-room safe never worked.  Note they accept pets.  It was great because I got to ""meet"" the Westminster Dog Show winner!  But it was bad because I could hear the yip of the dogs on my floor well into the night.  Overall the room was a very good size for NY standards and you can walk to Javits from there, but I would not stay there again.";3
I would not recommend this hotel for families with children.   To start there is a $17 a night charge for self-parking. The evaluators from the parking garage go to the lobby floor, then you have to walk through the buffet line to get to the check-in counter. If there is a wedding you have to basically walk through the wedding to get to the elevator (if they haven't blocked off the entrance). The shuttle to Universal Studios comes by every 15-20 mins BUT if there is an event going on plan on waiting longer. You can walk to Universal S. but it's across a very busy street and up a steep hill, not convenient for small children.   The rooms were clean, the bed was comfortable, but decor was standard and the room had a terrible smell. There was a refrigerator with pay as you use;3
You wouldn't want to be in a more convenient location if you base yourself on the Upper West Side. The hotel is an old building which has been refurbished and is popular with people from the U.S. when in town. The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable. The lifts are shabby and the overall decor is very 70s. The breakfast service could be improved, but there are plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. Go for a room on a higher floor to lessen traffic noise. If you don't intend to spend too much time in your room and you receive a good rate, this hotel is recommended.;3
We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, which we booked last minute on the internet the day before we went. It was a good base for sightseeing New York.  The concierge doesn't have great local knowledge and generally wants to sell you trips in order for him to get commission, i would suspect! We booked a helicopter trip with him, which we are glad we did - as you need to reserve a place the day before and it was the same price if we'd booked it ourselves.  We also booked a car to the airport with him-but this was a bit of rip off compared to the cost of the taxi from the airport. Paid $47 from the airport, plus tips, and the cab he books is $55 plus tips and also $5 for a toll bridge - which they don't tell you about. If you've got the time and aren't too tired would recommend you;3
The room was ridiculously small. Bathroom even smaller and a bit dusty. However, we were not in NYC for the room. It served its purpose.  FYI, snacks in room are outrageously priced and Keurig coffee pods are $3.00 each.;3
I expected a certain standard of hotel, considering this one was meant to be 4 stars.  I would definitely not rate this as such.  The room was tiny, with 2 windows facing onto 3 brick buildings that you couldn't even see the sky - I kid you not!  The air conditioning was antiquated and hanging off the wall and when it was switched on it sounded like there was a tractor in the room!! You couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom and it was all just a bit grubby and need of a good scrubbing.  There were 4 elevators in the hallway and only 1 worked at any given time. What I will say is, the beds were comfortable and clean, and the location of the hotel was ideal.  I would not stay here again and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to my friends.;3
Let's face it..,,the Jane is not for everyone!! When I read some of the FEW negative reviews ,,,,, I wonder what these people exactly had in my mind when they book their rooms.., did they not do a little research??...Maybe the cheap Manhattan price sucked them in.... Well let me tell you,,,,, I paid $90 for a closet of room, so tiny,,,,,AND I  loved every minute of it..The Jane Rocks!! Yes,,, I had to share a bathroom, and sleep in very small quarters,,..No problem!!!..Love the atomosphere of this hotel.. The staff were so friendly and helpful..No attitude..Cool!!! Awesome neighborhood!!! Hotel has a ccol history!! If you stay here,,,do a little research,, if it's not for you,, no problem,,,BUT,, if you are like me,, not uptight and up for an adventure.!!!! you will love it!!!;3
"This is a great place to stay if you want to be near Central Park as well as near subway stations without ""breaking the bank.""  Room was comfortable with a nice bathroom which included toiletries with my favorite lavendar scent.  A couple of cafes were within walking distance, so that's another plus.  I'd stay there again because I like to get a bargain whenever possible.";3
So I will start with the positive. Pros:  - Truly walking distance to Universal Studios. Many places claim to be and aren't, this is honestly an easy 5-10 minute walk.  - Clean!  - Nice beds and linens.  - Surprisingly nice pool. Given where it is, I was surprised that when at the pool, all you see are trees and the hotel, no cars or other businesses.   Cons: - I could clearly hear the next room, especially in the bathroom. By clearly I mean I could have participated in the conversation.  - Rattling pipes. Constant pipe rattling noise no matter the time. Again, clearest in the bathroom.  - Although the room appeared to have been recently upgraded, there was a strange rusted pipe (see photo) in the shower, and the soap dish was falling off the wall.  - Why is there only one towel;3
"I frequently stay in Wyndham properties, and this was definitely not their worst, but certainly not among the best.  Overall, for a quick 1-2 night weekend trip, this was great.  Very central location.  Easy walking to Penn Station and other attractions.  Made for a good home base as we bounced around the city and needed to grab extra layers as the night went on.  Otherwise, not the greatest  experience.  The lobby was very crowded a time of check in, and the clerk who helped us in the specially designated ""Wyndham Rewards Gold Member"" line was pretty rude and short.  She gave us quite the attitude, even after I told her i was a Gold member and using my points for this stay, and that I was not in a rush and for her to take her time.  She then tried to make up for her";3
"I would not say that they really lie, but just by omition... They show you the beautiful entrance, but this is parking side, so when you are looking for this hotel, look at the name, and not an hotel with a beautiful fountain, you could not find it! On google in the description, they say ""luxury hotel"", and you know that's a 3 stars, so when you see the price, you say, yes ok!... But... luxury bedrooms are for the last level with a great view! Wait! The best is now, friday night we didn't have any warm water!! For medical reasons, I needed 2 warm bath a day, and I couldn't friday... THIS was inacceptable from a ""Luxury Hotel""! Hopefully, they have a great breakfast, with a pretty dinning room, the microwave and the fridge in the bedroom, it was awesome to have them! And the the";3
When arrived our room not ready so we were given a disabled room which was a decent size but after reading other reviews was still very dark and dingy. Could do with better lighting if the colour scheme is to stay the same.  The room we had looked out over what I think was air conditioning fans for the hotel and other buildings attached and the back of the other buildings attached!!! Not a very pleasant outlook.  The fans made it very noisy 24 hours a day!!  The only place to access free internet was in the hotel lobby which was still not brilliant and everything in the room was at a price, even water and coffee!!!    The lifts were antiquated and it took a long time to arrive. Even when we had the Do Not Disturb sign stuck on door the housekeeping staff still kept knocking on;3
This is the only place to stay if you're visiting Universal City and Hollywood and make sure you get the Executive rooms as the lounge with breakfast and afternoon snacks is great. Everything about this hotel is good - food/room/pool/bar/parking etc. We ate at the bar on two nights and it was great and very reasonable with excellent service. Buses to Universal are regular and convenient and we did a hollywood tour by bus from the hotel as well. This really is 5 star with value for money. Oh except for the phone calls - don't use the room phones as international cell phones are cheaper!!;3
Nice hotel - it needs some TLC in certain common areas.  The lack of a shower door is wearing terribly on the the bathroom.  The whole room basically becomes a shower when it is used and mush be wiped down afterwards.;3
Pros: Location, shuttle service to Universal City Walk Cons: dated, only 2 receptionists, Diamond status non-existent, dusty parts in some areas of the room, incomplete amenities (eg. 1 creamer on the coffee maker, shampoos are very tiny!), no laundry bags, no slippers or robesâ¦ expect less from a Hilton brand for this location. Very disappointing as I brought the whole family and booked 2 rooms for the holiday. Nothing special! You are only paying for the location, thatâs about itâ¦;3
When we viewed the website for the Empire Hotel, we were intrigued by the sexy lobby, lovely rooms, but most of all the rooftop area which had a bar and gorgeous views of the city.  We imagined sitting up there in the evenings enjoying a cocktail.  That didn't happen.  When we arrived at the hotel, we discovered that the rooftop bar was a separate entity from the hotel, with a separate elevator, manned by big thuggish-looking bouncers who's job seemed to be to scrutinize potential guests and decide whether they were appropriately dressed (no flats...only heels), typical Jersey Shore persona.  Needless to say, having left my Snookie animal print mini at home, no attempts were made to even sneak a peek at the rooftop!    The hotel was somewhat rundown and the rooms could have been;3
Based on expectations we expected a higher class of hotel in NY. The hotel room was very small compared to other hotels in America. It was also dated and could do with a revamp. Location was fine and easy access to all sites of NY;3
My partner and I stayed here in early August 2013.Arrived in Newark at 12 midnight,rang the minibus transport and we were picked up within 10 mins!! Dropped to the door after an hour.Coral Castillo was very friendly and welcoming--even at that hour of the morning.Lifts/corridors/carpeting/decor is a little old and worn in places and there is a weird smell in the corridors BUT--the room was perfectly adequate for our needs.After all,we weren't there to live in the room.Excellent mattress on a queen size bed:good storage:room safe:bathroom very good and towels clean.Neighbourhood is really lovely-2 blocks from Central Park and a short subway ride from all the major tourist attractions.HINT:get a 3 day subway pass for $29.Might sound expensive but is well worth it as you can;3
For location if you are visiting Universal this hotel is fabulous you cannot fault that.  A free shuttle to take you right to the door of universal city walk.  With a family the pool is great and safe and has a nice bar area, and hot tub / jacuzzi.  The down side to this hotel however is the price of everything. Breakfast, dinner, laundry, the shop all so very expensive.  28 dollars a day to park,  18 dollars each Breakfast, 6 Dollars for a bottle of water,  Really!! With the price of the rooms this place is certainly a money burner!  Cannot fault the helpfulness of the staff they do a great job.  The elevators are having a lot of maintenance and took ages to get down from the 7th Floor, almost 20mins on one occasion.!!  I am a Hilton Honors Customer and stay at Hiltons a lot;3
This breaks my heart about The Jane, I've stayed many many times over the years, it's a real gem in a marvelous location. I love the staff/rooms/lobby and once gorgeous ball room that the hotel once opened to it's guests to have a coffee, sit in front of the roaring fire, cocktails in the afternoons, it was a HUGE perk.  Sadly now, it belongs to some 'club' that opens only at 9PM and is incredibly unappealing. The restaurant remains closed as well. The biggest miss to me is the non available cup of coffee in the morning, Wouldn't it be so very easy for the hotel to put a little coffee station in the lobby?? There is NO COFFEE available, one has to get dressed and walk several blocks,,for us it was insanely easy to fix with a coffee station but no such luck The staff remains;3
Don't be fooled by the massive pool that is shown in the hotels website. They some crafty angle shots. It is at max 7 feet across. We watched about 20 people or so come up to the pool only to laugh at the ridiculous size and walk away. In addition to it being tiny, you have to walk 3 flights of stairs to get to the deck and rooftop area. No elevator, that is only for staff.  The rooms are also very small as well, which tends to be the way it is for hotels in Manhattan. The bathroom door is also made of glass, so if you are traveling with a friend or associate, don't expect any privacy.  All that being said, we thought the room was reasonably priced for the area, and the blackout curtains really worked well.;3
The hotel itself is beautiful with lots of lobby areas for siting, socializing and relaxing. A nice little coffee place and a bar with happy hour specials. The room itself was comfortable but only average. I have stayed in a number of Hilton properties for both business and pleasure and this one was not quite up to snuff. The allure is it's proximity to Universal Studios. If you book this hotel through Universal you will get an early entry into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter which is really nice given the size of the crowds after the general opening. Not sure if you get this deal when you book directly with the hotel. Also, if you book through Universal Studios, Hilton will not give you points for your stay since you booked through a different company. This odd to me;3
Not the cheapest of places to stay. Room needing to be renovated, furniture in need of repair. However location wise good  subway stop mins away,also handy for the hop on hop off tour bus. Several eateries within walking distance.;3
Hotel is conveniently located near restaurants, bars, and a starbucks around the corner. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful and checkin/checkout was quick and efficient. Wifi surprisingly fast for hotel wifi. Rooms are relatively large by NYC standards. Bathrooms are in need of major repairs and/or cleaning but overall not terrible.;3
This hotel is in a prime location for subway, walking and some low cost alternatives like Starbucks, McDonald's and Famiglia pizza.  The restaurants at the hotel are not necessarily costly given its NYC but more costly than the average person would spend.  The staff are all courteous and there were people at a desk to help with information such as how to get someplace, the closest place for dessert, etc.  Rooms were clean but small.  There is no coffee pot, microwave or refrigerator but a $30 resort fee.  The fee and taxes totaled $60 additional per night.  This is common in NYC, not just this hotel, so buyer beware. For a fee, I was able to check in early.  Check out is at noon which is a bonus.  We walked or took the subway everywhere.  Penn station is right next door, Long;3
"Good location for subways but room wasn't great. Staff are very friendly and had an always ""open door"" policy. The rooms needs a major refurbishements and needs a new quality look. Overall, I would recommend this hotel on price and location.";3
nice location, next to Lincoln center.   room was noisy and hot.  they moved us the second night and I turned off the a/c and openned a window.  it was a bit cooler then. the breakfast was expensive and not all that good.;3
Room decor is eclectic, targeting an unimpressive clean and modern style while lacking in practical comfort. Hyatt LAX lacks the Feng Shui peace HYATT properties have been known to embrace. Table and chairs not effective âpartnersâ. Experience in Regency club disappointing food with poor and confusing selection of appetizers. Lobby all too proud to punish guests with CNN & MSNBC dogmatic talking heads at the end of a long day. Hotel is convenient to airport but area does not offer convenience to nearby entertainment nor quality food.;3
Close for subway, away from the crowds, quiet, clean. We had 3 to a room and had to ask for extra towels twice. Hair dryer didnât work and did ask twice. That was a nuisance in December. This is low end but was certainly clean and the price was right. We stayed 4days.;3
This is our 2nd time at the Hilton.  For location to Universal its ideal, but at over $200 per night its a bit steep.  Maybe the Sheraton is a better value.  Its a $75 taxi ride from the Airport and being up on a hill, walking to things other then Universal is a bit tiring.  The room is classic Hilton, but its starting to show its age.  Last time we came here 5 years ago we had a nicer room and the condition of the hotel was superb.  Reception and bell staff are very professional, but there is no concierge in the lobby -- you have to call them.  A bit strange.  They have a reasonably priced buffet for lunch.  The workout room is in a temporary room but the equipment is very good.  The pool is outside so its too cold to use in December.  Overall everything was fine, it just;3
The Days Hotel has seen better days.  They have signs up ask you to pardon their mess they are remodeling.  Didn't see the remodeling but the hotel is old and tired.  The rooms are clean, bed is comfy and the water always works.  They were having trouble regulating the heat and sometimes I would come in to a room with the air conditioner on to try and cool it down.  The elevator rarely worked right (a little scary). I took the stairs a great deal so get a room on a low floor, I was on the 9th ugh!.  The staff was  GREAT, always friendly and helpful. The location was excellent, food, subway stations and near the park (sort of);3
I have booked one room on this hotel on Priceline for two double bed for me and wife and kids. i have driven from Toronto to New York.  After spending almost 12 hours on the road, I wanted to have a place to relax. When I get to the hotel the staff , she didn't even have a smile or greetings to me. She start saying that if I have double bed then I have to pay extra for each night otherwise I can leave and they will charge for a night. I was so upset and tired that I had to go through this with family was waiting tired and looking at me what am I doing. She went to talk to her manager he was saying same thing. he strictly said this has nothing to do with them and I have to pay more to have double bed. if they have this kind of issues then why they even advertise in priceline.;3
The Empire Hotel is in a great location: across the street from Lincoln Center, near wonderful restaurants, walking distance from theater district and museums.  Hotel employees are nice and efficient.  Bathrooms are small and inefficient.;3
Youâre paying for the fact that it is only 5 mins walk from Universal Studios. Room was really large, but this meant the small TV was hard to see from the bed. Bed linens were high quality and soft. A/C was really loud so we ended up having to turn it off. When we arrived there was only one towel and a used cake of soap in the shower, but housekeeping was quick to bring more towels. Parking is expensive ($20 per night for self park). And the hotel information booklet was useless.;3
Great location but staff was not attentive to simple needs and doormen made you feel uncomfortable every time you left or arrived back to building. Huge disappointment overall. Location is key and walking distance to everything!;3
We stayed here for 5 nights. When we arrived we where asked if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra $200. We did this and arrived to a small room with a very small bathroom (which can be expected in New York anyway) and no space for a family of 5. We went back to reception, eventually the member of staff agreed to give us our original room back but we where warned it would be smaller with less of a view (we had no view in the âupgradedâ room). To arrive to our original room with a much better view, 2 bathrooms and 2 separate rooms for the family of 5 to stay in. Perhaps there was a mix up with the rooms, However when this was settled we had a lovely stay rooms where kept clean and towels changed for us when needed, the staff located around the hotel where all friendly;3
We enjoyed the location as it was a block away from Central Park. The bed was very comfortable and the room had a good selection of drinks and snacks however they were rather overpriced. The recently reopened rooftop bar was brilliant and staff very accommodating. The decoration of the lobby and restaurant are great, just need to spread this to the rooms.  Now for the bad bits: I had put in two requests to the hotel for a room with as good a view as possible due to the nature of the trip which was a surprise proposal to my partner. Unfortunately neither of my request were answered and we were put in a room which looked directly into a space within two buildings. Not ideal. The room happened to be quite loud due to all the aircon units on the adjacent building. Unfortunately the;3
We saved 10 years for this trip & had an amazing, busy, fun time in the City.  We got upgraded on arrival to a King size room on the 8th floor overlooking the main street, it was a great sized room, with a lovely comfy bed, but with a small bathroom & inconsistent air con.  The staff on reception & concierge team were all really helpful & friendly, we received an excellent service & great dining & travelling tips.  We were surprised that WiFi was not included in the room, having visited alot of European Cities this was unusual. We were also.shocked by the room extras, Empire bring your prices down & people we pay it .... $8 for a 75cl bottle of Evian ... Really!!!  We did choose the Hotel because of the roof bar & pool but unfortunately after checking both out they were very out;3
We came for a weekend visit with our kids. The neighborhood is fantastic - restaurants, playgrounds, ice-cream, and as subway stop all close by.  The hotel room was basic, at best.  Pros: Comfortable bed Good AC  Cons: WiFi did not work in room No light-blocking shades Room needs updates - stained carpet, mold in bathroom, wallpaper hanging off walls.  Very few channels on TV. No kids' ones Long lines for elevators,   Bottom line: The room was inexpensive, and its lack of amenities matched its comparably low price. I would not stay here again.;3
We had visited New York many times and I always wanted to stay in this Iconic Hotel. So when I got tickets to go to a concert in Madison Square Garden I booked it. Was very good for access to the subway and within walking distance of many of the attractions. Loved the older style feel to the hotel.  Only thing that let it down was after we checked out and went to leave left luggage. I was shocked when they charged us $5 per bag left. First time l have ever been charged to leave my luggage in a hotel I have just checked out of.;3
Hotel ok, room was tired and in need of a make over.  Shower curtain in bathroom sticks to you when using the shower. Tea/Coffee making facilities would be nice. Noise from street below was loud. Late checkout was expensive.;3
Stayed here for one night - I live in NJ but wanted to spend the night in the city for my birthday.  Room was small but clean and we spent very little time at the hotel.  It's in a nice neighborhood and the surrounding area is nice and safe, which is all I wanted.  Not the nicest hotel but it's the best you will find for a reasonable price on the upper west side.;3
We have been going to the New Yorker regularly over the past 15 years at the same time of year--Westminster Dog Show/Valentine's Day. We booked through a shady site--otel.com--and were a little worried something would go wrong with the reservation after reading their reviews. [I believe] since i called the hotel directly a week in advance of the reservation to confirm, all went well. Mohammed, who checked us in, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got the room type we reserved and it was nice. However, this time, there was NO refrigerator or coffee maker. Very inconvenient but available at a surcharge of, from what I'm told, was around $40/stay. There were major problems with the entrance doors, being worked on. HUGE wind tunnel going in and out. Don't bother doing your hair;3
Very disappointed by the pool and outer deck, pool is like a large bathtub, water was very dark and murky, was the primary reason we chose Empir for the rooftop pool, spend alittle more and stay somewhere else;3
I was in the city for the weekend visiting some friends, came by the hotel and entered the lobby bar for a drink. The hotel is in a great location, love the area. The service was great and the beer was cold :) especially one employee named Mor was really lovely an helpful.  Thanks for the great experience would definitely come by again.;3
My husband and I stayed at the Empire Hotel at the beginning of March 2016.  We were given room 1116 which was on the top floor and had a nice view of the Lincoln Centre.  The room was very spacious with a king size bed, two large windows, an armchair, desk and chair, set of drawers and wardrobe.  We had ample floor space which was a bonus given we were in NYC.    The bed was very comfortable and allowed for a good nights sleep especially when bearing in mind that I am pregnant.  We did note that there was no way to control the room temperature but we happily slept with the windows open at night which kept the room at a good temperature but did mean that you could hear city noise i.e. trucks and police cars during the night.   The mini bar is overly priced and it was;3
"My partner and myself arrived on the 11th of December 2015, after a long day of travelling we arrived at the hotel only to find that the hotel had no record of our reservation. After presenting the receptionist with an itinerary and proof of booking, she was helpful and put us in an empty room over night. The next morning we returned to the reception desk and the matter has been resolved overnight. (The booking had been placed with a spelling mistake by the travel agents.) We were moved to another room on the 6th floor immediately.   The rooms are very clean yet basic; personally I'd say it's ideal for a cheap city break as long as you're not expecting anything special. It had all we needed and did the job as we were out the whole day.   The (shared) bathrooms were clean but";3
The room 1218 was very small for 3 young adults, dark room rubbish lighting with an awful view of a wall! and very very very hot and stuffy!!!. The Air con gave us sore eyes and throats and awful humming noise 24/7, we was pretty much itchy the whole time we was in the room too!;3
This is a classic old NYC hotel in a terrific location. Rooms are typically small and a bit tired but well cared for. I arrived early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. But I came back when told to and it still wasn't ready. Twice more I came back when told to and the room I was supposed to get had been given to someone else. If you are in Manhattan for business or the night life and need a handy place to sleep, this is a very good place for that.;3
Nice and central location on Manhattan. But very noisy: Either from the AC/ventilation units outside or from the AC units in the room. With the AC on in the room there more noise than in a modern airplane. Friendly staff and clean room.;3
The first impression of the hotel was good but a few things didn't really work. The pool was closed a lot and that was one of the main reasons i booked it since we traveled with kids. The roof top was great, though. Wonderful views! The room was a bit too small for 2 adults, 2 kids and a baby. There was no room to walk. The air condition was loud and kept waking us up at night.;3
There are lots of bellhops in funny hats, amazingly campy decor and a calendar behind the registration desk that reads April 35. All very Wes Anderson, but the actual details of running a hotel didn't quite interest the management. Had to call the front desk  four times to get towels. The big draw was the bar, with loud thumpy music and overpriced drinks, appealing to Steampunk fans, perhaps. Facing the river, you also get the West Side highway noise, which is considerable. We were in a Captain's Room @ $300/night, so wanted service to be a little sharper.;3
Location is perfect for the restored hotel near the Lincoln Center.  Easy to get in and out verse the hotels around the theater district.  From those logistical aspects this is a nice spot.  Walking in the door I thought I was in a Star Wars bar with planets from around the universe well represented.  It isn't a typical business style but frankly it was just fine.  Rooms are small but adequate and I thought the shower stall was nicely sized with a large overhead fixture.  I could see the city street so I did hear some sounds at night but that wasn't over the top.  Could have used a water bottle in the room and the heating/cooling system is from a black and white movie era.  For a Hotwire purchase it gets better than average marks.;3
Just providing a nice large comfortable room does not justify a place to be called a hotel. It should have a proper 24 hr coffee shop, a 24 hour room service, more than one restaurant to justify charging a hefty room charge. Service means a customer after a long flight does not have to stand in a q to check in. The reception is short staffed. The don't understand difference between a credit card, a debit card and a Cash card?? Arriving late from San Francisco due to a delayed flight, all that the hotel could offer was a tasteless soup??;3
"The property is old, so the rooms are very tiny - tinier than others I've experience in NYC.  On the plus side, they took most of the available space for the shower; on the minus side, the toilet was difficult to use without hurting yourself on the toilet paper holder, the wall, and the sink (potentially all at the same time).  The bed was comfortable, but the tv was off to the side, so difficult to view from the bed.  The safe was too small for more than a laptop, but there was a safe.  We were sucked into a ""free breakfast"" presentation at a ""new Wyndham property"" not far away, so we thought, why not?  But it turned out to be a very aggressive timeshare sales pitch and the ""breakfast"" was a sad showing of a small scoop of scrambled eggs, a couple pieces of bacon, and a small";3
5 star advertised though the rooms were more like 3/4 star. The pool was advertised but closed when we were there for refurbishment. Staff were helpful & friendly. Good location but a poor view from our room.;3
I had high expectations of this hotel as it has been recommended via lots of different social media channels. The hotel is a wonderful art deco old New York Hotel and Iâm sure it could tell many a story of people staying here in the past.  I would recommend you ask for a higher floor as we were on the 7th floor and the view from the room was disappointing, nothing to see! Having seen amazing pictures on line, I can only imagine you would have to pay a great deal to have any decent view.   The rooms are small, and I know NY is renowned for this as space is a premium. My biggest grip was that there was not enough space for 3 cases and you couldnât hang much in the tiny wardrobe. We shared with my daughter so effectively 3 adults with nowhere to open our cases other than throwing;3
Very promising and luxurous entrance.  Hotel has a great location, couldn't be better as it was just a few blocj away from Times Square (walking distance)  Though, downside of the hotel is the very loud and old central airconditioning. This installation is in need of a facelift.  It's too loud and the installations in the rooms are due to be renewed urgently.  Rooms are a bit dissappointing when compared to the entrance and the reception desk of the hotel, no closet space and very small rooms and bathrooms. For a 5 stars hotel the daily service in terms of new towels etc can be improved.;3
No frills budget hotel at a good price (for New York hotels) for people looking to stay close to soho and lower east side areas. Walking distance to Brooklyn bridge. Clean rooms, perfect for what my girlfriend and I needed as  we were out exploring/eating/shopping 90% of the time.;3
Room was extremely hot and right next to laundry staff did move us to another room on third night. Each night it reached 80 degrees with the windows open and 35 outside and it was too hot to sleep at all;3
This hotel is the perfect place to stay if you're visiting Universal studios. It's a few hundred yards from the entrance, which takes a couple of minutes in the free bus.    Our room was spacious with a great view of North LA, while the decor was along the lines of other Hiltons (clean, but a bit dated) and breakfast was decent.;3
We stayed for 5 nights at the Hollywood Hotel.  The room was recently renovated and was quite clean. We had a double queen room on the 3rd floor and it was quite big with a balcony overlooking the swimming pool.  The bathroom was basic and cleanliness was ok.   Breakfast is practical - omelettes, cereal, doughnuts, bread, cream cheese, some fruit, juice, etc...   Parking is a bit expensive - about 20 or 25 dollars a night, but we were able to find street parking most of the time.   The staff however are not too nice - some are nice, but some are downright nasty.;3
Bottom-Line Upfront: Just OK - No frills hotel close to Universal Studios Amusement Park.  Pros: You can walk to Universal Studios if you have to which we did on way back. The Valet team is GREAT! When their shuttle broke down they took us in our own car!  Cons: Shuttle broke down. Breakfast Buffet staff way to over worked and too many table for each waiter to handle - not fair to staff. Hotel was under renovation which was noisy and caused very long lines to check-out. Bathroom was dirty and had human hair on floor. After check-in we alerted the front desk in person and nothing was done about it during our stay - big problem when you have children and a baby!  Recommend: Only sleep here to be close to the park.;3
I already answered this question.   Staff were wonderful.   Was not happy that I was charged for my room B4 I checked out and without my permission to do so.   This put my card over the limit and then I was charged again when I checked out,   saying that the 500 would go back on my card in 4-5 business days.   This card was to be used exclusively for my trip and the charges put on by the staff checking me in caused my card to be over the limit and I could not use it for shopping in New York the last day I was there.;3
Hotel is affordable and in a great location....steps from Penn Station, 20 mins walking in each direction to Times Sq or Chelsea, pleasant staff but rooms are outdated> layers upon layers of old paint on walls, bathrooms not modernized, hotel hallways dark and lifeless! A complete reno project is needed!;3
The hotel is very well located, near to a subway station. I spent six nights there, the first four in a Deluxe Apartment Suite with a couple of friends and the last two alone in a Private Bath room. The location is great, and overall I have no real complaints. Both rooms were clean, staff was nice enough, and, most of all, it was affordable. They have a little room where you can leave your luggage if needed, but they're not responsible for your belongs and just give the key alway to any guest. They entered our room for cleaning with us there more than once, yet gave us just one key to a room that can acommodate up to five people. But I will definetly stay there next time I'm in NYC. I'm used to all kinds of hotels, and this is a simple, good enough one, in a city that makes you;3
I thought the hotel was nice but the beds were very hard and I was there for 4 days so that wasn't good, also the bathrooms are small and don't have doors on the shower so that was dumb to me. Also one of the guest services messed up my girlfriend's credit card that prevented her from shopping the way she wanted, that was terrible.;3
Staying at an icon can be a lovely experience, but doing so may come at a cost to quality and updating. The 'Old Lady' sits in a great part of town, just a few minutes walk to so many amazing places. Loved our experience but the rooms and floors were well used and tired.;3
This hotel is clean, the rooms spacious, and the front desk helpful. Despite the name, it is NOT in Hollywood itself. But it is only a 5 min. walk to the Metro (subway) station, which is four stops from central Hollywood, five from Universal Studios, and about a twenty-five min. train ride to/from downtown L.A. The locale is not at all upscale, with homelessness evident in the area. But we were not uncomfortable walking about, and there are some decent eateries for basic dining, and an Ecuadorean tavern across the street.. The hotel will offer you a menu for room delivery from some more sophisticated restaurants, but the apparently reasonable prices get grossly inflated by taxes and extra charges. Ripoff! The charming picture shown above is from the rear, where you will arrive;3
Just returned from an amazing week in NYC. Stayed at The New Yorker for its great location and accessibility to everywhere - this is where the hotel scores really highly with Penn Station right next door and easy access uptown and downtown. Hotel itself is iconic with some beautiful Art Deco features in communal areas, but rooms themselves are very basic and the general decor could do with updating. Staff are amazing and helpful but the hotel looks to tease out additional fees at every opportunity, $22 per room per night + taxes to use WiFi, TV and gym (whether you want to or not) plus $5 per bag for hotel to mind your case from checkout to pick up time. On the plus thereâs an amazing restaurant linked to the hotel called Tick-Tock thatâs open 24/7 and is the epitome of an;3
What was supposed to be a fun day and evening turned out to be a very stressful start . We did not receive keys to our room until 3:45 pm. We had tickets to see Bocelli at the Met at 5 pm. So now we had one hour for two people to shower and get dressed. The only reason given for the delay was that the inspection had not been done yet .  With check out at 12 how is this possible.  NOT FAIR . I would appreciate an explanation to this matter.;3
I was actually really disappointed, I honestly thought the Empire would be a great hotel since it was on TV and the reviews seemed good. The location was great, it was right next to the lincoln center and a short walking distance to all the main attractions in NYC. the rooms were a bit sketchy, I wasn't sure if they needed renovation or if they were supposed to look that way ? the walls and doors are so thin you can hear everything that's going on around you which was really annoying- especially that loud music in the hallway, it would be super awesome if they could lower the volume. I was disgusted with the room I was in, I didn't feel like it was clean at all. a friend of mine dropped food on the floor by accident and housekeeping didn't bother cleaning it up the next day.;3
"If you're going to Universal Studios, this is a good selection.  You have to pay for parking though (and the parking garage only fits cars 6'4"" and smaller or use vallet).  Our room was clean, but hot.  If you face Universal Studios you also face the sunrise which bakes on your windows.  The air conditioner can't compete with the heat in the morning.  Staff is nice, and you get a welcome fruit basket.  Free continental breakfast avaiable for hilton honors members, but they are discrete about it.  Would I stay again, yes but I'd ask for a room that doesn't face the sunrise.";3
It was a nice stay but there is some wait on the lifts. The staff seem very friendly , especially on arrival. The diner has very nice food and you do feel secure with all the security around . The upstairs corridors seem old fashioned and could really need a makeover Don't use the tour bus machine in the lobby. It doesn't sell tickets which  I found out when I arrived at the bus and was told I had to go the bus depot which was a queue for an hour;3
"Perfect location if you want to be in ""the centre"" of Manhatten and close to 5th avenue-shopping and Times Square. Short distance to Central park and Close to Subway which leads you up to Harlem/Queens or Down to lower Manhatten";3
The place was a little bit out dated and dirty but the convince and customer service was good. Would probably stay there again. Very loud at night and thin walls you could hear the 1,2,3 line.;3
"The Good: - The proximity to Citywalk and Universal Studios is perfect if that's the purpose of your trip.  Both are within a five minute walk.  (Of course, other LA attractions are quite a distance...) - We were in an ""executive"" room on the 20th floor.  It was clean and roomy.  - The service was polite and prompt.  The Bad: - Wi-Fi was an extra charge...... For EACH device, every night ($8/per device/per night).  Unless you're a luddite, this can get expensive. - As part of our special ""executive"" room, we received a complimentary continental breakfast each morning.  What was NOT mentioned, and what was NOT listed on the vouchers was that it is only available until 10am.  This is not really acceptable, as we were on vacation and didn't want to set an alarm just to scoop a few";3
The location of the hostel is great and easy access from Paddington Station. It was my short trip from South East England as I have some personal matters to be done in London. It is not bad if you have low requirements ans staying here just for a very few nights, or just wishing for a place to sleep. The receptionist is a bit rude when I checked in at the afternoon.  The single room with double bed is clean and nice until I discovered there's dirt on the bed sheet by the window side (It is the unused side).  The bedroom doors outside the aisle side and the door to the aisles don't have locks on it so it causes massive noise when others walking in and out from their bedroom and walking via the aisle, especially in the middle of night. Some of them talks loudly in the middle of;3
I checked in Friday 9/30/2011 and was pleasantly surprised that the room was ready. When I went to take a shower at 4, no toiletries or towels and a leaking shower. Called the front desk, explained the problem, was transferred to housekeeping with a promise that engineering would be notified. Housekeeping arrived in 15 minutes. I left the room and returned at 11:00pm to a leaking shower that annoyed me all night long. When I left on Saturday around 1:00pm - still leaking. And when I returned at 5 it had been fixed BUT my window was open!!! Why? Well apparently engineering or housekeeping needed to smoke as their was a match and a cigarette on the sill outside my window(see photos). Appalling!!! No I didn't write the Empire as they totally ignored the email I sent prior to;3
Good location- but this is an old hotel that has been partly refurbished. We were in a standard room- 807- too small, inside facing- and far too dark. After complaining, we were offered an alternative an outside facing room, much brighter, less depressing, and slightly larger. Despite this the bathrooms are all the same size and just too small to be practical. I think the air con units are the same age as the hotel, very noisy, and not efficient. In July with temperatures approaching 100 degrees fahrenheit you  need the air con to work. We stayed on a ' room only'  basis,  and made the mistake of having breakfast 'in house' at a   minimum 26 dollars per person. Starbucks downstairs seemed much better value. 2 of the concierges were very helpful- Yuri and Sergei- The general;3
Nice hotel located close to Universal Studios. Accommodations  for a family with children are lacking though. No microwave in rooms or in a room for guests to use. No Continental Breakfast for guests. Breakfast price is $28 per person which adds up quickly for a family of 7. Parking is also $28 per day. Shuttle to U Studios is also not strictly for Hilton guests, it's for the area. So being it was always full we walked there and back. Besides what I mentioned above everything else was fine.;3
Location is great. Too many items for sale in room. Corridors are to dark. Noisy  air conditioning, is that why ear plugs are provided? Too many dark brown shades throughout hotel. The chowder restaurant is great. Staff was very good and friendly.;3
Overall accommodations were good. Staff checking us out were more welcoming than when we checked in. I really liked the location of the hotel to Universal Studios and the shuttle back and forth to the park.  That is the main reason I chose this hotel.  The room was very clean and staff at the doors were friendly and very helpful.;3
If you are just in need of a place to sleep and not spend much time in the room, this works for the price. I stayed in a regular king on the 3rd floor overlooking Lincoln Center. Pretty view but loud. Recommend staying on higher floors as the noise level is constant day/night. Heat in the room rattled and cranked all night. Bathroom is super tiny - only 1 person can fit in at a time. If you like ultra firm mattresses, this hotel is for you.;3
The rooms are small but kept pretty clean. No coffee making facilities in the rooms but there is a vending machine below the lobby. Sadly not working during our stay. The staff are friendly enough and i`m sure helpful though we didnt require any help so can`t say for sure. Its location on the main road is an advantage for transport but also makes it a little noisy too. Overall if I were to return to New York I would stay there again.;3
I am not a huge fan of NYC, so take this with a grain of salt. The hotel itslef was OK, not super fancy or luxurious. The location is very good if you want to be in the heart of things. I found the room to be quite small and a bit dated, especially the bathroom which made me feel like I was staying at a friends place.   A couple of things that got under my skin was the noise from the street and the thin walls. I could hear everything from the surrounding rooms, a bit of a pet peeve for me. The other thing was that there were not nearly enough outlets to plug in our things.   Anyhow, now that I know I may stay there again, but at least now I know.;3
We booked a private double room, travelling from Argentina to see a concert at the O2. Our stay at Hammersmith Rooms was good, rooms were a bit small and the double bed was hardly a double one. If you go with your couple I suggest you get a twin room. The hostel is very close to the Hammersmith Underground Station and to the Hammersmith Bus Station, which is absolutely fantastic since you are a 3 minute walk away from them. Coming from Heathrow is great, the Piccadilly line takes you directly to the hotel. It is a good room for the price you pay, and the staff is very nice and helpful.  One thing I found odd was that they charged you for Internet, and I thought Internet was available for free. They charge 1 Pound an hour and you can log in and log out to administrate your time;3
Very convenient located but the space is small.  Do not let the pictures fool you.  With that said, we hardly spent any time in the room except to shower and to sleep so it was okay.  Do note that there are student residents on several floors of the hotel, so you are likely to run into skimpy dressed individuals who drown themselves in cologne and perfume in the evening.  Our room only had one set of towels, and to get another set took over an hour.  Overall, very clean, the AC functioned well.  It is across the street from Madison Square Garden.  Valet Parking will cost you $60/day.  They charge you a service fee which gives you free wifi.  You cannot opt out of it and it is $29/day!;3
Impressve looking hotel but a number of frustrations. Rooms were on the small side which would not be such an issue if they were not stuffed with overpriced merchandise to purchase! This left very little surface space. No free tea and coffee and chargable wifi! Totally unacceptable at this price point. Would not stay again.;3
"Big ""businessy"" conference hotel.  Rooms are large and very nicely appointed.  Staff ""checks all the boxes"" and does a reasonable job.   Location is only good if you are visiting the theme park, or working at Universal.   Typical overpriced hotel food, drinks and gift shop.";3
Our family of four (two older teenagers) spent the first half of Spring Break at the Hilton Universal City.  The hotel is in easy walking distance to Universal Studios and the City Walk area, and easy driving distance to other area attractions (Warner Bros, Hollywood, etc.).  We found it easier to walk to Universal, but younger families may want to take the free shuttle.  The location is great and makes up for the hotel being a bit dated in terms of decor, carpet wear, etc.  The elevators were being upgraded at the time of our March, 2016 stay and the wait times were a source of shared laughter with other guests.  The staff we met were very helpful and prompt.  We had the complimentary continental breakfast which was fine for our family of relatively light breakfast eaters as;3
On check-in found the reception staff to be a bit cold and impersonal.  They were having conversations amongst themselves instead of talking to the guests. Room was a decent size with comfy beds but bathroom was tiny and tired looking, really needed renovated. Bath/shower not great. Beds were clean with sheets renewed every day, but overall room could have been cleaned more thoroughly (very dusty light shade!). Housekeeping staff very friendly. Concierge staff also very friendly but they charge $2 per item of luggage they store. Very disappointing after also being hit with a bill of $23.95 per night for resort fees! The saving grace for this hotel is the location - very close to Macy's, Madison Square Garden and Times Square.;3
Very frustrating that this nice great reputation hotel charging a ton of money will cut cost on the most important part of a hotel room. The beds should ALWAYS be queen beds. Full sized beds are the back in the day twin bed. Luxurious is not small beds. I'm 125 lbs my husband is 215 lbs we are not overweight we are an averaged sized couple and we could not sleep we were literally on top of one another. So frustrating knowing  how much we paid for the room. Only thing that was frustrating but the most important being on vacation and wanting rest.;3
Stayed here to visit Universal Studios. Upsides: clean. Lovely views. Good food - although awkward to get as the the food stations were located in the dining room but also in the walkway outside the dining room, and there were SO many people rushing to get their food! Close to Universal. Parking for cars provided. Pool area lovely. Interesting - the piano in the dining area which plays (sort of!)prerecorded music without a pianist!  Downsides: 1. We arrived Mother's Day, and ate at the Sun night buffet advertised for $49 a head. Already expensive. When we got the account, they had charged an extra $10 or so, because it was Mother's Day. This surcharge was not advertised anywhere. 2. We had prebooked one night, but decided on arrival that we needed the second night.  This they;3
The bath was clean, but the tub was broken and would not hold water.  When I arrived home my credit card was charge $100 more than the bill I was given.  Accounting wasn't available when I called.  There was Smoking smell coming into our non smoking room.  We were awoken numerous times from the Loud neighbors, we are talking from 10:30 pm to around 3 am.  I found it confusing getting from parking garage to lobby.  The parking card we were given didn't work so we had issues getting out and back into the garage. It would have been nice if there was better signage coming from the garage area to the lobby check in area.  The room did have a nice view.  The staff we did deal with were friendly.  The shuttle service was nice and ran efficiently.;3
Well located near Central Park and Lincoln Center Swimming pool is more the size of a double jacuzzi and water is cold Nice Terrasse at the 11th floor with good music Excellent breakfast can be taken at Whole Foods Market in Colombus Circle;3
We spent 4 nights at Days Inn when visiting New York  First the Goods: The Hotel is ideally located on Broadway being close to Central Park, The Subway and other attractions. There is a good Cafe on the CorÃ±er & bar on the street  We found the Hotel 'Tired, our room left a lot to be desired. Rusty Radiator, broken sockets, drab. Very old CRT TV with poor reception. Staff were obliging when we needed to ask for several improvements. The shower was good as was our bed  We made the Hotel work for us using it as a base to only sleep at. There is NO food or bar facilities which we found locally.   For the price we paid we expected better. Our ranking is a 2.5 out of 5, being OK  Anne & Stephen Sheppard;3
It's all about location with the Empire Hotel.  An older property with a minimal makeover, this hotel is kitty corner to Lincoln Center.  A fabulous location but the rooms are pretty worn out and cleanliness is a bit sketchy.  The bathroom was quite worn, the carpet was minimally vacuumed, and the heat-a/c unit looked like it would break if I turned the handle in anything but the most careful manner.  For us, it was 1 night and the bed was fine.  The price for a Saturday night in October was pretty outrageous given the quality, but as I said, it's all about location here.;3
Nice hotel but the shuttle bus is fouled up.  We got in late and had to leave early.  The late pick up worked well.  The early morning {7am} pick up was messed up.  Two busses came by full - yet it was supposed to be only a Hyatt Regency shuttle.  I forced our way on to the third one. The driver didnât like it.  I wonder if the drivers are pocketing money for their own pick up service?;3
Lobby is filthy, as are all the communal hallways and carpets, however the rooms are clean, linen, towels, gowns etc all good.  The shared bathrooms were clean, and we had to wait a couple of times, but not for two long.  Plenty of hot water.  We had a bunk room, and we're well aware of the size when we booked it.  It has more in common with a Japanese capsule hotel room, but if you're ok with this, then the location is great (especially for The Highline). Staff so so, not a particularly smiley bunch, but did their jobs, although didn't proffer much information about the hotel or the surrounding area on arrival.  We enjoyed our stay, but with reservations!;3
Very nice situation of the hotel, next to Times Square, Broadway and Central Park and the people who are work info there are very line. The Â«Â butÂ Â» are about the rooms, they are very small, the bathroom wasnât clean and the breakfast was very very bad (no choice, no hot meals...);3
At first my review was going to be negative for this hotel but it did warm on me after a few days, I stayed for 4, and at $100 USD a nite, this was the driving force behind my choice of the Jane. The hotel is located in the north village (Greenwich) and a stoneâs throw from Chelsea, the area as you would imagine is quite trendy and upmarket, with lots of New York town home type buildings, people walking dogs, and cute little cafes selling cream cheese bagels, which no doubt have been doing this for years. The lobby is old fashioned and yes the staff wear cruise outfits from the early 20th century, you can walk to you room via the stairs or wait for the bell man to take you up in the old lift, which they operate manually. I understand this is being replaced in the new year with a;3
"The Empire is flashy upon entry into the lobby, but the rooms are in serious need of some TLC. I don't think the Empire should hire the same contractors to do the building work, though...some pretty shoddy workmanship. No fan in the bathroom means some major humidity problems, the rooms are quite small and the carpet is hurting. The booking we made through Priceline stated ""standard room with king, queen or two double beds upon request"" and we were hassled when we checked in and asked for two double beds. The hotel wanted to charge us an upgrade of $50 per night but we dug in our heels and got it without paying extra. Only catch was that it was on a stinky smoking floor, but the room itself didn't smell of smoke, thankfully. Good location - just a couple blocks from two subway";3
The Empire Hotel offers a very central and convenient location.  We were able to walk through Central Park to a number of destinations including some of the larger museums, The Boat House Restaurant and Central Park Zoo!  Across the street, we were also able to visit The Lincoln Centre for some (free) outdoor opera movies.  The roof-top terrace was also a very nice place from which to enjoy a morning coffee or an evening drink before heading out for dinner.    The room, itself, was a little tired and less than ideal.  The bed was rather hard and uncomfortable.  We did decide to splurge and spend our final two nights at The Tump SoHo.  That luxurious hotel offered a real contrast to The Empire Hotel, but the cost was significantly more.;3
The hotel was nice. I have noted the issues I had on the previous page. The bathtub was disgusting with a brown stain all over the bottom, so I would not take the warm bath I was looking forward to. I had trouble sleeping as the cheap refrigerator gurgled and hummed all night. It was also rather loud in the morning from others, though I do not really blame the hotel for this. There was not even a very basic breakfast included with the room. I don't eat much in the morning, but would have loved a free continental breakfast downstairs or something.;3
Lobby wants to be hip, but there is no notion of security presence in the lobby, so just anyone can come in and ride the elevator to any floor. We had a room on the first floor, which is the first floor above the mezzinine level.  Well, it faced the street, where we could hear all the traffic noise, which quieted down as the evening went on, but was back in the early morning.  Room is nice, but I do not know iwhat noise you can hear on higher floors.  Very convenient if you are going to Lincoln Center, which is across the street. I informed the front desk that a bulb was out in one of the lamps.  But, not, as promised, replaced during our stay.;3
Not good experience. Pool was not available for several hours. The air conditioner was broken in the room, making  terrible noises. Bottle water which was part of the deal daily, was not available. The front desk staff not friendly. When asked a question, they seemed like they were annoyed.....;3
Stayed for 6 nights - location is fab down 8th so about 10-15 min walk to 42nd street then the madness begins..  If you want to be out the business of Times Square then this location is perfect. Along the road from Macy's and Empire State Building - you might be lucky to get a view of the ESB unfortunately we didn't which was disappointing - I had emailed twice to there customer services to ask for a room with a view and to advise them it was a special occasion (65th birthday for mum) no replies to emails and no special view room or surprise.. Pretty poor show. Tick tock diner was good for breakfast we ate there a few times and also had coffee from the cart in the lobby which was lovely and nice pastries;3
"arrived after 3:00 pm - not early -  first room was dark - dusty - small - and reeked of bleach - had to be moved because the smell was so strong that I began to wheeze....second room was much better - was a bit disappointed with the size of room and bathroom for the rate paid; $400 to $500 a night...";3
Pros:  - Close location for people who like to stay in Hollywood area.  - A lot of restaurants and retail around the hotel - Very good rates on third party websites like hotwire - Gated and spacious parking - Complimentary breakfast... serving omelets, cereals, fruits, bread   Cons: - Expensive parking... you can find hotels cheaper than $22/day for parking - No complimentary water in the room ... staff advice the guest not to use vending machines on site as they wont refund your money in case the machine took your money and gave you nothing - House keeping did not change the bed sheets even when instructed to do so by me and by hotel staff - THE MOST IMPORTANT: no AC... The vent blow fan air ... it was really hot and difficult to sleep - Very noisy beds that keep squeaking when;3
"Nice hotel, but they seem to have changed their culture to get the Most out of guest.  Be careful at the front door, the bell hop who gets your bags out of the car, will not be the same one to take them to your room, so you will need 2 tips just to get the bags to the room if you don't take them yourself.  If you get a room with breakfast, read the fine print, it is only the continental breakfast, it is a $10 upgrade for the warm food part of the buffet.  Also the ""view"" that is promised, if you don't ask for the park side, you end up with a lovely view of the freeway";3
My party of three adults (girls' week away) stayed at the Universal City Hilton between April 21-28.  Location:  The Hilton was convenient to Universal Studios/City Walk by walking or free shuttle.  It was also convenient by car to some activities we had planned in Hollywood and Burbank.  However if you are planning anything at or near the beach, it is a long drive and there seemed to be traffic at times one wouldn't consider rush hour.  Check-in:  Check-in was smooth, and the bell staff and valet were very friendly and helpful.  Our luggage was brought up very quickly and the bellman also filled our ice bucket.  Room:  Judging from the hotel floor-plan and building shape, it looks like our room (1855) was among the smallest on the floor, and after having two double beds;3
This hostel is on the Upper West Side of NY, which is considered the rich part of Manhattan. I had the budget single room, which had a full/dbl size bed, mini fridge, sink (with no mirror), small dresser, small closet, and TV (which didn't work). I paid like $80/night (total for three nights came to $270) and the room size was perfect for me since I traveled solo. I was right next to the bathroom in the hall, so that was a plus also. I didnt' have to walk down the hall or far from my room. I had two issues with this hotel. The first was that I booked this through www. agoda.com and when I went to confirm my reservation the day before my arrival, the hotel didn't have me in the system. Luckily, the front desk person (Wendy) was nice and she said that they have plenty of rooms and;3
The hotel location is prime. You can't get any closer to universal studios. Traveling with kids, I look for safe, clean hotels and the Hilton fits the bill. You can tell the carpets in the room are a little old, but the room itself was clean and not bad. The problem with this hotel is it's understaffed. From the moment I drove up, no valet greeted me. Nothing. The one valet guy was retrieving cars, helping others in a booth , they should really have another guy helping. Not until I got out of my car and hunted someone down did I get some help. Then the check in was the same deal, only one person was working the desk to check in guests. The breakfast buffet, same thing, only ONE cook working the omelet/waffle station, a huge line formed. By the time I got my omelet, the rest of;3
we stayed here as part of a road trip for 3 nights, it's a great location, right next door to Universal Studios and around the road from Warner Studios, also very close to Hollywood Blvd, Mulholland Drive etc  The room itself was really comfortable, the fridge wasn't that cool and needed replacing but they did not have another one available when we asked so were left with only marginally cold drinks  The outdoor hot tub had faults with only a few of the jets working so this needs looking at, when we told the front desk they said it may get looked at soon  Upon arriving home I discovered we had been charged more for valet parking than we otherwise should have been, we booked via a third party whose rate was almost of the Hiltons but this was missed, we would have self-parked;3
We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at begining of June.  Had booked superior double room - don't know what other rooms where like but I wouldn't class the room as 'superior' (room 122).  We had requested two beds, which we were given.  The room was small (made smaller by 2 beds!).  Was dissappointed with the lack of space in bathroom - if someone was in the room another person couldn't get it!!  However it was functional and shower was good.  Housekeeping did a good job and the room was kept clean.  The beds were comfortable and room was nice and warm (despite the changes in temperatures outside!).   From our room we could see the Opera House and although we were on 1st Floor the noise was bearable considering we were in New York!   The situation is close to Central Park which;3
The rooms were not restocked daily with washrags properly, nor coffee cups.  The bathroom was under lighted, the food choices available were limited and expensive.  Beds were comfortable, the shower was OK.;3
The location was fine, and there were certain amenities that were nice. Main lobby was very dark with no exterior windows and kept dark. Rooms are TINY! No closet, just a curtain to cover a space for hanging, and the bathroom was so small and odd shaped that I couldn't even stand in front of the sink to shave! I get it that NYC is tight on space, but this room seemed the extreme. WiFi was useless, and with no LTE mobile service (bunker I guess?) I was just plain out of luck. Bed was comfortable....I'll certainly say that. There was an HVAC unit under the window that was circa 1975 and cooled like it! It wasn't hot out, but stuffy in the room!;3
New Yorker hotel is a beautiful deco building and very central for 42nd street, Times Square, Empire State Building, Macyâs and Maddison Square gardens. Staff were very helpful, rooms clean but a little small for  2 adults and all our luggage. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel and the subway is on the next block.  We choose to walk up to Central Park and grand central station which was a lovely trip and an interesting walk. There are plenty of taxis around but the traffic is heavy as you would expect from a city centre. It is a good location for walking from.    Only issues I had were that the room safe didnât work and was not fixed in the 3 days I was there. And the hotel was hosting a large dog show at the time- ok if you like dogs. I found having dogs in;3
Been to other Wyndham but this New York Wyndham is far below their standards As to room cleanliness, service, courtesy, helpfulness to clients. I thought it's probably an old hotel newly acquired by Wyndham and the reason for not being at par.;3
We stayed at the Empire's JR.Suit between the dates of nov.10-26 th. The hotel's location is a great plus.The room was clean and well maintained,the bed was very comfortable.The bathroom was  good size and in good condition. We were happy about the big screen TV in our room with decent number of channels ,sometimes we just wanted to stay in our room and rest although the reception quality  of the channels was not always good,maybe an adjustment would have helped. Our primary concern  with this hotel was the house keeping service. Almost every day something in our room was not replaced,we needed to keep on calling the house keeping service  on the phone  almost every day for missing  fresh  towels,toilet paper,soap,pillows,etc...which was very annoying.Somebody needs to contol;3
This is a good, basic hotel with a great location. Disappointed after all the good reviews on Trip Advisor. Found staff at reception very unfriendly. There is no double glazing at all which means you hear anything and everything at street level and I was 4 floors up! My room was an interior room and was so noisy.  By the way my roomâs windows were leaking. Not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady! Beds were very comfortable - unfortunately pillows were not. The clock in the room was broken and overall a bit of TLC requires. No Wi-Fi in rooms, unless you pay.;3
Currently staying at the hotel and definitely call before booking to check on the status of the renovations and construction. The rooms on the executive floor are great but the lobby is under construction and definitely isn't going to wow anyone looking for an impressive lobby area. And then there is some drilling and other construction going on elsewhere (our room on the 21st executive floor is somehow near a construction zone for some reason). A lot of these issues are just fine if you are spending your day at Universal Studios (the location is PERFECT for that and if you love sushi there are tons of great sushi joints nearby, including some of the best in the city) but if you are planning on doing work during the day like me and/or relaxing in the room it might be a bit less;3
The Morningside Inn is a well organized hostel with friendly staff. The rooms are ok and there is even a kitchenette. The shared bathrooms are impractical, but quite clean. Bus and metro will get you downtown easily.;3
"I think the lobby was nice and so was the front desk people, as far as the hallways it's very confusing the elevators are extremely slow and the room was outdated, i paid over a $100 for this room and I was utterly in disappointment because I've been to a lot of days inn but never like this one, there have been times I've paid less money and have gotten bigger better up to date rooms, The rug was pulled up and tattered near the bathroom, the wallpaper was peeling off the ceiling, the bathroom was beautiful and was the only thing bigger than the whole room,  It's near the subway which is good but that don't matter to me...I only stayed one night but i think this hotel is overly priced and i hope ""undercover boss"" comes and check out this one so some changed can be made, I only";3
The Hotel is ok. Our room was dated. There was wall damage in the bathroom. The tile grouting was dirty and the aircon had black dust staining the wall. Good points are overall hotel nice, pool good, breakfast great.;3
Staff is friendly, accommodating and efficient.  Location next to Lincoln Center is convenient, but close-by restaurants limited. The decor of this hotel is dark, depressing, and strange.  The rooms are quite small.  There is no closet, and storage is limited.  The bathroom is poorly designed, especially the shower.  It has a half-glass barrier, the other half open space.  You can't take a shower without nearly flooding the rest of the tiny bathroom.   Flooring likely to loosen in the near future.;3
We had three couples traveling together. One couple stayed in a king room on the first floor. At 11:30pm, someone with a key opened their door (thankfully they had the door latched). We spoke to the front desk and they assured us it wasn't an employee and changed out the key and gave the couple two free breakfast buffets. We think it was an employee because we noticed there were a bunch that would hang out in a break room type space nearby. We think they use that room to go to the bathroom. The king room was very loud with street traffic, water pipes and inefficient heater/air conditioner. The two queen rooms on the third floor were better and had been updated but the doors slammed when shut and there were gaps between the door and the door jamb.  The rooms are small, which is;3
On arriving at the Empire, I was given a room upgrade to a superior double double, or something equally odd-sounding. In retrospect, I think it meant that it had two double beds. Which was nice - I guess - but as I was travelling for business and staying by myself, the other bed was unused. I would rather have sacrificed the bedroom space for a bigger bathroom.  The room was big (indeed, to hold the two beds), but the bathroom (in fact - shower room) was tiny. I am petite, but when I sat on the toilet, one leg touched the sink and the other touched the wall. The shower itself had very poor pressure - I am not sure if there was something wrong with it - had I been staying longer than 2 nights I would have investigated. The complementary toiletries were nice - and replenished each;3
The hotel has very interesting history. But these days the hotel is quite shabby , our room was tiny.  I would not chose this hotel again. The hotel was not cheap at all. The location is good, but better to live not further then 7th avenue.;3
"Check in time was at 4p but room was not ready until 4:30p. When we got up to our room it was still dirty smh; there was hair on the bathroom counter, pistachios shells & razor blade covers on the floor. It was definitely it worth the money we paid.";3
My boyfriend and I stayed at The Empire Hotel from 26th to 31st July 2015, having booked the hotel in February/March 2015 - I think we booked this before we even booked our plane tickets!  Now, being a massive Gossip Girl fan (xoxo), I was SO excited about staying here. Following a week long stay in San Diego, where our hotel did not cost half as much but wasn't meant to be anything fancy anyway, I had high hopes for this place but boy was I disappointed.  Upon arrival, the person who checked us in on the front desk was so unfriendly, but I wasn't too bothered as I was tired and just wanted to get to the room. The room itself was fine except everything had a ridiculously high price tag on it - $8 for a small bottle of Evian and $4 for some in-room coffee, which is ridiculous as;3
Hotel is conveniently located, just (literally) steps away from the entrance of the 96th Street Entrance, with key attractions (Penn Station, Times Squares, Wall Street area etc.) just stops away on a direct line (Line 1, Red). Rooms are a decent size (for NYC) and reasonably comfortable and clean, with good showers and decent amenities. My only complain is that the carpet needs some deep chemical cleaning or changing (it feels grimy to the touch). Otherwise, a good base to explore the city - easy walking distance to Central Park, with plenty of eateries/restaurants nearby.;3
We felt the hotel although oppulent was rather impersonal. The receptionist rushed the check in at a rather noisy lobby and we felt we were just another number not a personal welcoming warmth.the hotel has good access to the subway and Central Park.  Found the beds rather firm but we prefer a slightly softer mattress. We also found our room dark. We had to use the torch on our phones to read the coffee machine instructions, look at maps and tourist information. Although the rooms were clean,not noisy and well placed hotel we wouldn't return as we felt the hotel was impersonaland lacked a welcoming feeling.;3
Middling hotel with a good location. Nothing terribly wrong, but nothing distinctive, unless the pool changes things--it was closed when I stayed in mid-June. AC unit was loud, and standalone underneath the window.   There's a special place in Hell for hotels that still charge for Internet access. It's crass and demeaning to guests, and it does influence where I choose to stay in the future.;3
This is very nicely located hotel near Central Park with clean and specious rooms ,no food service in hotel but plenty of restaurants around. The reception had friendly staff but the management of the hotel seems to have forgotten few basics. For example ,for 3 people staying in room they provided just one bottle of water and after many repeated request ,finally someone came and informed us hotel do not provide additional water. The telephone was out of order and we reported in first day of our stay 25th June  but not repeated ,again instead of repeated reminder, till we left on 28th June. The wifi was poor and not responding, which is unbelievable in a place like New York. They provided utilities like 2 paper cups /2 tea/coffee bags  or 2 towels in first day, while room was;3
Stayed for 3 nights for a conference held in this hotel in April. I had a conference discount for my room. Maybe for this reason, my room is concise. No coffee machine, no water. The washroom is small. But still OK, you don't stay inside when you are in downtown New York. It's within walking distance (10 min) to broadway.;3
Carpet and furniture are in really bad shape in the lobby, and in the room our carpet in room 1034 was really dirty and stained which was really nasty, the Ladies at the check in counter were nice and sent someone right away to fix our broken shower head. Room with runway view was really nice.;3
We had booked two rooms for a four night stay at the New Yorker Hotel. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who offered us two rooms next to each other on the 21st floor. The rooms were quite small dated but they were clean. There are not any tea or coffee making facilities in the room and after a long day of sightseeing it would have been nice to come back and make a cuppa.New York has become quite expensive even the Tick To k Diner that adjoins the hotel was pricey. Overall the hotel was fine but it is no more than a three star  New;3
We stayed here for five nights, at a rate of about 1/3 of what everything hotel in Manhattan would cost.  Our room was small but clean with a good bath and hot water and a huge bed.   We liked the proximity to the subway and the bus from the airport.   We also liked walking to Park West, the little Turkish place a block away in the morning for our coffee and a friendly visit with the owner. So it's not fancy at all,  but if you are in New York and just need a basic place to sleep and shower I would recommend this place as a good way to save money on lodging.  It is very conveniently located to the subway.   You can take the bus from LaGuardia for a few dollars and walk to the hotel from the bus stop. There are other much nicer places to stay In Manhattan, but for the price we;3
Normally I would give a Hilton Hotel a much higher & better review but in this situation where I was not informed at either booking ing or check in about the renovation noise the mind you went from 9am to 8pm Monday to Saturday. All I know is 5 minuets down the road is a lovely hotel at a third the cost & includes breakfast. This is a â4 Starâ hotel where they even charge you $30 per night to park your car. This time I was not happy & while the renovations are on I suggest looking elsewhere.;3
Staff was 'okay,' but certainly didn't seem to go above and beyond to make the stay special. Shower took 15 minutes to warm up, and many coworkers had issues with showers as well (taking a very long time to heat up, rapid temperature changes, etc.).   Food was okay, but I was surprised by the bill each time. I travel a lot, and have come to expect pricy menus in hotels. That said, I spent $35 on a breakfast buffet. What.;3
We stayed recently at this property - It is functional but nothing amazing. Due to its proximity to Universal Studios the prices are high and so are the food outlets - but this is what you expect.  Good 5-10 minute walk to Universal realistically, or use the free shuttle bus.  Pool area is small with limited provision of sun loungers. Good location if you want walking distance to Universal - otherwise nothing amazing about hotel. $28 + tax car park fee - per night;3
Not knowing the area, it felt a little seedy at night time. Conveniently located one block away from subway station.  The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to brag about, the earlier you get in for breakfast, the better, as it would appear it is not restocked after about 9am. Eggs are cooked fresh which was nice. The bed was a little small in our room, and the toilet made an awful noise when it was refilling and seemed to take a long time, to the point where I thought it was broken. Room was located at the rear of the hotel and road noise could be heard.  Guest laundry okay but only two machines, the gift shop and reception declined to change our small notes to quarters to use the machines, and there was no coin machine to make the exchange ourselves. Overall, for the price we;3
Only at the hotel for one night  Busy lobby , Art Deco styling , lots of security  Check in did not take too long ,professional staff . Once my room key was issued I made my way to the elevator area where you must show your key card  There are plenty of elevators so the wait is not too long  Although the hotel has plenty of character some parts /areas look old and worn  My room was on the 26th floor and what I would describe as NYC size  Room was clean fairly well equipped , regardless of how high your room is and regardless of hotel location noise will always be an issue , I still managed to sleep  well . Great location good transport links plenty of stores restaurants nearby , Madison square garden just round the corner  Typical large busy New York hotel;3
Be warned that this is an old hotel and the rowdy people next-door to us might as well have been in our same room. Additionally our room smelled like moldy cat urine. My husband declares that this is âjust New Yorkâ I think for the outrageous price we paid a room should smell much better. Also the rooms are extraordinarily tiny again this is probably just a New York thing but it bears mentioning. I will say that if you were in town to attend anything at Madison Square Garden the location canât be beat. There is also a creepy McDonaldâs across the street and two Starbucks within eyeshot. Also very convenient to Penn station.;3
The Empire Hotel is located in a great part of town, across the street from Lincoln Center and a block from Central Park! Pros: Location Small Hotel Nice roof deck  Inviting Bar and Lobby Front Desk - Patrick checked me in, he was professional and gave me a quiet room location per my request when I arrived. Hotel seems clean, floors polished, elevators in shape, carpet clean. Bellmen were accommodating Safe Location Entrance is nice too.   .Room Rate is moderate for NYC. Room was clean Bathroom was modern - a bit tiny Bed was comfortable (king size) Room size was average   Cons: I tried to book the hotel via the empire website - it never would take me to a check out page.  I tried several times over two days. I ended up booking via Expedia - paying a slightly higher rate but the;3
We spent 2 nights here at the tail end of a long vacation in other 4 and 5 Star hotels. When checking in, the room wasnât available at the checkin time. We had to wait a bit, but they held our luggage so it was fine.  The room was a mess and just felt grimy in general. The carpets look like they have never been cleaned. In the nook where they had the mini fridge (on the carpet) the surrounding carpet was so filthy you can see a thick layer of grey dust all over it. Wallpaper was ripped, doors and walls had grimy smears and dents and paint chips. The caulking in the bathroom was smeared all over and the fake plastic wooden laminate flooring was used as tile in the shower with the same weird smudges caulking. The shower has mildew all around it.   We stayed in room 1023 and the;3
This hotel was in a perfect location for Lincoln Center and Central Park. The front desk staff were friendly. Overall the hotel was fine for one evening. The room was small and had problems figuring out where to put the luggage. The bathroom was extremely small and already had a lot of water/moisture damage due to the shower not having a door. The room was clean and beds were fine. Any more than one night I would look for another hotel.;3
Very very expensive for one night. There were too many problems from start to finish and not enough help to resolve it, or they did not seem to care. The quality of their service was poor, especially for the amount of money that I paid to sleep for one night in New York. I was very disappointed. I'm not sure why people in the customer service industry think it is okay to just be dismissive and disrespectful to other. I paid my money to receive quality services and unfortunately that did not occur.;3
The hotel is located close to the Red Line Metro station Vermont/St.Monica, so it's easy to get to for example Walk of Fame or Staples Center without using the car. It's also close to the Griffth Observatory and The Grove & Farmers Market by car. The hotel itself, is in need of  refurbishing, at least our room was.... The complimentary breakfast was OK, especially the omelettes. The area is a bit dodgy, with quite many homeless people begging for money, so I suggest that you use the hotel parking area, even if they charge you a bit too much for using it.;3
Great location  Very very small room 125 sq ft  for one queen bed. Not even enough floor space for our suitcases.i had to use the small desk next to my bed for my suitcase . My husband used the closet for his suitcase but there was no light in the closet. We asked for a bigger room , but it would be an extra $40.;3
When guests are checking out don't ask them to only leave a 5 star review on Trip Advisor after they have not had a perfect experience, because you want to keep your high rating and any thing less than a 5 will hurt your business. This was very unprofessional and the reason why I am now writing this honest review.  Yes, the staff are lovely, the service is good, the food is OK and the Riad's public areas are well kept, but upon entering our room Fleur d'orange we found...  1. It was dirty and unclean. (see the images). 2. Used disposable slippers had been left as new. 3. Bathrobes were damp, not dry and fluffy. 4. Bathroom seemed to have a very large water splash mark on the wall, but we think it was some sort of oil as it did not dry and could not rub off.  After 5 minutes in;3
In general terms the hotel is good. Especially in terms of price/location. However it feels some somehow dated.   It has some very specific points that may annoy some guests.   Hotel Amenity:  -Restaurant, it has two. Not what you would call inviting. One is like a cafeteria the other is more upper scale.  -Internet/Free WiFi, it gives free wifi to guests. Normal speed.  -Front Desk, not so good customer service. It took us 12 minutes to check in. A bit slow. You will notice. Sometimes you come out of your room and there is, I kid you not, a line formed by around 100 people.  -Smoke free hotel, Yes.   Hotel Room:  -Air Conditioning, a bit loud.  -Cleanliness, very good. However (BIG detail), everyday when we came back the room smells weird. It smells between cigar and coffee.  -;3
Got a really good deal, staff friendly and helpful, room was bit run down and just looked shabby. Subway just down the block and Central Park is literally seconds away. Would not stay again as have reached the age where like things to be a bit of a higher standard! But if your young  and on a tight budget it would be worth a go.;3
Busy hotel in midtown, small room (typical NYC), really basic amenities (byo toiletries) and forgetful housekeeping. Room was tiny we couldnât unpack. Strong showers pressure was nice at the end of long day exploring NY. Check in/out was smooth though and location was great with many food options. I would stay somewhere else with bigger room next time a little farther away from the hustle and bustle;3
Travel agent recommended. Great location close to Hell's kitchen for great food options. Room was tiny and needed updating. Peeling paint in bathroom, carpet frayed in hallway. Bed was very comfortable and it was immaculately clean, so those were saving graces.;3
First the good bits.  Staff were friendly and helpful,  room was clean, great location and reasonable value.  Not so good bits.  Room was small and had poor lighting. Decor dated. Noise of building air conditioning going all night was annoying. Worst of all for us was the cost of W iFi in the room was far too much.  In a city where free WiFi is available everywhere,  we found this unacceptable. Please make it free.;3
Stayed here for 3 nights in a standard queen sized bed. The bed was comfortable. The room was compact to say the least! there was less than 12 inches space between the edge of the bed and the TV/ drawer storage to squeeze through. ( I am average size @ 80 kgs! ) TV is flat screen but a bit dated. Bathroom shower, very fiddly to get the desired water temperature. No extraction. Night time views of the lit up neighbouring buildings from the room windows were memorable.  Impressive foyer and reception. Unfortunately, public seating is totally inadequate for the no of guests using or wishing to use the space. There is a coffee and light refreshment counter. Also the Tick -Tock Diner attached to the foyer is popular. Prices are mid range. There are 'facility charges' added to the;3
We just got back from staying here for a week. I think the biggest thing to remember is that this is a hostel, not a hotel. If you are expecting a hotel, do not stay here.   Pros:  The room and the bathrooms were very clean, although the cleaner smelled terrible. All our clothes smelled like it.  The room came with a fridge, which we were not expecting. It's in a safe area. It's 2-3 minute walk to the tube station and right next to a private school. The tube station is great because it services 3 lines, so you can get wherever you need to go fairly easy. It's about 20 minutes on the Picadilly line to the center (Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus). The pillows, towels and linens were good quality.  Cons: Super unhelpful/unfriendly staff. There was never enough toilet paper and no;3
We reserved rooms for a wedding. They send emails with confirmed bookings but some of our family had problems such no bookings in their system etc. Some rooms have defective aircon, keys dont work(have to go up and down to have them fix). Location is very convenient. Restaurants, public transportation, central park.;3
The hotel is great , location is excellent , rooms are small and cold but suitable for what you need but the service leaves a lot to be desired   Upon arrival I was asked for a credit card for the fees - 2 days later I noticed over Â£700 has been secured against my card - went to reception to complain and they apologised and said it would be rectified   24 hours later another fee of over Â£400 taken against my card so nearly Â£1200 over half of my spending money was secured against these fees   Went to reception - received an apology and was told it was a error and I would receive all fees back and a discount against my stay which I have to wait for from BA  The fees have been returned but Its taken until 5 days after my return and no good to me now as I needed that money whilst I;3
What we didn't like truly marked the Hotel:  WORST ROOM SERVICE EVER - even when it was done only 3 times in 8 nights. Not Clean properly at arrival and daily. Old Smell in the rooms. No room service at all by default, even requesting sometimes was not done. Towels or even only a towel were randomly placed, robe's were NEW, needed to unpack,  and never washed. Incredible. Trash bin not cleaned, they even left the plastic bag pack, maybe for us to change it? The bed was NEVER done properly , they just move the main blanket and left the rest as it was after sleeping. Flips flops were added to the room every time, so we ended with 8 pairs in a tiny room.   Completely unprofessional service, never to repeat, a shame for a Hotel that claims and should be much more.  Never to repeat;3
I was pretty disappointed in the hotel for being a Hilton. The property was really dated and needs a renovation ASAP. My tub faucet had a constant leak. I told the desk and they would take care of it, but after 3 days nothing happened. Isn't California in a drought?;3
Smells of smoke on some floors and rooms. Very outdated needs an uplift but clean and great location. Was there for my 50th Birthday and didnât get off to a good start due to having to change rooms due to smoke smell;3
Pros: the hotel is well located in front of the penn station/MSq garden.The lobby is fine and the front desk people are attentive. The gym was ok. Cons: to get down from the 34th floor, youâll have to wait for the lift 5-10 min. The room is clean but VERY small. Good view of Manhattan and the empire state from my room.;3
Ok stay, queen bed was comfortable. Breakfast was amazing, the only problem was customer service. We arrived at about 12:30am and was greeted by a not so nice man at the front desk. We had originally called for a roll out bed about 4 hours before and the bed was not in the room when we arrived. The upside to this trip is the breakfast was great!!! Definitely not worth what we paid for the whole stay but was very good. Also the housekeepers were very nice, they greeted us with a nice good morning as we headed to breakfast.;3
Perfectly located for a night at Lincoln Center.  Room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Next time we come to NYC to visit The Met I will check the room rates and if they are good I'll stay at The Empire again.;3
"I stayed here for business in November because my company did not provide another option. Being a former resident in the city I did not expect this property to provide above the average service or ambiance. It was sufficient for a one-night business trip stay - efficient check-in and clean (small room and very cold bathroom) room; however, finance does not work well. I called the hotel twice in the past week asking someone to email me the folio so I can submit my expenses. One lady took my information after asking me to spell my name and email address about five times, and I still do not have the simple folio email I had requested. Truly beyond comprehension. This is an economical option for a family trip if no one will spend much time at the hotel or if you have a tight budget";3
We arrived early for our stay on a recent Saturday and were able to check in right away, which was a plus. The floor we stayed on ,however, was quite dated with frayed rug and in need of painting. Our room was bland and in need of an update, with an old, loud a/c and no dresser .The location of the hotel is fantastic, near great bars ,restaurants , a farmer's market on Sunday, and only 2 blocks from Central Park. The hotel staff was wonderful, very helpful and friendly ,no matter what time of day, offering discounted parking and suggestions for bars with and without entertainment and good eating spots. If you're looking for luxury, this is not the spot. If you're looking for a basic room in a great location, go for it.;3
Great location, easy to get there, close to the park / restaurants / shopping / Midtown and Times Square.   The room itself was ok. Nice decor in the lobby with very spotty wifi. Wifi in the room was very off and on, good thing I brought my own internet device.   As others have said, the bathrooms have nice decor but what a weird design! It is almost impossible to not get the floor wet and there is water condensation on everything afterwards unless you shower with the door open. All they had to do was put a glass slider or swinging door on.   Beds are hard, but pillows are nice.   We stayed 3 people in the room and it was a squeeze but fortunately we didn't have large luggage.   The biggest cons if you stay in a room facing the street are noise (bring your earphones, like;3
The service was ok at best. The door man Eugene was the exception he was amazing, remembering our names. Was always great with suggestions for anything we wanted. He would be the reason we would come back.;3
Stayed for two nights whilst we did Universal and some sightseeing in Hollywood. Hotel was more of a conference hotel with auditions being held frequently. We stayed in four hotels during our mini trip and this was the only one that didnât have USB ports which was surprising. Not impressed being woken up by banging at 7am and also hoovering at 7.30am. Overall a very average stay.;3
"I have stayed at this hotel several times and I would like to put at rest anyones misconceptions about this hotel.  It is not any kind of extra nice place to stay, at all  It was and partly still is a rooming house, or as they are known in nyc an SRO (single room occupancy building).  Many of the people at this hotel live there permenantly and have lived there for many many years.  The rooms that are being rented out are rooms that are becoming vacant as the permenant tenants leave.  The reason there are still permenant residents living here is that it violates nyc rent laws to evict certain people, depending upon their living situation, age, etc.  So whether you have a nice room or a bad one more than likely depends on how the person who ""lived"" there before it was a hotel";3
I was there from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25. They charged $500.00 Cad a night, which is almost $400.00 a night. The location is perfect, but the hotel is not worth it. The hall way and entrance is old and does not show clean. The room was small and the air was not fresh. The bath room was moldy, dirty and very small. There was not any coffee, tea or anything else in the room. They charge 27.00 a night for resort fee which I could not understand, what that was for? Overall this hotel is not worth it for the money they are charging. The only thing was fine is the location.;3
EN: They gave us a room that had not been remade and the person to whom I said have it changed immediately. The second room was clean but very very small. Essential. The neighborhood is pleasant and very well connected by metro and buses. It was not expected breakfast but every morning there was always a choice of cookies with Tea and coffee. IT: Ci hanno dato una stanza che non era stata rifatta e ce l'hanno cambiata subito. La seconda stanza era pulita, ma molto piccola. Essenziale. Il quartiere Ã¨ piacevole e soprattutto molto ben collegato da metro ed autobus. Non era prevista la colazione, ma ogni mattina c'era sempre una scelta di cookies con The e caffÃ¨.;3
I just want to start by saying I usually stay at the Sheraton but it was fully booked for this weekend.  I booked at the Hilton and immediately found the hotel to be larger and with the same great service. After the first day though I can honestly say Iâm extremely disappointed. I saw many adult guests walking around with out masks, getting drinks at the bar, waking in common areas and never once did I hear any staff ask them about their face covering. Traveling with my kids made this a bit more difficult. If I had known, I donât think I would have stayed here at all. I understand the state is opening up but we are not there yet and we tried to stay out of the common areas for the same reason. We came here because we were going to universal studios. Universal on the other hand;3
Stayed here for one night while my mom and i were in New York. The lobby was very nice and the staff was very welcoming especially with letting us leave our bags before check-in. We got into our room and it was extremely small, we didnât need much space but it was shockingly small. The room was very clean and nice set up for the size. Check out was easy but when we went to pick up our bags later in the day to head to the airport it took about 5+ minutes to find our bags, which was frustrating since we were in a rush.;3
Very well located and connected, with helpful staff and enhanced security measures. Though, for a 4 stars hotel, I would have liked to have a breakfast option not only at the restaurant, but included, or at least a minibar in the room. Also, in my room (? double queen with a view) the closet was extremely small and the wall mounted safe in the closet made extremely difficult to use even for one person in the room. In the area there are cheaper offers with more room amenities. Here you pay for the history of the place, glorious past indeed.;3
The location was perfect for our visit.  The room was not in the best of repair - specifically the bathroom which may have been recently upgraded, but the shower sprays all over the floor and the water damage as a result made the floor tiles loose  and the doors and wood were rotting.;3
We stayed here while visiting universal. The only nice thing I can say is that it is convenient to the park. The hotel is not upgraded, the beds were uncomfortable, tv ancient and the lobby is under construction. The reservation was non-refundable with no mention of construction which was convenient for them and disappointing for us. It would not be pleasing to eat at the hotel restaurants as the construction is literally steps away. We self parked And the entire parking structure smells so strongly of an ashtray we had to shower from walking through there.;3
First of all, if you are booking this hotel and expecting 4-5 star luxury, then book the Sheraton, Hilton or whatever other hotel. It is NOT even close! If you are looking for a inexpensive place to sleep that is comfortable enough, then this is the place for you. The bed was comfortable, the room clean enough, bathroom space was adequate. Subway within walking distance. Plenty of places to grab a bite. Duane Reed right downstairs. Would I recommend it to someone, sure but I would warn that this is a no frills hotel that does the job of a nights sleep. Would I stay there again, no, only because I would rather stay in Times Square!;3
Wonderful location, funky lobby, mostly great staff, good value for money.  Loud grumbling A/C (in two rooms where we stayed), terrible Internet service, tiny bathroom, small and cramped toilet, shower sprays water all over the place, some awful staff, pay-for-view TV never worked in two weeks, loud club on top floor.  What could be a great hotel smack on Lincoln Center is a rather run-down hotel with tiny rooms.  Most of the staff is extremely helpful, empathetic, plain nice.  Some others are as responsive as wall paper.  Not bad for the price, a somewhat endearing place that could be in much better shape.;3
Everything was just ok, except the toilet needed service.  The chain inside the tank broke, so we had to manually flush the toilet.  Not so great!  Something bad with the food.  I actually got sick a few hours after breakfast.  We had breakfast downstairs.  We had a family in the hospital near by, so we really didn't have a choice of which hotel to stay at.;3
This was one of those very big and very busy hotels in a very popular area (right next to Universal studios) where you felt like a number rather than a guest.  Whilst I expected no less than I received (a solid, no frills service) I was left feeling a bit empty by my stay at the hotel.   Our reason for staying here was simply to visit the theme park at Universal studios the next day.  I could see no other reason for staying here.  Maybe this is the reason I feel they can overcharge for food and drink and you have limited opportunity to vote with your feet and go elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, the stay was nice, the pool was great.  I had a really good sleep as the sound proofing must have been good.  I was just left feeling empty.;3
Looks very impressive as you approach on the the street, inside it has some old world charm but not as much as you expect from the outside. We had a coffee and snack there from their snack bar and sat in the foyer. The light feature and ceiling are fantastic. It is in a great location but is probably noisy.;3
Great location and wonderful staff, but the condition of our room was somewhat lackluster. The A/C unit made an awful loud noise throughout the night and the bathroom, with itâs odd layout, was a slippery hazard at times. The WiFi didnât really work and when it did, it was terribly slow. Despite these rather minor issues, you canât beat the price, location and great staff.;3
Fun vintage hotel with out much in the way of amenities Poor wi-fi. Felt like being in a Wes Anderson film. Rooftop bar is fun with good views. Central Meat Packing District with short walk to subway and bus routes.;3
Hotel is in a great location and is convenient to restaurants & the park.  The hotel is a little dark and not real light and airy feeling.  Employees were all very nice & helpful.  The room we were in was extremely small.  Not sure if they're all like that or not though.  It wasn't terrible, but not my favorite either.;3
OK experience and rooms. This hotel is only good if youâre going for business or friends. Thereâs not many places to walk to around the grounds, so if you need to go somewhere, prepare to take an Uber. Food was subpar. Check in was a nightmare as the line was beyond long.;3
"We stayed at the hotel the week before Christmas, visiting Universal Studios. We were upgraded (for a fee) to a great corner room on the 19th floor overlooking the Studios, however, the view of the park was probably the highlight of our stay. There were several minor issues which ended up accumulating to a point that we'd look elsewhere if we need to stay in the area again. - The hotel is enormous. The lobby was under construction and it took us a while to find the front desk to check-in. The entire area of the hotel, once you come up from the parking garage, seemed deserted. Zero ambiance. They could at least place some arrows on the walls to direct the patrons; - The staff was courteous and friendly, no issues there; - The food was extremely overpriced. We had breakfast at the";3
Very friendly staff.  Very small (5x7) rooms.  Unbelievably unique bar.  I'd complain about the prices if it weren't for it's location.  If your not ready for small, small spaces with big, big prices, then the West Village is not for you.  Overall, The Jane was a good experience.;3
The Hotel was very close to the LA Metro which was very convinent. But, You have to walk up a HUGE hill to get to the hotel. The hotel offers a shuttle service that goes from the bottom of the hill, to the hotel, and to City Walk. It only runs until 10pm. Kind of a bust....  Our A/C never worked. It was sooooo hott at night. We asked the staff to take a look but nothing was ever done.   The hotel was very dated and was in need of a face lift.  The staff was wonderful.  Room service was speedy and accuarate.   City Walk was close by.  Great View.;3
It was a bad start, I booked a one bedroom suite and it was still occupied and no fixed time when the room could be ready. I had to downgrade and that was a painful process. The club lounge disappointing you need to pay for the drinks, not sure if this is a American lounge concept? Bed was comfortable and room was ok. The gym was good and the bar staff were fantastic. Think if you donât have an early flight would recommend to stay in LA. The 3 was mainly due to the check in experience.;3
I spent there only one night. Clean, shared bathroom outside the room. In reality was dedicated to our room only while the second room was vacant. Good price and excellent location. Close to CP and Metro.;3
We returned once again to the Hollywood Hotel. The room we stay in is perfect as it has a slider door to the outside and I travel with a service dog. The breakfast is still good and the room is large and clean. Issues still remain. The front desk staff especially Michael G is rude. On two separate days maid service skipped us entirely. The bordering street Lexington was loud on the weekend. Good luck. Never quite sure what you'll find.;3
I stayed at this hotel about a year ago on business and loved it. I booked this hotel for another business trip but this time I brought my 12 year old and sister in law. Things have changed with this hotel as far as service. I am a Hilton Diamond HHonors Member and I love Hiltons because of the level of quality and service. This hotel is lacking in both areas. This trip, my Diamond status did not do much for me. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: Great Location, 5 minute walk to Universal and easy access to Highway and Hollywood/Beverly Hills Parking was very easy  Breakfast Buffet was great - lots of different choices Room was nice and clean  Cons: Staff was sub par. At the front desk, it was acknowledged i was a HHonors member but that was as far as it went. Nothing terrible;3
"I stayed at this Hilton while on vacation with my college girlfriends. The location was great! It's right near Universal Studios and Universal City Walk. It's an easy commute to Hollywood, Burbank, etc. Even during the busiest travel times, we never had trouble getting to our destination. The room itself was large, very clean and had a nice view. We were on the 5th floor. Overall, we had a good stay, but there were a few things along the way that were a little disappointing. They weren't ""deal breakers"", but added up...they lowered my score from a 4 to a 3! Here's why....  We chose to self park to save a few bucks every day instead of using valet.  It's no big deal to park in their garage. There are plenty of parking places. Although, my parking card didn't work for the first 2";3
The hotel looks beautiful. But yiu can never judge a book by its cover. Its a good location just below universal studios. It was a little pricey. And the roomservice was terrible..overpriced crappy food. The staff was less accommodating when it came to needing a hair dryer or fixing an overflow toilet. I would never stay her again.;3
"I spent four nights there last week. I wasn't given a clear (ideally printed) instruction how I was getting a discount from Empire Parking. As a result, I was overcharged. It would take me ten minutes to reach this garage located at 303 W 96 St. On a couple of occasions I was told at the garage that they were full and then when I was about to leave an attendant would tell me, ""but because you're a good man, I'll take your car."" Rooms on the 11th floor were more spacious and well equipped than on the 10th. The hotel has also a discount arrangement with a local reasonable dinner.";3
Last weekend, a friend and I stayed 3 nights at The Jane.  It was a good value for us as we travelling without our spouses and preferred to have our own rooms.  Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay.  I've outlined what I feel were the pro's and con's below:  Pro's: -Great Location in the West Village right on the river.  Quite close to a metro and plenty of great restaurants and the Highline is steps away. -Bargain price for Manhattan without having to stay in a hostel or share a room -Nice restaurant off the lobby -Loads of character -Small, but well appointed rooms considering. -Very good service (they even let us check in hours and hours early)  Con's: -Shared baths if you stay in the bargain rooms -Overheated!  I slept with the window open AND the A/C on. -There;3
Small tight rooms, staff at reception lack knowledge, The concierge Desk had an older fella who was extremely rude to both my wife and my daughters mother in law.  I did not believe it so listened in and found him so rude.  The Diner on corner was great top service and friendly.  Rooms were clean, very small bathroom and it needed attention. Would I stay here again ?  Yes, but NY is over rated noisy sirens every night.  Plenty to do though.;3
Do not use the phone in any case, (the rate is absurd, inexplicable). The location is great, (subway - line 1-2-3, lincoln center, stores, restaurants, etc). It would be better if you needed the care.;3
This hotel was by far the cheapest option I found for my trip in September 2013 and the reviews made me apprehensive but I was pleased by the cheerful desk staff, and the room was much bigger than I had pictured. The tub surround seemed held together by mIldew and I'd never be motivated to take a bath in it, but the hot water was plentiful. I peeled off the white bed coverlet and the vellux blanket beneath it -- neither seemed especially clean -- and just slept on the clean sheets with a clean towel covering the pillow. The room was quiet, the hotel seemed safe, and I got the two wake-up calls I requested. however, I spent so much on cabs going back and forth from the Times Square area with luggage that I would in the future spend an extra $50 per night and stay closer to;3
We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and it was not as bad as everyone made out.  I read the reviews before we arrived so I suppose it prepared me for the worst but I was pleasantly surprised.  We got clean bedding and towels every day and had hot running water day and night. The staff are friendly and are willing to help with any questions you might have.  The deli on the corner was an added bonus and again they were very friendly (bit of advice if you are looking to buy rose wine go to a liquor store about 4 streets up as its alot cheaper).  Like a previous review said there are alot of good restaurants near the liquor store - the Indian was superb as was a place called Henrys.  If you are into Jazz there is a place called Smoke which has live Jazz plus you get dinner for;3
Location is excellent.  We arrived early, and the hotel was able to hold our bags until check-in time later in the day.  When we did arrive back at the hotel, the elevators were not functioning, and our room became a 12 STORY WALK-UP. WITH BAGS.  Happily, that was the only time we had to walk up the stairs.  The $19.95 residence fee was expected, but still seems unusual- no other hotel has ever charged me a $20 residence fee.  Cleanliness was okay.  DO NOT EAT THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST.  This hotel charges $12 for a bagel and coffee, or whatever you might grab, breakfast offerings that are complimentary at comparable hotels.;3
We checked into this hotel after a disasterous first night at an airbnb apartment.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself a little tired and could do with a good fresh up but the rooms were tidy, bedding clean and showers good.  As we only used it as a base it was fine.  10 minute walk from Central Park and two minutes from the Subway.   No restaurant or bar but very good coffee shop across the road.;3
I always love staying at the Empire but the hotel rooms are tired.  Bathrooms are super small and I dislike a shower curtain.  Other than that, I still love staying there bc the people are so nice and the location is wonderful.;3
Stayed here a while back for a couple of days on business. It is located close to Universal Studios. The staff was very nice but he hotel seemed a little bit dated. But overall a decent stay and I would return;3
Firstly the positives - the Wyndham New Yorker has a lot of history (there's a small free museum downstairs!) and you can't really beat the location. Literally a stone's throw from Madison Square Garden and 10-15 mins from Empire State Building and Times Square. There are 2 or 3 subway stations nearby which is convenient. Service was also good. Check in was painless and we had an issue with the toilet bring blocked which was sorted very quickly and efficiently. Tick Tock diner next door was awesome, we only ate there once but would recommend it. For the location, we didn't hear any noise during the night etc but I guess this may vary depending on where you're staying in the hotel.  Negatives - the room is tiny. I've heard this is normal for New York, we had a double bed and not;3
I've stayed here several times. The hotel room is fine, the location across from Lincoln Theater perfect. But the bathrooms are tiny and very poorly designed, with a shower stall that has plexiglass on one side, and a wide opening into the bathroom on the other. Thus, water always spills out onto the floor. The bathroom sink is very shallow, so water always splats out onto you and the floor as well.;3
The good news.  Wifi is free.  The registration line was short.  They upgraded my room.  The room was big.  The location is close to the train station, bus station, and subway.  The bad news.  Parking is $60 per day. I forgot my  toothbrush before a meeting. I went to the front desk for a new one.  They told me they had them, but I needed to go to room and call room service. I left for the meeting unbrushed.  The bathroom was small and the toliet paper roll was akwardly place behind the door.  They had plastic water cups.  At night the room was cold. The bedspread was thin, and there were no extra blankets in the room.  In the morning, I was late for a meeting. I came down to check my bags but the line was 1/2 hour long. I walked 1 1/2 miles to my meeting with my bags. This was;3
This hotel is ok but nothing special at all. I always wanted to try it in the summer due to the rooftop pool, but the pool area is crowded, although the lower level has space, it's poorly laud out for seating. The upper level where the pool is located is very small,not a relaxing atmosphere and the pool is tiny.  Nice view thought. You take the elevator to the top. And then you have to walk up a flight of stairs in a dingy hallway.   Our room was very clean, but honestly the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in while visiting new york and I've been several times. There was only a half door on the shower, so the water goes everywhere and there is no exhaust fan so the other way around steaming up the room is leaving the bathroom door open. There is water damage on the door;3
I stayed in this hotel last summer because I got an awesome deal during peak season!  I paid half of what I would have paid if I had stayed in Midtown Manhattan.  Though it is not a four star hotel, it provides comfort and cleanliness.  They provide internet access and vending machines. There is a convenience store a short distance away.  The store also serves bagels and sandwiches. I was a little concerned about the location before my stay.  My mom and I found it to be a safe and quiet area.  We were able to get buses and trains to Midtown without a problem.  Honestly, I would stay at this hotel again.  I loved being right across the street from the beautiful Central Park. It is very quiet at night which makes it easy for sleeping. I have stayed in Midtown and I found that;3
situated in a bad area but the hotel is decent, nice rooms, secure car park but with no restaurant we had to order food from a local restaurant which was actually good but wouldn't have found a decnt one to go ourselves;3
We had a room booked 4 nights. After sleeping though night 1s with gnats (in 3 different places in the room), we were switched to a new room the next day. The new room had heat problems (the ac needed to be on but was stuck on heat), the fridge was left empty, no coffee machine and places to plug in phones by the bed were never brought in. In exchange for my daughter and I sleeping with gnats for a night we were moved to a different room and given 4 extra water bottles. I donât think $6 in free water was enough, I think the 1st nights room should have been refunded.;3
My husband and I stayed at The Empire in December 2013 for our first ever trip to New York. We chose the Empire because of its connection with Gossip Girl.   It is situated in a really good location, right next to the Lincoln Centre and in walking distance to the Park, Upper East Side, Rockefeller and Subway links etc. Perfect location to explore New York.  The Hotel itself is nice and comfortable, but not amazing. Staff were relatively friendly. We had a room on the 5th Floor overlooking the Lincoln Centre. The room itself was nicely furnished, modern, clean and a decent size - everything you need for a comfortable stay.   The only negatives were the decor throughout the hotel was looking a little tired and grubby, which should really be addressed. And the noise from the;3
I travel a lot and the services provided (internet, food, concierge) was not good.  My phone basically did not work... the wifi was ok but I did missed several calls and text messages because of faulty internet service.  No snacks or access to bottled water on site.  The services and customer service wes well below average.;3
Went with two girlfriends. We each had our own room, tiny but comfortable -- like being in a train car. We didn't spend much time in the room because there is so much to do in the area!  Yes, it's kind of like staying in a dorm room with a shared bathroom on some floors but it's clean and the staff is really nice. Just a few blocks away you have the new Whitney Museum, the High-Line, amazing restaurants and shopping, just a great vibe all around in the neighborhood. You will really get the feel of the West Village -- lots of history.  Their ballroom/bar is so much fun late at night. We got into the party and the rest you have to experience for yourself. Many interesting people to meet!  The cafe in the hotel was also wonderful and the coffee was delicious. I enjoyed the;3
Firstly, the hotel is not new at all. It could have been renovated and modernized slightly but the old feeling is still there namely on the elevator, interior of the room and bathroom. The room is not that big as it is expected for most of NYC hotels, however the location is excellent as it's located near Macy's, shopping avenues, restaurants and 24 hour convenient stores. Staff are mostly excellent, you are required to show your key room whenever you want to use the elevator. Upon checking in, I found the receptionist just wanted to get the job done, too quick, not too friendly and informative.;3
Good location and easily accessible, helpful front door staff and some reception staff but not all.  The hotel needs a revival especially the rooms . The bathroom set up is not functional. They look the same as my first stay in 1996.;3
Room was ok. Shower was hard to figure when first arrived but was fine once I figured it out.They price was good but the fact that I had to go out to eat breakfast was a disappointment. I feel for $100 plus your should at least receive a lite breakfast.;3
For my wife and me, this was the right location at the right price. Our room was modest yet clean clean and comfortable. The only shortcoming was that the bathroom while fully functioning was not yet finished its renovation.;3
"We were on the 12th floor. The rooms are not very large, but we had a king size bed, a closet and a bathroom with both a shower and a tub. The chair by the desk was a dirty lime green....and the chair by the bed had weird bleach-like stains on it. We tried not to sit on either one. The guy staying in the room across from us kept yelling and banging on our door the first night, at around 12 midnight. We finally called the front desk, and they sent up security. The guy said he was yelling at someone in the elevator who was ""threatening"" him....the following night we heard him slamming the door and brushing up against our door. But he calmed down after a while. There's a diner on the corner and a drug store, on Broadway; subway station is two blocks away.";3
Hotel is run down and needs renovation.  Also, they cannot accommodate a feather allergy. We were told at the front desk that this 40-floor hotel has never encountered someone with a feather allergy and could not provide feather-free bedding. Feather-free room is a standard checkbox and in my customer profile as a request at both Hilton and Marriott hotels, but apparently the Wyndham has never heard of such a thing. Front desk staff did commit to sending housekeeping up in the afternoon to try to see what they could do, but they never showed.  Superior customer care could have overcome the tiny room with the rundown bathroom, but it was not to be.;3
We went to our room 10th floor and when we opened the door its good we didn't like small spaces as the room was so small we could only get around the bed no where to put your luggage and the bathroom was even smaller as the toilet was so close to the built in sink unit you could not sit on properly its a good job we were not BIG people. The downstairs at night was like a cave as the lights were turned down and the bar only sold bottles which were expensive and cocktails so if you want a draught beer go out. Staff at desk were quite rude but the door boys and Conceiage were friendly. All in all a place for a stop over and nothing else.;3
"We loved that it feels historic ... but with that comes the run-down, worn-out issues.   Gotta say that the $22/day parking gets you a guaranteed spot. (We've had issues with space at other Hollywood hotels.  They have a pool but you have to cross the parking lot to get to it. Hmmm  Tub/shower has really low shower head so if you're 6'0"" you're going to not love it.  Every vending machine in the building was empty when we visited. Go see Mike in the gift shop for drinks and a nice conversation.  Probably wouldn't stay here again just because the room rate could get us something more modern and in central LA. That said, the place DOES have character. Must have been THE place 20-30 years ago.";3
My husband,  our two young children and I checked in at the front desk which was a pleasant experience.  After reading prior reviews we made sure to booka premier room.  To get to  our room on the 11th floor we had to take a very small and stuffy elevator that was extremely slow and  had to walk through a dark hallway maze to find it.  The room was what we expected,  nothing fancy, clean and working air conditioners which we needed since the weekend was a hot one.  During our stay we had a few minor issues.  If we wanted hot water we would have to run the water for at least 10 minutes before getting into the shower.   The irony is that in the bathrooms they ask you to help conserve water and reuse towels.  Housekeeping would only leave as two towels and we would always have to;3
Rooms were way too small. The two beds in the room & dresser was all that could fit in the room. Very little room for any people. Bathroom was exceptionally small too. No vanity or room to store any bathroom supplies. Very disappointed in rooms. Lobby was beautiful.;3
Cheap hotel (NY prices) but comfortable enough for a short citytrip. The interior is old but cosy, the bar is an absolute must-visit! Near the financial district, easy to reach through yellow-cab/highway or a walk along the waterside. Not a business-hotel.;3
"After reading other's reviews I learned a great deal. First, it is wise to try and get this room for around $115 on Priceline.com (I stayed from 1/2- 1/6/2012).   The top floor is very warm, but the windows do open.   The bottom floor is cooler, but the ""quiet"" side away from the street is very noisy due to the HVAC units (ac/heat).   The showers do flood, the design is awful! The prices on food/drinks/other accoutrements are a bit pricey, even for NYC standards.   I requested a king size bed each day and received it; which made me really happy. The staff was very friendly. The roof top bar was a lot of fun. The location is very close to great shopping and Central Park. My only major complaint was when the roof top bar closed, I had just bought an expensive liquor drink and was";3
We were supposed to have two queen beds, but they had change it to one king bed. This was dissapointing, and there were no more rooma available. Rooms were clean but tiny. There is a sauna and a pool, and nice garden. Breakfast was very good, custom made omelettes etc.;3
Expensive hotel but great location. Right in the middle of everything and easy to find and get to. The rooms are small and basic however we had a great view of the empire state building. Nice and clean interior of the hotel with a handy shop in the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff;3
Went to New York for my sons graduation and chose The New Yorker for its location. Close to where the event was and his job and such. I was a bit disappointed to see such a small room for the price I paid. I get the location was great but there were not many amenities, in fact all they had was a diner which was pretty good and a bar/restaurant and a workout room and they give you free WiFi. The views were amazing and I will say the staff was very pleasant. My kids were hoping to have had a pool but no such luck this time.;3
This hotel is located unusually close to the terminals at LAX, which makes for convenient transfer to/from your flight.  Smooth and friendly checkin, a large, clean room with all the expected amenities, however a disappointing view of a huge parking garage. My in-room safe was locked when I arrived, but security quickly came to open it after I had notified the front desk. The bed was comfortable, wifi worked well, shower pressure was ridiculously weak.  The swimming pool is good sized, though why it is heated I don't know. As can be expected at a hotel this close to a busy airport you do get a lot of noise and smell of jet fuel there, making lounging by the pool not altogether pleasant. I did not try the fitness room on the top floor.  For breakfast I went for the breakfast;3
This is kind of an odd property, sort of like a time warp.   Its located within walking distance to Universal Studios and Citywalk, which is very convenient.    The hotel itself has a heavy Asian influence, and feels sort of stuck in the 80's.  Its in some ways kind of opulent, but not what I'd call chic and modern.    The rooms provide good views, ours was to the north.  We had a king alcove room, which cost extra but provided a ton of space.  The room had a big, thick carpet and was a little dated, but in very good condition.  I just think the dÃ©cor could use a refresh--the walls in particular.  Very dark.  The sheets and towels were actually amongst the highest quality I have encountered in a hotel--very soft and thick.   The bathroom was very large and the shower worked;3
First impressions were okay...the gate for the car park was not working however and we had to drive round a few things and after a 2 hour drive we just wanted to put our bags down...Finally got into the hotel and we were about an hour early for check in and they didn't have a room ready just yet so put our bags in a bag room and went out...came back later and went to our room...first impressions...smaller than the pictures...went into the bathroom to find ants all around the toilet, sink and on the floor...we tried to get rid of them and hoped they wouldn't come back...stayed the night...the next morning...more ants...went down to breakfast and was planning on saying something after...before I came to this hotel I e-mail and asked if they do gluten free waffles for;3
This hotel was really mixed but may be suitable depending on what you are after. There were good points. The front desk people were cheerful & efficient, but often busy. The Upper West Side location is nice if you want to stay away from the bustle of Times Square/5th Ave with subway entrances within a minutes walk. Rooms were quiet, not cramped by NY standards & wifi was free. But the bad was quite bad. I saw the doorman being quite rude to some guests. We were shocked to find the TV did not work - no channels at all! The room was old & not so clean, although upper floors are renovated. I found the room too warm & there were no controls for me to adjust. There is no onsite food outlet but there are lots of neighboring places which deliver to the guests. The shower took ages to;3
Room was tiny and noisy though the bed was very comfortable. The extra charge per night of US$20 + tax is over the top. Apparantly for phone, gym, water and coffee which most hotels include in tariff. And when you consider no coffee in room and only available between 630am and 730am that's a hard one to justify. Who gets up that early in NYC!!;3
For years, the New Yorker has been where I stay when I fly to New York preparatory to walking across the street early the next morning for the Adirondack train to Montreal. I'm now re-thinking that. This was my first stay since it became a Wyndham, and some of the problems aren't Wyndham's fault. To list the ones that are first: I was walking to the elevator when a guy behind a desk asked me if i knew about the free breakfast, which started at 9. I told him I had to be up earlier and he suggested I change my train reservation. Not going to happen. I was then given a hard sell for Wyndham resorts, which I didn't appreciate. The room was fine, but (and this isn't Wyndham's fault) construction suddenly started up, making it very hard to sleep. It stopped a 5am. Next problem might;3
"Room is small but got the essential, but that's it. No bedside lamp, empty walls, no AC. It is fine for sleeping (beds are okey, wouldn't complain), but not very nice to hang around in. Close to the tub with many lines stopping, so good location. Helpful staff. Clean enough. Got plenty of small kitchens, but they seemed to be lacking the things you might find at a ""real"" hostel (like soap, some kitchen utilities, left over spices). The cheapest place we could find which wasn't totally off, so I guess the price was okey for London, so in that term you get what you pay for (a place to sleep not too far off), but in most other cities, you'd expect more for this price.";3
pros: Very goo location,  you have coffee or tea for free every morning,  Stuff was very nice,  Cons: 1.They didn't cleaned our toilet in 1 of the 2 days we stay there, no shampoo etc either, One empty beer left in our rooms that day, do not know who put it there (ot us for sure) 2.I left my iphone USB charger connect to the clock, came back evening for it they said they didn't find it....it was connected to the clock 100% sure. 3.Noise from the street for rooms that face to. 4.No free wifi;3
"I've stayed at this hotel several times, but this may be my last.  I booked a room on the ""Executive Floor"" thinking I was treating myself a bit...but, not so much!  First, the floor was supposed to be secured (use your key in the elevator to access the floor), but not so.  I was there for two nights...took the elevator several times and NEVER had to put my key in for access.  Second, when I opened the door to my room (which opened out...never had that before in a hotel) the carpet was very worn and dirty.  Third, I had to move the ""coffee table"" in front of my couch as there was no way I could get to the bed without doing so (who planned that?).  Fourth, the view (although some may have liked it) was over the park....noisy and not too scenic!    I was going to ask for a";3
Overall hotel is clean and tidy. Breakfast was good. Metro is close by so transport is also okay. If it was not for Michael at the front desk being a great help, i would rate this hotel 1 star! Roman who also works at the front desk would be the rudest most arrogant person i have ever met in a customer service orientated job. Other staff were also short and rude when questions were asked! Area is okay, but would not walk alone at night.;3
Arrived at the Hilton Universal on Thursday July 12th at noon. we proceeded to check-in to see if our room was possibly ready. We were informed that their entire system was completely down and they were unable to check any one in until 4:00pm, as they hoped their system would be back up. Well as we did not have anything planned for the day we headed to the lounge for some drinks and a bite to eat, while we waited for my husbandâs children to arrive.  At 3:55 we proceeded back to check in and a crowd had formed. There had been people since 8:00 am waiting to check into their rooms, people were not too happy.  The system was not back up and they informed everyone to have their conformation information available along with photo id and a credit card.  They then asked for people to;3
The hotel is good and well located unfortunately I left a pair of sandals after checking out and when two hours later I came back for them they were never found. I was left angry as I felt betrayed by the room staff and housekeeping seriousness.;3
Wow! Just below our expectations. Locations is however brilliant. Convenient location close to all major attractions e.g., The Empire State Building, Times Square. Excellent for tourists to save time.   The room was not so great. Very congested for a couple.   Service was okay. Could have been friendly.  Anyway, I would recommend the pizza shop right opposite to the hotel. Extremely delicious and economic survival :-)   Have a pleasant trip!;3
It's a cute hotel with a great bar,  it's pretty inexpensive but it's much older and there's no amenities.   I'm a clean freak and didn't find it up to par but my standards may be a bit higher than most.   If you're trying to do NY on the cheap this place will work. It's in the Meatpacking district so location is good.;3
"I was extremely disappointed to be charged $27 per day facilities fee.  Yes that is true it is in the ""fine print"" of the Priceline terms and conditions that there may be additional fees such as a resort fee or parking charges.  This hotel is not a resort and I was not planning to park.  The ""amenities"" provided are free local calls, use of the business center, and excercise room.   These are basic services that are included in most 3-star and all 4-star hotels.  I feel like I was deceived. On the other hand the service and location are still top notch.";3
"Let's start off with saying that Hollywood hotel was not what it was made out to sound like. Location-wise, it was close to the metro red line station and various buses but the nearby area did made it feel like I was in a run down neighborhood.  My towels had some hair and an unknown black stain on it. The decor on the inside of the hotel was kind of dreary and dark. I was expecting a much more grand hotel for the actual price they listed per night; good thing I only paid $30 per night thanks to Orbitz! We requested for a courtyard facing room and didn't have any problems getting it. It was on the first floor so we have direct access from the room to the courtyard. Haven't used the Wifi much but the speed seems to be decent.  One redeeming quality was the breakfast. They have";3
"Second time to stay in this property. The Good: across the street from Lincoln Center  The Bad: pretty much everything else was disappointing. Heat in room didn't work. It took nearly an hour to get a maintenance person to the room. Front desk wouldn't switch our room (""booked solid"") - and when maintenance person called down a few minutes later, magically a room became available. No bellman available to help with the room move.   Overall, the property needs attention - worn carpets, lots of minor maintenance issues that need attention, etc Walls are thin and doors are not the ""quiet close"" found in even mid-range properties.    Standard rooms are tiny; not unusual for NYC, but more up-to-date and roomy choices available nearby at similar price point.Bathroom is closet-size.";3
Overall a decent hotel. Great location and average clean rooms. Quite small rooms (normal NYC standards). Very outdated bathrooms (biggest complaint). Great food on sight and convenience to major landmarks nearby! Subway is at hotel!;3
Hotel is nice in that it has two room suites and we had two bathrooms.  Suite hotels in NYC are impossible to find so it met our needs.   It needs remodeling.  The halls are dark and unpleasant.  Rooms ok, but need updating.;3
This is an old hotel that is doing its best to keep up with the changing times.  There are some issues with upgrading the Wi-Fi but for the most part it was a minor inconvenience.  We had no long waits for the elevators.  The rooms were a good size for New York standards, clean and comfortable, with very reasonable rates and the staff were responsive to our needs.    The location is so handy to all forms of transportation, good cafes, restaurants and markets as well as to tourist attractions.  We would stay here again!;3
Great City Location The New Yorker is in a fantastic place for exploring and getting around the city, situated right opposite Penn Station and Maddison Square Garden and a short walk from Times Square and Hudson mall and piers. Hotel staff were friendly and professional and hotel clean but although itâs an old hotel with lots of history it needs a bit of an upgrade/paint etc looks tired but bed comfortable and being the city that never sleeps it was well received after a long day on our feet. No tea and coffee in rooms but a coffee bar in lobby and the Tick Tock 24 hr diner too, good choice of breakfast and meals and also a McDonaldâs and Starbucks right opposite hotel although plenty diners and bagel shops on each corner too.;3
The guest rooms are small but adequate. Tic Toc Diner a bit tired. The Butcher and Banker is solid steakhouse. The bar has a nice whiskey selction. Favorite with budget minded European travellers. Must be location of Penn Station next door.;3
This Hotel is perfectly placed for a visit to Universal Studios, unfortunately, other than that it is a pretty standard Hilton.  The shuttle to Universal is a bit hit and miss we had booked the VIP tour which meant we had to be at the park gates by 9.15 and were told that the first shuttle came to the hotel between 9 and 9.20 so our best bet was to walk.  Not a problem for us but if you had a buggy or any mobility problems, it is an uphill walk with a flyover to cross the road which was just steps - you couldn't do it.  Another issue was that we had planned on eating at City Walk in the evening, but it closed at 8pm, we didn't leave the park till closing at 6 and by the time we had got back to the hotel and showered it was closed - you are not close to anything else here so it;3
So disappointed .....New York has  been on my bucket list for year's....room was teeny tiny,our view was of windows directly opposite usð Tiles in bathroom dirty...lifts an absolute nightmare...waiting for ages. Staff so-so,the doormen outside we're the most friendly and helpful.Would not return;3
For the last 7 or more Yeats, I have stayed a week at the New Yorker for my annual business trip to Manhattan.  This year, the hotel was not nearly as nice as in years past.  For one thing, only three of the six elevators are operational.  It took a very long time just to get in and out of the hotel each time.  They have also taken the coffee makers out of the room and if you want one, it will cost you $25 per day.  Finally, they check in process took a very long time.  The man apologized saying that he was having a hard time finding a room for us.  This was disappointing as I had made the reservations and paid for them a month prior to my arrival, I did the recheck in the night before, and I arrived at the hotel at the time I said I would.;3
"This hotel is old and dated. Be sure to request a renovated floor. The staff is very nice, but the concierge was not very helpful; she only recommended the restaurants on the property.    This was our second stay. The rooms are tiny, but this is NYC, Iâve accepted that.   The bathroom in our two-room suite was also just Ok.  Clear signs of water damage, and the tile was not as clean as I would expect.  The average night was $500 so very pricey.   We picked the hotel for location , but may look elsewhere next time.";3
I brought three Grandsons to LA for a special treat.   On arrival at the Hilton, the first thing was a complete absence of curb side assistance.   Check in was pleasant enough.  Our room was nice,  but I didn't expect a shower over the bath!  At my age the risk of tripping whilst climbing out, is quite high. Then the excitement of checking the mini bar - empty.   The fridge,  empty.  So we went looking for snacks for three hungry young boys.  The coffee corner offered three cookies and a muffin.  So we had to taxi into town for a light, affordable meal.   On our return at 9:30p.m.,   The queen pull out bed was found to have extremely light blankets and only one pillow.  To add insult to injury we could use free wifi in the lobby,  but not in our room.  Coffee corner closed,  and;3
We booked this hotel because we want to go to Universal Studios and other places near Hollywood. It has a shuttle bus to Universal Studios and back, which is super convenient. It is pretty close to Burbank, Hollywood and downtown LA. Our room is on the 18th floor and the view from our room is freeway 101. The room is big and there are plenty of room but the bathroom is just so so. There is not complimentary water in the room. You have to go to the vending machine located in the parking floor to get it. One bottle is $3..... It is better for you just go to Ralph or Vons to get a pack.;3
Impressive lobby, check-in was quick but not very welcoming. Room was on the 22th floor,a bit small for the 4 of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers)  but this is New York after all. Bathroom was a bit small too but with nice historic details and a good shower, nice view of New York. Very close to Penn Station which was why we chose this location.;3
Have just returned from this hotel. We chose this particular hotel following a recommendation. The hotel location was very good (just outside Penn Station) and it was very art deco in appearance. 2 adults and a 16 year old so we booked a double double room, it was very small and we struggled to accommodate our clothing and suitcases etc. The room had art deco type lights which were very dim so all lights were on when we were in the room. The window overlooked another bedroom and absolutely no view. The whole place seemed tired, they had painted the bathroom, evidence of this was paint all over the chrome towel rail which came off onto the towels. We got up one day and found that there was no water at all in the room, yes it was resolved, but three of us with no shower in NY;3
We decided to stay here because the only attraction we were going to in LA was Universal Studios. They have a free shuttle that leaves from the hotel and goes to Universal every 15 minutes or so, which was extremely convenient. The park is technically walking distance, but with the steep hills, you have to be in very good shape.  The hotel itself is very clean, but they offer no frills at all. They did away with the free continental breakfast unless you pay for a package and their breakfast buffet runs about $23 a person. They also offer wifi, but at $8 a day. Considering they charge $200 a night for a room with 2 double beds, I think they can afford to provide free wifi.;3
The lobby has a nice lounge feel to it with the dark colors and high ceilings. Staff was friendly during check in which went smoothly. The rooms are small which is very common in NYC. The room was nice looking and was comfortable. The bed and pillows were okay as far as sleeping goes. The AC was okay and kept the room pretty cool. Nice location due to its proximity to Fifth Avenue and Central Park. This hotel is right on par with the many other average hotels in NYC.;3
Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The guy who checked me in didn't give me the wifi code (included in our corp rate). Room was fine - good view, tv too small for the distance it's away from the bed. Bathroom was large, shower was a bit weak.   Elevators were slow at times, but not really too much of a hassle.    As I said didn't get wifi password and the phone didn't work when I got my room, was fixed promptly when I brought it to their attention. Silly to have a text sent asking about your stay, when you get different information from the desk - not going into it, but it was evident whoever read my text didn't understand it.   At a Hilton their should be certain things included such as WIFI - eight bucks a day, parking 20.00 a day corp rate. CONTINENTAL breakfast;3
Old hotel and rooms reflect this.  It looks like bathrooms have been updated, but showers only have half a screen, so water goes over the floor.  The a/c cant be controlled from your room and is on 24/7.  Carpet in front of the a/c unit was wet. However, all staff we met were lovely and welcoming.  Location is one block back from Central Park, and about a 5 minute walk from Columbus Circle (one of the main subway stations), which was very convenient for us.;3
Super convenient location to Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden! Room was very small, sink in the bedroom not the bathroom. But itâs NYC and we know not to expect large rooms. Bed wasnât not very comfortable.  No iron or ironing board in the room, you must ask for it.  Also as an important note, no elevators in this hotel.  We were on the 4th floor, depending on how much luggage people have this might be challenging.  Very nice front desk associates.;3
On arrival we were early so rooms were not ready, however they offered to upgrade our room for free if we wanted to have separate rooms rather than interlocking which was fine as these were ready. Room was OK but needed a bit of updating, especially the bathroom. The main issues were the noise from the road outside and the cold due to poor windows. We had to have the heating on most of the time which made just as much noise as the beeping horns and sirens. We were on the fourth floor. However room was clean and comfortable beds and the staff were polite and helpful. Hotel was in a great location, 5 minutes from central park and 20 minute walk to times square.  Beware of the residence tax before booking as this is an extra Â£25 per room/night. This had been included in our holiday;3
Nice looking hotel, Room was not clean, Noisy AC, overpriced for what we got, great proximity to Universal Studios, I will stay there again when going to Universal Studios (May2014) but, this time I will book in advance to secure a better rate.  Notify Management of my reservation and disatisfaction issue to make sure room assignment is upto Hilton's Standards;3
This is a full-service Hilton. We stayed in a King suite with sofa bed while visiting Universal Studios. Due to its proximity to Universal, it is an extremely busy hotel.  As such, even though we checked in past the check in time of 4pm, our room wasn't ready.   The overall cleanliness of the room was fine except for the bathroom. There was hair in the corners of the floor and behind the door, and the tray that shampoo, etc. were sitting on was filthy.  Other than the tray, I didn't mention the other issues just to see if it would be cleaned up on subsequent days. It was, but the tray was never replaced.  The shuttle to Universal came in handy. There are some hilly areas to manage and one of us uses a wheelchair so we used the bus often.  A continental breakfast was included in;3
Good location. My second time staying during the  Westminster dog show. Good with having show dogs as the basement is converted into dog area. Room was fine- good size and clean. What I didn't appreciate was waiting for 2 hours in the lobby for the room to be ready!;3
"I will begin with the negative aspects of my stay at The Empire, then finish with the positive.   After staying in New York for a week already (in Midtown), I decided to spend my final week on the Upper West Side to be closer to Central Park and to have a less ""touristy"" feel. I had booked the hotel on Expedia, and was required to pay upon check-in. I was welcomed with no issue and my credit card charged. I was given no receipt nor was asked to sign anything to show the amount that had been authorised on my card, which didn't bother me, however some hours later after checking my account balance, it appeared that my card had been authorised for an extra $600 than what I was paying for the room. I went downstairs to discuss this with reception, and was bluntly told that there was";3
This is a total tourist hotel. It's in a great area for the Empire State Building, 34th street Times Sq etc and is one of New York's busiest soits but not generally in a great area as lots of dodgy characters About particularly on the corner of west 35th for some reason. I know New York very well so already knew this wasn't the best area but the hotel was booked for me.  It's so dated, too dated regardless of all its 'Art Deco' ness its old, very old furniture very tatty looking and musty. The elevator doors opened on my floor and my heart sank, dark, dingy, musty..just horrible. The elevators themselves are like hospital lifts, Lino floors..old! The hotel I gather think it's 1920s style is quirky but nothing much seems to have done since it was built, even the wallpaper in the;3
Fantastic location, a block from Central Park. Clean, funky rooms as this is a Boutique hotel. Room and bed were on the small-side but staff were very helpful - particularly the Concierge. Refrigerator, TV and safe. Probably suited to younger people/couples.;3
"The New Yorker is a great place to stay. Position is good. Rooms are a bit small. One thing that always annoys me is that once you have booked and payed the advertised price that I think that this might be the only hotel in the world that then charges what they call a ""Facility Fee"". It is a bit difficult to figure out what this is meant to pay for, but I gather it has something to do with the very small Gym in the basement.   Others have said that if you look carefully enough that you can figure out that there is this post-booking fee. This is not good enough and even in very basic first year contract law is not legal or enforceable.";3
We stayed at the Hilton Universal City hotel while we were in LA.   Universal Studios is not surrounded by many hotels, and the Hilton is the recommended hotel for Universal Studios guests. The hotel itself is very nice. We were there in December and everything was decorated for the holidays.   Before arriving, we had arranged through the hotel for a fruit and cheese platter to be delivered and ready when we entered our room. Unfortunately, the room that the hotel had given us was not the room that we requested on our reservation. Our reservation stated a room with two queen beds, high floor and a view of Universal Studios. Instead, the room they had put us in only had two queen beds, which also meant that our platters we ordered were also sent to this room.  The young man;3
Well Myself and my partner stayed at Hotel Riverside for a week, Although the hotel is tired looking its actually comfortable. When we first entered the room on the fourth floor, it was a little scruffy, dirty marks all over the walls and the floor had not seen a vacuum for at least 3/4 days, But there was fresh sheets and towels and although the shared bathrooms where dirty this was because we arrived late and actually the next morning they were relatively clean. Either way it was cheap and cheerful, The staff were ok, Although we had very little to speak to them about, when we did they were helpful. As previously mentioned it is very close to 72nd street which has a subway taking you around Manhattan And no sign of bed bugs, Which i was dreading. The room actually grows on you;3
The Wilde Hotel in Ballybunnion is a small hotel facing the beach.It has been recently refurbished and it is a lovely and well designed hotel.The staff were very friendly and courteous.Parking is limited and a one way system is in place.Bedroom was small but comfortable and the breakfast was top class.Bar small but adequate.Ideal for a summer break.;3
Stayed here for 3 nites in Early May 2018.  Sadly i was left disappointed with this hotel.  It looks very glamoures from the out side & inside with the 40's deco but for me thats where it ends.  The rooms are very basic with no fridge ( much needed in the New york heat ! ) or kettle so you can make a tea or coffee.  Small room not ideal if your in a wheelchair.  The staff where pleasnt and the gaurd by the lifts give you that bit of reassurance that your room is safe.  Be prepared to pay a hotel fee mine was $76 and that was based on a 3 nite stay.  The Hotel is very close to Madison square gardens and Penn station  and 10 minute walk to the empire state building.  sadly this will be my last stay here.;3
"First off the room we booked online looked nothing like the room we received upon check in also, to add insult to injury we received a room in the basement of the hotel were it was very unattractive and noisy the (AC unit next door kept us up all night) ""I latterly felt like a mole person in the basement lol!"" However, when we complained to the Hotel Manager, he was more than happy to oblige we received a huge discount on our room stay, free parking comp, and 50% off the Sunday brunch. I would consider coming here again in the future excellent customer service!";3
"In my opinion, this hotel is nothing to write home about; There is nothing special about it.  This is a typical Hilton hotel. It has a pool, it has around 20 floors and it has a lobby. That's it. The hotel's breakfast is decent. The food is fresh and there is freshly squeezed orange juice. There is not much to say about this hotel. It is around 5 minutes away from the hotel to Universal Studios. I would recommend this hotel to a friend, but only if he or she is going to Universal Studios.";3
In this hotel you get what you pay for. Being a budget hotel in New York, we weren't expecting much, our room was small, but perfect to put your head down after a busy day in New York. The hotel was clean and friendly, and the room was serviced every day.  The location is quite far out for most attractions in New York, but with only a couple of minutes walk to the nearest subway, it is easily accessible :);3
"Stellar Location midtown; OK room; Parking on the street nearby if you are out by 08:0; that was fine by me. .    Small rooms with large king bed.  Get rid of the desk or the luggage holder.  The hotel was on strike, so I guess I need to cut them some slack.  So I will.   Fashionable and trendy lobby leads you to old service style elevators.  They are not very clean nor is the carpet in your room.  (I hate when your feet turn black on the bottom when walking around) .  What I will not forgive is that on the hottest days of July 2017 the pool was closed. Not just one day but for all of my five days.  I only suggested this hotel to my wife and moved from the Aloft because it had a pool.  This was very disappointing.   The room decor is defiantly from the 80âs or 90âs and could use";3
Our family of 4 stayed in the New Yorker Hotel in June of 2016. First, the Good:  the lobby photo is accurate. The revolving door, lobby and staff help to transport the guest to the nostalgic 30's, 40's & 50's. The hotel is located near Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, subway access, 2 blocks from Macy's legendary department store, from our room the Empire State Bldg was clearly visible, beds were comfortable, temp control was good, cleaning staff were mostly invisible but very good. Relatively close to Time Square.  All of these things made the stay pleasant. The Bad:  Being from the mid-west, the value of the room-to-cost was not a plus. We paid ~$220/night through Expedia, this room in the mid-west would likely be half that. But it is New York. The bathrooms left something;3
I stayed with my son (10 yrs) I was worried with all the bad reviews but I was pleasantly suprised. The staff were very helpful, we arrived after a 15 hour flight and without asking given a room straight away! The room was fine, a large comfy bed, nice size clean bathroom, tea & coffee making facilites. Everything you needed. The hotel had a nice bar after a big day to relax with a wine. The breakfast was great and plenty of it! The only real thing I would say it wasn't walking distance to Hollywood walk of fame but there is the train station within a 2 minute walk! All in all I would stay there again!!;3
We traveld in nyc in 10/2014 And we sleeped in days hotel... The hotel is near to metro station, central park life night And have a many resturant.. The hotel is clean and quit but not have a breakfast..;3
I had stayed only for one day at the New Yorker hotel, and my experience was great. It was a twin bed room, waking up to the most beautiful view of New York City (picture attached).   Let me rewind back a little bit though, on booking sites, the initial price was $200, with taxes, etc. it came to $270. At check-in I was forced to pay an additional $31 per day for premium wifi (mandatory payment). I was just not happy that I got surprised with these fees at check in and that was the only thing that ruined it for me.  Over all stay was good, the hotel rooms cleanliness would score 6/10;3
We stayed here while in LA (our first stop of a 5 week honeymoon from Australia).   The good: We had a car, so the location was fine, and very close to stores and Hollywood.  Free internet was good, rooms were clean (albeit on the smaller side), and staff were ok.   The Bad: The breakfast that was included was very average - I would give it a miss next time if it drops the price of the room. Also, even though many hotels do, I don't think it's right to charge close to $20 a night for parking.  Finally, the morning after our last night we asked for a wake up call in order to catch our flight. Luckily we also set our alarms because they only called 20 minutes later than we had asked.;3
This place was ok for the five days we stayed there except for the fact that the AC system is pretty weak, dirty and noisy, and we melted in our room.  WiFi only in the lobby.  Overall an interesting place, with a communal vibe, with guests from all over the world sharing the internet and their stories with each other as well as the chatty reception employees.;3
Though this was a great location next to the Universal City, just a short walk in fact, being such a large hotel chain with apparent standards I was hoping for more. For 7 nights my room was only serviced once, the bar/lounge was very expensive, the shower took a while to heat up if at all. The greatest amenity however would be the pool and heated hot tub.;3
My husband has been to this hotel on many occasions for events at the rooftop etc. But had never actually stayed in the hotel. We stayed in one of their junior suites which looks very welcoming at first glance until you start noticing deep rooted flaws once you actually start living in it. It wasnât as clean and updated as we hoped, which we complained about. the hotel were lovely enough to send up a bottle of red wine and two wine glasses to apologise with a lovely note attached, which we appreciated. The temperature in the room was very hard to regulate, it was either too hot or two cold no matter how we tuned to radiators. This left me with uncomfortably dry skin and a nose bleed every morning for the entire trip. The air was so dry! So I had to create my own humidifier with;3
Great location. Tired rooms that need major updates to be clean. Old carpet, old decor, sagging mattresses. This was probably a gem in its heyday that is now in need of complete redecorating and overhaul of hvac etc.;3
Good for 3 stars hotel. Breakfast is poor. Ä°ts better to go out if u like breakfast. Room is small but clean and nice. The best part is location. hotel is middle of manhattan close everywhere :-) Also airconsition is centralized and working noisy.;3
The customer service was brilliant especially with the help of Mohammed. But never ever expect a big big room/bed or even bathroom for the stay. Apart from that, air conditioning was brilliant, towels are well clean. Is pretty well convience as well which McDonalds and Starbucks are just opposite and CVS are just across the road.;3
The most memorable thing about the hotel was that the service staff always seemed to be busy and swamped. Be it at check in or check out or even a phone call to the front desk (which they hung up by accident and I had to re-dial), the staff were always asking guests to wait and they looked under-staffed. As a result, unsurprisingly, service was just functional.  Getting an inter-connected room meant being able to hear noisy neighbouring guests. The room was spacious and decently comfortable. The hotel is located about a 10-minute walk away from the theme park. There is a shuttle bus but it is always full so no point waiting for it.;3
Stayed for an overnight in early November, had a twin room which was very clean but not the most spacious. The room had a decent sized wardrobe and fridge along with mugs, plates and cutlery ect. I was located in the first floor across from a kitchen and 4 toilet cubicles. Overall the place was clean, however it was very hot and the doors closed loudly which could affect you if your a light sleeper,wasn't really a problem for me. Ideal location only a couple of minutes walk to the tube and shopping centre where a tesco can be found. For less than Â£20 a night I would recommend, you get what you pay for and it's ideal for somewhere to crash after a day sightseeing.;3
Room was clean, comfy and satisfactory.  Positives are location and Jeffrey, the doorman, was friendly and a great help with all the questions we had.  He took the time to tell us about taking the subway as a group for a reduced price and we found it a great way to get around.  Thank you, Jeffrey!!;3
Location was great, view was an awful brick wall, room was tiny and a bit dingy. The location for us was the highlight of the trip. During the spring it allowed us to walk everywhere we went without the extra cost of cabs always a plus ð;3
I would like to start by saying you get what you pay for. Trouble is, paid a lot and got very little in this case.  The hotel looks ok from the front, inside the decor is primarily grey and black. The hotel staff are vaguely competent, it only took several attempts to get our rooms sorted after some confusion caused by the man at the front desk. Avoid the lift, itâs hot and slow. Just by way of cost saving the fan in the lift is set to off permanently. The room we were given had a view of the waste area central to the hotel, at the bottom were many ceramic bathroom parts, perhaps spares for our room that was fitted back in the eighties with odd fitting covers.. It is clean, and location wasnât too bad. You now know what to expect. Oh and they charge for WiFi in the rooms, free;3
The position of this hotel close, to a subway, grocery store, bagel shop, pub and excellent Indian restaurant out weighs the disappointment of the room. There is no hot drink making facility, unless you count the communal microwave. Even then you have to go and buy a mug to make it in, not useful when arriving late at night, In fact if it could be removed from the room it did not exist!    On the plus side, clean room,clean linen every day and plenty of hot water, so great place if you just shower and sleep.;3
This is a decent place to stay. The rooms are quite small. There are no coffee machines in the rooms. There is no shuttle service. I had difficulty accessing the internet. The daily MANDATORY surcharge of $20 plus tax offers little in terms of services, all of which are included at no additional cost from other reputable hotels. Even with the surcharge, all that is offered for refreshments is free coffee in the morning, free water (yay!) and tee in the afternoon, and a minimal selection of happy hour snacks. My room was not able to get NBC New York on the TV, which was very surprising..  Lastly, there were ZERO cups or glasses in the room. This makes it difficult to use the bottled water to take meds.;3
The hollywood hotel was a very good stay....  Up until the very end.  While attempting to print boarding passes, we were having some difficulty, and the lady at the front desk acted like she could not be bothered. Her instructions were to attach our boarding passes to an email and she would print them. I happy to say, I'm pretty tech savvy, but I just could not figure out how she wanted this to happen, and quite frankly she wasn't too concerned. It was literally like talking to the desk..not the person behind the desk, but the actual desk.  What do ya say... we just get a printer for that area? Ok paper is expensive, hook up a printer and just turn it on when boarding passes are needed. This was my only, albeit major complaint. Having your boarding pass makes such a huge;3
This hotel is certainly comfortable, and is in a central location within walking distance of many of the key NY attractions and close to the subway too, but it is a bit tired. In particular our bathroom was very dated and in need of a refresh. We didnât use the restaurants (apart from a quick coffee at Tick Tock - weirdly served in metal mugs!) so I canât comment on the wider facilities. Itâs an underwhelming hotel but is clean and serves a purpose as a place to lay your head.;3
Busy, central location meant that staff are not always responsive. Helpful when asked, however, and directed is to fine local restaurants and sites. Though they replaced our room keys several times, the keys were always hit-or-miss when unlocking room.;3
was a bit hesitant booking this hotel based on various reviews. But to our suprise was a beautiful hotel, nice small but adequate rooms. Great breakfast. the location was the appeal to us. Easy to jump on a bus or the metro to explore the city if you don't have a car. Would recommend and definitely stay here again. Felt reasonably safe in this area, but hey, where in LA right !!!;3
This is a perfectly nice hotel except it has terrible wifi on all of its routers. It is difficult and sometimes impossible to do work on their slow internet. I stayed three nights and had to use it at most times of the day and evening. You get better wifi at a DayInn for gods sake. In addition, their bar was not open yet their sign said it was open every night. In fairness, it also said hours may change without notice. As a result I had to take my business meeting to a local dive down the street. I will not be staying here again. Good internet access is essential for my work.;3
Good location on the upper west side. Right round the corner from 96th street subway which takes you into times square in about 5 mins. The hotel itself looks nice from the outside and foyer. The staff (of what we spoke to them) seemed lovely. They room we were in was an absolute s**t hole. The windows were taped shut, the curtains wouldn't close, the carpet needed to be replaced and the wallpaper was something out of the 70s. The beds were comfy thought and it was clean. It's a semi decent hotel for a manic few days in NYC and you need somewhere to sleep. We won't be back though.;3
Dirty bathroom and under bed for the whole 4 day stay. Also hard to work shower. Other than that nice looking place, nice staff. The doorman were always working and that was a nice part of it. The drinks were good and the food. Good location.;3
The cooked breakfast was amazing! Perfect omelettes by Hugo! The room itself was nice but had a couple issues. Slightly musty smell but put that down to constant humidity! No instructions on how to use the shower taps (never seen taps like those in Australia) so had to call reception, then my husband had to turn on for me as even with 2hands I couldnt pull the tap forward. Also had no hot water on our second morning (took about 10 mins of running the shower for it to finally come through). Staff were all very friendly and the parking is $20 per night. Not as glamorous as I hoped it would be for the 1st nights of our honeymoon.;3
"As a Hilton Honors Diamond member, I was disappointed in the lack of benefits.  When I inquired about a Diamond upgrade, I was told I would be in a ""recently refreshed"" room, no Executive Floor, corner room, or suite.  The Diamond breakfast is only cold food and guests must pay a surcharge for the full buffet.  The only real amenity was 2 bottles of water, so being an elite member is of no real value.  The hotel, however, is ideal for visiting the Studios, with a shuttle running frequently or just a short walk up the hill.  In addition, Citywalk is nearby offering many shops and restaurants.  Parking is conveniently located on the lower levels and the hotel is right off the freeway.  Rooms had flat screen TVs, refrigerators, and coffee makers.  Service at the front desk was slow";3
For what I paid I could have stayed in a midtown hotel. Nonetheless, it did its job. As far as the location, it's a bit out of the way if you want to see all of the attractions, although it's only a short walk to the park. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, but it's a good ten minute walk to the lively bars on Amsterdam Avenue. The room was a bit small compared to what we've been used to, but it was okay. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, although the cleaning staff were a bit noisy in the corridors on a morning, which might not have gone down too well with anyone nursing a hangover. Even so, I quite enjoyed my stay at this hotel and in The Upper West Side area. This might not be the ideal location for everyone. However, for anyone that wishes to escape the;3
Manhattan West is a frill-free hotel on the corner of Eighth Avenue and West 3oth in Midtown West, about two blocks from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The room was rather small with a hardwood floor and a comy bed. No room service - or coffee even, but the price makes it worthwhile. (You can step outside and get anything, anyway.) The TV offers little in the way of entertainment, unless you speak Spanish or enjoy some obscure stations (GRIT TV? MeTV?) The bathroom was small, but provided the usual toiletries. The shower was a tiled phone booth without a place to hold the soap. Be warned!  Still --- a pleasant place in a great midtown location.;3
First time to New York and was there for business conference. New Yorker accommodations were quaint and full of nostalgia. Great location for walking to some of the tourist sights and feeling the buzz of the city, but not luxury stay by any means. Staff were helpful and friendly.;3
Very good location, room 1005 outdated due to old fashioned wallpaper, overpriced breakfast, noisy air conditioning and difficult to control the temperature in the warm room...door of bathroom deserves some new paint.;3
Not a safe neighborhood. The close neighborhood is a mile walk past homeless encampments along a dangerous Supulvida Blvd and they close the restaurant four nights a week. This puts too much pressure on bar tenders to serve a limited menu. Most customers were mad at the slow service with no genuine alternatives.;3
This hotel is quite typical of New York. Not a lot of space but more or less what I expected. The benefit is it is very central and within great walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. A bit tired and the central areas are a bit drab. The thing is in New York you don't tend to spend any time in the actual hotel, so not a great issue. The staff were friendly enough but it didn't have much atmosphere.;3
There were some renovations going on when we visited in January.  The elevators were being worked on so the wait to get to your room was sometimes quite frustrating, but better that they are maintained, than not.   Front desk staff were very pleasant, one or two a bit too personal and not as professional as they should have been.  I like to get my reservation and room assignment done and go to my room.  Friendly is fine, but there is a line that you do not cross. The room was very nice with a slight view of Universal and the mountains.  We were there during El Nino, so we saw lots of wind and rain more than anything else.  Bed was fine - nothing outstanding, room was clean, nice big bathroom (this is where the coffee maker is) and lots of shampoo and other essentials for;3
The hotel is great , location is excellent , rooms are small and cold but suitable for what you need but the service leaves a lot to be desired   Upon arrival I was asked for a credit card for the fees - 2 days later I noticed over Â£700 has been secured against my card - went to reception to complain and they apologised and said it would be rectified   24 hours later another fee of over Â£400 taken against my card so nearly Â£1200 over half of my spending money was secured against these fees   Went to reception - received an apology and was told it was a error and I would receive all fees back and a discount against my stay which I have to wait for from BA  The fees have been returned but Its taken until 5 days after my return and no good to me now as I needed that money whilst I;3
My husband and I stayed at the New Yorker on our honeymoon and we found the hotel to be in an absolutely brilliant location. The room was small but comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size. All could do with a referb but ultimately it was cozy and suited our needs well (although no tea / coffee making facilities which for a Brit abroad was startling!).   One thing to be aware of with this hotel is how tightly packed in the rooms are, therefore your neighbours sound like they're in the room with you. We had horrendously noisy neighbours on our first night (which to be fair, security came and spoke to) who didn't shut up until 5am.   After this, the hotel decided that their maintenance team needed to be in the next  room for the rest of our trip - the next 3 mornings had us;3
The staff we encountered at the front desk was very lovely and extremely attentive. At a quick glance, the hotel looked extremely beautiful, especially with the wonderful and unique color combinations. Unfortunately, upon a more thorough look, thatâs where the pleasantness ends. There we a few large stains on the elevator landing on the 10th floor. In our room, there were a ton of stains on the couch, hair in the bathroom, and it just didnât appear the room was actually cleaned properly.  To top it off, my boyfriend woke up with bites on his back. We didnât see any bed bugs but it did make us very uncomfortable.;3
Empire is in a fantastic uptown area. 2 minute walk to Central Park, loads of restaurants & diners to choose from. Highly recommend the Big Bus tours, accessible stops at Central Park and almost right outside the hotel. Double double is quite small, junior sweet is considerably bigger and more comfortable. Comfy King bed, sofa bed was relatively comfortable for one person. Room was a little musty but opening windows remedied that.  Unfortunately aircon was quite dusty, after some fiddling we managed a good temperature.  The Chowder House was lovely for a meal or drinks. WiFi is free and fast in the lobby, $9.95/day in the rooms. Sadly the pool was closed indefinitely on our visit. Night view from hotel corner;3
Very nice and friendly staff everyone I spoke to was keen to help. Great location for universal studios  The room and lobby feel very old and in desperate need of update. The fitness center is small. And be ready to pay for parking which for a suburban hotel is a minus  The evening pianist at the bar is a special phenomena. Great funny entertainment you do not want to miss.   Food is ok with some Asian cuisine available as well.   If you can forgo the old look the service will deliver a great value;3
Was pleasantly surprised at the renovated digs of the Empire Hotel. The only reason I didn't rate it as very good was because of the bathroom. When we took showers, alot of water ended up on the floor so we had to mop it up with towels. Clearly, an unanticipated error in the design.   The bed, pillows and duvet were a great upgrade.  We stayed on the first floor, which was suprisingly not horribly noisy. And we were only steps away from the workout center, which besides great equipment, always had good water.  We kept being surprised at how close it was to everything! Sure, the room was close but it wasn't claustrophobic.;3
My friend and I often meet in NY and this time we chose The Jane because we were budget minded.  The bunk bed room was very small indeed.  Barely any room to move around in.  However the room was very clean.  There are communal bathrooms which are also kept clean and I never had to wait.   The bathroom floor did get quite wet and there are no shelves to put your things on while you shower.  The room was extremely warm so I had bit of a headache in the morning.  We had the window open all night.  There is a charming cafÃ© attached to it and a separate bar and lounge.   The lounge gets crazy at night (we stayed on a Saturday).   People are dancing on tables and furniture.  The music is a very good mix (not house electronica).  It was fun.  The place got very crowded and there were;3
If I could give a rating of 3 1/2 I would, because truthfully this property is a step above average for the price and location in NYC.  Like most accommodations in the city, it was on the small side and everything from the furniture to the television to the bathroom to the elevator has not been updated in some time.  However...it was very clean and comfortable and at least the mattress and pillows seemed to have been replaced somewhat more recently.  This hotel is very close to the subway and to some restaurants, so getting around and getting something quick to eat was quite easy.  I would definitely stay here again!;3
Second time staying here while visiting family in the area.  The fact that it is convenient to Universal Studios is a plus but does not figure into our reasons for staying here.  Consider this a revised review from last year's entry.  Overall, this is a nice property but the construction in the Lobby area (not disclosed when we made the reservation through the HHonors website) is a bit disconcerting.  The peeling wallpaper in our bathroom was another little detail which detracts from the overall experience.  Not peeling in a trashy way, looks like it was never properly glued on in the first place indicating a lack of attention to detail which might be a common thread in a lot of other reviews of this hotel.  Biggest problem was the Internet connection.  It took 20 minutes and a;3
I don't like that your guys double charge me for the second time and no one wants to talk to me about it you guys said that you was going to call me back never heard from you guys I don't like it;3
Sonja makes a fantastic omelet, best I ever had! And she is so nice and funny.  Hotel is quite alright. Everything you need is there. Nice and clean rooms. Pool is lovely. Nice breakfast. Nice fitness.;3
This Art Deco hotel has interesting public areas but our room was very poor with a tiny en suite.  8th Avenue around the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The Tik Toc diner and the Trattoria were reasonable but overpriced.  Close to Penn Station so if youâre travelling by train, perhaps itâs OK.;3
This a good hotel that is clean and average room. The buffet is excellent but the lines waiting for the buffet are all over the place and not organized, which create confusion between people waiting for the food and the guest transiting to check in or going out to the park. Also, be awarded that you have to pay full parking prices (around $20.00+) a day as a guest while other people visiting for conference, buffet... has a discount. The check in process was below average and the attendant was very rude but the check out was very different, very professional and friendly. Overall is a good place to stay if you visiting the Universal Studios park. I am looking forward for the new hotel building close to the Hilton. Thanks.;3
We stayed at the Empire hotel for 2 nights in November 2011. The location is great. However we had to change room twice as it was noisy and the air-conditioning did not work. Also the decor is a little dated. It was expensive for the service we received - overall disappointing.;3
I had scheduled four nights, and had spoken directly to the staff to get the reservation. I had explained that I really needed a quiet room, since I can't sleep with lots of weird noise. Checking in was different than any hotel I've ever been too.  First of all, a computerized sign in, then a statement that a $100 deposit is taken from every guest.  When I inquired as to why, I was told that often people watch HBO movies, and the deposit helps to cover that.  Most hotels just inform you that any additional charges will be put on the credit card that you register with, so I have no idea why they need to take a deposit! ( perhaps it's needed if folks pay in cash)  Back to the noise.... my room was in the back, overlooking the parking lot.  The room was extremely hot when I checked;3
The deluxe king room is an approximate size and was missing the additional amenities. There were no robes in the room, and requested two. Twenty minutes later 1 robe arrived and I was informed that's all they had! Also to say the roof top bar was a disappointment would be an understatement. It caters to an all male very young crowd and is anything but plush :(;3
Firstly i found the staff on reception to be quite short and clearly uninterested in the guests. The only people that were warm and helpful were Christopher and Yuri. The rooms were very tiny and the heating seemed to be on constant! They charged for absolutely everything which was very dissapointing. The shower had no curtain/door which made the bathroom (as small as it was) to be soaked! All in all it was close to many of the tourist locations but the hotel could have been so much better!   Now dont get me wrong we didnt stay much in the room whoch is just;3
"We booked this hotel through hotels.com, consider as a ""reduced price"" night. There were fees associated with this hotel that one must read in the fine print before accepting, I believe for our night this equated to about 30 some extra dollars. I must say when you enter the lobby you are encircled by a nice modern red themed decor. I was very impressed by the design. The check in process was quick. There are a couple... scary... elevators, I remember the one we rode had a broken light, the other customer riding with us was also scared. The room, was ""New York"" sized. No issue with size. We only needed a place to stay and sleep before our next day flight. Unfortunately, the street noise was undeniable. We attempted to use the constant feature on the air conditioner but to our";3
We stayed here before it became a Wyndham hotel so it wasnât as cool looking as it is now. The room was really small so much so that only one person could walk around the bed at a time. We didnât spend much time in the room for it to us bother us. The bed was ok and the shower grand. The diner on the corner was one of the best breakfast experiences Iâve had in New York.;3
As the parents of the bride, we had many guests at the hotel and the bridal couple.  The inconveniences distracted from our enjoyment of family and friends. Gift bags were not given out to the guests without reminders from myself and my daughter.  Having to continually ask for different keys, and then get totally locked out was annoying.  Then we were asked to change rooms.  When I refused, there seemed to be no problem with fixing the lock on the door.  All my guests were unhappy with the elevator situation.  The housekeeping staff and bellmen were excellent.;3
Stayed here to see a show at the Greek Theatre.  First floor room, really clean and very comfortable. Large flat screen, better than average toiletries, generous with the towels.  Sliding glass door for fresh air, no view. A/C rather noisy, woke up a couple times should have turned it off.  Really appreciated the large iron gate for the parking lot.  Didn't think twice about leaving my vehicle and price decent at $20 per night.    Don't think there's evening housekeeping service, passed the same refuse in the hallway and lobby from arrival to checkout.;3
Booked an executive room with 2 double beds for $2700 for 7 nights. Was lucky enough to get a killer view of the Empire State Building from my room but oh what a price to pay for it! Location is amazing - right opp Penn station, a block from Macyâs in one direction & 2-3 blocks from Neiman Marcus in another direction, 700 mts from Empire State, 8 min walking for bus tours, great places to eat nearby, convenience stores, Starbucks & 24 hour McDonalds opp the hotel etc etc.   However, for the steep price, one would expect at least a tea/coffee maker in the room, maybe a complimentary fruit basket or cookies or at least the usual 2 bottles of water everyday but alas nothing of the sort!! Expect a basic room - executive rooms are decent sized vs a regular room (saw one from inside;3
Showers are half enclosed and water gets on the floor. Wifi is expensive in the rooms, according to the front desk. They didn't even give us the price, just said it's free in the lobby and mezzanine. Those two places are not well-suited for using your device. Coffee costs $3 per pod in the room. Breakfast in the restaurant is not recommended. I ordered a $13 yogurt parfait with fruit. The server said it was at the buffet and already mixed. The yogurt parfait was a container of yogurt with one fruit choice - the same container you can get in the supermarket for $1.  The room size is adequate. The closet is not. The closet was quite small and the rod was too high for me to use. Living out of my suitcase for six days is not my idea of a good hotel stay.  The rooms have been;3
Stayed in the New Yorker during a recent visit to New York with my daughter.  Bedroom had new curtains and new bedstead, bed was extremely comfortable and room was clean.  Very good location.  Bathroom was very shabby, mould all around bath and soap holder, very mouldy smell from water coming out of hot and cold taps in bath. I have never stayed anywhere where bathwater smelled like this! Very unpleasant as we had to bathe and shower frequently due to temperature outside.  Washhand basin and toilet clean and air con very effective.  I am giving low score due to shabby smelly and tired bathroom. I did not expect this from such a well known hotel. Needs more upgrading.  You think it will be nice when you step into beautiful foyer. Disappointing!;3
I stayed here with two friends last week for a long weekend in New York. The hotel is a great location - on the upper west side, very near to 96th street station (a 1, 2, 3 subway line) which takes you straight into midtown, downtown and beyond quickly and easily. The hotel itself was pretty dated and not the cleanest - it also smelt quite strongly of smoke in our hallway and the lift. The room was a good size (bed was huge), however the heating/air con system was noisy as was the street outside (bring earplugs and you'll be fine though). The staff were friendly and helpful, there's free wi-fi, and the Corner Cafe across the road does a good range of breakfast things as well. All in all it is a good hotel if you're not going to be spending much time in the room - just sleeping;3
I stayed here on 3 separate occasions in May with my mum. The first stay was good although I only managed to get hot water. I did mention it but nothing changed and I didn't get the same room so it wasn't a problem again. The room was comfortable and they had a mini bar and cable TV which is a bonus although I didn't watch it. The final stay there was a problem with the booking and I only got a room with one bed. They couldn't fix it on the day but next day they moved all the luggage to a deluxe room plus I got a refund of the difference back without any drama. Ive stayed at moringside inn in 2014 and my mum has stayed previously. They have improved the rooms and they are pristine and cleaned daily. Overall I'm happy to stay there again although NYC is becoming so expensive due;3
OK, to be fair, I often stay at the Waldorf when in NYC. Occasionally the Marriott. This is the first time I've stayed in an 'off brand' hotel, and I was not impressed. The lobby was dark and uninviting, the elevators made you feel lucky to arrive at your floor, and the room was not much bigger than a standard walk in closet. OK, the rate was cheap, and the locations was very good. I may even stay there again, but definitely keep your expectations in check.;3
Overall - all ratings about average.  Rooms small but adequate. Check-in and Check-out were fairly long waits.  Concierge was great. Location was terrific - easy to get around.  Would recommend if you don't plan to stay in the hotel much.;3
It was a lovely hotel in a good spot. Rooms were clean if a little to red and over powering. I did think the tin for lovers at 8 dollars added to the hookers hotel vibe but did make us laugh, The breakfast on the roof top was pleasant and the views good. The heating seems to be on even if you turn it off. But your not in your room long with so much to see and do. It is a friendly hotel and I have only stayed in this one hotel in New York would I stay again, yes but Iâd also look for something a little more relaxing on the wallpaper and decoration front. That being said fun trip.;3
"Quiet neighborhood hotel across from Central Park. We knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room itself, so the size wasn't an issue. If you want space to spread out, this hotel won't be a good fit. But if you're looking for historic buildings, lovely atmosphere, and a place to change/wash up/sleep, this is a great value! Parking was easy (and free on the curb by the park). Each bellman met us with an enthusiastic greeting, helpful advice, and knowledgeable suggestions; they offer a bag check for pre-post checkout which allowed us to get more out of our time in NYC. Fun place! Note: they were doing construction/painting while we were there, but the staff was kind and friendly, so it didn't bother us.";3
Just back from 4 days at the new Yorker hotel.Check in was great no probs, lady at desk was great, quick & helpful,Room was on 36th floor with some great views over new York, 6 lifts only 2 working(being updated soon)witch resulted in queueing & long waits especially morning time(so allow more time). The Room was very small but adequate for time were there. The bed was very comfortable clean & tidy with good house keeping every day. We only slept & washed as out all day & night. We used Tic tock dinner for breakfast as it was convenient But tasty with a typical New York menu or what ever you wanted & coffee refills.The hotel is OLD & dated & in need of renovation but don't let that put you off. The LOCATION is wonderful if you're visiting New York city with all big attractions;3
Stayed here three nights in November 2006. I had stayed here before and knew that for the price... it was clean enough, no bugs, and that it was affordable for NYC. Location was great, close to subway, close to Central Park!;3
We stayed at the astor for five nights and were pleasantly surprised after reading some bad reviews before going. The room was clean (but a little on the small side) with a good view over central park. The staff were friendly and helpful, particuly Felicia from reception. The hotel is near Harlem at the top end of cental park west, however there is subway a couple of blocks away on 103rd street to take you to all of New Yorks attractions within a matter of minutes. We were told before going that the hotel offered continental breakfast, when in fact it was just free tea and coffee down in the basement. However there are a few very reasonably priced delis a few short blocks away. The next time we go to New York we would stay somewhere a bit more central but would definately;3
"Stayed here 3 nights, the first night I had a really hard bed and would have done better sleeping on the floor.  The night shift clerk ""starting at midnight"" is a real jerk and does not help or know anything.  had message light on the phone and he said  there are no messages ""written"" for you.  asked how I listen to my phone messages and all he could say is call back in the morning to talk to the manager.  The room is very clean, it does not have a fridge as stated by write up and are very small.  The price is right for $70.00 per night but I would not pay any more for it.  It is in china town which is very run down, I never had any problems walking around even late at night when returning at 2am.  There is a corner store across the street which is open til 12am and the hotel is";3
Hotel was very average, Staff were brilliant though.    Location.....not great for Walk of fame etc, cost us $70 to get to Santa monica.  Yes its right on Hollywood Blvd but at the end of it !!!  About $30-$40 to get to the walk of fame and bus tours etc.  Nowhere is in walking distance so be ready to get the bus,metro & taxi.  Breakfast was pretty rubbish, we went once then refused to go back but there is a 50s diner down the road which was brilliant !  ATM worked 1 day out of the 4 we were there which was a pain.;3
Why did I book this hotel? Reviews were pretty good and best of all it has a pool on the roof. As we were in NYC for over a week a couple of days by the pool would be great. The pool as it turned out is tiny and was at the time absolutely freezing. So in short did not use it, but was a nice area to sit out and read anyway. Room wasn't ready when we arrived at two pm and even at the guaranteed check-in time of 3 either. After a long haul flight it would have been nice not to start this way. The hotel itself was great and the staff very attentive. Room was spacious and clean but oddly no bedside tables? Location is great for Central Park but quite a walk to Times Square etc. but NYC is all about walking. The charging for Wifi thing is always so annoying and seems just an extra;3
"I stayed at this hotel in January 2012 for one night. I had tickets to the tv show ""The View"" and this hotel was close. We had a junior suite on the 3rd floor and it was very nice. Very large room. Huge windows. Overall, It was a nice stay but I have to say it was very loud outside while I was trying to sleep and you can hear everything through the windows. I am not used to having 100 taxi's and 200 buses outside my bedroom window though :) I think there may have been a bus stop directly below my window so the stop and start of the buses was loud and I had trouble falling alseep. Other than that, very clean and nice spacious room. VERY easy walk to anything! Best buy was directly across the street, which came in handy when I forgot to pack my phone charger. You can actually walk";3
The hotel is located on a busy blvd, approx. 5-10minutes walking from Vermont/Sunset metro station. Some of the rooms appeared rather old, others have been renovated. We were a group of 7 people who booked the same room category but some were given renovated rooms others had to get away with old rooms. The rooms in general were ok, spacious with tea/coffee-making facilities, a safe and a small fridge. The bathroom was pretty dirty when we checked in and also was not taken great care of by the cleaning staff.  The hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 6.30-11am - the breakfast is ok - from pancakes, omelettes to ham/cheese, fruit and cereal all the basics were offered. We did not make use of the pool, but when parking at the hotel's parking lot we realised the pool was right;3
We love this hotel but on this stay, the AC was not working as well as we would had liked. We are from Louisiana so we are used to hot weather. However, the inside of the building needs to be cooler in hallways and elevators.  The room AC's need to be able to be adjustted to a cooler setting.  When the unit would kick off, it was very warm and we had trouble sleeping a couple of the nights.  We do love this hotel and would like to stay again.  I won't come in July next time.;3
I did get a good deal for a hotel a stones throw from Lincoln Center and Daniel Boulud's culinary corner, but I would not give it the same rating as say the Essex House.  If you like animal prints and loud techno music, if you are impressed by dark lighting and heavy handed decorating, this is your place. Smoke and mirrors was my takeaway.  The front desk does not seem to know how to accommodate travelers the way any other 4 star hotel does effortlessly. When we returned for a third try to get into our room at 3pm, we had to wait in a long line for half an hour. By the time we got to the counter the bigger better rooms with a real view were gone.  Imagine a queen size bed with a one foot clearance on three sides - that was our room. Imagine sitting sideways on the toilet so your;3
It was a nice stay. Employees were friendly, the hotel has an excellent location and provides a good service. Towels were and sheets were daily changed however, it should be nicer if dust was removed from furnitures, carpet was vacuumed and blanket was eventually changed.;3
Underwhelmed.  This hotel has amazing heritage - it was a former seamanâs hostel which was used to accommodate surviving crew from the Titanic.  Despite this heritage there is NO reference to this anywhere in the building.  The rooms are a good size for NYC but are badly lit and the air con is very poor.  I would imagine the rooms are unbearable in the summer.  Itâs got a nice location on the Hudson River and some nice restaurants nearby.   I wouldnât recommend or return.   Ps Ru Paul also used to live in the penthouse apartment at the top of the hotel - again no reference to this anywhere!;3
I had read the reviews warning me of bad service and a tiny rooms - but they were only half right!  The room was tiny - to explain this further -- the double bed/queen was placed in the middle of the room, and you could reach the side of the wall with your hand from laying in bed.  But as they say, you don't intend to spend much time in your room when you're a tourist, especially when Central Park was literally across the road.  I had a late flight (2am!) into NYC, and the nightman working was rude and unhelpful. However, the doorman in the morning was very informative, polite and provided some nice suggestions for breakfast.   Overall, the place was fine,  the rooms were clean (albeit small) and I really was only there for sleeping.;3
Jr suite was nice but most terrible thing was the shower had no curtain or glass partition. The partition looked like was broken and never replaced. Called house keeping and was told that there is no partition! When you come out of shower there is water in the entire bathroom and floor very slippery.! Easy chance of falling. A/C is turned of at night and gets hot and stuffy. 3 star hotel at 4/5 star prices. Not worth it.;3
The location is very good for terminal 1. The room I stayed in was a smokers room which led to a week of asthma problems. The cleanliness is not up to Hyatt standards. There was a long black hair on my bath towel. I discarded this towel for another, but I would not take friends or family here.;3
The hotel is very out dated,4 ladies went in one room beds very small, it was my 70th bday I would have thought thy would hav given us  nice room but we were room 2597 overlooking sum building work going on we could see cranes but as you are out most of the time it dosen't seem to matter , we were what seem to be near a lift the noise was awful they never seem to stop going up & down all night. When we went to our room there weren't any coffee/ tea facilities we rang asked reception for some 2hrs later it arrived but it wasn't replenished we went and bought milk sugar. Do not bother going on a dinner river cruise not worth the money poor service and very cold on the boat. 41 dollars for a bottle of what seem to be a cheap wine. The best thing was the show Peter pan and 9/11 very;3
PERFECT HOTEL â¥ï¸friendly receptionist huge warm room  Nice view well clean and decorated ,Lightings is good ,PRETTY GIOD HOTEL LOVELY STAFF FOOD IS GOOD LOTS OF GOOD DRINKS TO BE choose.weâll recommend for a couple trip .wifi is. Pretty good ð perfect for everyone;3
As far as nyc hotels go itâs ok. Clean and friendly.  Gym is tiny and outdated. The internet is fast. The bar is expensive. They tell you they have free snacks 4-6 which means fruit and very plastic mini muffins.  Generally meh;3
I have enjoyed the banquet facilities here for many years for an annual even that I attend with my family.  Due to the fact that it's a celebratory event, I have nothing but fondness for the hotel although the banquet is very bare bones.  This is no fault of the hotel establishment, I think that it's just a budgetary issue with the organization we celebrate with.  That being said, I imagine that if budget was no issue and the hotel pulled out all the stops, it would be grand!  The hotel is very nice and classy with a friendly wait staff.  I have not stayed in the rooms, but I would expect them to be very nice considering the location and the decor of the hotel lobby and banquet hall.;3
5/2/14-5/6/14  4 days...I used Hotwire bidding upper west side for an unknown hotel of 2 1/2 stars ...$81@ nights = $324, taxes $38.72, occupancy tax $28.68, fees $27.61, Total $419.01...I was assigned to room 711...Small room, flat screen tv reception unwatchable, cd clock radio time would not set...Then water started leaking into the room, from the room above...judging from the water stains on the ceiling this is not the first time this has happened...I called the desk and reported the problem...I said to the desk clerk, she would have to send maintenance up to check out the source of a water leak that is now raining from the room above. This was clear water and did not appear to be waste water...I was reassigned to room 207. A much larger and more comfortable room...I have;3
My wife and I have stayed at the hotel for several days. The location is very good. Special thanks to Nicole at the reception. She was very kind and useful for us. Thank you Nicole for your time and help.;3
The Empire Hotel has a great location in New York. I booked 5 days with my daughter at the Empire Hotel, I chose this Hotel because they had a pool, knowing that we where going to be there in July and i t might be hot in New York, then i thought the this hotel would be the best as we could come back in the  afternoon after had a long day walking in NYC. little did we know that the Pool Deck was closed for all 5 days we where there. so if the pool is a must this is not the hotel. also I would like to add the 2 days out for the 5 housekeeping was not able to attend to our room.;3
This was our second stay this year at this hotel. The showerhead wasn't working and the bathroom sink was clogged. We had to call the front desk and wait 2 hours to shower. The carpet in this room is worn out in several spots. The location to Universal Studios can't be beat.;3
Just got back from staying 5 nights at the Hotel of Hollywood and while I'm not disappointed with the hotel I have to say its nothing to shout home about.  Location - I thought I'd talk about this first seen as thought its a big talking point on here and in the hotel. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the touristy side of Hollywood and I have to disagree with a lot of people about the area being rough, its not a great tourist area so don't expect bars and shops within walking distance but I wouldn't say don't walk the streets. I never felt scared to walk the streets alone but I can see why some people were. Finally YOU NEED A CAR IF YOUR STAYING HERE!!! yes there are metro stops nearby but public transport in LA is  largely useless, if you don't get a car you'll find;3
When we first arrived at The Empire we had to wait for another guest to be dealt with at reception who was complaining about needing maintenance work done on a faulty shower. At the time I wondered if that was an omen!   Then it was our time and after asking for as quiet a room as possible we were offered one on 11th floor. On getting there we were shocked how the room smelt of a most unpleasant chlorine smell. Presuming it was associated with the air con, we returned to reception and asked for an alternative. We were then offered one on 4th that didn't have such a stunning view down Broadway and towards Central Park. Straight away we noticed it did not have a mini bar, and we like to use such a thing or fridge to keep our fresh milk cool to go in hot drinks. Back to reception;3
I stayed at the Empire hotel from Dec 31-Jan 2. The staff was very helpful and attentive. I was able to attend the NYE rooftop party which was very nice. They later had a private party for hotel guests which was also very nice. The rooms are a bit cramped but I've stayed in worse places. I would recommend this hotel if you're able to stay for a discounted rate because the excellent customer service didn't justify their rates.;3
But hardly a 4-star hotel! The lobby was large and spacious--and filled with tour groups. The staff was lovely and very helpful. But the room was tiny. If you were sitting at the desk, the person in the bed could not get past you to get to the bathroom. The closet was tiny as well--and very shallow. Because there was a safe in the closet, it was almost impossible to hang up clothes. We would stay again only because of the location but this was clearly a 3 star hotel, not a 4 star.;3
Stayed here as part of a package deal. The hotel is crowed and the front under construction. The desk was anything but cooperative the 3 times I had a request. The rooms at the 27th are quite small and the bathroom outdated. The location is nevertheless good;3
Great location and friendly staff, however the hotel itself and rooms are very dated, grubby in places and could do with an update. Rooms get a cursory once over but could do with a deep clean. Also no tea/coffee making facilities in rooms.;3
Visited 3 years ago and upgraded before arrival to one of the newer rooms and wanted to do the same when we return in September as I've booked with virgin and they don't offer the upgrades but advised I could do this directly but I can't get in touch with the hotel - I live in the UK so can't call and none of the email addresses I find online, I get a response to. We're travelling for a celebration so I'll be gutted if we can't get a better room as I know the unrefirbished rooms are tired and disappointing so really hoping the hotel can respond to this with a way to help me upgrade for September!   The group Wyndham email response just told me to phone the hotel and when I explained I couldn't in my second email it went ignored so I feel like this is the only want to go to get a;3
We stayed at Universal Hilton for the location, but unless you are driving it is hard to access anything else... the staff were helpful,  but after staying at other places, we ended up transferring to another hotel...;3
Slow internet. Painfully slow. Everything else average. Room is much smaller than the pictures look. The elevator was really really slow. The staff was very kind though and the bell boy were very helpful.;3
This hotel is in serious need of an update. It is old and tired and filled with clutter. The events space spills into the foyer and there were chair barricades everywhere. The breakfast Buffett was filled with choice but was messy and the food was poorly presented making it very unappealing. The reception staff were cold and unfriendly. The lifts were slow and unresponsive which was annoying on the 23 rd floor. The security is poor as the lift does not require key card access meaning anyone can go anywhere in the hotel. On the positive side the room was large and comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a Hilton property. The bathroom was large and the bed was great. Room service was fast and tasty. The hotel is good value for money but the location is poor;3
"This hotel is completely legendary. Wonderful historical exhibit in the lower level showing posters for big bands, GIs during WWII, info on the mechanical and electrical systems. Lobby is fantastic. Great location. Very nice diner just off the lobby is great for bkfst. Bed and bedding are very comfortable. Security is excellent: you must show your room key in order to enter an elevator, Soundproofing f/ outside noise (sirens, honking horns, etc.) is very good. Wonderful, big bathtub. Room was small but I don't care. The place is very clean. However they nickel and dime you to death. $25 to to check in before 4pm. even if your rm is ready. $5 to hold onto your luggage before check-in. Most outrageous: $40 for ""facilities fee"" covers business center and fitness room whether you";3
POSITIVES FOR A FAMILY OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES   Positives  Location!!! - perfect base for exploring NYC  Family Rooms - all 6 of us could stay together in the Family Suite.  Price - unbelievably good price.  We paid around Â£1550 for 6 nights.  By NYC standards this is a great deal!!  Decent views of NYC  The house keeping staff were very helpful   Negatives  Hotel rooms are very dated and quite noisy (in so much as you can hear every conversation outside your room).  The room and lobby outside the room was scruffy but beds were comfortable and clean.  Rooms are made up every day and staff are nice.  Overall - great value and perfect for a family of 6.  I would stay here again if going with the family.;3
The Empire Hotel's proximity to Lincoln Center (it's directly across the street) is clearly it's Number 1 attribute. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, but the hotel seems to get shabbier and shabbier as time goes by--stuck in some past unknown decade.   The bed in the tiny room is comfortable, and the HD TV on the wall is nice. But there's literally no room to walk around, while the teeny, tiny bathroom is in serious need of remodeling. The shower stream is more a trickle. The fitness center was being remodeled when we were there, two of the elevators (which can only be described as seedy inside) weren't working--workmen were lying on one elevator floor with tools spread out everywhere. Calling the front desk from the room took about 50 rings--if you were lucky;3
Comfortable mid range accommodation close to Los Angeles international airport. The room provided all we needed for a one night stay and food as available on site, though limited and moderately expensive;3
Stayed here for NY marathon, very convenient for the marathon. Convenient location, three blocks from subway. Rooms are small and bathrooms even smaller. No Internet, but you can pay a secondary provider. Close to Lincoln ctr, lots of restaurants close by;3
The room was adequate.  It was not one of the renovated rooms.....old carpeting and the original bathroom.;3
The hotel is in a very good location, but everything is very old (carpet, paint, etc) and the room that they gave us was very small, the person from the front desk told us he was going to give us an upgrade and it seemed more like a joke he gave us the smallest room ( in a corner) with two doors fom other rooms very near so we could hear a lot of noise from the people entering and exiting their rooms near by, not a very pleasant stay;3
Disappointing return visit. Rooms desperately need an upgrade. Old, worn, uncomfortable, and not technology friendly. Location is great and staff were very nice, but this is no longer a go-to for me. Ask not to be put in room #41.;3
Great view from room but very very very small . Not big enough for 2 people and no space to put anything on a shelf in bathroom. Wifi in room very poor not able to connect until in lobby area. Reception area beautiful but step out of lift to get to rooms and its very old and in need of cleaning and upgrading. Staff very helpful.;3
I was really hoping for more from this hotel. The location is great - right next to Lincoln Center, a short walk to Central Park, and close to subway stations. My husband and I arrived a little early for check in and the desk staff gave us a voucher for 30% off drinks on the rooftop and told us they would bring us our keys when our room was ready, which we were told would be by 3pm (check in time). We enjoyed the rooftop, which is spacious with great views (although the pool is very tiny - not really for swimming). However, no one ever brought keys to us, so we went back to the desk around 3:45. The room was ready, but I would have appreciated the staff bringing us the keys as they had promised. The room was well appointed, but very small, even by Manhattan standards. Only two;3
We rented this through a travel site, canât remember which one. Read the fine print, there was an extra charge,, which took some time to get my money returned but after some frustration it was refunded to my credit card. It is certainly a New York hotel, small rooms but very clean and in a great area of the city. There is a beauty supply store on the corner that is worth checking out, huge assortment from shampoos to odd knick knacks. Donât bother with the restaurant, the Tick Tock i think itâs called, juice is from a bottle, nothing fresh, over priced, terrible coffee, but the scene is fun to watch.;3
Iâve stayed at the Wyndham Days Inn close to Central Park West, Whole Foods, shops. Good location when you don't know anyone to freeload on but aren't made of money. Commit this to memory when traveling in and around Central Park in NYC:  East Side = Old Money West Side = New Money Downtown = Celebrity Money Uptown - No money  1900s old. A tad shabby with the carpets, smell of disinfectant. But it will do after a day of sight seeing and subways. Beds are firm, clean, made daily. Crowded front desk. Good for college visits when you just need a reasonable, safe place to rest your head at night.;3
After spending 5 nights at the Empire here are the pros and cons:  Pros: excellent location, overlooking the Lincoln Centre, 1 block to Central Park and very close to 2 MTR stations, Wholefoods at Columbus Circle is the best one I've ever seen..! Loads of restaurants nearby. The hotel has a nice lobby and roof terrace with a small, chilly paddling pool. Staff are pleasant.   Cons: our bed was as hard as a board, the shower was missing a door, one of our windows was missing a privacy screen and there were no umbrellas available on the terrace. The whole hotel is well used, very tired and worn out. A major refurb is way overdue..!  With so many hotels to choose from, I don't think I would return here.  I only chose the Empire because it advertised a pool which I need to do laps,;3
My family and I spent three nights at this hotel.  We loved the fact that it was so close Universal Studios and were able to take the short walk over to the park.  The rooms were acceptable and clean.  The biggest frustration was that only two elevators out of five were working. This resulted in a long line and a long wait for the elevator.  And when the elevator finally reached our floor(7th)  It was full and we would have to wait for another elevator....which was full.  We ended up taking the stairs so we wouldn't waste any more time!! A note of explanation would of been nice to know why the other elevators were not working!!!!;3
We stayed here in dec 15. On arrival was a lovely looking hotel. We was told we was getting a free upgrade from the check In staff but when we got to our room it was tiny. If that was an upgrade I'd dread to think how small our original room was. There was wall paper falling off the walls and the heater didn't work so it was freezing when getting out of the shower.  My only real issue was with the concierge. I feel he lied and conned us into buying tickets for a bus tour. He told us it was a new company and could get them for us at a discounted price. When going to do the tour we realised we had actually been charged more than if we had bought them off the ticket seller.  Overall a very basic hotel. Not the best;3
The #1 advantage of staying at this hotel is its proximity to Universal Studios and City Walk (but, despite the hotel being here forever, the walk over to Universal involves walking in the middle of streets full of traffic) #2 A nice view IF you're willing to pay and wait and fight for a non-parking lot/freeway view The disadvantages are: #1 the daily charge for parking is $28! #2 the daily charge for parking ends at 6PM (not posted anywhere on their website- look for yourself) #3 If your car is in their lot after 6PM they charge you an arm and a leg for each hour after that #4 the breakfast is below average #5 Even if you're the highest tier in Hilton's frequent guest program, they still charge you $10 plus tax for their hot breakfast foods #6 the coffee in the restaurant is;3
I traveled to NYC solo and I looked for the most interesting and most memorable hotel I could find. After looking for awhile I came across The Jane which states to have the smallest hotel rooms in all of NYC. I was hooked and very excited because as a photographer I knew this place would make for a great photo op for my friends back home to see.  The rooms don't have their own bathroom/shower so don't expect to get that. instead theres a community washroom with individual bathroom and shower stalls. a bit of an inconvenience but something I did not have a problem with at all.  After all of the photos I have taken on this trip the one that gets the most comments from my friends and family are the ones of my hotel room here at The Jane! Hilarious. hehe.   I paid about $99 a night;3
Beware...the Empire Hotel has a fabulous location and an attractive lobby.  But the rooms are less than optimal.  On our first visit the room was fine.  Not so fine on our second visit.  Expensive prices for a seedy room.;3
"I'm not a complainer in general and have stayed in all kinds of places in all parts of the world. Mostly I just sleep in a hotel and don't spent any time there. That being said, my room, which was ""under construction"" (smelly primer on one wall; holes everywhere) and having old blood stains on my blanket was so cold, and they couldn't change that, that they gave me 2 more blankets - which I was totally fine with by the way - I slept safe and sound! All amenities in the room, besides the air-conditioning, worked perfectly fine.  Best part: the staff is extremely nice and helpful, front desk as well as anyone else. On top of it, the breakfast is well prepared and the friendly staff downstairs (in the restaurant) made me smile every morning. Thanks Hugo and Juan and lovely";3
Our family trip to NYC for the first time was amazing! But let's talk about the hotel. It is an older hotel, do not expect any clamor or glitter, the hotel smelled old if it was damp, so I purchased a couple of room refreshers for the rooms. (Pick some up at your dollar store before you travel) The rooms are small and cramp as well as the bathroom, and the carpet looks as if this has seen better days. The important questions are would I stay here again, Yes. Why the location and the price. The location is fantastic, a few blocks walking to Times Square, two blocks up is Central Park and Columbus Circle, also across the street is the Lincoln Center, (catch a free concert) The subway entrance is also across the street. Across the street from the hotel is a nice sitting area with;3
"I get that it's a great location and that it's NYC. I get that. But puh-leeze. The stellar customer service provided by Zunachy, Maggie, Eugene, and Jose (doorman) made the high priced yet average room bearable. (Note: ""wheelchair accessible"" is apparently code for ""no electrical outlets in the bathroom."" Like styling hair should be optional or something. WT...?) The room itself? Meh. It is very dark and the air conditioners will drive you crazy. Beds are comfy. And housekeeping was amazing.  Customer service? Outstanding. The aforementioned people are the only reason why I might consider returning.";3
2 minutes walk from Central Park, right next to the Lincoln Centre. No breakfast included but there's a Starbucks right next door, and a supermarket next to that. Clean rooms and helpful staff. Nice rooftop bar. Didn't get a chance to check out the gym - too much site seeing to be done! - but apparently it's newly renovated.;3
"I stayed there for 3 nights. Staff is very good. They let me check in a bit earlier and when I complained about a noise coming from the bathroom they fixed it right away. Location is perfect. That probably the best pro of the hotel together with the staff They charge $20 per day for hotel fee (not included with an online third party reservation). They say is for the bottled water in the room, the wifi and the coffee in the morning at the lobby. I guess that's common. But for that money internet should be ultra fast and coffee should be good quality.  Two things to criticize. The carpet is old and not properly clean. For people like me, with allergies, that's a challenge. The other thing is the size of the bathroom. I know it's the ""NY special"", but still...as you can seemy the";3
I stayed in this hotel back in October and had a great experience. I booked it again for my parents wedding anniversary and got them the romance package. They didnât get a room with a view or their free breakfast coupons. They tried to ask a desk person about it several times but were told to come back. I called but could only be told what they were suppose to have. They were disappointed.;3
Stayed here one night. The hotel room was clean and comfortable and it was great to have breakfast included. Location is not as great as other reviews suggest. Good for Griffith Park and observatory but quite a drive from anything else. Parking is not free which I would expect to have included - $22. We did not realise there was a pool until we were leaving which was a shame.  The hotel staff could have pointed this out but then we had such an unhelpful and rude receptionist which unfortunately has coloured our view of this hotel. I cannot really recommend and would not return. There are plenty of other hotels in LA.;3
Situated right in the Middle of Chinatown, next to Grand Street subway stop. Bowery and Delancey stops are also within a walking distance, so you get direct access to B, D, F, J, M and Z trains, that is you can eventually get anywhere in Manhattan and have an easy trip to Brooklyn if needed. Obviously, there are plenty Chinese restaurants and take away places nearby, and in 5 min walk you can reach Little Italy when tired of Chinese food.  For a good morning coffee your best and closest bet is Two Hands on Mott street. This is pretty much everything super positive I can say about this hotel. Otherwise it is far from being bad, but severely overpriced, I guess that's NYC.  Reception staff is fairly OK, check in was fast, but first room they assigned to me was not in use actually,;3
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel from 30th March to 5 April 2016. Beginning with the positive, the hotel is very nicely located near the Lincoln Centre and Columbus Circle. The staff is very pleasant and helpful; and the breakfast certainly very nice.However, there are a few flaws which, I must say, surprised me.  The cupboard has a shelf running its entire length such that you cannot hang a coat or a suit without the bottom trailing the shelf. This makes the shelf less than useful. I am surprised that there is a charge for making coffee or tea in the room. The shower strangely has no door, meaning that even angling the head you cannot avoid splashing the bathroom floor. (The hand shower does not work, something apparently true in a number of rooms, as we were a large group staying";3
Recommended to be a mid-range option: not the most expensive hotel in NYC but not sketchy. Decent location. Bellmen were great and helpful- esp re storing bags and arranging transportation. Room amenities were minimal. No sheets on the bed (just a mattress cover and comforter). Room was warm even with the AC full in. Air temp was not very cold and full on fan speed barely circulated the air. Shower has no door (by design) but water easily sprays out into the floor.;3
"This hotel is a short walk to Universal Studios and is very well maintained.  However, all restaurants are very overpriced (breakfast buffet $23) and the rooms are small.  Good pool area, but hot tub is not hot.  Our main problem was the management.  As a long time diamond member, I expected a good room, but got a terrible one that was so small it ruined the trip.  I was also told that nothing on the Exec level was available for several days, but the next day two of my acquaintances checked in and got rooms on that level.  In short, we were constantly given the ""runaround"", as managers did not seem to know the status of our booking or the room availability.";3
We stayed here for 4 nights while attending the opera. The rooms are large for nyc and somewhat irregular  in shape. Our room was clean. The maid service is good and friendly. The elevators are slow. They charge for wifi. I paid for 3 days and  was cut off after less than 2 days. It is ok for email but not much else. You are better off going to the Starbucks on the corner where it is free and works much better. Even better, go around the corner to the Lincoln Center ticket office where there is a large lobby with tables and chairs where the wifi works great and is free too. Also, they make the best sandwiches in the whole world ie for lunch. The music is much calmer there compared to Starbucks. There are plenty of excellent restaurants near by ie Atlantic Grill on 66th.;3
The Room was tidy and clean  but there were only 2 glasses for 4 people, the fridge and TV were not plugged in and there were no liners in the either of the bins. I thought is was very unusual and below par for Hilton;3
The hotel was fine and the room was clean. Staff were very friendly. The subway entrance is right across the road on the corner. Although they don't serve breakfast, you do get a voucher to get a special discount breakfast across the road. Central Park is a short walk away. If you are going to NYC and want to be close to the main action then it would be better to stay closer to Times Square so that you save yourself the traveling time. We found ourselves waiting for the subway later at night. For budget accomodation it is not too bad.;3
Stayed here for 1 night great location. lobby looks great so I thought rooms would be just as good.  How wrong can one be the corridors  Absolutely stink very musty they need a complete refresh & livening up the room I stayed in was small and in desperate need of modernising & again had that musty smell . Stop living of your past New Yorker hotel & embrace the 21st century.;3
First of all I stayed in one of the capt cabins, so quite a large room and en-suite. It was a fairly expensive rate for one night considering the air con was very loud and fairly weak. The ceiling fan did a better job. I gave up on the air con half way through the night. Bed was pretty average.  Saying that though, the staff were very friendly, the location is excellent and as a 'concept' type hotel it's a lot of fun.   I'd recommend going for a cheap room so you know exactly what you're getting!;3
At best a 3.  Room size and cleanliness ok, but water pressure the worst Iâve seen at any hotel    (water barely comes out).  The buffet is also perhaps the worst quality Iâve ever had.  And all this for a very expensive price.  Iâm a Hilton Diamond member too, so very disappointing.;3
This is one of the most affordable hotels located adjacent to MSG and near Times Square and the Empire State Building. The single rooms are quite tiny, so if you're traveling as a family, I would upgrade to a double room. Given its location to tourist hot-spots, expect a lot of crowds. The lobby and restaurants are packed at all hours of the day. The service is average, but all things considered it is worth experiencing the historic hotel.;3
Took about 30 minutes to check in and when I tell them I booked online (I know we all heard this one before) they say that their internet is down and they can't even find me in the system...smh..rooms that are standard tend to be a little run down, you have to upgrade to get better quality..anyways...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.;3
On Central park West, between W 106th and 107th street. Clean, small room, essential (no fridge, no safe box, no brealfast as usual in NYC, no frills), enjoyed low price.;3
"Basic, inexpensive/budget hotel.   Advantage: Near/Close to Metro LA (if you plan to use transit); Free Wi-Fi, Car Rental services in the lobby (for those wanting to rent a car to roam around); Free complimentary breakfast (cereals, omelettes/eggs customized according to your liking, waffles, assorted fruits, assortment of cheeses, pastries, coffee, juices); gym-fitness room with treadmills. Basic room with private shower and acceptable centralized airconditioner (occupant controlled).  Disadvantage: Charges for self-parking ($ 22.00 + tax per night) even with the rental car or own car; Booking a taxi at the front desk they will ask for $15.00 on top of the actual flat rate (and, worse, the taxi company (I think I remember it's called CA Express) will demand a tip from you-- so";3
Stopped here beginning of November for one night before joining the Queen Mary 2. Hotel is in a fantastic location and only a 5 minute walk from Times Square . Hotel itself has a grand lobby but once you go to rooms you will find it very tired and in need of some TLC . Room decor is brown and drab and bathrooms and on desperate need of a refurb . Room had a great view . Check in was a bit of a disaster as my reservation could not be found . Found the reception desk manageress quite surly and rude . One great find is the Tic Toc diner attached to the hotel . Will review separately . Overall for one night o would return purely for location and diner;3
Pros: lovely staff throughout hotel and bar/restaurant.  Comfy Bed as always with a PI. Plentiful supplies of hot water for showers etc.  Tea and coffee on hand in room.  Food in restaurant is fine the salmon was generous and cooked to perfection.  My husband enjoyed a curry and the mixed grill.  However, it takes ages to get served and then ages again for food to arrive.  Not the fault of the staff, they are a small team to cover both bar and restaurant and there are simply not enough of them! Fabulous location for tourist attractions and easy to get taxis etc to travel further afield.  The London Eye, Southbank and parks looked very festive with all the lights.  It felt very christmassy.  We also did the dungeons experience (also in county hall) and it was fabulous fun!  So;3
Ok, it's not the Ritz, but for the money it's hard to beat. The building itself is quirky, with narrow halls and odd-shaped (in some cases) rooms. It was clean and quiet, and the staff was helpful and friendly. The beds were surprisingly comfortable. Lighting not the best, but we wern't in NYC to read anyway. Use the safes installed in each room...you'll get charged for them. The location is great. There's a subway stop a hundred feet from the front door, and it services lines 1,2,3 & 9, which gets you up and down Manhattan with a minimum of effort. If you run or walk for exercise, you're close to both Central Park and the park along the Hudson River (forget name), and the neighborhoods in between appeared safe to us. Three close eateries we recommend: Key West around the corner;3
Check-in was quick and easy.  The agents at the front desk were very professional and efficient.  The doormen couldâve been a bit more attentive.  Our room was clean, with ample light and a great city view.  The beds however were very firm and not the most comfortable.  The linens were also rough with hardly any fluff or softness.  Finally the hotel operates on a boiler system and our rooms heater was not working properly.  This should definitely be updated and corrected.  If youâre looking for a place to stay in Manhattan that is affordable, clean, with a great location then the Empire Hotel is where you should stay.;3
Very noisy hotel and a nightmare to park, but rooms are ok, bed isn't  as comfortable as Westin but sufficient for sleep. People are nice and helpful.  Overall clean. Towels were old and rough. Skip coffeemaker,  it's awful. Get a good cup somewhere else.;3
Wear your flip flops in the shower. It's a weird feeling to have strange men sharing the bathroom with you.  Great for ppl under 30. I wish they had separate bathrooms.;3
Câmon Universal Studios. It took me an arm and a leg to buy my tickets and then I stood in line for over 2 1/2 hours for less than 5 minutes of fun - Really!!! This is what my $619 gets me these days? So disappointed :(  If you can, avoid parking at their lot because it is expensive @ $25 for the day. Metro can drop you off right at the bottom of the hill and Uber/Lyft can drop you off at the front gate to avoid paying for parking. Donât misunderstand me, our kids did enjoy their day trip to Universal, we just didnât like having to wait in line all day long for 5<min.;3
Got to the hotel and there was no one on reception.  The security  bloke called someone in the back room and a lady came out  after a few minutes but did not seem at all bothered and not very friendly.  Checked in ok and went upto room.  There are 3 lifts (elevators !) but are very slow.   Room was decent enough, double bed, fridge (which was a little noisy), ensuite, tv, desk, wardrobe with safe.  Didn't hear much noise from the other people in the hotel.  The location could not be better, a few shops (small supermarket and subway (sandwiches)) and the subway are just round the corner.  Easily walk to Central Park from the hotel.  On the last day we were able to leave our luggage in reception (locked up)  and the porter who did this was friendly enough.  Can recommend the city;3
Nice looking room and common areas. Great location for LAX connections. The food service in the bar was horrid. Slow and slower - and the bar was only half full. One of the burgers was completely botched. Requested items not delivered to room. Broken hand held shower.;3
Best thing about this hotel is the location.  You are yards away from the subway station entrance and only 10 minutes to Time Square.  The staff was friendly and room was clean.  This is a room you would pay $50 a night for at a turnpike exit.  Neighborhood was very nice.  Definetely felt safe here.  Biggest complaint was that the windows were covered only with cheap plastic blinds so even in the middle of the night the street lights made it seem like daytime and there was no barrier to the street noise.  The TV was an old big box that only got 10 channels.  Old time elevators, but good old building with good noise barrier to other rooms.  Our room was right behind the elevator and we didn't hear a thing (except everything going on outside).  There is a cafe right across the;3
The hotel is in a great location and that is probably the only good thing that I would highlight about this room.   I was visiting New York this past winter and decided to stay at the Empire Hotel. The hotel itself isn't very big but not small either. The rooms were really cramped and very outdated. The heater barely worked and I couldn't regulate the room temperature. I had to have the heater on but the window open as well to get some sort of a balance. The hallways were also very outdated and old. All in all the hotel was in a really good location but for the price that they are charging I would not stay there again. If you shop around a bit you will definitely find newer hotels for around the same price.;3
first time doing a review here goes . good points ,great location,friendly staff,great roof top bar and pool.bad points small bedrooms ,ridiculously tiny bathroom,drinks expensive even for new york, decor dark brown unless you are used to living in a cave you will struggle to see . even though we had a great 4 days  i would not recomend this hotel .oh one more thing be wary of the people selling tickets outside the empire state building dont buy a vip ticket they  say you  will wait one and half hours a lie buy ordinary tickets.;3
A very well located hotel, clean, with friendly helpful staff. It's starting to show its age in places and a refurb would be welcome. However, it is clean and housekeeping good. A great location just off Columbus Circle and the No1 subway line. We would stay again.;3
We booked this hotel because it said it had a pool, but itâs just a glorified plunge pool. The room was small and the bathroom was awkward, no door on the shower, so there was always a lake on the floor to mop up and you had to bend around the corner of a wall to use the sink. The wifi was intermittent, so choose somewhere else if you need reliable internet for business purposes. Street noise is not dampened at all by the windows and the Mount Sinai sirens were pretty constant. It is close to shopping and Central Park, though. The rooftop lounge is a nice touch.;3
Arrived at The New Yorker Hotel and I am very disappointed so far.  Staff at front desk, not exactly welcoming or even helpful, a touch rude to be honest.   Once arrived told we have to pay an extra fee for the honour of using the WiFi, phone calls and gym, none of which we need but not optional.  I wouldn't class this hotel as spotless in anyway, it's quite dated, shabby to say the least in many areas and as for the room, Queen with a view, don't bother.  No coffee machine, no fridge unless you want to pay an extra 65 dollars a day.   Let's see how the rest of the week  goes.;3
"This was our second time staying at this property and this time were were extremely disappointed. We paid extra for a ""courtyard view"" which turned out to be a view of the concrete building next to us. (Photo included in this review)   Our room was at the end of a hallway that was so dark we had to use the flashlight on our phones to go down it and to hold over the lock so we could open the door.    The bathroom was a complete joke. Extremely poorly designed. The toilet faced a wall, in order to sit on it you had to sit awkwardly. No one over 5 feet would be able to sit at it straight on. There was no shower door. Literally. There was a joke of a glass panel that covered the back half of the bathtub, so when the shower was running the water sprayed all over the floor.  The sink";3
Toilet in room was running and a maintenance man had to come change the inside of the toilet at 10:30pm. Walls were thin and I could here the people in the next room having sex. Maybe that is normal ???;3
We stayed at the New Yorker mid February being a family of 4. Ill give an honest review Im a UK travel agent so I'm used to reviewing and staying in many hotels. I had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when I booked  Firstly the good, the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere. Thats about it as far as the positive, the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update. i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room. This room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed. With another 47 dollars a night resort fees;3
Very central and across from madison square gardens, tic tic dinner which has a entrance from lobby was great for breakfast, and staff very warm and friendly. Room we were in was small but was ok , very retro but all mod cons were there.;3
Ariana at the front desk had a very poor attitude.  She would not listen to me or answer my question, so I had to call my travel company to find my answer.  The other staff were lovely and helpful.  Ariana is the one bad apple in my entire experience at the New Yorker Hotel.  (also could have used a coffee pot in my room);3
This is a good, basic hotel with a great location. I'd normally rate this as a great budget find, but unfortunately I can't give it a good review because of the customer service. The door to my hotel room was left visibly open for about 12 hours after it was cleaned until I returned. Not very comforting to happen in any big city...The room was in front of the elevators, so it was easy to see the door was ajar and open. Anyone could have walked in. When I mentioned this to the manager, she politely acknowledged that it shouldn't have happened, but didn't go out of her way to take my concern seriously, compensate for it, or give me any reason feel inclined to be a return client...all that was offered was a breakfast voucher for an underwhelming cereal spread. There are lots of;3
"The rooms and bathrooms in this botique hotel are TINY. First off, the good stuff... The AC worked great. Although we did not take advantage of the honor bar, it had a number of non-food items that were ""interesting"". The linens and towels were clean and the lobby was pretty. The location is ideal and is right outside the Lincoln Center and about two blocks from Central Park.  The only parking at the hotel is a $60 per day valet. EEK! There a numerous parking garages nearby, but they run about $40 a night (plus tips). If you are patient, and start well before the Lincoln Center Crowd starts parking around 6:30, you can find an on-street spot if you are willing to walk quite a few blocks. Be careful though... Make sure that the street sweeper will not be cleaning in the morning";3
Small room but big enough for the two of us, we were only there to sleep and change to go back out in the evening.  Fresh towels every day, some traffic noise from the next street over but not awful - didn't disturb our sleep.  Hotel staff helpful, some more confident speaking English than others but we didn't need to ask for much.  Organised our taxi to JFK on last day and gave us a room to store our bags and get changed before leaving.  Fab location, bit of a culture shock first day (but we were tired too!) felt like a safe area and subway station less than a block.  Nice little shop on the corner so handy to buy soft drinks.  Walk through Chinatown & Little Italy for Broadway, Soho, Financial District etc.  East Village in the other direction.  Very handy and would recommend;3
I am not sure how to tell you something about this hotel. Location is superb, on top a hill just before Universal City entrance, very close to Universal Studios but nothing else. If you want to see downtown LA, Hollywood, other places and add a Universal Studio tour, just stay in the city. Take the red line to Universal City metro station then there are shuttle trams to take you to the top of the hill.  The building is old and not very well maintained. In our first room, the air conditioner was very noisy, so I shut it down, but the noise continued to reach us from the next room which uses the same ventilation shaft. There was a continuous humming sound all night.  In the bathroom, my wife and I heard a water dripping sound but after checking all the taps we could not find the;3
The Empire hotel really needs some TLC.  The room we were in was very clean, but pretty decrepit: peeling wallpaper, smudges on the curtains, an uneven blind on the window, heavy, cracked paint around the bathroom door.  My sister had stayed there previously and said her room was in better shape.  I will say that the bed was excellent and there was a nice variety of pillows.  The staff responded quickly to a problem with a running toilet.  But on the whole, this place is due for an overhaul.;3
A lot of my coworkers hated their rooms but I liked mine, it's really small, but it's Manhattan Iâve stayed in smaller rooms in New York. The mini bar prices are just ridiculousâ¦$3 for per tasteless Keurig, $11 for a bottle of water, $72 for a bottle of cheap wine and so on.  Tip: Thereâs a Starbucks next door.  I got stuck with a room next to the elevator but it was still dead quite. The service was nice, the sheets were soft, the bed was comfortable and room was clean. The rooms were dimly lit and everything felt dark in an old-hard wood kind of way.  The pool deck was closed for the season still, but looked nice, we made it up to the rooftop bar, but it was very later-20s-college-clubby.  This is definitely a business hotel, and I was there on business, so I didn't think it;3
We stayed here for a week, the staff when we checked in were very unfriendly and were almost to the point of being rude.  And during our stay very unhelpful.  And the hotel parking is expensive.  The neighborhood is not the best and I wouldn't be walking around there at night.  There is not much in the way of restaurants, but there is a lot of restaurant that deliver and they have their menus is the rooms.    But on the plus side, our room was great, big and airy over looking the pool complex.  It was clean and tidy.  It was quiet except for Saturday night.  There is a free breakfast very morning with a chef and this is well worth it.  There is also a very small bar which is not open very often.;3
I stayed at the Abercorn House on two non-consecutive nights in October for a single room with shared showers. The rooms i got looked very clean and there were towels, soap, shampoo and toilet paper. The first night i stayed in room 219. it was a bit noisy at night with doors slamming and some loud noise. Right outside the window was the window of the kitchen. The lights in there wouldn't turn off so there was some light peaking into the room. The second night i was put in room 217, a double room (just for me of course). It was clean but i saw a small cockroach, it wasn't noisy like 219, though. I stayed on the second floor and there are multiple showers, kitchens and toilets. It's close to Hammersmith station, which has a lot of shops, and fairly close to Westfield shopping;3
Truth be told I had a great time, right up until I checked out when I received a bill that included a US$29 per day 'facilities charge'. I queried it because relative to my daily room rate it was an extra 15% per day, which is not insignificant. Apparently this 'facilities charge' was for the use of wifi and the gym - whether I actually used it or not. It's not the amount involved that I am concerned over, it is that by deliberately not including this 'facilities charge' upfront in the published room rate I believe to be false advertising. While I did have a lovely stay at this hotel, this experience made me depart with a bad taste in the mouth and unlikely to return.;3
We stayed at this hotel in Jan 12 , service was good but rooms slighty smaller than average and had issue with the smelly toilet and constant sound of garbage collecting was unbearable . Apart from that great location close to central park and ballet theatre .;3
great location - tiny room-s tick tock restuarant  poor food and cold to table---lobby very busy and small  --not enough desk staff---  but very  easy acess to subways and times square--and shopping and good places to eat;3
Clean but not much service, took forever to have a clean room in the morning, location is great but I would not stay in the Astor again, 120$ per night is way overpriced, the only thing I could say is that it was nothing more than 'ok';3
We stayed 5 nights, arrived with some apprehension after reading such mixed revues. Basic room, clean, fresh towels and linens. Close to subways, so easy access to all sights. Staff friendly and helpful. Our 6th visit to New York, this was an expensive time, couldn't find much under Â£200 per night. You definately get what you pay for, in this case a, basic clean small rooms. But who wants to spend to time in a hotel room or to breakfast there, when there is so much to see and do, so many places to eat. Subway gave us quick access to Amy Ruths, good harlem restaurant, Abyssinian Baptist Church, Columbus Circle, Times Square, Moma, and a walk across Central Park to the Met Museum. Go with an open mind, it's the Astor not the Astoria!!!;3
It was in upgrade mode when we were there in late april. Tv was old with only 2 or 3 channels that were clear. Shower and heater worked. The elevator on the same side as the front desk gives the feeling of your stomach going through the floors as it jolts to each floor;3
Very small closet with no space for women's dresses or coats. Very noisy room with outdoor air conditioners. Also view brick wall. Sink was stopped up and when I reported it I was asked three times for my room number. Location is great but price very high.;3
Hotel is run down and needs renovation.  Also, they cannot accommodate a feather allergy. We were told at the front desk that this 40-floor hotel has never encountered someone with a feather allergy and could not provide feather-free bedding. Feather-free room is a standard checkbox and in my customer profile as a request at both Hilton and Marriott hotels, but apparently the Wyndham has never heard of such a thing. Front desk staff did commit to sending housekeeping up in the afternoon to try to see what they could do, but they never showed.  Superior customer care could have overcome the tiny room with the rundown bathroom, but it was not to be.;3
I wanted to buy some photographic items from B&H and it is close to this hotel.Although room facilities are minimal for short period of stay , location is good .Room space is not enough for two people .;3
All that was good about the hotel is the location. Constant waiting for elevators, no personal attention (well I understand a huge hotel), really small room. I have been to many other hotels with the same room type, but I have never been to such a small one. Room cleanliness is sufficient, but for two people one vial of shampoo and soap? A restaurant adjacent to the place, did not give priority to hotel guests, also brought in from the street as a regular. Luggage storage at extra charge also for hotel guests, it has always been part of the hotel's service, but probably not here. I chose this hotel because it is part of the history of New York but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations;3
"Best thing about The Jane is its location: just under 10 minutes walk from Chelsea Market and bit over 10 minutes to the 14th St ACE subway lines. The rooms are indeed very small (40-50 sq feet--the size of my bathroom at home) but not cramped or claustrophobic. I requested and received a quiet room that had a single twin and was close to the shared bathroom, which was very clean. A bathrobe and slippers were provided but far too small for me to wear. Just there for an overnight, so no complaints; however, for longer stays in the future, I will return to my favorite guesthouse in Harlem for half the Jane's price.";3
I got the trip to NY in a promotion, and I only had 24 hours to confirm it. At first I didn't even look for the hotel, i only saw his location and it was great (as long is in Manhattan...)  Then when I started to prepare the trip,  I look t the reviews of trip advisor, an  admit I was a little bit scared and  afraid of the hotel, but I can ensure that it was just fine.. The beds was really confortable and clean. We got so tired after a long day exploring NY that we didn't even listen the sound of the streets... And lets be honest, who goes to NY to stay in the hotel?? In the end of the day, I just wanted a confortable  bed and a hot shower, and that's what I got.   By the price you pay, is really great...Is a 2 star hotel, so don't think your getting a Hilton Hotel treat.. So if;3
The hotel has great location, next to Central Park, metro station is 5 min walking. The rooms are small and very basic. After reading some reviews I realized that our room was one of the worse (211) and actually one of the smallest, but since we were busy with exploring NYC we never asked to change. the problem was that we were staying in February and it was really freezing, and the rooms were not ready for such cold. It was deadly cold, and only hot shower was saving us. Though, it is worth to mention that the stuff was trying to help as much as they could in those extreme temperatures (-18 and so on) and provided us with heater. But the windows are just an entrance for all the wind and cold. The room is so small that you cant be anywhere away from the window and in anyway you;3
Great location on Broadway in the center of Manhattan. Place to sleep and rest and go on the town.;3
Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights after a week at Iceland. When we got there after our long trip at 8pm they advised us that our room wasnât ready and we had to stay in a different room without a view that we requested. To make up for this to be fair to them they gave us free breakfast vouchers for the next morning. The next two nights we were given a room with a fantastic view of the Empire State. The only drawback I would say is the rooms could have been cleaned better as there was a lot of dust in the bathroom.;3
This hotel is expensive because of its central location, right across from Lincoln Center. The first night 3 of 4 elevators were out. The battery for my remote died and I couldn't get the coffee maker to work. Moore's was a rather pricey breakfast spot, but the personnel were polite and served quickly. I had to cancel one night and they did not charge for the missed night. My room was quite small, especially for two people, but it was quiet.;3
The rooms are really small, the temperature control is dicey and the lobby is very dark.  However, you cannot beat the location if you are going to Lincoln Center, it is literally across the street.  Location, location, location;3
We picked the New Yorker based on the location due to the purpose of our trip (business/sightseeing). We arrived early around 11:30 a.m. coming from Penn Station. Check in was not an option as I had called the night prior and I was told there was a fee if a room was a available (no room available). We were able to do âprecheck inâ which just meant we gave them our credit card and ID and phone number and they would call us when a room became available. We could hold our bags there until then. Here comes another fee $5- per bag to hold our bags. This is another first for us. We have never paid to have our bags held in any hotel weâve stayed at. At that point it was 12 pm and when we returned to the hotel it was around 4:30-5 pm and it was insanity. The hotel never called to let me;3
If it were not for the worst beds known to man, this hotel would receive a 5 star easily.  We were checked in and out by Majid, who was the best first impression any hotel could get. Majid was customer service personified. He did everything allowable to support a family with two small children.   We have been coming to New York City for 15 years. This month, I decided to quit my job and could no longer stay at our normal hotels. If not for the beds, this would have been a low cost option. Perfect location to Central Park, Times Square, and 5th Avenue Shopping.   Pros:  - Location, Location, Location - around the corner from the Brooklyn Diner, Pazza Notte, the Russian Tea Room, and so close to nearly everything. - Clean-ish - the beds, the sinks, and the tubs were clean. I may;3
As we booked a room for four adults we were shocked at the tiny tiny bathroom....I've been in showers bigger than the whole bathroom so it didn't matter that there was no lock on the door as you could hold the handle while seated on the loo! The check in was fast efficient and friendly. Pool was a bit of a hike...across the car park , but nicely shielded with greenery and lovely loungers with abundant towels to use there. Breakfast was good, nice staff and plenty of choice.....cups were old though and we noticed lots of guests chose to use disposable beakers. Hotel is well located near the Metro for down town or Great Universal Studios. All in all this hotel served our purposes but it does need a facelift and modernisation.;3
The Empire Hotel is a conundrum. On my first stay here in five years or so, first impressions reminded me how much I like the neighborhood (across the street from Lincoln Center), how much the Upper West Side feels like home (it was many decades ago) and what a dearth of good hotels there is up in this part of the city.   The hotel's weird, though, and if I hadn't paid a very reasonable $133 a night (almost unheard of in NYC although there were a few properties advertising in that general range -- typically it would be in the same $200-plus or so per night cost that is more usual for hotels rated with 4 stars), the overall rating would be a 2 1/2.  The conundrum? This is a quirky, older hotel (and I like quirky) where there's been a spotty refurbishment. My room was a;3
This was the second time I stayed here.  First time my room was halfway down a corridor and was at the back of the hotel.  This time I was close to the toilets and over the street and the noise was dramatically different.  Banging doors and traffic kept me awake most of the night.  But.....I had a view of the Statue of Liberty this time round - my only reason for not asking to be moved.  The air con was completely useless, and most of the tv channels had frozen.  Quite cheap for NYC, but not overly impressed this visit.;3
You got exactly what you paid for. The room was cheap so our expectations weren't too high. The location was great, just off Broadway and not more than 2 blocks from the subway or bus. The room was very small and basic but in saying that it was clean. It wouldn't be my first choice for a couples getaway but it was ideal for us as we were going for a night out on the town. Staff were friendly and overall we had a good stay.;3
I didn't expect much.  Near subway and off Broadway.  But hotel was run down even after what looked like an attempt to upgrade.  Bathroom door was falling apart.  Paint was peeling off wall like wallpaper.  Elevator was cramped and dirty.  Dresser looked like a file cabinet.  Overall I won't be back...but you get what you pay for.;3
We have just returned from a wonderful week in New York having booked five rooms for 13 female family members ranging in ages from 23-70.  Initially some of the ladies were allocated rooms on the eight floor and they were in much need of decoration however the rooms were clean, bedding actually looked new with a plentyful supply of towels etc in the bathroom, alarm clock, coffee maker etc. However, on enquiring at the reception desk about refurbished rooms we were moved to the fourth floor it would appear these rooms have been refurbished and were in a better state of decoration.  We had no problems with the lifts, and we found the staff to be friendly and helpful when asked questions.  If your only interested in a clean bed and bathroom and not bothered about hotel facilities;3
It looked like the hotel needs some updating.   You're pretty much paying for the convenience of the location: right by Central Park and the Lincoln center.  At least the mezzanine and the lounge look decent. The rooms? Not so much.;3
This was my forth business trip to NY and I have always stayed the Empire.  My room was on the 4th floor so the street noise was loud and the bathroom was too small to be comfortable.  When I checked out the front desk did not ask me about my visit.  Interesting....maybe they knew based on my room assignment they were going to get negative feedback.;3
The best thing about the Empire is its location: close to restaurants, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and theater district. The hotel is old, bathrooms are very small and inconvenient.  Do not take a room with a view of the courtyard.;3
It's hard to write a review on property that is set in a very over priced city.   Here's all the postives: The room was clean and housekeeping was very timely. Very dog friendly. I was there for the Westminster Dog Show and it was quite convenient. Location was very good for all the touristy things as well. We could walk to many iconic sites. Check in and check out very easy.  Now for the negatives:  Even though I'm trying not to let price affect my feelings about the place it does play a part. As the rooms are  super tiny. Not much bigger than a nice size walk in closet. TV channels not working and would go in and out, not that I was watching much tv, but it's nice at the end of a busy day to watch a show.   If I'd pay $100/night it would get a 4 or 5 star but paying over;3
"We stayed at the hotel for 4 days in Sept of 2006 and the stay was ""ok"" but I guess ""good"" for the price.  We paid close to 300 per night.  Plus the hotel is located 3 - 4 subway stops from Times Square.  The staff was nice, the rooms were as clean as they could be.  The hotel is old and dingy but if you have a full schedule it probably would not matter.  I  would not stay at the hotel again because there were some nicer hotels that averaged about 300 per night.  So the extra 19 or so dollars would have been worth it.";3
The room was so small, one of us had to leave the room and close the door so the other person could get out. The staff was wonderful, and we felt very safe. I expected it to be a smaller room since the hotel is so antiquated, but we could barely move in the room.;3
IT was a top Location, but the room was really small. And I booked and afterwards had to pay an extra of 20 usd per night, this is beside the tax. They could have communicated that better I think. It said city view and it was not.;3
Iâm fairly sensitive to mold and felt a wave of gross as soon as I walked in. Itâs technically clean, so housekeeping is doing great- but if youâre also mold sensitive, itâs probably a place youâd like to skip- itâs in the walls. Additionally, the reviews imply the rooms are reasonably spacious for nyc standards, and the room I was given was definitely not.;3
We spent 3 nights at this hotel in June 09. The rooms were spatious and clean, but are not well isolated. You could hear people running and talking loudly in the hall at night. The hotel area is not optimal, but it's a central location to do all your excursions by car. Complimentary breakfast. Staff was friendly, except for the guest manager Natalya X who seemed to be very annoyed when we turned to her for the check out. Complimentary wifi access. Overall: Ok price/quality.;3
Stayed here for two nights.   Positives - great location  - reception and door staff were great  - rooms were nicely decorated  - great bathroom   Negatives  - sheets weren't clean as shown in the pics (arrived late so just wanted to sleep). They changed the next day and they were then clean.  - wifi (they charge a day rate) but the signal was pretty rubbish;3
Location was excellent. Love that it is smoke-free. Walking distance to Metro and convenient drive to beaches, downtown,  Griffith Observatory, Beverly Hills, Burbank, etc. Microwave and fridg a plus. Balcony view nice from 3rd floor. Staff very helpful. Nancy, at the front desk, went above and beyond from reservation time and questions before arrival, through the entire stay (Felt like I knew her when we arrived!). The made-to-order hot breakfasts were excellent with generous hours and Hugo (absolutely terrific) and Sonia providing quality, friendly service. Anabol (?spelling) evening serviceperson was also extremely personable and helpful, but herein lies the problem in needing him to come up two nights. I would rate housekeeping extremely poor. Sticky stuff on nightstand,;3
Small room- of course in NYC! The bathroom was tiny and a outdated- no way to turn on the shower without getting wet, and the room worn and even a bit dirty feeling. The best parts were the lobby and bar- they were nice and staff almost friendly. Better than a typical low end chain, more charm, about $350 a night.;3
The general manager has since contacted me, apologized, credited back the charge for the mini bar and my overdraft fees and offered special rates, upgrade to a suite and free Drinks and breakfast should we decided to come back again.  This manager was very nice and accommodating and I am going to make plans to stay there for my anniversary and give them another shot.  I am keeping the original post from my review because it should not have taken up hours of my time wrangling with the shift manager.  However I did upgrade from 2 stars to 3.  This is what I emailed to the Manager and posted as part of my original review:  I am writing in reference to the stay my wife and I had in your hotel this past week.  We enjoyed the physical hotel very much but had a number of interactions;3
From the moment we arrived we were greeting by a rude member of staff from Valet. If it was not so late and having a tired 3 year old I would have gone to another hotel just from that first experience.   However when we went inside we were greeted by the lady behind the desk who booked us into the hotel. We then went and sorted our bags out and headed to the lift. WELL... they have 6 lifts which only 1 works at a time. We were waiting for 5 minutes for a lift they are so painfully slow!  The room was nice enough but after being at 8 hotels already I feel that the Hilton was no where near satisfactory.  The hotel is in a great location if you are visiting Universal Studios and City Walk has a many restaurants to choose from. We only found out about the City Walk the day after we;3
Me and my wife stayed at empire hotel for a week. Despite the helpful Mr. Ze, we had problems with key room and air conditioner. Room was a little tight also. And no hotel should charge for wifi....But it was a good experience in general. Finally the location is very good.;3
We booked this hotel because we wanted a boutique hotel WITH a pool.  Location is great - close to central park, in a lovely area of upper west side right beside the Lincoln centre......but after we checked in and put our swimsuits on and rushed up to pool deck, we were greeted with POOL CLOSED signs.  When we called front desk to inquire, we were told the pool did not pass a 'test' and was closed indefinitely.  We were not told about this at check in and had FOUR children with us for four days in NYC.  The hotel itself is tired/run down and in need of upkeep/maintenance.  Staff are not very friendly (with the exception of Asst. Director and Director who resolved my complaints about the pool closure).  I would not recommend this hotel over other boutique hotels in NYC.  No free;3
New York hotels are a different ball game. You pay more and get less. Bearing that in mind, the Dayâs Hotel isnât such a bad option. Sure, the rooms are shabby and dated, the Internet doesnât seem to connect, and the âfitness centreâ consists of a single exercise bike, and the TVâs are from the 1980âs. But for the price itâs not too bad.  Here you are in the heart of the Upper West Side, a local area with plenty of good shops, restaurants and bars. While the hotel will be full of tourists, this is not a tourist area. Youâre a ten minute walk from Central Park, five minutes from Riverside Park, and the 2 and 3 trains will whisk you to Times Square in less than ten minutes (the hotel is right beside the subway station)  When we stayed in Feb 2015 the hotelâs exterior was being;3
"the hotel is as you would expect for a central Nyc hotel . The corridors are like rabbit warrens and the rooms vary in size and noise level . My room was defiantly ""compact"" and a little worn ( especially the bath room) that said , it was comfortable and very peaceful which is a huge bonus in NYC . The tic toc diner in the lobby is 24 hours and is fairly decent . There are pletly of places close by to eat ,drink and shop . And it's a stones throw from Madison Sq gdns .   Overall I would say it's a fairly good choice to use as a base . If you are looking for luxury then this isn't the place for you .";3
Not a bad hotel per se, but you'll have to pay extra for everything - eg making a coffee in your room is $3. And as for wifi - thats $12.95 for 24 hours in room which is bad enough on its own, but that is only for one device ! You are offered free wifi in the (chilly) lobby, but that was hopeless - taking ages to get a connection which then dropped off after a few minutes.;3
Amazing  location and aspiration to be a beautiful boutique with animal print chairs, big beds and fluffy towels. But avoid top floors due to noise from night club - unless you are a clubber - and expect faded glory, tiny bathrooms and long lift queues. Best if you want some atmosphere of bohemian NY, and aren't worried about quality!;3
The hotel is not useable until the elevators are fixed.  We had a good room, but it was on the 10th floor.  Good view, but Room too high--noise from roof bar.  Wardrobe in room is only half height--not useable to hang coats, dresses, or trousers.  Shower drenches bathroom,  part of the controls and shelves in bathroom are too high for a short woman.  BAD DESIGN.;3
Arrived on 5th Feb and the lock was dodgy on my room so the porter asked the receptionist to get me another room. She sorted this out after 20mins and I was given 805. The room was very clean, although the tv didnt really work and there was no view to speak of, although neither of those bothered me. Whe I headed out, I was shown directions for the shower and told how to get to the metro. The room was cleaned and towels changed every day - only thing was maids didnt lock the room after they had been in. It was noisy from about 7am due to the plumbing but I had taken earplugs as where I come from is the middle of nowhere with no noise 24/7. I was glad I took themthough. Didnt get hassled to book anything through them - I was there on my own and was out early each day for at least;3
Location is all Empire has going for it. The rooms are very small, bathroom very basic and cramped, and ACs are super loud! Defitnitely not great value for money! The rooftop has a very cool view though.;3
Check in problems with no fee card. Had to use mastercard incurring conversion fee. Charges were confusing as they were charged, refunded and charged again. Hotel and service was fine but a little noisy even from floor 24. Overall ok;3
Good hotel, rooms are very small and shower is hard to operate. Water was never really hot no matter how long you waited for it. Good location, very close to everything so I would recommend from a location standpoint. No free wifi in rooms...air conditioner was good but effective. Bathroom very small.;3
Just returned from a girls weekend at The New Yorker. We stayed in a double executive suite with pull out couch(one bathroom) The room for 6 is quite small, however it was duable. The location of the hotel is great and convenient - overall the stay was okay. The hotel was clean and a bit dated. The staff was helpful- I would probably choose a boutique hotel for our next stay.;3
The hotel was clean and the breakfast was good. The hotel has a gym and a pool but a little dated. It is not in the safest of areas. We were charged for Parking even though we had paid Expedia. When we contact Expedia by e-mail , they have not bothered to e-mail back to us. I tried calling them but no joy. I suppose they took our money. Wont be booking with them again. If you have a car , it is safe but do not venture out after 9 as while we were there, there was a shooting and a fire near by.;3
I took a room with my boy and I can say...really not bad! Even if it was Just for one night , we even did a shower and find an aazing woman who gave us shampoo and stuff :) comprare to other hostels  where I ve been its a.good.one;3
I wasn't surprised by the small rooms. The Jane doesn't pretend to be something it's not. I've stayed in other shared bathroom places, and this was by far the best. I wasn't all that happy that the shared bath is co-ed, but it was clean, and the showers were quite fine. There were a few seedy looking characters around the hallways, but not a deal. The staff was over the top friendly - from check in, to the bellboys, the woman cleaning the bathroom on Sunday, and the elevator operators. The restaurant was crowded but fun on Sunday morning. Don't plan on a 5 star you'll get pampered place. It's on the cheap, but a good place to sleep.;3
The room was nicely furnished with new carpet and newish bathroom. The AC worked very well and the view was nice - with a little parkette across the street. BUT we found 2 cockroaches in the bathtub one morning. The hotel staff were VERY nice and allowed us an early check-in. I parked my car on Broome St. for the weekend without getting a ticket ! You really get what you pay for with this hotel. It's very standard and the rooms are by no means big. So if you're an older couple or picky - shell out the extra dough for a nicer place. If you're a student or not very picky - totally go for it. I've spent more for worse places.;3
"The hotel overall is good value and generally OK. Its main advantage is the good location on the Upper West Side at a very good price compared to more central hotels in Manhattan. Just around the corner from the hotel is a Subway station for quick access on the 1/2/3 line downtown. There is also a pharmacy just outside, a diner round the corner, deli across the road, Starbucks + bank across the road etc. The hotel itself is fairly dated. Elevators are terrible and you can wait for ages for one. Free Wi-Fi is not actually accessible in the rooms like advertised, but it works in the lobby and there is also a ""business centre"" with 3 computers and printer which is reasonably priced for checking anything quick. The room was actually quite spacious for a New York hotel. It was clean";3
Just returned from 2 nights at the Morningside. The room was very clean. We had a triple room, (one double bed and one single) with private bath. The room had a clean working refrigerator and a window which opened. The hotel staff were helpful and polite. We were not able to get extra pillows- one was provided per person. Although the shower water was not cold-  it was never hot enough for us. The room lock was keyed and no dead bolts, chains, or other security features were provided. We added a chair next to the door at night.  All in all we were very pleased with the Morningside. Our room cost $88 per night. We were able to spend more money in NYC with the money we saved by staying in this  hotel. Don't stay here if you want luxury. If you want a back to basic place to lay;3
Spent the weekend here  I cant think of a better location than this, walking distance to Central Park, multiple subway stations, and Times Square. The service was good, personnel always friendly and helpful if something needed However, the rooms are missing maintenance, and some basic details are very visible;3
I was a bit concerned when I read the reviews, but the room was clean and tidy, as was the bathroom, plenty of hot water... The bed was comfortable and clean The staff where very helpful, it was very warm at night.  It could do with a paint and refurb, this said... on Monday ( 30th Nov '16 ) there where work men taking up tiles etc for a refurb... btw not a bug in sight... the subway is on the next block, there is a little deli, does not look great, but bagels and coffee are great... the area was quiet, across the road is  Central Park...we also could leave the cases, after check out.. which was 12-00 mid day...;3
Everything was good and in safe and quite area. It was close to businesses and stores where to buy food. Also, close subway stations. The TV signal was not very good, the doors where loud and other people were not very quite when closing the door.;3
The hotel and room met my needs and fit nicely into my limited budget. The staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was clean. Could use some sprucinging up though such as some paint and new lamp shades.;3
We arrived early and left our luggage with a friendly receptionist, think the name was Jaz. Used the guest restroom wich was filthy, should really clean that more often since it was our first impression of the hotel. The room was very small but alright. The doorhandle to the bathroom almost came off, doesnt the cleningstaff notice such things? The walls in the room could need some paint but I understand Itâs a busy hotel. Very good location near times square and central park. When We checked out the receptionist did not Ask how our stay had been or anything else, almost not even a goodbye. All together an alright stay and you really visit NY for the atmosphere, maybe not the hotel. But some small improvments would have resulted in a better review from me.;3
Let's just say that you do not stay here for luxury, but if you want a not-too-shabby room at a cheap price and a great location, this is it. The beds were small and the shower dripped, the room overall had an old, depressing feel. But do you come to the city to enjoy your hotel room? If yes, this is not for you.  For me and my friends who stayed here, the A/C was adequate and easy access to the subway made it a good place to stay.;3
I stayed here with my girlfriend, at first we were very disappointed with our room on the 5th floor. The air con wasn't working properly this led to a very uncomfortable couple of nights with no response regarding our issues from the usual day time staff, until we met Rudi who at midnight was helpful enough to get us a new room, which was an upgrade. The second room was excellent with a good view and two air conditioning units in case we had the same problem.  We went to Ed's chowder house for one breakfast and one lunch, the staff were the same both times, there was plenty of staff but they just sat there watching us forgetting parts of our order , which was worrying. The food was good though and the drinks menu was very impressive .  The internet situation at the empire is;3
I stayed there at the first week of October and I can say it is a good hotel for sleeping after a day of strolling around the city. Beds are comfortable and staff from the front desk is very polite (Nancy is adorable). The rest is pretty much average, nothing special: few breakfast option, cleanness ok, location ok. There is a swimming pool, which is nice but thatâs it. Even though it is expensive, it is the best you can get in LA;3
Old and getting older. Great location next to the MET. ( This is getting comical, I have said what I wanted but it is not 200 characters so that leads me to rant about discrimination against people who have difficulties with written language );3
We were visiting Universal Studio for 3 days so stayed at this location. We picked out a room through their online check-in process but was disapointed that they assigned it to someone else when we arrived ( Not sure the whole point of online check-in). The room were spacious and clean. It had large bay windows over looking nice views. Breakfast and Dinner was pricely like most hilton locations. Valet service and room service was prompt. Universal shuttle stopped at this location and Sheraton almost 15 minutes which was very convenient. Overall a great location but average service.;3
We stayed for three nights family of four with two teenagers. Check-in was easy and straight forward, we had both rooms on the same floor as we had requested. Having heard about the limited size of New York hotel rooms our rooms were fine, you could walk around both sides of the bed! The room was clean and tidy although the decor is looking tired, there was no kettle in the room to make a cup of tea only a coffee maker which is very annoying when neither of us drink coffee. We turned the air conditioner off at night as it was so noisy we couldn't sleep with it on. We used the roof top pool once early evening after a hot day sightseeing, it is very small and very cold but a welcome opportunity to cool off before going out for the evening. The lobby flooring was being replaced;3
Cost was high compared to this hotel chain at other locations. Did not use any of the facilities services, so I cannot comment on them. Charge for parking was reasonable compared to that which the park charges.;3
The welcome by the doormen and reception was friendly. The room was prepaid therefore check in was quick and easy (we managed to check in earlier than 3pm as well).  The hotel is well kept and looks nice in the lobby and mezzanine area.   The room was quite small but we paid a budget price for this so budget can be expected. The air con/heating was quite loud but did the job. The room offered complimentary water each day (300mls) but not to be confused with the 500mls size which will cost you $5 per bottle.  There is a safe in the room which is easy to use. There is a hairdryer and also the hotel provides soap and other basic toiletries.  There was a coffee and milk set available but confusing as the whether or not this was included or an extra charge.  The bed was quite firm.;3
We arrived very tired after driving from San Diego after taking a Cruise. Chap on front desk was very nice and gave us a large room on fifth floor near the rear elevators. On a busy street but we walked up a ways and got a sub sanwich to bring back to our room. No problem , there is a childrens hospital almost next door. Took a tour the next afternoon ,arranged by front desk, worth the money. Breakfasts were great and there is a Wendys near by. Pool was very nice. Only slight complaint,sometimes funny smell om first floor near the rear.;3
Lets start with the pros!  .strong air conditioner  .comfortable huge bed .clean room and clean linen .iron,coffee maker and safe  Cons  .cable channels suck! Like it gives you a booklet with all the channels arranged by number yet non of the channels match and it has less channels then the book...i take passion in this do to the fact that ima huge tv watcher so yea disappointment  Another con is no microwave or fridge...im not expecting to stay in the trump tower with a stove and couch but those simple items would have went along way  Not the worst hotel ive stayed in but would stay again  Fyi - i recommended the Manhattan diner if your hungry they food is nothing short of amazing and the red velvet cake is to die for!;3
I have stayed three times at this hotel, which is due to the combination of excellent location, great breakfast, style of the hotel, and price. I recommend everyone to have a look at the reviews, as it appears that the level of service (and the rooms, etc.) varies quite a lot. In my case, the staff has corrected all problems that have occurred. I dislike the fact that they charge for everything extra, but on the other hand I think for this level hotel the price is decent. For me the location close to the Lincoln Center was essential, and with that criterion, Empire hotel is hard to beat.;3
"The room was tiny, but I knew that already. The hotel was quite good for it's price, and the decoration was quite charming. The shared bathroom was always clean. The only problem with it was that in the mornings there was too many people using the sinks/mirror area, and being subjected to unpleasant views, like and old man in his underwear with his robe open leaving the bathroom. Also, the room was noisier than I expected; I could always hear people entering/leaving their rooms and the cars on the avenue beside the hotel.";3
The location is great, staff were friendly but the hotel itself was unimpressive. I found the decor dark and dreary and the rooms were very depressing. I was appalled that the beds were not made properly for a hotel....not a mattress cover and one flat sheet used covering the mattress....first time I ever saw that done. We complained and they sent up 2 sheets for the 2 double beds and we fixed them ourselves...weird! It turned out that there were no more problems than that but thought the bed making improper. I like to feel that hotels take extra precautions such as mattress covers and proper sheets from one guest to the next. One and only time we stayed there. Still surprises me that this hotel gets a 4 star rating.....must be the nightclub.;3
We stayed here twice going to and from a trip to Asia.  The shuttles are fine enough. The hotel is great looking being newly renovated.  Rooms are very comfortable.  The restaurant has good enough food but one can go out quite easily using Uber. The issue I had on both occasions is with the front desk.  They have a 'no can do' attitude to the point of double charging me for a room as we didn't check into our already paid for room until the morning so they charged me for it again. We were flying in from China.  They're an airport hotel.  They should get the concept of irregular time schedules.  When we checked out the next day at 4:30 AM (to catch a plane) they couldn't give me the bill because they were running their days billing.I didn't discover the double charge until I got;3
The location being directly opposite Penn Station made this hotel worthwhile! The rooms are very small but liveable for the five nights we were there although the bathroom was so awkwardly small. Staff were friendly and helpful however when we checked out I realised I had left something valuable in the room and when we returned they said it was not there! The hotel did not have tea/coffee facilities for the mornings but luckily there was subway opposite. The walls were literally wafer thin so the noises from the room next door and outside were pretty loud especially the sirens from outside.;3
This is a recently-renovated budget hotel in a commercial area of Hollywood near the Metro. Breakfast is great.  If you don't mind waiting a few minutes you can get eggs, omelets and waffles cooked to order. If you're in a hurry, there are cereals, variety of breads, and sausages that are self-serve.  Coffee, tea, milk of course.  Breakfast is served from 6:30 to 10:30.  The breakfast room is large and nicely decorated.  The rooms are plain but clean and spacious. Flat screen TV. Microwave.  Small refrigerator.  Table and two chairs, plus a comfortable armchair near the bed.  New high-end mattress and duvet. Our bathroom was small and had a stall shower (no tub), which was fine with us.  Plenty of hot water. Parking is $22/night with tax, gated.;3
We stayed 3 nights with two kids, 11 and 9 years old.  The hotel was fine: clean rooms, quiet, nice bathroom, plenty of hot water, nice pool for the kids, all the essentials.  We stayed there because I wanted to be within walking distance of Universal Studios and Universal City Walk.  I have no serious complaints about the hotel, but convenience to Universal Studios  is the only reason why I would stay there again.  The beds are small (doubles, not queens) and ours were sagging.  There is no shower fan nor can any windows be opened in the room, so by the time the entire family has taken a shower the room has become tropical.  There is no way to air out the room.  Internet was not included with the room fee even for a Hilton Honors member.  The cost of breakfast at the hotel was;3
We stayed here for two nights before a cruise and was very disappointed. We regularly stay at a Wyndham hotel in Florida so expected this one to be good. The reception was bright and airy but the room we were given was small and cramped. The wallpaper was coming away from the wall,we reported it as soon as we saw it but nothing was done. The plumbing in the bathroom looked like it was original and very shabby. The shower was a nightmare but that was due to the very old plumbing. It was not what I would expect from a Wyndham hotel and it cast a shadow on our first visit to NewYork.;3
I had a room that was combined from two smaller room into one. By NYC standards it was large, prior to the merger they must have been two phone booths. It was an older room but still in the Art Deco style that dominates the lobby of the hotel.   Overall it was clean, slightly run down but an enjoyable change from the normal corporate hotels I normally stay in. I'd go back when the price was right.;3
It is only about location. Not much more to say other than hotel staff were very helpful with logistics for getting around.  Room was very clean.  Continental breakfast was grossly over-priced and very poor.;3
My husband I stayed here a few years ago (2007)â¦Tripadvisor will not let you put the date of stay farther back than 2009.  Anyway, Iâm sure some things might have changed since we were there (it was then a Ramada), but many things in my review are still relevant Iâm sure, such as the location.  We just wanted a decent place to come back to after long days of exploring.  We stayed 8 nights and did a ridiculous amount of activities (Hollywood Blvd, Graumanâs Chinese Theater, Rodeo Drive, went to Marilyn Monroeâs house in Brentwood, Dodgers game, San Diego Padres game, San Diego Zoo, Universal Studios, Disneyland, Coachella Festival in Indio near Palm Springs, Gwen Stefani show at Universal Ampitheater, Warner Bros studio tour, Sony Pictures Studio tour, Santa Monica Pier, Venice;3
Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. Not the best quality Hilton I have been in, but in a good location to Hollywood and LA. Had problems with the TV in the room. Called a technician twice, and was told to pull out the cord and plug it back in every time we wanted to watch TV. No mean feat when the plug was located behind a large cabinet, plus quite annoying for a 6 night stay. Hotel is located midway up a large hill. The Metro station is at the bottom of the hill and Universal Studios at the top. It is possible to walk down to the metro, but I wouldn't recommend walking up to anyone who isn't seriously fit. There are two shuttles that can be taken (one to universal from hotel, the other to the station from universal) which is a bit time consuming if you are in a hurry. Staff;3
"Wish I could leave a happier review but few things disappointed me!  Firstly; building, lobby, staff, feel of the place was lovely, beautiful, clean and pleasing. However the size of the rooms were beyond rediculous, I expected small from the pictures and descriptions. But honestly two adults with a suitcase each just does not work. The room was not big enough for both our suitcases, literally we could not open them - they had to be put on the beds to open, then back on the floor to be able to sit on the bed... but then it was hard to get up off the beds and move because no floor space left to stand up! We couldnât even get up and out the room to use the toilet very easily as we couldnât open the door without having to lift the heavy suitcases up onto the bed to be able to open";3
Rooms didn't seem that clean and were somewhat in disrepair and one person at front desk during check in was rather arrogant and condescending.  Roof top bar did have a fabulous view and concierge was helpful.;3
I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, and I usually have a good experience. In the past I have not had towels in my room upon arrival, but for the most part the visit was great. The staff is always friendly, the hotel is quiet. Most recent stay was not my usual stay. The staff did not greet me (it was busy at check-in), and when I arrived in my room there was left over food in the fridge from the previous hotel guest. I ordered room service on Thursday night, and when I was eating the chicken it had a funny taste. I ended up being sick all weekend with food posioning from the dish I ate on Thursday. In the past I had returned items to room service for the food being the incorrect temperature at this hotel.;3
Not on par with other Hilton hotels. Stayed there twice in one week (different Weekends). Young gal that checked us in the first time was great and friendly, she was a trainee and appeared to be of Asian heritage (I only mention this so hopefully she gets credit for a job well done since I didn't catch her name)  Next weekend Linda checked us in and was anything but helpful, the guy that checked us out on the 2nd of April was trying really hard to be nice but you could tell it was a chore and it appeared to take all his willpower  As others have mentioned, elevators are sooo slow. Ever had to factor elevator wait time into your daily itinerary? Here you will. My daughter left here camera in the room and when we got to the lobby she decided to go to Universal without it because;3
Overall, our stay was fine apart from the WiFi. I wanted to get some work done from the room but 4th floor corridor had absolutely no wifi coverage, to the point where I had to go down to the bar to work. I paid for the ultimate internet but the issue wasn't speed, it was the fact that the room did not recieve wifi signals.  Apart from this heavy drilling/construction work began at 9am which was super noisy.;3
Stayed at The New Yorker after a cruise. Started out bad with an aggressive woman who we thought was at the concierge desk trying to sell us a 2 hour presentation for a time share tour. All we wanted was a map and tickets to the Grayline tour bus. They need to better label the real concierge desk and get rid of the crazy lady.   The rooms are kind of hit and miss on the size and location. Some were big and some were tiny but with views. Rooms were clean, well appointed but the carpets and halls look worn down. Elevators were fast which was a plus. Hotel felt safe and secure. 24 hour restaurant was nice. Good location. Price was about right for mid Manhattan. They charge $10 a bag to store luggage until check-in time, which was kind of high since a lot of places it's free if you;3
The hotel amenities were very convenient and good.  You pay a lot for parking but it is a secure space with ample spaces available.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  My only complaint was the condition of the room itself.  The room needed to be repainted badly!  Lots of marks on the walls and the bathroom needed to be caulked again.  The wall paper was damaged and it just felt like our room had a lot of miles on it!  Therefore we did not spend a lot of time in our room.  The location is convenient with the Metro Station so that you can forgo the driving and parking to shop the malls.  Overall it was a little better than average but not much.;3
I'm sorry, but I would not recommend staying here.  Rooms are okay(nothing too glamorous), staff was nice, self park is my biggest pet peve.  You can either valet(which is expensive but it is the customer's choice) or self park(which costs $20 a day if you're a hotel guest.  This should be a free amenity as a hotel guest.  They do it at Vegas resorts, why not here? The answer because it's LA/Hollywood nothing is free(which is really sad when you're paying those rates a night, just because it has the name Hilton attached to it.  Also, the elevators need to be have maintenance work done to them.  You'll stand sometimes up to 5-6 mins waiting around for one and you have to walk a ways from the hotel lobby to the garage elevators, which also need to have maintenance work done to;3
Lived in a double room with simple furniture, a frig, wardrobe and a chair. Two set of plate/cup/forks/spoons in the room, which is convenient for traveler. Several kitchens can be used, however, no kitchen equipment to cook. But you can use oven and microwave. Just 2 minutes from hammersmith underground. easily to go to city line/district line/Piccadilly line. a great location your travel is near airport, earls courts and paddington. Its a great value in terms of price/location in London. Although , too simple, shared bath.toilet.;3
"Clean and tidy hotel however some gripes. First I booked through BOOKING.COM, when getting to the hotel I find that my HHonors membership perks (free wifi and water) will not be honoured because of booking through a third party (that wasn't advertised by BOOKING.COM). So, disappointed at both big companies as the little man in the middle gets the financial hit. Have to pay extra money for wifi and drinking water which I find outrageous for a Hilton hotel. High prices at the bar and a staggering $28 per person per day for a buffet breakfast ($18 for continental). Next I drove here, fully expecting to pay the advertised $28 per night parking although that again is ridiculously high for a hotel guest. However because my car does not fit in the parking garage (6'4"") I have to use";3
The third Hilton we came across in 4 days. While it was nice and clean and right across from the Universal park, the prices were astronomical and another Hilton we stayed at an hour up the road was nicer, cleaner and 1/3 of the price! For the price, I expected to have a wonderful experience, yet when we called for extra pillows at 9pm, they never arrived. The room was clean and spacious, we stayed on the executive floor, but I would most likely never stay here again. Not worth the price/experience.;3
Spent 4 nights in November with a friend, twin room ensuite. We wanted a budget stay and we got what we paid for. Room and bathroom were clean, however the hostel needs some TLC The bottom handle of the side table/drawer was broken off when we got there. The ensuite, while clean, smelled slightly of sewage the whole stay. While that wasn't super bothersome, what was bothersome was that the heat did not extend to the ensuite. It was always cold in there. Also some of the grout had mold which again was not bothersome, but just not nice to see.   Overall, it was a good stay. Nothing save the temperature of the ensuite was bothersome. The room was clean, I slept well, there was a mini-fridge provided and dishware in case we wanted to use the kitchens. There was also a lift which was;3
Hotel is lovely but beware of those facility fees you are charged per day. Apparently it's for the use of telephone and wi-fi.   On check in day the guy at the desk said all that is free, so what's the charge for?  Definitely will be writing a personal email to the manager.   We we also located in a corner room, where you can hear the creaky taps and when someone is taking a shower. Disturbs sleep. We asked several times for someone to help us with the safe as we couldn't activate a code. No one helped.   Service is poor. Disappointed.;3
The hotel is in a great location for universal studio's. We were initially placed in a room on the 2nd floor with a view of some bushes, the room was so dark it was like being in a basement! We were a party of 3 booking a room with a sofa bed for my daughter which hadn't even been made up. I refused to stay in the room and we were quickly moved, even then I had to remind reception to make up the sofa bed. The rooms are a little tired and having just come from the bellagio in Vegas, paying more to stay in the hilton was a bitter pill to swallow. Parking charges are a joke! The hotel is more concerned with catering for functions and don't seem that interested in your average holiday maker. Would not stay again.;3
Okay, truth be told, when I first arrived I considered finding another hotel. The location is so-so.  Not some place you are going to want to walk around. And the exterior looked kind of tired. But it's not far from Los Feliz, which is very nice and near the Vermont Ave. metro stop which is convenient. I took the metro to Hollywood and Highland and it is safe, fast and well-run. Way better than dealing with the crazy traffic and lack of parking in that area.   This place looks more like a motel than a hotel. I thought the hallways were kind of dark. And I arrived an hour early to check-in time and was told to leave and come back. Really? The bathroom has some cracked tiles and rusted metal parts and you wouldn't want to take a bath in the tub.(It's clean, but has that kind of;3
Not very modern.... Rooms could be remodeled, but hey , its NYC No breakfast included--but there is a starbucks 1 block away GREAT LOCATION--2 blocks from 96th street subway stop, and you can take the express red 1 subway from Times Square, so it takes maybe 10 minutes to get there from Times Square. ALSO--only 3 or 4 blocks from Central Park---great place to run early in the morning.  Wifi was really bad--had to go to Starbucks. Bed was very comfortable  I was in room 212, very quiet, corner room so was very large! Asked for a room with 2 single beds, got a queen/kind and wasn't charged for the upgrade. NO BED BUGS  Don't wait to book 2 nights beforehand--you'll get ripped off;3
This hotel gives you more than what your typical two star hotel usually does.  The lobby is spacious and clean. There is even a desk set up where you can reserve and pay for airport shuttles and city tours. Every person I dealt with was professional and corteous. Whether I needed directions or meal recomendations the staff was helpful and knowledgeable.  There are two banks of elevators and while they are slow and small they go up and down.  My room (214) was larger than I expected and had a really nice bed, a dresser, television (with remote), iron, ironing board, safe, hair dryer, coffee maker, steam heat, and air conditioning.  The bathroom had soap, face soap, and lotion. The sheets and towels were exceptionally clean and I had to tell them not to change the sheets every day;3
"Hotel located in a fairly good & convenient area. Plenty of restaurants, shops etc in the vicinity. Absolutely safe to walk/stroll in the night. Subway station ""96th street"" just around the corner. Able to reach mid-town Manhattan within 10 minutes on the express train. Hotel staffs are friendly & ever ready to assist with enqueries/infos.  Hotel room (the one we had) attached with shower, had all the basic amenities. Extras like hair dryer, iron & ironing board, user friendly safe as well as a coffee maschine comes in really handy. Comfortable bed with clean bed sheets and daily change of bath towels were a welcome. There was also a t.v & an air-conditioner. The only downside is that, room is freezing cold even though heater is at maximum, due to non isolated windows. Carpet on";3
Considering we scored this hotel for $100 on the Fourth of July, we werenât sure what to expect. The hotel was older but not dirty. Our room was clean but small and that didnât bother us. The outlets in our room didnât work so that was weird. Anyway, check in was slow. The staff ignored you until they had to talk to you, in which case, they were then nice. The location was decent as well. Safe area. Central Park is right across the street and the subway is a short easy walk. If you get the place at a great price, go for it.;3
The beds were great - very comfy - location was so-so as we were off to Universal Studios, but a bit far away from the other sights of Hollywood.  Room was clean.  Only complaint was really noisy air-conditioner.  Kids liked the pool.  Front desk staff were helpful.;3
Hotel is very well located but apart from that not much is going for it.  The rooms were very small as were the bathrooms.  Had to move right into the bathroom to be able to close the bathroom door.  And the shower didn't work properly.  The beds were big and comfortable but couldn't get much else in the room.  The corridors were very noisy which suggests poor sound proofing in the rooms.  And very disappointing there was no internet in the rooms, had to constantly go into the lobby or to the mezannine.;3
Recently spent a night at the Wyndham New Yorker and the room was doable but mediocre at best. The rooms clearly need to be renovated. I can see where in past years this hotel may have been a high end hotel, but to me, it the room was just out dated and passable. I did not feel as though I was staying at a four star hotel. Beware of offers to valet park your car, it will cost you $75 per day, and you cannot leave and return. If you park your car yourself, you will save $35 per day.;3
Location excellent, arrived at midnight and I was quickly checked in. I arrived to my room , which was correct. Unfortunately a brutal aspiration noise from the climate system of the building on the side makes it truly difficult to sleep.  The blowing noise is so brutal that tomorrow I will leave the hotel and will look for a proper place to sleep.  If you chose this hotel make sure your room is not on the back of the building unless you plan to go out at night hard and sleeping is not relevant;3
My Boyfriend and I stayed in Abercorn House Hostel for three nights in a private double room with bathroom. The Hostel was in a very central location within Hammersmith, it was close to the Apollo, pubs, shops and bus station, so that was good. It is on a very quite and safe cul-de-sac. The Room was very clean and was warm enough, plenty of hot water. Very good price for London. Only fault was the room was very small, and no iron to be found in the entire hostel. otherwise, perfect if you just want a comfy bed.;3
The Regency Club offerings were poor.  The huge parking garage was a nightmare.  It took forever for me to travel up and then down 8 floors.   And no, I don't want to pay twice as much for valet parking.  I would not stay at this hotel again for this reason alone.;3
"Price was right, but air-conditioning was not working properly, and the fellow at the desk tried to tell me that's the way it worked in ""temperate climates"" Location is a bit nasty, with nothing to do within walking distance. Wouldn't stay again, or recommend, given the number of other hotels in LA.";3
My husband and I stayed @ this Hilton property because of its location...being on the Universal Studios lot.  So basically the convenience and the usually good reputation of Hilton Hotels we felt comfortable knowing that we had made a really good choice in booking with them.  I really have mixed feelings about this place.  Location great but they get you on the nightly rates.  I guess you get what you pay for....which is the convenience of being able to access the park.  But if I would have known how my room was going to be...I would've booked elsewhere.  The carpet of my room was so dirty.  Stains everywhere....dust on the dresser and tv.  We paid close to $300 a night!  I suggest for anyone who is planning to visit Universal Studios to stay @ their sister property....the;3
We had an enjoyable stay here. We LOVED the room! It was comfortable and quiet! The staff were polite and helpful.  And this is in spite of a traumatizing even that occurred with housekeeping.  The day we were to check out, we went to breakfast early (hadn't checked out...it was only 8 am). We took our luggage to our car but left all of our food & drinks for the trip home in the room, as again, we hadn't checked out and it was early. We went to breakfast. We came back and the maids were cleaning our room and had taken all of our food and drinks for themselves. Since they didn't speak English, they called their manager, Brandon. We were horrified! It was only 9 am at this point. And we felt violated. Finally, the floor manager, Jerome called and arranged a reimbursement for us.;3
Location was food, room was clean and everything worked well but no tea making facilities.  Staff not overly helpful but pleasant enough. Check in and out was straight forward. Need laundry room, lots of people have a stopover in the big city before going on.;3
"I stayed at the Hilton/Universal City for business reasons. It was a nice hotel, though somewhat dated. I had a room on the 10th floor with a nice view of the mountains and the freeway (with the famous LA traffic). The City Walk was quite accessible via a shuttle or by walking over. To get to the Hollywood landmarks one usually drives, but the Metro can easily get you there. There is a station just down the hill; you can walk down and cross the street. Walking back from the station is more of a challenge because of the somewhat steep incline but we learned another way: take the Universal Studios shuttle (which stops at a covered area at the bottom of the hill) to the ticket area then walk a liitle to get to the shuttle stop for the hotel, or walk over to the hotel. The concierge";3
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel after 5 nights in a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. This was a mistake. We should have reversed the holiday and started in LA. The Hollywood Hotel is certainly not what it appears to be in the brochures. It is tired and dark inside. However, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good. The housekeeping staff do a good job and the rooms are clean. It is a $20 taxi ride from downtown LA, the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and Starline Tours (which offer just about every tour you could wish for) and 5 minutes walk from the nearest Metro station. 15 minutes walk away are some very reasonable restaurants. HOWEVER, to walk anywhere you will have to pass vagrants sleeping on many of the benches on the pavements. They do not cause much;3
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The room is as you would expect in New York quite small. The bathroom was very old fashioned. The bars attached to the hotel were very good. The hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and 10mins from Times Square. The walk to Times Square there is a lot of homeless and people on substances but if you ignore them they will ignore you.;3
We went to Hollywood Universal hotel for three nights, the staff at counter was normal, not very friendly but not rude either. I don't know if they forgot or what but we weren't given bottles of water until we came down in the evening and asked for it, as there was nothing in the fridge- just an empty fridge. My sister and her two children also got only two bottles of water, despite they stayed in the honor room. The cleaning staff was nice, and one night I called the front desk for a bandage, they brought it to my room which was very nice. The concierge and the luggage transferrers were good, too. However, the breakfast here was the most reason which makes us not to come back: On May 24th we came down for the first day of breakfast and were showed the only counter for;3
Plusses are friendly and helpful staff, ideal location for the Lincoln Centre, clean and comfortable bedsMinuses are horrible 1950s decor, cold drafts from widow surround and bathrooms from hell, shallow basin with no plug and no proper enclosure for shower so the floor is bound to flood.    The restaurant has closed since our last visit in 2016 but there are plenty of good eating places very close by.  In this day and age I do not expect to be charged for internet access in the very small business centre which has no free printer.;3
Rooms are clean and well serviced.  Beds are comfortable with plenty of feather pillows. Tv with movies in the room. Complimentary wifi but seems a little slow. Bathrooms are clean.  We had three rooms on the ground floor but seemed safe and secure. Occasional traffic noise but nt surprising given location.  Service from concierge was adequate and they helped immediately with checkin and with arranging safe access in the room.  Breakfast was disappointing. Plenty of choice but nothing exciting. Coffee was ok, boiled... Could have been stronger but it's an individual thing...Eggs were poor being powdered eggs. Sausages were ordinary.There was a choice of bread for toasting and bagels, rolls and waffles.  We recommend  the waffles.  Nice toiletries and spacious rooms. Overall;3
The check-in was pretty smooth. First room was street facing although I had asked for a courtyard room, room was very small. Changed room to a courtyard room and besides the ventilation noise outside it was pretty quiet. The room was clean, as far as I could see as the carpet was black.  AC could not be adjusted or turned off. The bed was of good quality. What brings me to an average rating is the fact that everything you touch costs money, eg. 8USD for a bottle of water, 12,95 for standard internet for 1 device - per day if not included in your rate, prices at the bar are close to a palace.   One day I had to go to the gym via the employee section (elevator was broken) and was just shocked by the dirt and smell - not a good sign.   Internet was supposed to be included in my;3
me and my boyfriend made out first visit to america we went to new york for new years which was great.  when we booked the hotel we read the reviews on here which were rather worrying, but when we arrived there the place looked small but friendly. it was excellent for what we were looking for  the rooms were small and quite cramped but we werent there for the hotel, and we were looking for some where affordable. the bed was made every day and the bathroom cleaned and maintained. although the hotel isnt in the thick of the fun there is easy to use transport which we discovered on the second day. we first used the taxis but found they were expensive and the drivers were really rude and hard to understand. so on the 103rd street there is a subway station its $7 for a day pass which;3
I thought the Empire Hotel is a nice place to stay. It is average. I recommend you to not spend your whole day inside the hotel. Get out and walk the streets of NY while you can! I think they may hve a pool! It was fun watching movies at night. My only complaint are the toilets. I kept clogging it! Service was quick to come! This a nice average hotel to stay in. It is simple.;3
Great location and Hammersmith is perfect with 4 tube lines making it easy to go places. This hostel is an okay place to stay if you only need somewhere to sleep and don't plan on spending time in your room except for sleeping. I had to sleep with earplugs because there was lots of nosie and very thin walls.  One plus since they don't have a restaurant it was a big plus that the room had it's own fridge. We stayed here for one week and I would absolutely recommend staying in Hammersmith just not at this hostel.;3
The best thing about this hotel is Hugo's breakfast! He is doing an excellent job with eggs and waffles! The hotel is pretty quiet, but rooms and services are average. But over all a pleasant experience.;3
"Family of four stayed for 3 weekday nights this August.  Room on 18th floor had a great view.  However, the carpet was very stained and dirty.  Whole room needs an update. Bathroom was very roomy.   We had access to the Executive Lounge (also needs an update).  Do not waste your money on the upgrade.  Cold cereal and sweet rolls for breakfast and 2 ""hot"" snacks at night with cheese and fruit.  For the extra $30-$40 per night you can get a real breakfast.  Also, the lounge was so packed while we were there we had to stand and eat.  The hotel is very convenient to Universal Studios and City Walk.  They have a shuttle they share with the Sheraton that comes every 10-15 minutes.  Next time I would stay at the Sheraton which was just updated.";3
I enjoyed my stay here in general, the very small room was sufficient and the shared bathroom didn't bother me at all. The room however was very hot and in the end I had to leave the air con running and get under the blankets to be comfy. The cafÃ© attached, CafÃ© Gitane was quite charming but the service was variable and the staff appeared to have some problems with basic maths at times. The rooftop bar was a real treat and popular with the locals as well as hotel guests.;3
Check in went pretty smooth, the rooms are a bit dated. The location is kinda run down,the only good thing about the location is the metro station. Did not feel safe walking around the neighbour hood at night. The breakfast was good but they ran out of fruit easily. For why you pay it is worth it.;3
Please work on fixing the internet issue or remove the fact that internet is available because it's not. Overall the experience was nice but I would have liked to use the internet comfortably in the comfort of my room. Instead I had to stand next to the door to respond to emails, and that sometimes took forever, or I would get kicked off. Thank you.;3
The hotel is basically OK, Corner Room + bathroom both spacious and tidy, good beds and pillows.  Some minuses:  â¢ There is a clear âupstairs-downstairs class divisionâ with the wealthy 5 star customers on the upper floors and ordinary 3 star customers on the lower floors.  â¢ Their credit card readers are a bit outdated: they only read the magnetic strip on the card, not the chip! Luckily I had one credit card with an ok strip (they tend to become unreliable if the card is old and worn).  â¢ Check out is at 11 a.m., but the cleaner knocked on our door already before 9 to see if the room was empty yet. And again at 10 oâclockâ¦  I have travelled quite extensively, and never before have I had to pay for breakfast and room service in cash! In my experience usually hotels charge;3
The Empire Hotel has an incredible location at Lincoln Center is a perfect base for NYC adventures. However, I will say that the Empire is a bit rougher around the edges then other 4 star properties in Manhattan. Just a few examples are older air conditioning units, peeling wood on our bathroom vanity, and loud HVAC noise directly outside our window. I will say there are some good things about the hotel other than the location. The rooftop bar is a solid place to hang out with the usual NYC hotel bar drink prices ($15-ish/drink). The Empire tries really hard to maintain a younger Euro vibe and as such there is a lot of dance/electronic music played both in the lobby and on the rooftop, which depending on what you are going for could be good or bad. The rooms were clean and the;3
Small, not-terribly-exciting or comfortable rooms. Loud as heck, both from outside noise and the hallways. That was the worst part. But ... It's relatively clean. The staff is nice. The gym is decent if you care. The LOCATION is awesome. And I'm still shocked at the affordability, which I'd imagine is why people would come here. Wouldn't rush back but certainly wouldn't avoid it or cringe if I learned I was returning.;3
"Great service and most helpful desk. The room needs a lot of improvement. I stayed in room 927; a double-bed non smoking room. The room needs to be completely renewed. Everything worked but all the furnishings are quite old and show use marks. The beds were very clean and the housekeeping services are very good. The location is great; three blocks from the Central Park, one block from the subway station with a big convenience store by the corner. Do not forget the diner that neighbors with the convenience store. Concluding: I enjoyed my stay here and most probably will return.";3
A request made during our booking was not fulfilled and was not mentioned by the hotel.  We arrived 2 days late due to the failure of BA (no surprise there) to get us there,  No-one at reception offered any sort of comment on how we must be feeling or any sort of dialogue about it at all.  Some might say that's just normal but in the service industry something like that is a great way to show good customer service.    The room was small, basic and the windows can't have been washed for months.  The windowsills were thick with dust but the rest of the room was clean.  The AC worked well which was great.  We waited for almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged when we went to try out breakfast so decided not to bother and didn't dine in the hotel so can't review this.    The pool was;3
After reading all the reviews, I warned my sister and my pregnant friend about the reviews I saw here.  I wanted to scare them so that their expectations were low and they wouldn't be freaked out when we got to the hotel.  Someone had mentioned that Woogoo is not a hotel, and that is what one has to get into their head when they book here first, then you won't be that disappointed.  The men at the desk were very very accommodating to us, and we didn't have any issues with our room.  When we arrived in our room, about 10 minutes later, one of the men at that front desk called up and asked me if everything was alright with our room.  I am not going to lie, my friend did see one cockroach but after that, we didn't see anymore.  We hardly spent time in our room so for our purposes,;3
After 15-hr flight, I desperately need a rest. Entering my room, air conditioner made noisy sound. Apparently itâs malfunction. I ask to change a room, our engineer will check your air conditioner...., Mr engineer came after 30 mins, After 15 mins check, engineer called front desk to give me a new room, then another 30 mins waiting came bell caption to lead me to the new room., sure itâs quite enough to sleep..., Be patience, it took me over one hour to change room. After that, when I was taking a shower, it took me another 1 hour waiting for them bring me toothbrush. YES, itâs another one hour waiting. Be patience, every service at this hotel goes unexpected slow. Hotel provide free shuttle service to LAX airport at every 10 minutes.;3
I recently stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in September, while enjoying all the sites that NYC has to offer. And my conclusion? Meh. It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible, it just sort of existed.  The location is fine. It's a little out there, but it's only a 15-20 minute subway ride to all the good stuff. The hotel is 3 blocks away from the nearest subway station, but it only took a few minutes to walk. There were lots of little stores just a couple blocks away in case you need anything. The building faces Central Park, which is nice. The street was never too busy or noisy.  My room faced away from Central Park, which kind of sucked, but at least it was quiet. Other reviews have warned about the size of the rooms, and they're right. There's enough room for a bed, an end table,;3
Stayed here for 3 nights as a family with two kids.  The lobby of this place is big and beautiful however the rooms were very average. We had a room on the 18th floor with a view of Universal Studios.  The windows donât open which was a bummer because we like to air things out due to COVID.    Reasonably clean rooms but nothing appearing above and beyond with their supposed enhanced COVID cleaning practices.   The room also didnât have a microwave so getting hot water was difficult. Had to go to the front desk or restaurant to request it every time. The front desk staff were mixed. Some were nice and seemed to really want to help while others seemed annoyed that I was there. Even as a supposed âHilton Diamondâ member.    Parking is $30 a day but is within walking distance to;3
Stayed at the Empire for a week with my 10 year old daughter. Arrived around 9.30pm on a Friday night and the outside was full of people who were going to the top of the hotel where there is a party area so struggled through with my suitcases but there wasn't a bell boy around to help  When I got to reception I was told I had a double bed even though I requested a twin room when I booked it up and I would have thought the hotel would have seen a man and child travelling when allocating the room. I asked for a twin room and was told the only option available way for me was to spend $1000 dollars to change rooms of which I declined this and reception told me that they would contact me when a twin was available but never heard from them again so I shared the double bed with my;3
I have always enjoyed staying at the Empire Hotel. This visit, however, was disappointing because of maintenance problems. The air handling system took two visits to fix and the shower backed up. While waiting, we had 100 degree heat or the noise of a jet engine from the radiator. Black gunk bubbled out of the shower drain. It was eventually fixed, but...  Another issue was cigarette smoke. This was supposed to be a non smoking room, but both the room and the hallway reeked of recent smoke. Another guest in the elevator also remarked on it.   We asked twice to be moved but the hotel kept insisting on trying to fix things. We should have been more persistent, because it certainly took the shine off our visit.   All that being said, the hotel staff were always pleasant and they;3
went to room and was not made up.  went to new room and key wasn't working and elevator took key to work. walked up and down stairs four times. from trip advisor we had free parking ($18 value} they said they didn't no about this.  finally  i recieved credit after talking to 5 people. Other then that the room was ok;3
We stayed here a couple of days in August. Excellent location in the upper west side that was close to everything, including the subway. The room was rather small and sort of clean, yet the room price was the best we found in Manhattan, so its all somewhat of a trade off. Price aside, I probably would not stay here again.;3
Decent hotel in very good location, walking distance of most of tourist spots. Hotel is clean and attached Tick Tock restaurant is reasonable value, especially for breakfast. The gratuies however are ,as in all America, eye watering. The waitress even had the cheek to cross our the suggested 18%, yes 18%, and ring the 21%. She didn't get it!!!  We had a room with a view of the Empire State Building, reasonable size and clean. The main objection with this hotel was at check out when the taxes and gratuities and fee for use of amenities, it matters not if you don't use them you still pay.  While taxes etc are beyond the control of the hotel the TOTAL cost of stay should be given at time of request.  Make sure you get the final total and not a surprise on check out Having said all;3
It was a good option to stay in this hotel because it was the closest to the airport and follow standard covid protocols. As a foreigner in USA, I think the hotel met minimum safety standard for example in  other hotels there is a disinfecting protocol of luggage when you check in. Also a similar one for everyone coming inside the hotel building. There should be someone assigned by the door entrance encouraging customers to follow  protocols. I think the hotel is great, they need to improve a bit with regards to Covid safety.;3
Subway stops on both sides, in the middle of everthing, 10 minutes walk to Times Square, 250 m away from the Madison Square Garden, what can I say? The room was small and we didn't like the bathroom, there was no kettle and minibar. But I would probably stay again due to its location and cleanness.;3
"Overall a decent hotel. The best part was the staff... very nice and very professional. The hotel is showing it's age. The rooms are decent but very small. The caulking around the bathroom needed redoing, some sheets and pillows needed replacing. The worst was when the wall shower head (there was a ""rain"" style head on the ceiling and a wall mount) mounting bracket fell apart and the shower head fell and gave my wife a decent sized bump on her head. We got a free breakfast but.... The other issue was the elevators were terrible... the programming, not the condition. Waiting for an elevator was usually a long one. Elevators would skip past your floor while you waited and, several times, once inside, the floor buttons that people had pushed for their floors would go blank and the";3
After reading the reviews prior to our departure I wanted to cancel the reservation.  I am so happy we didn't.  As I read the recent posting from Oct. 16 to the 21, I am truly questioning as to whether these guests stayed at the the same Central Park Tempo apts as we did as the description  was an opposite of our experience.  Our apt. was on the 9th floor. We arrived about 2 hrs before check in and were told there was no room for our luggage in the holding room - but our room was ready.  The apt. was relatively clean.  The hallway was clean with carpets.  The sofa bed was fine but could have had a thicker mattress and been a bit wider... we laughed, calling it the virgin bed.  The shower was powerful, the tv great.... ok, the fridge defrosted itself and they cleaned up the water;3
Myself and partner stayed here for 5 nights. There for a special birthday we received an upgrade and champagne- excellent! Good service although on two mornings housekeeping knocked and woke us up despite there being a do not disturb sign on the door.. Room nice bathroom clean- all good. But then on the last day I was extremely ill, we asked to keep the room as our flight was not until 11pm given that I couldn't stop being sick. They wanted to charge an additional $350 dollars plus tax for the sake of 8 hours. Not good. Then I progressively got worse so my partner asked if the hotel could get a doctor (I was in the lobby sat there all day being extremely sick and probably disturbing everyone) they told us they couldn't because we had checked out. Not good service at all. Nobody;3
I stayed here for 4 nights in August, before I signed up to tripadvisor, hence the late review. Guest rooms are well furnished but small. The bathroom was stocked with high end toiletries but it was really small. Forget 'showering with a friend', there was barely enough room for me (6' 180 lbs) to get in and out of the shower on my own!  In fact a friend of mine left her suitcases in the room after she checked out of her room and travelled upstate to Rochester. I agreed to store her 2 suitcases but had to perform some olympic grade gymnastic maneuvers that would make Mary Lou Retton proud just to get to the bed from the door as there's simply is no dedicated space for suitcases. Y'all remember Mary Lou, the West Virginian who won Olympic gold in LA in 1984.  I quizzed the front;3
Staff are quite simple and hard work to communicate with. 1st night our bathroom stunk of weed as weâve arrived back on the night. Found it bizarre that we had to ask for our room to get cleaned when we was stopping more than one night and then come back to our room still not clean but we give the cleaner time in the end whatâs not a problem. Donât understand why the cleaner who gave us one towel to share when there was two of us. Overall I wouldnât stay at this premier inn ever again and definitely better hotels around and better price.;3
Great location. Good service and staff friendly. Rooms r old and donât smell great. But... great views from 22nd floor and beds are comfy. Very convenient to Universal Stydiis. Shuttles were a definite plus;3
I would totally hook up with The Jane every time I was in NYC. I love the Wes Anderson-esque regal oddity and unremitting charm of getting your big brass key from the reception and the magnetic allure of Cafe Gitane. I really wish I could handle the tiny rooms and punishing themostats.   From the moment I looked at it online, I was smitten. The location is great and rooms seemed adequate. I had a Captain's Room, which means an en suite bathroom. As I was travelling for work, I should have thought to ask for a desk. That said, the room was approximately bed-sized, so not sure where that would fit.   The bathroom featured a great shower with nice pressure and plenty of hot water. The sink, however, was so tiny that I kept bumping my elbows on the shower wall as I brushed my teeth.;3
Just got back from Universal Theme Park in CA.  Stayed at Hilton, just a short walk from park.  Best part was the location.  The rest was very pedestrian.  Large rooms, comfy beds, clean.  Breakfast was pricey and uninteresting.  Didn't eat any other meal there.    Service was good, employees extremely nice.  Bar always seemed busy.  Be aware of the construction at the hotel, gym is closed, and outside walkways and patios being worked on,  we never knew which door to go out for our walk to Universal.  There is a shuttle to the park, but honestly its faster to walk.  Just got tired of outside doors being locked and walkways closed.  It was an adventure just trying to find a way back into the building.  All and all an uninteresting hotel that could use a little personality.;3
Me and my boyfriend stayed here at the end of July for 4 nights as part of a bigger holiday in the US. We found the hotel nice with clean well furnished rooms and enjoyed our stay. We were asked to move rooms half way through our break due to maintenance and the manager dealt with this himself, he was more than helpful, courteous and polite, also giving us a room upgrade. The hotel is in an okay location, good for Central Park, however, its a bit of a walk to Times Square etc. Despite us largely enjoying our time here, there were a couple of things that we felt let the hotel down, Firstly the lack of free Wi-Fi, a lot of hotels have this now, but unfortunately this was only available in the lobby, and it was difficult to connect. We used the Starbucks next door whilst getting a;3
i was really kind of surprised how small 2x3 meters maximum 7x9 ft hotel rooms can be. what i really disleiked was the doorman staring at me like bein transparent without helping at all with 2 heavyyyyy suitcases.strange i thought but no tip later :)  the girl at the reception really the best of the whole ''hotel''. okay i am picky .they even gave me a park view toom the second day but come on. so small. old tv sets and 1960 cheap furniture. the windows were so dirty i thought it was raining outside but no.just lack of cleaning:) no breakfast,of course. rude recepcionist in the morning...or maybe just the new york way :) something positive?  metro in front (110th parkway station, c-line) dont take a 70us cab from jfk.take the airtrain, then subway to 42nd street then c line.;3
The foyer is amazing and we didn't have to queue to check in.  We were given room 2201 which has two double beds and two bathrooms.  Initially the room looked amazing but we were right next to the elevator room and it was continuously so noisy, it sounded like a supermarket trolley on a hardwood floor all day and all Night!! We rang reception and asked to move rooms but were told none were available and were given ear defenders to mask the noise and help us sleep. One of the bathrooms the shower was cold and the other the toilet leaked soiled water onto the floor. Both baths were really marked and the grills in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned for years. We didn't sleep properly all the time we were on our holiday due to the noise.  The location was amazing but for what we paid;3
We stayed here in January and the hotel is in a fabulous  location. The rooms are small which is  what you  expect in a large city however the  hotels is looking a little tired. The rooms need to be redecorated along with the corridors. The plumbing is noisy and you can here when the people in the next room have a shower or use the  bathroom. The rooms are spotlessly clean, but we bad to ask for a coffee  maker. My biggest gripe was the facility  charge that you have to pay on top of the room charge a which was $31.57 per night. This is for the gym, wi fi and phone calls. This was on top of a refundable deposit of $45 per night. The other charges that you have to pay is if you check out and want to leave your luggage you are charged $2.00 per case. Would I stay here again no.;3
I am a long time customer.   The room I got needs an upgrade although it has a great view. The bed was uncomfortable and felt old and the carpet needs to changed and upgraded. I was too tired to request a change and it was late. Needs refreshing and an upgrade. Too dark.  The staff at the front desk are great.;3
We were charmed by the pictures of an old world hotel with an inviting lounge. Our room (a Captain's room) was great, private bathroom and a great terrace but it was not much use in the cold and rain. It was comfortable but really why is there not an in room coffee maker? At this price it's the least they could do. The beautiful lounge was off limits as it's some sort of nightclub now, so really there is no casual cocktail area to sit so we went around the corner to the Standard High Line for that (highly recommend, great service). The location is great but for the price there really should be better hotel amenities and one really big downside is the sound of the nightclub which basically pounds through the whole building until the wee hours. I could sleep through it but my;3
"So My friends and I got into NYC early in the AM..we were told there was lockers to keep our stuff in so we could go and see some sights before we checked in....when we got there we had to go to the ""B"" and we get there and its a room with a lock on it to keep our stuff in..OK i guess...when we came back to check in we were suppose to have a Private bath,we were told the room was already taken and there was no other Private rooms with bath...so we had to stay in a room with shared bath,it wasnt that bad at all really minus the bathrooms were small and there was mold on the curtains in the shower,the bedrooms werent so bad small but not bad if your only sleeping in it which thats all we did..only time we spent in the room was to get changed between shows and go to bed....staff";3
We stayed at the Ramada for 1 night at the end of March 09, I paid aprox Â£55 per room so didn't expect to much!  We were pleasantly surprised when entering the reception looked like a very nice hotel.  The rooms were small compared to a standard room in the USA but fine for a brit! The rooms had a balcony over looking a lovely courtyard also had a fridge and a microwave. Everything was clean. Plenty towels.   The hotel itself had good faculties -   3 Sauna's although only one was working, a steam room  Nice pool Small gift shop  Laundry room  Free internet in the rooms  Pay internet on PC in reception   Breakfast was buffet style and included in the room price, waffles made to order we great the rest was basic, few choices of cereal bread for toast & bagels. My husband had;3
Location is perfect for Lincoln Center.  Hotel is pretty tired.  That said, beds are firm and comfortable, sheets are fine and the room is clean.  But be ready to tolerate cracked peeling paint in bathroom, fixtures pulling out of wall, and leaking shower fixture.  We stay there because it is just great to come out of the Met late in the evening and walk across the street to your room.  Doormen are excellent--grab your stuff and help you from the cab, check luggage if room isn't ready early, and get you a cab quickly for whatever travels.;3
This hotel is not for everyone. The shared baths and micro sized rooms appeal to the budget traveler that enjoys novel small spaces. The robes are great. Each room looks like a berth in an old steamer ship. The staff is very friendly. The place attracts a lot of Europeans. The neighborhood is my favorite in the city. Lots to discover and a little quieter. My only complaint is that the hotel has a small number of resident guests. Some of them enjoy smoking in their rooms and this can permeate the hallways especially on the third floor. The hotel's private rooms are really awesome if you want to splurge.  The bathrooms are kept very clean and the showers are really nice.;3
If you are obese or clostrophobic, you do not want to stay here.....but we found this to be a fine little hotel for our visit.  Everything about this hotel is tiny: lobby, elevator, stairway, hallway, rooms.....but it is clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the bed was comfortable. The only problem we had was that the window air conditioning unit did not cool as well as we would have liked, but we were so tired from our wanderings in the city that we slept great anyway.  Please note that this hotel is not near ANY famous attractions.....but it is a mere 3 blocks from a subway stop that can take you anywhere!! And there are many restaurants within a 6 block walk.  We found this hotel to be charming and quite suitable to our needs (sleeping, bathing) while in New York;3
This was a mediocre stay.  I did not like the feel when I arrived the front desk clerk was not very friendly.  He seemed a little rude.  I also did not like that you had to sign your life away to stay there.  There were 4 of us staying starting New Years Eve and I felt that you could not go outside because there was no Starbucks nearby however there were a lot of great restaurants within driving distance.  We get to the room and it has a linoleum floor which I have not seen ever in a hotel room.  The bathroom was tiny and the beds were comfortable but squeaky.  The room had no closet but that my be due to the fact that is was built in 1904.  Back to the bathroom it only had a shower and it really needed to be updated.  The shower water was temperamental.  The one thing that did;3
We stayed at the Hilton for one night during our recent trip to LA.  The hotel was easy to find, and very convenient for Universal Studios and City Walk, which were about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.   The hotel was of the usual Hilton standard, although the first room we were given smelt very strongly of stale smoke.  It was clear that a previous guest had smoked in the room, but it had not been cleaned effectively as the smell really lingered.  We complained, and were moved immediately without hesitation, however this fell below the usual standard expected of a Hilton Hotel.   Our NEW room was spacious, and was on the 10th floor, so had some good views of Universal Studios and the Hollywood Hills.   We used the car park, which was easy to find, secure and convenient with;3
The best thing about this hotel was the location absolutely fantastic, very clean and staff very helpful. Only downside was hidden cost of $400 deposit. Also upon checkout we had to pay $5 per bag to store in luggage room.;3
"I stayed at this place for 8 days while on business.  Everyone at the front desk are top notch and very friendly and helpful.  The lobby is beautiful in this boutique hotel.  The rooms are rather small, but nicely decorated.  We arrived late the first night and they only had a room on the 2nd floor.  Since we were staying so long, I asked if we could have a really nice room.  No problem; don't unpack completely, leave our bags in the room in the morning and we would be moved to a room on an upper floor with a ""beautiful city view.""  Everything went as promised with the move.  But, their idea of a ""beautiful city view"" is looking into two 1970s era apartment buildings across Broadway from the 9th floor.  If we knew this, we would have probably just stayed on the second floor.";3
This is a real nice place to hold an event. Good for business and social occasions. I went up to the rooftop lounge and had drinks with some friends the other night. Admittedly, the view is not of Central Park but of Midtown Manhattan, and you only see office buildings. Wine and alcoholic selections were provided, and there was a good crowd on a warm night. On the roof area, lighting, directions to the restrooms and elevators are hard to find, especially when multiple parties and events are in full steam. Would I go back? Probably, yes, but not on the top of my list of favorite hangouts.;3
Great location. Service cold and anonymous. Unexpected resort charge worked out at Â£25 per night - covered expensive wifi but mandatory. Not visible with Expedia booking until confirmation. Tick tock diner next door great for breakfast. Hotel tired!;3
Ok - warning the pictures they show do not represent all their rooms! We had to start with room 920 which was little more than a noisy cupboard! The noise off all the aircon units reverberated up through the middle section so even if you turned your own noisy unit off you heard everyone else's! You could also touch all walls from the bed!! After complaining we got a free upgrade to Queen on level 12, massive difference hence the mixed review. Larger room and bathroom, office desk and fridge, huge improvement!!! Even a quiet aircon unit and as it looked over the street no one else's aircon noise either. There is no free internet in the room which is a pain however the hotel is perfectly situated for Central Park and Times Square. There is discounted parking across the road and;3
Take care of the noise from the ventilation system - do not accept a room with internal position. The room is small but OK clean and Rudy. Very good site in NY midtown. The noise from the ventilation system in the internal tract og the hotel is sleep-preventing.;3
We stayed at The New Yorker this past weekend. The property was a relatively easy walk from Grand Central, and a straight shot from the theaters. Youâll need to show your room key when heading to the elevators. This is great from a security standpoint despite not getting a heads up from the front desk. The night we checked in while we were out at dinner I received a welcome email from the property that offered some upgrade options. I thought this was a great idea, so I selected the champagne and truffles package but received another email 20 minutes later that they could not process the request. Disappointed, now thinking weâd have something waiting for us when we got back I placed another order for just the champagne. I monitored the email and never had a subsequent;3
The location of the hotel was fantastic- just outside of the hustle and bustle of Time Square but within walking distance of all the tourist attractions and many hidden bakery and coffee shop gems. I booked the hotel solely for the roof top pool feature- however, after my sister and I checked in and went to check it out, we were alerted by a sign that the roof top pool was indefinitely closed! After speaking to the front desk, it turns out the roof top pool had been closed a week or longer prior to my arrival! Very disappointed in how management handled the situation. Also, they advertise free wifi- it is only free in the lobby. If you would like wifi in your room, it is an additional charge of $13 per 24 hours.;3
The Wyndham New Yorker provided a nice stay in the city. Front desk service requires a long wait, especially during peak check in/out times. Staff was friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a Premium Suite based on Diamond status, which was nice. The room was clean, spacious, and had a nice view. It even featured a private terrace, although you could not get outside.  Hotel location is pretty central with Penn Station across the street, making all of Manhattan a short subway ride away. Overall a nice option for a few days in the city, especially if the price is reasonable.;3
Great location. Room size is not too bad. We had our own bathroom so things were good there too. However the staff are not the friendliest. If they're so miserable then they shouldn't be working there. Customer service is everything!! Their wifi connection is not always the best, and it's bad enough their towels are so tiny, you only get one per person. Apart from that. It really is ok. I could even recommend and maybe come back someday;3
, it is very noise ,also internet is very slow .double glassing windows should be improved and bathrooms should be updated , you can get for the same price ink 48 hotel which is more modern and well presented;3
if you're planning on spending time in the hotel beyond sleeping and showering, this hotel isn't for you. It's in a great spot for cityexplorers and museum goers. Pay for an upgraded room, I was on the 11th floor and my room was clean, renovated and just big enough for myself (and one more person). I don't use housekeeping when i'm at a hotel so I can't comment on that, but the bathroom was clean and stocked, my room was clean and tidy, Yes, the Air conditioner was loud, but chilled the room nicely. The elevators are slow and small, hallways dark, long and humid. But if you're just going to and from your room--- you're fine. My only major complaint was how long it took for the hot water to come when trying to shower. It took about 15-20 minutes, but I planned accordingly and;3
Small room.  Clean  and was affordable.  Close to Subway to get to see Broadway shows, Coney Island.  Across from Central Park.  Would stay there again.  Perfect location in New York City!  Staff was helpfull.;3
My wife and i stayed at the Ramada Inn for 5 days in late September 2006 because we wanted a good location for easy access to Disneyland and Universal Studios. The surrounding area was a nightmare due to three main factors: 1) no closeby restaurants that were clean, 2) the poverty surrounding the hotel and 3) loud car noises from races and burnouts. Although the physical location was very good- everything else was ok to worrying. The breakfast was very very average- cutlery was grubby too, the service was slow and parking very expensive ($12US per day) including any tours/activities they offered us. We needed to do everything from booking Disneyland, Universal and LA Tours on our own to ensure we got it at a reasonable price. Good price and distance from attractions- but thats;3
Second time I have stayed at this hotel, but a bit disappointed by the room this time. Booked a standard double room and got given a disabled room on the ground floor by the lifts. Was noisy and just felt empty inside the room, lacking comfort we expected for the price paid. Its a great location for those visiting Universal Studios, as you can walk to the entrance in minutes and the staff were brilliant. A big thank you to the parking guys outside the reception, super friendly and helpful with directions. After two stays here I think I would stay somewhere else if I go to visit Universal Hollywood again.;3
This hotel was recommended to us by Virgin holidays. First impressions were okay, although I was worried about the area the hotel is located in.   I was staying here with my teenage children and had booked 2 rooms, when checking in we were given rooms 5 floors apart which wasn't ideal.  I have seen a lot of reviews about the lifts, however we didn't have a problem with this and only waited a short time, if at all.  The ticktock diner is very good, reasonably priced and so convenient.   Our rooms, located on the 21st and 26th floors, were small (even though they were both double, double rooms) and dated. The walls are paper thin and we could hear the people next door singing in the shower and using the toilet.   Overall outlook stay was satisfactory, but  we would not stay here;3
I selected The New Yorker because of its iconic and amazing building. Location is excellent too. I was though a bit worried of previous reviews pointing out the quality of the rooms. Disappointingly the worry became real.  I had higher priced suite on 39th floor. Bigger room with separate living room space at high floor with a view.  The room is gloomy, tired and had moldy smell. Not fresh visually nor physically. I had the view, but the windows are small and my view was blocked by pillars - it is still better than looking at another buildingâs wall.  Bathroom followed the suit. The quality of shower was bad, water pressure low, shower head loose and old spattering the water unevenly and weakly.  The room is a big disappointment. Though the bed was good and on higher floor the;3
This is an average hotel for NYC, good from what I hear for Days Inn standards. Water pressure was a little low and there is no room service or restaurant on the premise, but you can order take out from menus provided though,;3
You get what you pay for. The room is small, practically all bed, but it's not abnormal for New York. It is clean, but old. The carpet doesn't extend underneath the walls, the tv is small and old. My tv remote inexplicably disappeared, never to return, after my first night and the first visit from housekeeping. The walls are paper thin so you will hear other people, as well as a periodic rattling sound. When I arrived for check-in, no one was at the reception desk. The doorman, Hamilton, informed me the computer was down and the receptionist would be back once she fixed it. She sauntered back 20 minutes later, not at all apologetic. (Hamilton, on the other hand, was wonderful. He spoke several languages and remembered each guest well enough to greet them in their native language;3
Having just returned from NY and staying at the Astor on the Park myself and my husband were happy with this hotel for what we paid to stay there.   Having read some of the reviews we were a bit aprehensive of what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. We took our 3 year daughter with us and our main thing was that it was clean. And one thing that can not be said about this hotel is that it wasnt clean.   The room we stayed in was on the 10th floor looking out onto Central Park and had a kingsize bed in it and bunkbeds. The room wasnt massive but it was ample for what we needed as we only slept in there! The staff by far were very very friendly and very helpful, they couldnt do enough for you and made us and our daughter feel very welcome at all times.  We would definatley;3
I stayed here for work and was not impressed. The room was clean, but the heating and cooling system was a disaster. Maintenance had to come multiple times to adjust the heat because the room was so hot. Maintenance indicated that this was a common occurrence which is unacceptable. With so many other options in NYC I would not choose to stay again. Don't be fooled by the pretty pics, they don't paint the true picture.;3
Near to Central Park, the room was a little tired, and small, with no proper wardrobe just a rail with a  curtain, the air con was very old,  and the charge for wi fi in the rooms extortionate, but the staff were very helpful and free wi fi in the lobby, also access to a room for printing off boarding passes which was very useful. The Sky Bar looked very good except for the maÃ®tre de who needs lessons in customer service and due to his attitude we walked out!!;3
As you walk in the foyer is nice and gives a false impression of the rooms.   We booked a suite as there were five of us and it was nothing like the photos. It was very much in need of a renovation.   To make matters worse they were building on the balcony and that would have made it a lot better. The door to the bathroom wasn't working but someone came and fixed it for us.   There was a bedroom with two doubles and a small lounge with a pull out sofa which had a very thin mattress on it.   The wardrobe was tiny for five people and there weren't enough hangers.   It was quite clean but there were lots of signs if wear on the walls and carpet. It wasn't quite what we had expected and as I said nothing like the photos.   The positives however are the location. It is practical;3
Stayed for only 4 nights in this hotel whilst on a mini break to New York. Whilst the hotel style and room was basic in style the staff and location couldn't be faulted. Checking in was an easy process upon our late arrival though wasn't informed that I needed a card on file though I had already paid, luckily I had taken mine with me. The room was clean, small but spacious enough for two of us as a base. Let's face it in New York with lots to see you only want to use your room to sleep. There wasn't a tea making facility only coffee and as a British person this was a let down. The safe was on hand in the room but the instructions to use were stuck on top so had to get a chair to work it out. Old fashioned tv was difficult to use if you wanted to so didn't bother much with it.;3
Great location  - next to Madison Square Garden, several subway lines run under the hotel, Macy`s, PATH train station, Times Square is less than 10 min walk - amazing history of the building with stunning art deco interior. However our twin room was a bit small and the double beds are short (though the matress was perfectly firm for me).  There was no kettle in the room to make tea or coffee in the morning.  Staff was profiessional but when I complained about the smoke smell in the bathroom and about the draught around the window, they coldly apologized and that was it.   Paying the $29.00 facilites fee is a bit much if you have to pay for leaving your luggage there after check out. That $2.00 per suitcase could be really covered from the facitilies fee.;3
"The one minute walking proximity to Lincoln Center is fantastic, but location is the only reason I would consider staying there ever again. The service and the amenities were well below the standards of equal priced hotels in any other city; it felt like they made the minimal effort knowing the location alone would ensure customers.    It was storming when I arrived and when I asked where I could obtain an umbrella the employee who checked me in suggested purchasing one at the convenience store around the block. Unfortunately I was drenched by the time I finished running there, but I purchased an umbrella to use the rest of the day. When I returned to my room I was surprised to find an umbrella among the amenities located in the closet. It certainly would have been helpful to";3
This hotel is worthwhile for the location alone. Its a block away from MSG and walking distance from Times Square and Broadway. That being said, the hotel itself isnât great. The lobby is cramped and always busy. The rooms are kinda cramped and not the cleanest. I actually had to change rooms because the shower pipes were rusted and released dirty brown water. The wifi wasnât strong. The hotel also has guards that you need to show your room card to in order to go in and out. The whole operation seems to be 20 years behind more modern hotels. But, if you donât plan to spend much time in your hotel, this is a pretty affordable Midtown hotel.;3
A group of us stayed here on Saturday night as a part of my sister's bachelorette weekend. We booked 2 rooms and arrive around noon to hang out by the pool. Our rooms weren't ready which was fine because we headed to the rooftop. Although we didn't reserve a space we did find a couch and a couple tables to take over. The pool is very small and covered so the water was COLD but nice for refreshing dip. The drinks are of course overpriced as are the snacks/food. We were told by an employee that we couldn't have any outside food or drinks on the rooftop and that was the last we saw of anyone. Nobody came up to see if we wanted a drink or food. We had to keep going down to the bar to order and get drinks but they didn't hesitate to automatically add gratuity to the tab for doing;3
I like this hotel, centrally located and walking distance to Universal City Walk.  Very big, with a nice pool, gym, good restaurant and bar.  Underground parking.  All in all I like this place and and will stay again.  Views of Citywalk, views of Extra!  .... The TV show, all good at this place.;3
"I paid $145 for my room which was for 2 peopleâ¦50 square feet, bunk beds, tiny.  I knew that going in but a couple of things made the room undesirable, and keep in mind I am NOT a picky traveler.  First, the room I was in was supposed to be non-smoking, but because of the poor ventilation system, I might as well have smoked. Second, there aren't enough bathrooms, period. I had to wait twice to take showers. Once at 1am and once again around 7:30 am. The bathrooms were clogged with hipsters.  Thirdly, if you are over 5'9"" as I am, you will not find the bed comfy. It was built 100 years ago for smaller folks than I. Fourth, no communal space except the cafe meant that I couldn't work in my room, nor in the lobby, and the cafe closed early. Off to Starbucks with me!  The room was";3
The hotel location is awesome! Near walking distance to Central Park, Met Museum, The Met. The subway station is very close by to Columbus circle or 59th Street. The concierge was great and very helpful in giving directions. And great to walk to Broadway!;3
The Hotel is located in midtown Manhattan. Perfect location for all activities. The downside ist the noise. So even though we were on the 8th floor the noise was quite disturbing. Additionally to the street noise there's a loud elevator sound every single time the elevator stops on your floor. Rooms are very clean and well equipped. Hotel staff and especially the doorman are very friendly and helpful. Room was always clean and had an ok size for a mid-prize-range Hotel in NYC.   So overall an ok Hotel...but be aware on departure: When you leave to the airport they offer you their own limo service. That costs you 10$ more than a yellow cab + it even takes you longer because they're trying to save money by avoiding tolls.;3
elevators are constantly being repaired. upper floors means you stop at every floor on the way down, lower floors means there is no room when the elevator opens. we have been staying there 2-3 times a year for 4 years and it is always the same;3
Maybe it's just me, but charging $3.00 for making your own cup of coffee in your room or $15 for a drink at the pool when you're already paying $379 a night is perverse. I appreciate paying for value, but being nickeled and dimed is a pet peeve.   With that being said, the staff were all top-notch. I'd hire David, the manager for the pool deck, in a heartbeat! I can't complement him enough.   All in, the Empire was average.;3
I had good expectations of this hotel with its 4* status - but I was really disappointed. The check in process was slow, and although I was pre-warned about charges on arrival, it was a big chunk of money to pay for 2 rooms for 3 nights - still waiting to see if the refund arrives as promised. The room was the most disappointing - old and dated and not enough space to swing a cat.  Two people in the room with nowhere to store suitcases meant there was no space to move.  Small bed - although comfortable - and very noisy air conditioning.  The bathroom was tiny and needed updating.  A lot of noise came in from the streets 25 floors below. However the big selling point for this hotel is its location - it is right in the centre of the tourist area with Empire State, Times Square and;3
We stayed in a twin room on the third floor. The room was really small but had a good size wardrobe, fridge and a table. It was clean and very warm. The toilets were right opposite our door which was very convenient. The location is also good. The only down side was the noise. You literally hear every single door closing on the floor especially the bathroom and kitchen.;3
Great location and service, but many rooms still have those old, clunky, noisy and inefficient air conditioners. Poor temperature control. Empire has great location, especially for an elderly guest like me. Right across from Lincoln Center. And great restaurants nearby. But they badly need an upgrade.;3
We booked this hotel based on reviews from other reports, and we are by no means snobby and are well seasoned travellers, but this hotel failed us in every way.  The rooms were clean but very small with one queen size bed (in all the hotels weâve stayed in in the US the rooms have been massive with king size beds).  That we could cope with but there was nowhere to put anything.  A couple of bedside drawers and a wheeled clothes horse that looked like it came from a clothing shop shoved into a corner was just not sufficient.  The hotel dates from about 1929 and looks it.  The manager said that all the rooms had been upgraded and when I expressed my dismay due to the rusting towel shelf, the peeling toilet seat, the cracked tiles in the bath, the peeling wallpaper and the mildew;3
They looked unhappy with my booking via Expedia. They discouraged me upon my request of adding my Hyatt membership number on my reservation. now I am seeing the reward point 37 for my two nights stay!;3
A standard room was discounted on the company site and rightly so.  Very small room, cramped bathroom. Poorly maintained: sticking bathroom and closet doors, dripping shower head. Unplugged and noisy in-room AC unit needed housekeeping's attention. Mixed friendliness at reception. Attractive lobby area and bar.;3
a reasonable priced hotel for the night. Bed was very comfortable. One major negative was the unexpected stains on the bath towel, quite unhygienic and disappointing (didnât bring this up at the time as I found it late and needed to check out quickly);3
Our first impression of the hotel was not that great.  We got dropped off but no one assisted us with our bags.  The doors were hard to open and one struggled to get into the lobby despite there being a doorman out the front.  Check in was fast but we had ask for someone to bring the bags to the room and then when we went to get the lifts up to the room we get bailed up by salesperson trying to sell us a share plan for the Wyndham  hotel chain.  After a very long flight we just wanted to get to our room. Also we were there for  a holiday not to buy a share in property.  Why would we give us some out time just to get a free breakfast to listen to their sales speil.  Unfortunately our impression got worse when we got to the room - it was small, old and had no fridge or coffee;3
This is a good hotel in Hollywood and I don't think that it's easy to find a hotel to a better value. The hotel itself is OK but it's certainly not a luxury hotel. The rooms are spacious but feels worn out. The bathroom didn't feel fresh and would really need to be refurbished soon. The staff are friendly and give all help you need. The breakfast is good and is served in a nice dining area, they have a chef making omelets, waffles etc. The pool area is nice and relaxing but there aren't too many sunbeds. However we always found available sunbeds so it doesn't seem to be a problem. Parking is safe but cost 24 USD per day.  All in all this is an OK hotel when taking the price and location into account.;3
Myself and my 2 friends arrived late Wednesday eve after booking accommodation for 3 people. The girl on reception was pretty uninterested in our arrival- and simply asked to see my booking info when i said we'd arrived to check in- she looked us up and said- ok thanks- you can pay in the morning- heres your key- and promptly looked back down at her computer. I then asked where we needed to go for our room- she pointed roughly down the hall. we got to our room to find one double bed in there. My friend popped back to reception to ask why we had a room for only 2 people- she simply said- oh im not sure- there's nothing i can do now.  So my friend said- well cant you find us a room for 3 as thats what we booked for- she said -we'll i dont know- id have to call the manager! so we;3
Beautiful architecture, quaint practice of giving guests their own robes and slippers for the shared bathrooms... yes, shared baths unless you opt for the higher priced rooms. I've lived in all kinds of situations so this is usually not a problem, but people were not cleaning up after themselves, and staff was not thorough with bath/shower cleanup. Doors close automatically so there was a bit of standing water every time I went to shower. The toilets are fine. The staff was friendly and courteous. The housekeepers were nice as well, but the showers need more thorough inspections. Debris was stuck behind the doors and remained there throughout my stay. I was in NYC on business and was also not too pleased that the restaurant turns into a nightclub at night and there are a lot of;3
The best thing about this place is the location - it's so convenient to Lincoln Center and Central Park. The hotel itself is average NYC faux swank. The bar is fun and trendy, as is the rooftop lounge, and I enjoyed hanging out in those areas with friends while I was in town. The rooms are also typical NYC boutique - pretty small but reasonably nice. I'm the sort of person who doesn't spend a lot of waking hours in my hotel room, so for me, this place was just fine. One thing to know - there aren't a ton of late night bars and restaurants in this area, though you can get to those things easily.;3
Clean, safe, functional.  No microwave, coffee pot, mini-fridge in room.  I think you can get them for extra fees.  Convenient to subway and Penn Station.  Excellent bagel/muffin shop across the street.  Hotel employees were cordial.;3
Yes: Great location. Very comfortable bed. Windows actually open. Stunning view of Lincoln Center if your room is on the front/upper floor. Good service at front desk. Good bartender. Easy metro access.  No: If you're on the 10th floor, be prepared for the night club one floor above to throb away until 2 am or so. Wifi costs $13/day (unless you complain about the throbbing night club) as does...in-room coffee?! Yup. K-cups are provided, but at $3  a pop. No ice bucket or machine. Room service is prompt, but two eggs, a slice of toast, potatoes, juice, and coffee will set you back $36. Bathroom is tiny and is has-been swanky/worn/moldy, but offers good water pressure and a nice opportunity to practice your pop-up camper bathing skills. (Just put a towel in the sinklette and dump;3
Donât understand why youâd charge $3 for a bottle of water when other Hyattâs provide 2 complimentary bottles of water per day per room. The rooms were modern, looks like a new renovation and you canât hear the planes even if itâs right beside the airport. But staff should learn how to smile more.;3
"Hasn't been upgraded in 20 yrs. Staff great; but owners are just milking the location.  Stayed many times and it is just sad. This was last until they upgrade.  Had Jr Suite and the couch was so old and springless it was uncomfortable to use. Real shame,SOMEBODY BUY THIS HOTEL!!!!";3
I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. I had a business meeting to go to and Mohammed was very accommodating in expediting my check in. Very nice and professional, he is a great asset to this hotel. Thank you very much.;3
Location of this hotel is great! You can easily walk to most of central Manhattan tourist spots. Concierges were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for them. This is a noisy hotel but only due to New York being a noisy city!! We stayed on the 6th floor and weren't aware of any noise other than the outside traffic etc. The walls are paper thin and you do have to hope that you have considerate neighbours. Other reviews mention the towels, shower etc . Housekeeping are only to happy to issue more towels and yes the shower splashes but if you use the bath mat provided you don't get a puddle on the floor. If you're looking for a traditional hotel then this isn't the one for you but on the whole a good hotel for NYC.;3
Pleasant hotel, conveniently located, reasonable price for New York City. At check-in, we requested adjoining rooms and were assured that rooms 619 and 621 were adjoining. They turned out to be as far apart as two rooms on the sixth floor could possibly be. Loaner umbrella in the room was a nice touch. Staff was very friendly. We skipped the $18 breakfast and found excellent alternatives right around the corner.;3
Made reservation for a Tower floor, the amenities were not there. For breakfast you have to go down to the lobby restaurant, no Lounge on the floor. Room is old and small need renovation, old T.V with limited channels. You can hear the quests talking from the next room. Last day no hot water. Left a comment card did not response.;3
"BEWARE - Not all the rooms are as good as that shown as 'Standard Queen' on the website. We checked in to this hotel on Tuesday 17th July for four nights.  The room we were given was very small, very dark and unbearably hot; there were no mini bar or coffee supplies (both shown on the website photo).  The air conditioning seemed to be on but was not working properly.  We complained and were told an engineer would be sent to sort it out.  On our return from dinner nothing had changed so we asked what was happening and were told nothing could be done but we would be changed to a new room the following day since there were no free rooms that night.  We asked for a fan which came but did not make much difference and we spent a very uncomfortable and sleepless night.  The following";3
I was very disappointed. It was not worth if its price. No microwave available to warm up any food and no coffee in the room. Rooftop service was one of the worst. When you need a servant you had to go look for one yourself. When you placed the order, it took forever and they kept coming at different time. The best service was the towel guy, handing the towel and picking up after everyone and cleaning the pool area so that it didnt look so bad.;3
Did enjoy the hospitality but bedroom only had a view of a wall and the air-con was an old-fashioned under-window unit which was noisy and inefficient.  As a result it was difficult to sleep comfortably - but the bars and restaurants are lovely and it's good value for the price.;3
The hotel is in a excellent location by foot or the subway for all the major attractions which was great. The hotel room was very clean with clean towels each day, shampoo, soap was supplied.Tea and coffee machine supplied at a extra cost,  the maids were very friendly with excellent customer service and cleaned the room to very high standards. Tick tock diner which is part of the hotel was very nice  however when you order a cup of coffee you only get half of a cup  when my husband question this he was told thats the way it comes, lucky for us Starbucks is only over the road to the hotel.Third day into the holiday I broke my ankle which ment we had to stay another 4 days at the hotel until I was clear to fly, I really felt it for my husband because the reception staff were not;3
The hotel location is great.  The food was nice. The rooms need an update as they felt very old. I felt like they needed a good clean. I have stayed in lots of premier inn hotels and this is probably one of the lowest standard ones I have seen.;3
Average boutique hotel in a fantastic location! Helpful staff, good restaurants close! Starbucks across the street. Easy walking to subway,central park, broadway theatres. Hotel bar was closed, looked  like they had an on-site restaurant but it was shut down also, but the location is so good you donât need those things!;3
Myself and my son stayed there for 2 nights. Asked for a quiet room and got room on the 17th floor facing the 101 highway. The room had extreme traffic noise even very late at night. We had enough around 2AM as we couldnât sleep. The receptionist did not seem very empathic or very honest when she claimed all rooms get traffic noise. Had to insist to get another room not facing the highway. Got a room at the 20th floor facing Universal Studios and it was super quiet. No noise at all so evidently the receptionists did not tell the truth.  This ruined our first night in the hotel. Other than that the rooms are big, clean, comfortable beds. The location is amazing and you can get to universal studios in 5 minutes walk. We ate dinner at the lounge and it was just OK. Breakfast buffet;3
The good?   Cheap,  the room was clean, the hostel is nice and near the tube station,  The bad?  The receptionist who sits on the left side of the two is abrupt to the point of rudeness.   The Corridor doors are heavy and awkward to open, and shared toilet, clean but shared is never a great thing, and the bed, lumpy and uncomfortable.;3
The website looked much better than the actual hotel. Lobby was the most impressive part of the stay. Great location though. I probably will chose another hotel for my next trip to NYC. I've stayed in many different NYC hotels and I think this was my least favorite.;3
The Days Inn is a mixed hotel/lodge facility with character and a mix of staff attitudes. Location is exceptional with the subway around the corner and lots of places to eat. Note that there are older rooms and refurbished rooms which had an economical face lift.  Factor in time to transit the lifts (very nostalgic). I would suggest that when you book a room pay the little extra for the refurbished rooms and on arrival check that the rooms are what you booked for committing to payment. In our case, we arrived late and were given refurbished 2 x double bed rooms rather than King Sofa Bed. We were moved to King Rooms the next morning (only one sofa bed left). Strange that our booked rooms were not available the night before or the next morning. Seems that the hotel releases rooms;3
This is the only hotel I've ever stayed in New York City so I don't have a frame of reference for other hotels there. The room I was in was nothing special. But if you're just looking for a bed and this is all this is. The best thing I could say about it is it's very clear that subway station. If I was going to go back I would probably try to find A different hotel;3
No ensuite bathroom although each block had their own bathroom. The bedroom had a new carpet and the bed sheets were clean. Dated room and the Aircon needed cleaning but for the price paid it was ideal for travelers as you're not in the room much.;3
I have stayed at the Empire hotel three times now and have always had a great experience. The staff is always helpful and try to accommodate all of my needs.  I have celebrated several special occasions here and they always go above and beyond and have upgraded my room as well as left champagne for us.  I would definitely stay here again!;3
We stayed here for 4 nights in September when we attended NYC fashion week (not as models!). It was an excellent location but don't expect to find using the lifts easy as we often had to wait FIVE minutes for a lift - I know the hotel was full because of fashion week but it was pretty ridiculous. And I don't mind walking downstairs so long as they are well signposted and you don't have to walk through a laundry area/service area to get out into the lobby.  Nothing special, but a good location. The bar was nice - and they had no qualms about swapping a glass of champagne when I thought it was flat which was good of them.;3
If you are going to Lincoln Center or Columbus Circle, then maybe you should overlook my comments and book because of the location.   Otherwise...there are three points that are important to know about the hotel.  1. The woman who was working at the front desk could not be bothered to help us. Not warm. Not welcoming. Not willing.  2. Unless you are a slender person, you cannot stand in front of the sink in the bathroom in room 327. I'm a size 6/8 and I could barely squeeze in.  3. The charge for making the coffee in the room is $3 and the cost for making the tea is $2.50. Seriously?  On the other hand, the bellmen were terrific, especially the guy who handles the luggage room.;3
A bare basics typical mannhattan hotel. It does the job if you want to avoid paying 270+ . It has serviceable rooms and basic amenities . Great location next to many city attractions . Has a great 24/7 restaurant downstairs with good options menu . Front desk is average as you get the typical hurried reception assembly line . But that is expected for the price in mid Manhattan . This is not a upper tier hotel but if you are traveling with family or on a quick business trip this will do as most of your time will be outside the room and the hotel.;3
I have stayed at this hotel on two different occasions when visiting the area for business.  The hotel is very convenient to the business we were visiting and that is the only reason I stayed a second time.  The staff okay but you got a sense that they were tired of dealing with the consistent problems...particularly the elevators which were some of the slowest I have ever encountered.  The first stay the elevators were so slow we ended up walking down 10 flights of stairs in the morning.  The explanation from the staff made sense...upgrading the entire system.  What was surprising is that the elevators during the second stay 2 months later were in even worse shape.  Not only were they slow many times during the stay they did not work at all.  Again had to walk down this time 11;3
I didn't pay or 5th avenue, the place was clean & tidy after a long flight, room was what we asked for.;3
Location is ideal, which is what you pay for, as actual hotel was not worth the price.Very comfortable beds,however,had problems getting air conditioning to work properly,no vent fan in bathrooms,and no microwave(Not a huge problem,but if you stay more than one night good luck re-heating anything!);3
The location is excellent but the room is very small.  The television was problematic (had to call for help twice but it doesn't get the normal channels), I only had cold water in the shower the third morning.  I had asked for a wakeup call but did not receive one.  When I went to the basement to get ice (after an injury) I had to step over rolls of carpet and bags of debris to reach the ice machine.  I wouldn't stay there again.;3
This trip was to visit family for Christmas so I was only at the hotel a short time. The in-room phone to connect with the front desk didn't work.  One of two key cards didn't work.  The rug had a big stain on it by the bed.  The shuttle service was great. The location was great.;3
"The closest hotel to Universal. There is a shuttle bus to Universal but it's really not necessary as it's so close.   Stayed on the Executive floor but there is really nothing that special about it. There used to be a lounge but it was cut out as""too many friends of guests were using it"" according to one of the receptionists. Nothing to do with cutting costs then? They could offer internet as a perk but I guess it never crossed teir mind to ffer it as a perk to the exec level?  $17 for self parking or $22 for valet. Yup, a couple more extra charges.  And here's where it gets strange: You get coupons to have an ok continental breakfast which you can upgrade to a more comprehensive one.  It's really weird how you sit in a room next to the main breakfast one in a separate breakfast";3
We stayed for 7 nights and our room was just big enough for two which I believe is normal for NYC. You have to ask for a coffee maker as there are no kettles but be persistent as itâs our experience that it will not arrive after the first time of asking! The room was cleaned promptly every day and being on the 19th floor did not preclude the street noise from keeping you awake at all hours. Also fellow guest were always talking loudly as they passed your room so sleep was often interrupted, but that is probably part of the New York experience? We had the feeling that as we booked via a UK travel agent and paid in advance to get the best price we were given the âless good roomâ - didnât want to say the worst room as it was adequate and we only slept there (or tried to)! The;3
Recently took the family to New York and stayed at the New Yorker which is a wonderful old Art Deco style hotel. The position was sensational right in the heart of mid town close to the Empire State building, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens and the giant Maceys store. Was a bit disappointed with the internal condition of the hotel as its very tired but that didn't particularly worry us as we were out day and night looking around. Very nice diner attached to the hotel and staff were fantastic! Overall would give it 5 stars for location, 5 stars for staff and 3 stars for room condition!;3
Clean well kept rooms, but the rest of the hotel is tired looking. The actual room size is quite small with little room for your luggage, so you're always tripping over it all. The adjoining diner/restaurant is poor also. Having said all that, it didn't cost much and I suppose you pay for what you get, so I can't complain too much. It served our purposes being 2 mins walk from Mad Sq Garden, but we wouldn't stay there again.;3
Good location to get into town and the Park. Rather old feel all around. Old carpet and food smell in the hallway at 8th floor. Everything works in the room except that the closet door cannot be closed. Convenient eating and shops are close.  It was an OK stay.;3
"Let me start out by saying that if we had stayed in the first room we were given, this hotel would have been rated zero stars.  A very strange room with torn carpets and an odd concrete balcony strewn with garbage and cigarette butts.  The balcony had concrete walls with oval cutouts that provided a very limited view of the park and the city.  Luckily we were ab;le to have the room changed the next day and the new room was acceptable if somewhat small which is probably normal for NYC.  Staff for the most part was very helpful.  For NYC the prices at this hotel are great which for us was a very big plus.  Three blocks to the nearest subway stop.  However your are quite far uptown and thus away from the main tourist attractions.  This hotel would normally rate two stars in my book";3
This hotel feels like a small apartment building that someone has recently retrofitted into a hotel.  That's both good and bad, in some ways.  The most surprising thing, for a hotel, is...no elevator.  That's right, if you have a room on the 4th floor, you're going to have to walk up.  They are VERY good about taking your stuff up, so no worries about that.  In some ways, it's giving you a real NYC experience - the first apartment I had in NYC was a 4th floor walk up, and this felt VERY similar.  The rooms are TINY - mine was barely big enough to fit a twin bed - but again, this is NYC - what did you expect?    That said, the rest of the experience is fine.  The rooms are clean, the lobby is nice, the location is actually very central - you'll have to walk a few blocks to find;3
"Spent one night in this hotel following a concert in Central Park.  Location was great as the surrounding area was so quiet -- slept well!  King sized bed which was comfortable.  Yes the rooms are small -- it's New York.  My first impressions  were ""simple lobby, okay"".  Got on the elevator and thought 'Kind of old elevator, hmmmm.'  Stepped out of the elevator onto the 5th floor and thought the hall looked a bit sketchy and thought 'oh-oh'.  -- but once in the room all was fine.  Clean, very simple room.  Bathroom fine.  In the morning walked a block north to Park West Cafe and had great coffee and an inexpensive breakfast to start the day.  Would I stay here again, yes, if it was just to sleep.";3
We stayed at the New Yorker because I wanted to be near the Javitz Center for a trade show in October of 2010. The staff was helpful, but the rooms were a little small. I'd stay here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.;3
Clean with a friendly staff. The location across the street from Penn Station is excellent.  The room was small, and a long way from the ice machine not even one on our floor! Glad we were only there for one night.;3
Booked here as I wanted somewhere super close to Penn Station with a 24 hour reception.  This did exactly that, Penn station is literally just round the corner.  Service was amazing, super kind and friendly, including helping me with my suitcase and giving great directions.  The room was very small, and perhaps a bit more basic than the photos on the website I booed on.   Good shower and range of toiletries. Bathroom grouting could have been cleaner though and the room window had obviously not been cleaned in a long while.      Quite a noisy location at night, would recommend earplugs to deal with horns and sirens.;3
I always give honest reviews and was a little disappointed with this hotel.  Start with the negative  We stayed 4 nights in one of the cheaper rooms, well it must have been as the view was another hotel window on 33rd floor.  The room was tiny and the bottles of water they put were double the price of the 7eleven across the road loud roadworks could be heard as the windows didnât close properly  The lifts were hit and miss it took 15mins to get to reception Saturday morning as the full lift stopped on every floor down to 21 then went up again so annoying.  Plus points  Location was excellent and felt safe as security wouldnât let you up without a door card How water bath and shower were ok.  The diner attached was top class see my Tick Tock review  Most importantly the bed and;3
I booked this hotel over the internet, and I was not familiar with Los Angeles at all. Upon arrival, it was dusk, and the neighbourhood was very intimidating. We were less than pleased, and though we were booked for 5 nights we debated about moving hotels immediately. However we ventured out (in a car) and sunset and hollywood blvds. are only a minute drive. The hotel was fine, the food was fine, and the nieghbourhood is a little rough around the edges, but follow the protocol you'd follow in any major city, and you'll be fine. A car is handy as well.;3
"The location is very helpful. The hotel, however, is ""tired"" in many ways. You should be aware that the bathrooms are tiny. I'm 6 ft, 200 lbs and got around okay but there's not much room to play with here. If you're traveling alone and don't care this should work out. I wasn't and it was ""tight"".   Also, they have the completely stupid ""wifi only in the lobby"" policy. Its $13 a day to connect. Idiots. I'll do my best to avoid this and other hotels with such a dime you to death policy.";3
Very very expensive for one night. There were too many problems from start to finish and not enough help to resolve it, or they did not seem to care. The quality of their service was poor, especially for the amount of money that I paid to sleep for one night in New York. I was very disappointed. I'm not sure why people in the customer service industry think it is okay to just be dismissive and disrespectful to other. I paid my money to receive quality services and unfortunately that did not occur.;3
Close to Central Park 10 minutes walk and time square 20 minutes walk,rooms are a bit tired need some T L C Starbucks close by and restaurants 10 minutes walk all tastes catored for lot of walking under ground good and cheap;3
We stayed here 4 nights. After a long day of driving, we got to the hotel at 4:15 and were told the room wasnât ready (check-in starts at 3). The front desk staff was nice about it, held our bags, and we went to the rooftop bar. (Note-the rooftop bar was the best thing about our stay here. Great happy hour drinks, tasty bites of food, friendly and fast service, great vibe, and solid view. It was awesome).   We got into our room around 5:30. It was fine.  The blinds didnât work so we couldnât let light into the room which made everything really dark. There was an iron, no ironing board, and no informational booklet/folder about the hotel which seemed strange.    Second day of the stay were were gone all day out in the city and ran home at 5:30 to shower and get ready for dinner,;3
We had a packed itinerary of things to do and only used the hotel as a place to sleep, so it was ok.  Pros: Kind staff, clean, good water pressure+ reliable hot water, great location, private bathroom, 24hr door man, super easy check out/in anytime, AND we got 2 beds when there was only supposed to be one  Cons: The heater seemed to turn on and off when it wanted, bathroom floor had old dark tile that looked dingy, TV channels were awful, really really poor lighting, no washcloths, and vending machine gives 12oz drinks when it shows 20oz.  Overall for the price, you cant beat it.  Its the most afforadable clean hotel in a good location.  I would stay here again if I planned on being just as busy and only needed it as a place to sleep.  Definitely stay somewhere else if youre;3
"Need a place to stay while visiting someone with an apartment to small for guests?  This might fit the bill on Manhattan's Upper West Side with an  easy access to the subway.  It is located in safe neighborhood in the ""city that never sleeps"".  We did not appreciate the blue lights that were always on as a night light on the underside of the bed's head board.    Use your room key to get 15% off for breakfast at The Upper West Side Cafe, 2528 Broadway @ 95th.  (At that Cafe, be careful not to add your tip to the bottom of your bill's total, our tip was included within the bill.";3
"Stayed here three nights.  Perfect for going to Universal Studies, but that's also the reason I never stayed here before (too ""touristy"" a location for business).  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the location.  It's sandwiched between the 101 and 134 freeways... which means it's a good location to access the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood, or Pasadena whichever direction you want to go.  From that standpoint, it's a pretty good base for exploring L.A. (only beaches are less accessible).  Otherwise, it's a fairly standard Hilton.  I was on a floor BELOW the lobby which gave it a subterranean feel.  I would've appreciated more light and a view.  Front desk staff seemed a bit clueless when the group I was with was needing to check in a little early (one staffer knew how to";3
Russian riverboat cabin? No.  Roomette on Amtrak? No.  Cabin on a 1930s transatlantic oceanliner or perhaps the Venice-Simplon Orient Express? Very close.  West (Greenwich) Village location, and a Landmark building. The Jane's website sells its river views. Yes, it is literally directly across the Westside Highway from the Hudson River, but I'd estimate 90% of the rooms CANNOT even see the river at all.  Built in 1908 as a hotel for sailors and lovingly restored in 2008, The Jane is beautifully decorated like a 1930 oceanliner--steam pipes wrapped in rope, 1930s style carpeting and woodwork, some doors have nautical portholes. Inspired by luxury ship and train cabins from the 1920s/30s but with the latest technology...Individually dash controls the AC and heat, cable TV,;3
After a very long trip, and getting slightly lost after getting off at Penn St (completely our fault as it's literally round the corner) we checked in with Mohammed. We had initially asked for a quiet, high floor room, of which Mohammed told us that non of these rooms had outside windows. They were apparantly all indoor facing. Mohammed was a little abrupt and told us we had booked a budget room and implied that we should take what we were given.. We did not book a budget room, we booked through a travel agent and the room was expensive. I would usually challenge this attitude, however exhausted from our trip from Liverpool, I literally gave up and accepted a room which I was told was the best they could offer. The room wasn't ready however so we took a seat in the bar. Now upon;3
We booked the hotel not knowing that there is a renovation going on and we thought that we are going to get a newer room as shown on the website but instead we got an older room that needs a major overhaul. Our 5th floor paint job and wallpaper is poorly done (maybe it's the floor that is not renovated yet) the TV and dresser are very old. Bathroom lighting is not bright enough. For the price, there are newer construction hotel that has better amenities and quality than this.;3
My first impressions of this hotel were very low. It is messy and not well kept (peeling wallpaper and rusty old sinks) and the lift was a bit creaky.   BUT..... After a day exploring the city it was the perfect place to come back to and sleep.  I've just finished uni and therefore have no money but still wanted to see the sights of NY.  For me, this hotel was perfect because I knew that whichever hotel I was going to be staying in, I wasn't going to be spending any time there.  I didn't see much point in forking out an extra Â£100-200 or more to rent a room that I wasn't going to be in.  By staying in this place it meant I had more money for sight-seeing, shopping and eating out - which is, ultimately, what you go to NY for! There are plenty of bathrooms on each floor and I;3
Great location on the South Bank for the theatre, galleries and shopping. Nice helpful staff. Reasonable breakfast and comfortable hotel to use as an overnight base. Issue with the room not being cleaned one day only partially resolved. Overall it was a good place to stay.;3
Checkin problems, toilet very small and always wet, and internet limited to 2 devices in the room. Everything was ok but not an amazing experience. The rooftop was a nice place to hangout and the hotel was in a good location.;3
The good:  You can walk from Terminal 1 (Southwest) in about ten minutes.  The staff is great.  The quality of food is very good .  Good wine list.   Not so good:  The decor reminds me of what a clubhouse in a mobile home park might look like.  It looks very cheap, and isnât comfortable.  The bar is very awkward feeling . Cold modern and unwelcoming.  The bistro food area was very confusing.  Window shades ( a blackout and drape) are controlled by two hard to use chain pulleys. Trying to figure out which is which and then place yourself in the right position to raise and lower the curtains requires an associates degree in Cirque Du Soleil maneuvers. The TV wonât turn on unless you put your key in the slot near the door when you enter. I had to call about that since it was never;3
This hotel is in a great location. Penn Station is a block away and you can easily walk to many many places such  as Times Square, Broadway, Hellâs Kitchen etc. Its in the garment district so if you have a chance definitely take one of Mikeâs walking tours!   Anyway back to the hotel. We were there for my daughterâs birthday weekend. We arrived in the city at 10 am and expected to check our luggage but they had our room ready which was awesome! Except the bed was super small and there was zero room to walk/move. The room was on the 7th floor and TIGHT! The owners desk staff was very nice and helpful in getting us switched to a more appropriate room on that floor. This wound up being one that had room for a roll away since they said they had no more double beds.   Overall the;3
Most of the staff were great, the maid service were friendly and did a good job. My only gripe and it's a big one is one member of staff. Please note it was only one out of the 7 I encountered. On arrival there was a mix up with our rooms so they gave me a double for the night and asked that I moved the following morning which is fair enough. The room they gave me had not been cleaned, but I suppose they weren't expecting to use it that night.  I went to reception to ask for fresh towels and linen as the ones in the room were clearly not fresh her response was why didn't you ask for these earlier when the maids were here? I'd been at the hotel for less than an hour not that I should have to explain myself to her. She then got towels but said the linen was fine and she couldn't;3
It is in a good uptown location and the lobby is smart and I can see why it is very popular with European guests. However the rooms are small even by NY standards and the full size beds are really small.  Not only too narrow for 2 people but also quite short, however we are all 6ft and sharing a room for 4 people so it was a struggle  Might be ok if you are smaller!  The bathroom is tiny but the biggest problem we had was the air conditioning unit which was unbelievably noisy and kept us up all night.  However the hotel were extremely accomodating and offered to move us to another room but we decided to go to a hotel with larger beds and they kindly refunded us for the night.  Very helpful front desk.;3
Food was great. Parking is not free, Traffic to reach hotel was terrible. Service is excellent. Price was very good. Kids are allowed to stay with no extra charges. Staff is very co-operative. Hotel views are very good. Extremely clean, looks refreshing.;3
"The best thing about this hotel is the location.  The roof-top pool lounge area made the stay tolerable, because it allowed me to escape my cave-like room.  I don't mind small rooms, but the dampness of the air and the lack of natural light in the room resulted in my feeling I would have thrived better as a mushroom.  My colleague on a higher floor had the same complaints.  Her ""courtyard view"" room allowed her to see the window of the hotel guest in the adjourning wing of the same hotel (a view similar to mine).  The desk staff and concierge displayed very helpful and professional behavior and I appreciated that.  BTW, bring your own K-cups (or buy them in the shop on the street just outside the hotel entrance) or pay $3.00 per cup of coffee (or other hot K-beverage).  )Plus,";3
Usually book hotels myself after reviewing first but this time booked  through travel agent as was doing another trip tagged on to New York so i was a bit sceptical as what to expect. Arrived at night to be told that though a request had been put in for twin beds they hadn't been able to honour this as were fully booked. Wasn't too happy about this as meant sleeping in the same bed as my friend!. Receptionist said wasn't anything she  could do about it but she had allocated  a king sized bed.  As it happened it was ok as the bed was that big we may as well of been in twins, but this may have caused a problem if two men had been travelling together or a male and female friend. Think that if requests like that can't be honoured then the hotel should let you know so you can have;3
Good location but the hotel is in need of renovation. Hotel staff are not helpful and quite rude. We asked for a change of room and the manager was not helpful. The carpets and bathroom appeared to be original installation. Basic budget accommodation certainly not luxury;3
It seems like a lot of these reviews are not real. Too many posting from people with 1 contribution on Trip Advisor. This is a real unbiased review. When pulling up to the hotel from the main road I was concerned with the appearance and dated exterior. The nice fountain pictured is in the back gated parking area. I was greeted at the front desk by Pil. He was lovely, friendly and put me at ease with my choice of hotel. The room was basic and dated but cleanliness was no issue. I got a room facing the courtyard and it was very quiet the entire 2 nights of my stay. On to the reason you want to stay here. The free breakfast is fantastic and Hugo's reputation is well earned. Friendly and happy to serve up delicious omelets or waffles. In addition to the fresh made items there are;3
No having stayed any where else in midtown Manhattan, I found the room small and in need of update.  Everything was clean but the grout around the tub was in dire need of replacement, very mildewed. For over 250$US per night, I expected more. The location was excellent for access to the subway system and for walking everywhere though so I guess that is what you pay for. The next time I go to New York, I would stay outside of Manhattan and just utilize transit to get in and out of town as it's super easy to use, fast and efficient. Well worth the unlimited use Metro card price.;3
"Overall the hotel was ok, a few things kind of threw me off a little. Upon arrival the guy at the front desk couldn't even muster a ""Hello"", when I asked if this was were to check in his first reply is ""well you are way too early to check in"" (when I booked the hotel I had already requested an early check in to hit Universal Studios when it opened at 9am. The guy did what he needed to do to find us a room and says there's a $25 early check in fee. There was no mention of this fee when I called to book, but at this point we just wanted to drop our bags off and hit the park. Our room was just ok, nothing special. There was no mini fridge in the room, which I found abnormal in today's world. Another thing that drove me crazy was no hand towels or towel rack! In the shower - yes";3
We stayed two nights in a one bedroom queen off of the courtyard. I loved the location which was walking distance to quaint burros called Los Feliz, Silver Lake and Sunset Junction, Griffith Park and Frank Lloyd Wright's Eniss House.  Griffith Park has lots hiking trails and we were able to hike to the Observatory.  Los Feliz has many restaurants and a nice little wine bar. We found no need to have a car with these attractions being so close. It might have been different had we wanted to see other LA attractions.    The bedding was nice and comfortable with amazingly soft pillows. Our room and the hotel were very clean. Our room was very quiet since it faced a courtyard with comfortable seating and a lovely fountain.   Breakfast was fair. It was nice to have fresh scrabbled eggs;3
The hotel is quite old with very old furniture environment and rooms. I didn't feel comfortable at the first room they put me in so I've asked to move. It felt better but still old and not very clean. I found some hair in my bathroom and in my towels.;3
This hotel is a decent hotel. Do not expect perks and glamour, you will have a decent room, no thrills no frills, just a nice place to lay your head. The breakfast buffet wasn't all that great, but the service was good. You'll also enjoy their wifi.;3
Don't expect luxury it's good for one night or two with friendly staff my room was small but clean with bathroom and safety box and LCD  Located in China town near grand station but the internet was slow Not bad for the money and for one night stay it's ok;3
It's located walking distance to Central Park and directly opposite Lincoln centre.  Staff are helpful, superior room is small, bathroom very small, bed is v comfortable - but room was a tad tired looking and bathroom especially could have done with a once over.  I'd go back - as team there are helpful, location is good, I would have rated it 4 if more attention was paid to upkeep in rooms.;3
This would be an average motel style room elsewhere.  The price is reasonable for NYC standards, room is mediocre but is clean and thats what matters.  There is some sense of security at night with the night reception on duty.  Not many amenities but who stays in their room anyways.  Convenient location to Chinatown, Would not hesitate to stay here again.  Given the price it is not bad;3
The hotel is exactly what it is -a budget hotel in New York.. Why do people pay low prices and are then surprised when their hotel isn't as luxurious and modern as some of the others? Our room was not an upgraded one -it was worn with tatty furniture. But I had come to see New York not a hotel room so for the limited amount of time we were in the room it was adequate.  It was cleaned every day, sheets and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable. Customer service could be better although the maintenance man who came to open my safe was very cheery and helpful and the guy who stored our suitcases on the last day was  brilliant- maybe the rest of the staff could take a lead from them.  Although to be fair no-one was rude just direct with very little warmth or cheeriness. The;3
We stayed Saturday night in Rm 1127 and while the room was very clean and relatively new looking, I was surprised how much of it looked unfinished or not right. The beds had holes cut in the headboards which appeared to be for bedside lights, instead they had table and floor lamps. The table lamp took up all the space on the bedside table, the clock radio took what little other space that was left. The desk where you would normally put your laptop to work also had a lamp on it, and while it did not take all the space up on the desk it did take the only plug available to plug in the laptop. Apparently there was to be a flat screen TV on a wall as evidenced by the wall mount for the TV, instead on the only other flat surface was an old 25 inch CRT style TV and the wiring for it;3
Hard to perfectly rate this one. If I could, a 3.5 this time. The positives are a brilliant location, a historical building, good staff and overall convenience. Cool and decent diner connected to it which is open 24/7. Useable business longue. Views were great. It is a perfectly fine hotel for shorter stays in my opinion. If you want to feel you are really on vacation, the high-volume of hotel traffic will not provide that feeling. Tons of rooms and 6 elevators! Takes a while to get up and down. Elevator guards to check your room key reminds you this is located in a busy place where you gotta keep an eye out for floaters and belongings. While I was appreciative of a penthouse upgrade (would def get this room again), the water pressure was low and drainage was horrible. Sadly not;3
"Stayed in-town for a convention at the Javitz, and its great because you can walk right down there quickly! The rooms on the other could be disappointing. The first room we were in was a tiny tiny box, with a ugly bathroom. We got switched the next day to a bigger room which was fine.  So beware of the room size... I would say ask for a bigger room if possible.. say ""i may have a third party, so we may need room for a rollaway bed"" The rooms are not anything nice, so remember that.. its no Dream or intercontinental.";3
"I agree with Bella F. about the unexpected extra charges to my credit card for the amount of time I was a guest.  Quite a surprise but they were deleted promptly upon checkout.  Another hidden cost is the charge of $3 for each cup of coffee one makes with Empire equipment in one's own room - - tacky !  I was amazed at how inexpensive Bella F's room was.  My room was more than double her cost.  I can only caution prospective guests to check prices for this hotel at various times because they do have specials.  I would like to single out Nick at Reception.  Most of the Reception staff seem to have been taught not to smile; however, this was not true of Nick.  He was helpful and friendly.  The hotel indeed has a great location and the door men are consistently great !  My room was";3
"Had booked for 5 days, and at the time of check-in, I was told that the room was upgraded.   Staying in New York,  you do not expect big rooms,  but ""upgrade"" made me think it was a slightly better room.   There was absolutely no change, same 2 feet clearance around the bed and bathroom which was tough to fit even a person less than 5' 9"".  Except that there was coffee machine in the room.  The only advantage was that it was just 10 minutes walk to the office.";3
Stayed here for a few nights in July...good points: en-suite room, safe neighbourhood, tv in room, excellent air con close to underground and restaurants/supermarkets.  Points for improvement: clean sheets every night (pretty sure they are just sprayed with air fresher), friendly staff who can answer questions rather than come back tomorrow and speak to..., total cost to be paid on arrival includinging tax, updated beds and mattresses.  Like the title treat this like a middle of the range youth hostel;3
Spent 3 nights in hotel, excellent location for Times Square And Broadway. Negatives were that we were allocated very small room in fact would describe it as tiny, limited space for hanging clothes, had to live out of suitcase, one bedside lamp and hit bed trying to manoeuvre round it to get to toilet. Outlook was poor at back of hotel and extremely noisy with cooling fans operating all night. Would avoid room 421 at all costs.;3
this Hotel is in a great location.  Rooms are small but most are in NY.  Lobby nice but after you get past that this hotel needs a lot of renovation.  Going to the room the walls and carpet are drab and dimly lit.  Not at all welcoming.  They did not have our room ready when we got there (we were early) but they said if they did we could get in for ANOTHER $50.  We took our bags to the bell hop and that cost $5 a bag no matter the type of bag.  It is a shame when you pay so much for a room that all of that cost even more.  PATHETIC.  Staff was good.  Tick Tock diner was below average.  Have been there before but food was below average and the staff were not friendly at all and borderline rude.;3
We were allowed to check in very early - thank you!  The hotel certainly doesnt feel like pther regency hotels. It's new and comfortable but a bit basic.  Rooms are big. Walls are thin and I was aware of every plane taking off   Included breakfast has great continental options but the eggs, bacon etc aren't the best  Shuttle is frequent and easy;3
Superb location on 34th and 8th,  near enough to midtown Manhattan but far enough away to be quieter.  The hotel is undergoing a facelift outside which seems to be ongoing.  No noticeable affect inside.  Rooms are comfortable if a rather dated. Air conditioning is excellent especially for us from more moderate climates.  Staff are also plesent.  The tick-tock diner is great value, huge portions, enough to split with two kids if you have family.  The bar on the other side is also very nice,  a great happy hour and plesent efficient staff. The hotel has two sets of lifts. One for 1 to 20 and another for 20 - 40,  they are a little slow to arrive but very big.   Check in is also a little slow but given the volume of guests, it is efficient.  When you are booking, note the mandatory;3
The Hilton is good for its location if you have a family & want to walk to Universal. You have to factor in that if you have a car it's an extra $24 a night to park at the hotel. Try & request a view of the city or over Universal on a higher floor. (We didn't) It's closer than the Sheraton if you have smaller children. The breakfast is pretty average. The staff are very friendly though.;3
Stayed here just recently to be close to Universal studios.  Staff were friendly and helpful, can't really fault them at all.  However the property is showing signs of its age.  The bathrooms have been renovated at some stage but they did not replace things like the bath, they only coated it with paint and now that is peeling away. The elevators were the worst I have ever experienced.  Waiting for an elevator that never comes is frustrating, push the button and it stays on for 10 seconds then goes out but no lift ever arrives.  The staff had to ride the elevators and select floors otherwise people would be stranded.  Once you actually got in the elevator they were extremely slow and rough, bouncing at each floor.  The parking was $24 a day which is a little steep but convenient.;3
Â· We probably had the best one double suite in the place on the top floor - brilliant views of Empire State, WTC and even the Statue of Liberty. New York is not cheap and this room helped compensate for an otherwise jaded icon as a hotel in a city that is going downhill fast unless the city planners can sort out traffic, rubbish and social problems  Â· Location in central Manhattan is great on paper.... the reality is that Manhattan is not a romantic stay- the traffic is horrendous and constant noise from emergency service sirens to make a way through it only stops in the small hours- rubbish is piled every 50 yards on the pavements on all the main streets/avenues in bags for the nightly collections. There is a massive homeless and vagrant problem evident all around with rough;3
Biggest issue is the heating system did not work, and not only in my room, we are at a conference and everyone said that.  You could not regulate it at all and very uncomfortable.  On top of it room is very small which is OK but run down.  Staff is nice, but they need definite investment in this hotel.;3
"Very good location for what we wanted to do. Small room, as expected in NYC. Staff was friendly enough, but was a real test of patience for a simple item we asked for, for our room. (1 additional chair) Not a recliner, a desk chair. 3 calls to front desk. Also, we were NOT told of a (SURPRISE !!) $25.00 Facilities Fee upon check in. EXTREMELY upsetting and the desk clerk only offered, ""I'm sorry. You should have been told.""...........";3
It has excellent facilities and location, however, I want to show my indignation towards the cleanliness of it, since we stayed 3 nights my friend and I, and the person in charge of the cleaning did not do his/her job â¦â¦. only tended the beds and added clean towels.   	He/she never picked up trash, never cleaned the bathroom, which had an unpleasant smell of urine, and did not replace the consumables, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.   I have waited to put my complaint to leave, because I fear reprisals on his/her part, if I made the mention.    Excellent hotel, but honestly, I did not want to return like that, it's not worth the price we paid.;3
The hotel was OK.   It's bit small, but OK for short visits   Might visit again. Also would like the hotel to cater to guest more. For example they should turn down the bed @nights. Do things to make the stay special. The bathroom is very small. The bedding, should have more sheets on the bed.;3
We booked the hotel to have a place to 'land' during down times on a day trip to the City.  The location can't be beat and even my partner, who can be very picky, was pleasantly surprised by the accommodations and rate.  It was great to be greeted by Denis at curbside and use the valet parking.  Danny, at the front desk, was helpful and efficiently met our need to check in early.  The hotel has modern decoration and colors used (e.g. browns and golds) seem to make everywhere appear cozy but dark.  The room (a king) was European sized and well appointed. The bathroom while dated and small by USA standards was clean and met basic needs.  The heating unit needed attention because adjustment was not possible.  The room was warm and a bit of cooler fresh air would have been nice. We;3
"The Jane... Lovely building, quaint, small rooms, but just lacked the ""I'll definitely be back"" spark. The rooftop bar is cool, but very often closed, and the downstairs bar is pretty, but always seemed to be closed for a private function. Also, if I'm being truly lazy, it's quite a walk to the closest subway, especially when you're laden with luggage,which has just broken a wheel. Staff on the other hand were great.";3
World of Hyatt status not recognized. Consequently no benefits received. Third time I stayed here this year. Always seems to be something. But hotel is the closest to LAX.  Can walk to Terminals 1&2, Terminal 3 ok getting far to walk for seniors. Does have a shuttle bus.;3
The hotel was pretty good, however the rooms are small. We are not satisfied that we got charged for an amount on our creditcard although we had't consumed anything. Therefore in the end we are not completely satisfied with this hotel.;3
Stayed at Days Hotel, 14 to 17 April 09, inclusive, allocated there by JetlineCruises.com. after a six day Atlantic crossing on Queen Mary 2 (which was fabulous). Days Hotel has probably had better 'days'. Room was dark and tired. However, bed linen and bathroom towels were spotless. Located upper west side of New York. Had we known better would have asked for a hotel more central.   The extra cost of somewhere more central would have been have been covered by what we paid out in taxi fares to and from hotel. For anyone on a very tight buget the hotel would probably be ok. On two positive points there is a great dinner, 'New Key West', just around the corner. Had breakfast and late dinner there both nights. much cheaper than eating in central New York. The quality and quantity;3
"Overall the hotel itself was nice, The reception Nicole at the front desk was very sweet and Checked us in early. The room wasn't what I was expecting  the bathroom was outdated and run down but overall the room was clean and the workers cleaned my room everyday which was a plus and they were friendly. Breakfast was good. I went to the bar downstairs and every drink I ordered I found a bug in it (fruit fly maybe)  but the bartender was nice and always made me a new one. overall the hotel and workers were nice and The hotel itself wasn't a bad experience. The area itself is disgusting!!! Homeless and DRUG ADDICTS everywhere, Garbage on the streets definitely not what I was expecting I am from New York where I'm ""supposed"" to be used to this but I never seen anything like this.";3
My boyfriend and I booked this Riad after reading all the amazing reviews on here and although the reviews about the impeccable service of the staff were not wrong we were slightly disappointed.  I feel like all the reviews focus solely on the service which covers up the cracks really. Yes the staff can't do enough for you however there has to be more to a holiday than service.  The main negatives were:  You really can feel quite isolated as it's a nightmare to get to and from the Riad. First of all the walk which is like going through a maze takes around 15 minutes before you get to a road - you cannot look lost otherwise one of the kids on the streets will pick you up and start leading you somewhere which you have to pay for the privilige of. When you are in the hotel itself;3
The hotel is beautiful, clean and the staff wonderful, but the noise we experienced while staying there was unbearable.  First it was the construction noise all night long, then got moved to a nicer room, but I swear we were in the elevator shaft as we heard (and felt) the elevators rising/falling all day/night. Other than that, the place is great!;3
So we stayed in a Junior Suite for our trip to New York recently, which was booked for our first anniversary. On paper this is quite a premium New York City hotel. Just off Columbus circle, minutes from Central Park and a short walk or cab drive to broadway.   Iâm not sure if we were a bit unfortunate because we had a huge flight delay which meant we arrived at 4am, but the welcome was a bit underwhelming to say the least, especially for a city that doesnât sleep apparently as there was no one to greet us at the door or help with luggage and the guy on the front desk wasnât hugely welcoming either, I hardly got two words out of him.  On getting to the room it was freezing, so we put the heater on which was the noisiest thing ever. I had messaged ahead to see if they had;3
Stayed here recently with the family.  The location is good for those wanting to do the Universal Studios theme park, but the hotel seemed dated and not up to usual Hilton standards.  For example, the hotels at Universal Studios Florida are much higher quality.  The price (I assume due to location) was not justified by the hotel rooms and amenities.  Also, it appears that Hilton HHonors has discontinued complimentary hot breakfasts for members and instead providing a continental (cold) breakfast.  Why hot breakfast at Hampton Inn, but not Hilton?  A poor move considering many loyal HHonors members.;3
"It;s in the midst of chinatown.  Not my favorite place to be, but it is safe.  The rooms are pretty basic, not sure it should qualify as a two star, but you get a prety small room, hard beds, dusty tabletops, bathroom countertops and desk. At least bathroom and sheets were clean.  Towels looked a little brown, I brought my own.  You do get soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste in case you forgot your own.  The WiFi worked fine for me and we had a medium sized flat screen t.v. in our room that made it look a little nicer, but rarely ever used.  There was a safe in the room, but I didn't need it.  It's perfect walking distance to financial district, little italy and the subway station is just 1 block away and it takes you anywhere you need to go.  So in that sense it was great.";3
"We decided on this hotel because of an airline package through Jet blue Airlines. I called the day ahead to confirm reservation and to ask about early check in.  Our stay was 4 days. The hotel charge $75.00 for early check-in but this did not happen because they were fully booked.  We arrived at the hotel  little after 9 am; we went ahead a did pre-check in. We were told to come back about 2:30 the earliest. I was told that the hotel charge a resort fee of little over $20 per day , however because we did our booking through the airline it was $ 10. I am not sure why we were been charge a resort fee because this was not a resort and we did not utilize any of the services that the fee included.  We got to our room and I must say I was little disappointed. The carpet in the room";3
"Had a 5 night stay in this Upper West Side hotel. 100 yards from the Lincoln Center, the prices in the surrounding restaurants were to be expected. However the hotel location is terrific. Central Park in 5 minutes, the aforementioned Lincoln Center in one ; Columbus Circle is 5 minutes away with it's subway connections and high end shopping. You can't go wrong. The rooms were typical Manhattan, quite compact and ours had a view of some air conditioners - but this isn't a bad thing compared to noisy streets. Well equipped, lovely rooftop terrace and plunge pool. We only tried the attached Chowder House for breakfast and it was fine and the PJ Clarke's downstairs was good for burgers etc. but, again, unsurprisingly expensive. There is a Starbucks (of course!) in the same block as";3
This def isn't a fancy place to stay, but was good enough even with our 3 year old daughter. The location was great just a short walk to all the shopping and fun things to do in Chinatown as well as downtown area short train ride. Ask the front desk a good place to eat and they will giv u great suggestions we went to an amazing Chinese place that u would never find or even think of goin to if u don't ask the locals. The air conditioner leaked water but apart from that was an average hotel in a good proximity to a fun time;3
We stayed at the hotel during a recent family trip to New York. The hotel is a step back in time, but also tired and ragged at the edges. Check in was not great, arrived at 8pm and didnât get all 3 of our rooms till after 10:30pm, suspect this was partly due to us pre- requesting we were all on the same floor. Staff were apologetic and we were given some drink vouchers and credit on the resort fee which was appreciated. Staff at the hotel are friendly including room cleaners, always made to feel welcome. Location of the hotel is great whether you want to go up or down town. We walked pretty much everywhere, but the subway is well located for those who donât. Tick-Tock diner was great (portions are large) and the staff very friendly, a good breakfast to get you going. Would;3
Very poor elite status recognition. Staffs need training. Lounge food is poor. I didn't have time for breakfast.   Location is good as it is right next to LAX. Didn't use the shuttle service so cannot comment.;3
For the price it was good, but on the reservations it didn't say that there was a 16% tax and a $3.50 a person tax making it $145 a person not $133 like we thought. The celling fan was loud but not as bad as the A/C which is a window unit. The elevator fit one person plus lugauge. The fridge in the room smelled, there was a kitchen but no tools. The shared bathroom was for like 8 other rooms so sometimes we had to up a floor. The internet signal was so bad we couldn't get it on the 2nd floor room. The night guy was very helpful though.;3
This is my second time at the Jane, I loved it the last time,although I had a room at the backs then. This time we had a tiny room on Jane Strret which was on the 3rd floor and the night time noise was unbelievable. The ballroom downstairs had music on till around 3am...although I am a light sleeper and had walked around all day and was very tired, I could not block the noise out. The shower has great water pressure..no problems sharing.;3
We picked the New Yorker based on the location due to the purpose of our trip (business/sightseeing). We arrived early around 11:30 a.m. coming from Penn Station. Check in was not an option as I had called the night prior and I was told there was a fee if a room was a available (no room available). We were able to do âprecheck inâ which just meant we gave them our credit card and ID and phone number and they would call us when a room became available. We could hold our bags there until then. Here comes another fee $5- per bag to hold our bags. This is another first for us. We have never paid to have our bags held in any hotel weâve stayed at. At that point it was 12 pm and when we returned to the hotel it was around 4:30-5 pm and it was insanity. The hotel never called to let me;3
The hotel is in the best possible location: right next to Madison Square Garden and a Metro entrance, which makes moving around very easy. We even walked to Central Park, which was only 30 minutes away on foot. The room was quite small, though, and the bed and pillows had seen better days. Some of the staff were very nice and helpful, but others could really improve their manners with guests.  It was also FREEZING cold in the lobby, especially, and corridors. Caught a cold from coming to the August heat in the street into the hotel.;3
"The hotel's location is great! Its close to restaurants, not far from Penn Station, Times Square, Central Park and several subway lines.  The hotel itself is starting to show some signs of age, as there were renovations being done during our stay.    As part of a promo for a movie premiere we stayed in the hotel's supposed ""best suite,"" for 3 days and 2 nights. The suite was nice and accommodating; however, if personally paying $800+ a night, I would expect more from hotel accommodations.  The suite offered a semi-private bedroom with en suite.  The door to the bedroom did not have a locking feature and did not close all the way.  While the room came fully stocked with a wet bar and snacks consumption / use of anything would require an extra charge e.g. Evian water $10, peanuts";3
While the staff were friendly and attentive to our requests for assistance, the hotel appears to be relying on its history as a very large major hotel in New York The rooms are quite small, we were advised at reception when checking that no rooms have a King bed.  We had to do with a Queen bed for the 6 nights we stayed.\ There was no fridge or tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  There was only one chair that could be used right up next to the bed if one of the two of us wanted to watch TV while the other one had to sit on the bed.  The hotel foyer and hallways on room floors are dated and need brightening up.;3
It was our second time staying at The Empire, our fist stay in 2009. After a great first experience, we couldn't wait to go back. However, The Empire turned out to be a disappointment. The rooms are so small, there is hardly anywhere to put your bags. The bathroom is the size of an airplane bathroom and in desperate need of maintenance. The shower doesn't have a full door, and everything in the bathroom becomes wet. Because of this, there was a bit of mold on the floor, and the wallpaper was beginning to peel of the walls. The rooftop pool views are amazing, but the pool is about the size of a bathtub. Although the hotel is in need of some maintenance, it is in a very good location, only a short cab ride to Broadway and SoHo.;3
The high-points of this hotel > the location and Chris at the Concierge desk. He was very helpful. The atmosphere was modern and pleasing to the senses. However, if you are there in the Winter you will need a coat to sit at the bar in the lobby as they keep the entrance doors open.;3
Ok, here is the scoop on the Jane.  I loved the location,  West Village.  The rooms are very small but the shared bath is always clean.  There are some locals that live there and that is a bit odd, but they dont bother you.  The club is VERY popular and at night trying to get into the one entrance shared with the club is not easy,   Basically have to beg the bouncers to get by.  Huge crowds outside trying to get in.  Id stay again, the price is great.   Staff is nice;3
We reserved a month ahead of time as part of a package from Universal Studios. We selected a room with a pool view. We called the hotel directly day before we arrived to confirm. We were informed the check in was 3 pm. We arived at 3:30 and were to there was a only disabled room but it was not ready or we could have a room next to the stairs overlooking the parking lot. We had to wait 45 minutes for the room. The room as clean and modern consistent with Hilton quality that we expected. I sorry we have dogs but don't feel the need to bring them on trips, but for those that do please don't lock them in the room all day and night. We called to complain after we left our room in the morning hearing a dog barking, came back during the day to rest and it was still barking, and at;3
We reached late night, after a long journey.  09th 08 2018  Room was small. Didn't look very inviting. As we were really tired traveling, just crashed out for the night. Next morning we had the impression the breakfast was on the house, - so it was on booking. But were not served. Otherwise an average stay.;3
This hotel is certainly comfortable, and is in a central location within walking distance of many of the key NY attractions and close to the subway too, but it is a bit tired. In particular our bathroom was very dated and in need of a refresh. We didnât use the restaurants (apart from a quick coffee at Tick Tock - weirdly served in metal mugs!) so I canât comment on the wider facilities. Itâs an underwhelming hotel but is clean and serves a purpose as a place to lay your head.;3
Standard double room was very small with very old en-suite. Customer service is shocking in this hotel, rude, abrupt and arrogant. Definitely not worth its stars and itâs not cheap. Having said all that the location is perfect, but thatâs all this hotel has going for it and lives off that as the hotel is very antiquated and shabby in parts. Would not stay here again.;3
I'm writing this review from the hotel now. I'm staying in the 3rd floor, a cabin room, traveling solo. I booked directly with hotel. I've stayed in many boutique hotels and this one is definitely one of the quirkier ones. To make it easier I'm going to divide review into positives and negatives... Positives: - hotel location is surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes - The staff is very friendly  - Hotel is kept very clean and that's including the shared bathrooms - Barely no wait time to use the showers...btw... the rainfall shower head  is fabulous! - rooms aka cabins are ultra tiny but good use of space and storage - see pics - bed firm but comfortable  - hotel has tremendous charm and character  - subway 10-15 minutes away (A train )    Negatives: - this has been;3
Don't stay here during really cold weather. There's no central heat and with 30 degree lows a space heater didn't cut it.  Room was modern and upgraded. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast offered consisted of an omelette station, Belgian waffles, a few hot sides, fruit, cereals and pastries.;3
This hotel is in a superb location for accessing all part of NYC.  However, I was very disappointed at how tired the rooms were. There were 4 of us and it was a special occasion so I booked We booked a 2 Double Beds New Yorker View Suite and given the price I had high expectations. What a disappointment, it was very very worn and felt very grubby. We all felt so flat that I went to reception to see about moving room. They managed to move us to a 2 Double Beds, Executive Room which was supposedly newly renovated.  It was a major improvement in terms of how it looked and felt but it was a quarter of the size of the suite and there is no way it had seen any renovations newly! Having said all this, bearing in mind you will probably not be spending much time in your room other than;3
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 4 nights and found the hotel to be a bit far from anywhere. Having only a few days to explore the tourist areas, we had to catch a subway down to the main area. The hotel seemed to be in a bit of a dodgy area for a hotel we thought was in the heart of Hollywood!  The hotel itself was nice- comfy bed, good breakfast and amenities like pool and gym. Next time we will look for somewhere walking distance to restaurants, shops and tourist sites. If it was just a little closer to the main area we would have been very happy.;3
I stayed 6 nights at the Hilton Universal City while participating in a ballroom dancing competition held at the hotel. I enjoyed a large and comfortable room. The facilities both in the pool area and the ballrooms were excellent. The staff serving both in the restaurant and the bar were unpleasant and inefficient. They seemed to have difficulty processing guests staying within the dance competition package. This led to repeated unpleasant exchanges at meal times. Also there was plenty of food but it wasn't very tasty. Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay.;3
Location is nice. Parking is expensive and the rate is confusing. Carpet is disgusting. Bathroom needs a fan or air vent. Service is good. Digital Key never worked even though the staff reprogrammed it and ensured me that it's working fine. My Bluetooth and NFC is on so that's not the issue.;3
Recently (last weekend)  I reserved two rooms at the Empire hotel. Both rooms were reserved online at the same time as a single reservation. I reserved the rooms to bring two of my grandchildren to NY at the holiday season in December.   I reserved the rooms three months in advance, but I have learned that grandchildren may get sick, etc. and such plans are always subject to change. For that reason I requested refundable rates.   When I received the confirmation it turned out that one room was refundable and one was not. I discovered this the next day (on Sunday night) and called early the next morning to inquire. I was told that the money for one room had been already charged to my credit card. I then called the manager twice and left my cell phone number but the call was not;3
"For years the Empire Hotel, across the street from Lincoln Center, was a seedy, rundown venue. In those days, it deserved the comment I once heard from American composer Morton Gould: ""I don't mind the cockroaches, I just wish they wouldn't charge you double occupancy for them.""  But the hotel closed for a few years, was rumored to be converted to condominiums when the real estate bust hit, and it was eventually taken over by the World Hotels chain and completely renovated. It is now clean, elegantly appointed, and continues to benefit from being across the street from Lincoln Center.  Unfortunately, the renovation did not include re-building the rooms. They are tiny, as are the bathrooms - where there is barely enough room to change your mind.  The poorly designed shower makes";3
Check in was friendly and efficient. This is a huge 24 floor hotel next to Universal studios. We didn't have a car and found it handy to walk just 10 minutes down the road to the metro station.  We booked an executive room which was on 20th floor. The room was as pictures show really quite dated! I could see no reason that this was any different from a standard room apart from the free continental breakfast coupons. with the breakfast coupons you can use these as 13 dollar credit to anything from the main menu or buffet - this was only really explained to us on our 2 nd morning. We were facing the very busy freeway so glad we were on a high floor as there was a constant hum from the road.   As other reviewers have said the walls are paper thin! On our first night we were woken;3
Rooms could be cleaned more thorough. lots of dust in the windows and around the room in the corners. Bathroom could use a sliding door preventing shower water from spraying into the tiny bathroom. Also, more power sockets would be useful as there was only one to charge your devices. A/C makes a lot of noise and definitely needs maintenance.;3
"Paid extra for ""City View "" and early check in.  There wasn't a room available when we arrived  (after 1pm) and when we did get a room, we were greeted by a view of a brick wall.  If you put your face against the window and looked at an angle, you could see part of a great view.  It is an old property, so I expected the rooms to be small, and it was. The bathroom was extremely cramped with no place to set personal care items.  The decor was nice, the bed comfortable and the room was clean, but ovetall the stay was rather disappointing.";3
Got the hotel on Priceline with name your own price. Desk help was okay. Nothing great but nothing had to say. The lobby is very nice compared to the rooms. They spent way too much money on the lobby and not nearly enough on the rooms. The room was clean and no issues there. The restroom was actually quite large by manhattan standards even when compared to much nicer hotels.  They safety is questionable. The windows open all of the way and the radiator heater May not be safe with children. All and all. It's 4 walls and a clean bed.;3
The New Yorker is well situated, especially if you are attending events at Madison Square Garden or wanting to shop at Macy's. It's also an easy walk to the Times Square/Broadway area if you are reasonably fit. Security is good, with entry to elevators monitored. The staff is personable and helpful overall, but be sure that you approach the information desk and not the Wyndham sales desk closer to check-in, where you will have to escape a fairly-high-pressured real estate pitch. When first built, it must have been a real top-tier hotel. Its features reflect its age. It has an elegant lobby. Some rooms that are quite spacious and some that are quite cramped. Ours was one of the latter, and we could hear the guests in the next room well enough that we could probably have;3
"During our stay we lived on the Wyndham New Yorker hotel in the middle of Manhattan. I was very excited to visit this hotel based on picture and information I`ve found on the Internet. When we arrived I was a bit confused. The hotel is rather old and not what I call ""up to date"". I was also a bit shocked about the fact that there was no ordinary breakfast restaurant at this hotel, only a small diner where you could buy traditional american dishes for breakfast. The placing of the hotel was rather good. Short way to the Times Square, Empire State building, Macys, different shopping etc. But due to the very high price, I was a bit dissapointed about the hotels condition on the inside.";3
I paid approximatively $50 a night with expedia, so for the price i found this hotel very OK. The breakfast was normal (eggs don't have a taste, that's right), the room was ok. My internet connexion worked fine. I had a room giving on Vermont and the windows weren't double gazed, so sometimes it was noisy.  The room and towels were clean. They did not offer a lot of services, I asked for some universal tickets, they didn't have any. I asked them to print a file for me and they couldn't. I had to go to the Staples next door to make it...  The location is good for tourists but way too far the ocean.;3
Flew in from Chicago Illinois for a business meeting. Stayed here for only 1 night. The room wasn't the greatest. Stayed 2116. Needs to be updated. Lots of small dents in the wall. Felt like a MOTEL not a hotel. However, the staff was excellent. I wasn't feeling well, and they gave me a later check out and the security guard Danny Gonzalez was absolutely extraordinary. Very well mannered and attended to all my needs. If I stay again, I would only come back because of how professional and friendly the staff were;3
Stayed here for 4 days with my son. The location is fantastic, very close to the subway and many great restaurants. The neighbourhood is safe and relatively quiet (it is NYC after all...) We stayed on the top floor in one of the newly renovated rooms which was really nice and contemporary. Linens were new and very clean. The only downside is that hot water runs out at night and that the staff at this hotel is not friendly or helpful at all. If you just want a clean basic room, this is it!!;3
Good location close to Columbus circle and the Lincoln centre. Busy lobby that seemed dominated by a very active bar.   Service was good (cleaning, door man and concierge). We upgraded to a larger room with a seating area given the earlier reviews. This does give extra space, although space still is an issue for storing bags, clothes as there wasn't a true closet. The bathroom was small and again tough to store anything or maneuver.  Overall this would be a solid back up if another hotel wasn't available ( crowne plaza, westin, Parker meridian);3
We stayed here for 2 nights as we were visiting Universal Studios and Hollywood.  The hotel is in a great location for Universal and we realised it was actually easier to walk than get the free shuttle.  The hotel room was ok and whilst I appreciate they are sprucing the rooms up, it was very tired and the price tag is very high still.  We found the pool area quite small and there were not many areas to sit.   We were a bit disappointed as we were trying to get some milk for our young son to drink and no one could help us, we hadnât been able to stop and get any, we presumed the hotel would be able to help as we hadnât had a problem in any other hotel.We first of all tried the small shop in the hotel which didnât have any, we then got directed to Peetâs which charged $4 for a;3
Hotel next to main subway and only 10 minutes walk to Times Square. Water bottle in room eight dollars, bottle of Jamesons whiskey 255 dollars....do not worry cheap supermarket next door!! Did not sample hotel food although overall it was a good hotel, helpful and pleasant. Taxis on door step, room very nice although noisy aircon unit.;3
For December in NYC price was okay. An older hotel. Said they had renovated recently, but couldn't tell in our room. NY hotels have small rooms and they would certainly help guests by putting in some hooks in bathroom to hang clothes/towels.  This was walking distance to Empire St Bldg, Macy's, and Theater district (in good weather).  Friendly staff and also a good restaurant connected to hotel with very good breakfasts.;3
Hotel is well placed.  Our room was plenty big enough, with two bathrooms. Very pleased that the aircon was efficient without being overly noisy. Despite the complete lack of a view and the Hotel feeling a little dated would probably stay here again as it was very reasonably priced & we didn't spend a great deal of time (awake) in the room;3
Most inexpensive rooms are dark interior courtyard rooms. You can pay $$$ for upgrades to rooms higher up with views and light but you should then consider staying in a nicer overall hotel away from Madison Square Garden area.;3
I have just got back from a break at the Riad Kheirredine,the riad  has been described many times very highly rated in trip advisor ,so my overall feelings were disappointing the staff were great but it seemed more Chiefâs not enough Indians.the abundant fruit was topped up often but bruised or bad fruit left underneath.we would be asked how was everything & asked if we wanted anything  time & time again only for nothing too arrive or delivered. The evening menu wasnât up to the standard that a top draw riad should be delivering .free laundry is a bonus.          Maybe I stayed on a week that was a hiccup but that shouldnât happen;3
We have mixed things to say about this hotel.  The room itself is fine, clean but relatively small, as one typically expects in NYC.  But the main negative we're writing about is the elevators.  We were on the 8th floor and could easily wait over 5 - 10 minutes to get an elevator to stop on our floor.  While waiting for one, we would typically watch as they would just go past our floor without stopping, time and time again.  And when one finally did stop, it would stop on every floor on the way down, despite the fact that no buttons, other than Lobby, were pressed.  And what made this more frustrating, was that we were at the hotel in the spring and the problem was present then as well.  We complained to the front desk about it and we do have to say that the manager, Mr Ze, who;3
We have stayed in the hotel three times now and have never been disappointd. Yes there are marks on the carpets from decorating etc. but the rooms have always been clean. The toilets have been spotless every time. This November the room the wife and I occupied was quite large and did not have any complaints.  Very handy for the subway and a good safe area to stay in. Can recommended the Firehouse of Columbus & 85th for a good drink and meal. Also Roths steakhouse also on Columbus.;3
Great location to the Studio - about 10 mins walk. Rooms are of good size as well and amenities sufficient. Beds as expected are comfortable. Although hotel is under going renovation, it is minimal inconvenience to me/my family as we are out most part of the day. Breakfast spread including hot food is sufficient to fill the stomach but I would not term it lavish. Tried the seafood dinner buffet as well and spread was ok. A few front desk staff were friendly and helpful during my stay, always addressing and greeting me whenever I walked by.;3
The hotel is located within a few blocks of LAX. The interior was recently renovated and looks spiffy. Clean, comfortable, no noise problems.  Drawbacks: Parking is several blocks from the hotel. Walking can be a pain. At evening rush hour, there is usually one front desk clerk, making for prolonged checkin times.;3
Myself and a friend stayed here after we had spent two nights at White House NYC (don't go, it's horrific). We needed somewhere to stay for a third night so I opened up Trivago and basically picked somewhere else on Manhattan that was very cheap.  The hotel was really nice and well kept in all areas, but the rooms were very small, we had a bunk bed and I'd say if we werent in the room too, you'd struggle to squeeze a second one in the room (that's how small it was), the bathrooms were shared with other guests but all really clean and well maintained.  The rooms also had a couple of TV's and air con - which was really loud so we couldn't have it on whilst we slept and we couldn't leave it on when we left the room either because the room key has to be plugged into the wall to;3
"Accommodation was average. It is a room with a bed, bathroom, small fridge, cable TV and not a lot else. Though upon closer inspection, the tiles in the bathroom were chipped and some completely broken.  There is a nice outdoor area that claims to have a bar open...but it never was...and ""opening times and dates are subject to change"". The Route 66 bar downstairs was pretty good.   The area the hotel is in is close enough to Hollywood but far enough that you wont want to walk it. There are some close fast food outlets nearby but nothing amazing.  The ""fitness centre"" is a small room that if it had more than 1 person would feel crowded.  The complimentary buffet breakfast was really good. The chef made the best omelets! The staff were really helpful. Good experience, but pretty";3
Great location.   Great security procedures at the entrance and in room. We must show the room key to the security personnel before getting in the elevator. When we returned to the room during the room cleaning was in service, the cleaning personnel asked us to put the key card to open the door in order to proof that we stay in that room.  Bed and restroom cleaning are good.   The hotel should improve the cleanliness in the hallway, corridor, entrance, and the far to reach areas in the room, such as lightning/lamps, bathroom-vent on the ceiling etc. It was very dusty and dull the the hotel very greatly. The dead-bolt at the door was out of order. The room smelled a bit and we sensed overpower use of the air refreshing spray to override the odour in the room.  We were so far;3
Very clean but basic rooms, good view over central park. The only downside is the distance from Downtown.  For a weekend it may be worth paying the extra to stay downtown as what we saved by staying at this hotel we ended up spending in taxis.;3
Disappointed when the private bathroom I reserved was not available when I arrived. I ended up sharing a bath, but it was a minor inconvenience, and the price was changed accordingly. Room was clean and quiet, shower hot, staff friendly. A step above a hostel, with a fantastic location.;3
This hotel was OK.  The facilities were nice, but the amenities were bare bones for a 'luxury' hotel.  You could tell that they were cutting costs.  Expected a bit more from this class of hotel (no robes, mouthwash, only provided two towels per room, etc.) Food was good.  Breakfast buffet was excellent. Rooms were very soundproof and of adequate size. Front desk was a bit disorganized and canceled our reservation that was prepaid for the night before we arrived in order to guarantee an early check in so that we could get ready for an event immediately upon arrival (actually they resold our room in order to make a little extra $$).;3
Good price for NY but you get what you pay for. Super small room albeit fun, so fine for a jetlaggy one nighter but would not recommend you book for any longer. Great location for checking out the area and fun staff. Popular night spot so only book if you plan on getting stuck in. You will hear it weather you like it or not.;3
Renovations were taking place in the entrance foyer so it was bit of a mess when we were there.  Check in staff member was awful, she was extremely unwelcoming and unhelpful which was really disappointing.  Hotel is about a 5 minute, easy walk from Universal Studios and Universal City Walk which if full of restaurants and shops.  There is also a shuttle bus that runs between the total and Universal City Walk.  Our room was large with a great view of Universal Studios.  The beds were very comfortable and amenities were good.;3
well small rooms but clean and great location - where else can u get a room in ny for less than 100$;3
"I expected a lot from this hotel, because this was THE hotel in the Gossip Girl serie. When we arrived I was very impressed by the reception (good service) and the lobby (look and feel), but when we arrived in our room we found out that it was very small. It is a perfect place if you only come here to sleep. It is not really a room where you stay a little bit longer in order to relax. Although the room was small, the room and the bathroom are clean.  The hotel is a rowdy hotel; so if you are looking for a quiet hotel, I dont recommend this hotel. Positive thing about this hotel is the location. This hotel is perfectly located! You reach Central Park within 5 minutes and Time Square in approx. 10 minutes. Disadvantages of this hotel is the wifi; it is quite expensive (approx 70";3
"a block from the ABC subways so that was handy when we arrived late in the evening...that said, it was not the most inviting lobby; but,average; the clerk was polite.  Up on to third floor; extremely dingy hallway; both walls, odor, carpeting....  Room tiny with very poor lighting( and one desk light had a broken bulb, too)..bathroom clean although the tub constantly dripped all night; shower pressure adequate; the tub itself was miniscule!!! (but it held water at least!!!)  tv had one channel working only...  and, NO WiFi in the room even for cellular phone data!! Our connections showed ""DaysInn94"" and then it would disappear...only to connect to an adjacent hotel Newton, but one couldn't use that due to needing their password...that is so frustrating since the lobby clerk";3
We spent five nights here over Memorial Day, and it was just fine. Things I loved: the location. I pushed a stroller from here to Union Square and back and it was just fine. Obviously convenient to anything uptown on the West Side, too. There is a fantastic Whole Foods in the basement of the Time Warner Bldg a couple blocks away that made for some easy, cheap late-night dining. The parking! I got a valet package, that included in and out. It was SO convenient to drive up, have help unloading, and then walk away. There were a few hiccups with pickups -- they're using a new text system, and I think they're still figuring it out. The beds are very comfy and the rooms, though small, are nicely designed. I found the staff to be generally helpful, though not particularly outstanding.;3
The rooms here were tiny but cheap with double beds. We knew this when we booked but somehow in the event they actually are even smaller than you expect. That said, the feel of the place was very good and despite having to move rooms three times on our first night (after the flight from the uk) it was not a bad stay. There is a nightclub in the hotel which worried us as in the uk that would be a recipe for disaster, but it was fine and, much to the annoyance of the club door staff (who were turning away c.50% of people) we even went in for an overpriced drink $10 per drink, tips expected on top). This was a small part of a larger trip for us so budget was tight, on another trip I would pay the extra and stay at a proper hotel but this served it purpose.;3
For a relatively expensive hotel, the service level was just acceptable.  Expected more from the Hilton.  Rooms were good size and clean on arrival.  Service was inconsistent.  Concierge (Jesse) was amazing.  Location however is excellent for universal studios visits.;3
The New Yorker serves as a hotel, dorm, meeting place and office space. Our daughter was staying in the dorm for the fall semester and we arrived a couple days early as I wanted to see New York decorated for the holidays. We were given an executive room on the 8th floor. This floor has been recently remodeled. The room was very clean. It was on the small side, but honestly you are in New York who stays in there room.  The bed was supposed to be a queen but we believe it was a double. It could have used some updating as we rolled towards the middle of the mattress.  The bathroom was modern but could use a modification of the shower, the shower had a spray hand shower that was at a height of probably over 6 feet. There was nowhere for it to be moved to a shorter height, this made;3
Spent a weekend in New York City with family. This hotel was in good location, very close to subway. Only a couple stops from Times Square.  Nice selection of restaurants in the neighborhood.  The area felt very safe, walking in the evening was very comfortable.  I rented two rooms. My room was small and had no view at all, unless you like to look at four walls. It was clean and offered all I needed. The bed was very comfortable. My son's room across the hall was a little larger with a flat screen TV and a pleasant street view of the area. No breakfast was included. The elevators were small, slow and not air conditioned. I was glad I had only 6 floors. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who needs a clean, comfortable and convenient  place to sleep at the end of a busy day.;3
Hollywood Hotel is ok. Staff are very friendly and helpful, in particular reception. The rooms are a good size, with comfortable bedding and daily top ups of amenities like shampoo. The water pressure in the showers is no doubt among the best I've experienced from all the hotels I've stayed at. A small thing, but an important thing!! But the location is terrible.   Yes it's in an excellent spot if you want to be near attractions like Universal Studios and the Hollywood Boulevard (The former being absolutely amazing, the latter being a complete waste of time - I've written quite a scathing review on the location if interested..), but it's a dodgy spot. Being woken several times each night by the loud blaring of a police car siren racing by seems to be common practice. Whilst we;3
Room was average and a lot outdated. If you are only there to sleep because of universal studios then you will be ok, it's super close the park. The breakfast Buffett was amazing, and they cater to all kinds of countries for the style of food choices. Loved it.  Our only real issue was when we purchased front of the line tickets for universal studios after dinner, my wife and I split the costs between our 2 credit cards.  They put the entire cost of the hotel on my wife's credit card after we split the front of line tickets, not my credit card that was used to book the room and the card that was used for incidentals. Crazy right?  Not sure what happened there.;3
We just got back from our father/son trip to New York and our stay at the Astor on the Park.  I have to say I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews.  However, I was pleasently relieved when we got to the hotel.    I won't say it's fabulous, but I will call it sufficient.  At the price, though, you can't beat it ($145/night).  As most people have suggested, you don't go to New York to stay in your room.  In all honesty this hotel is not a place you would want to spend to much time in your room.  The rooms were tight to say the least, but we had a double bed room.  There was enough room for two double beds, a t.v. and a small cupboard for your clothes.  There honestly was not a whole lot of room to move around.  The rooms would be very crowded for more than three;3
This hotel was great the staff was very friendly but there was no room service and pool hours very inconsistent. Make sure when you book that you ask for a good view and space because they put me in a awful view and a very small room. I get it , it was just me and my sister but it would have been nice  to have at least a view in such a beautiful location. Again I will book again but I will ask for a big room and a view.;3
We booked this hotel for 3 nights in November for my 50th birthday. The price we paid probably reflects what we got. The hotel and rooms were far too hot, we put the air con on but it was too noisy. The room was like something out of the 80s really needs an upgrade. You could pay extra for an upgraded room but we didn't bother. Based on 94th street we had a long walk to the main sites but this didn't bother us. It was close to central park and there's a subway station two streets away. Wouldn't recommend this hotel pay a little more for a more up to date stay.;3
"Check in hotel with big lady and I have another booking connect with next day stay. She so unhelpful and use impolite sentences toward to customer. Instead of: - can I see yr ID please,  she said: I need yr ID. or, - She said: ""I can't find yr booking"" then I show her booking confirmation number but she wouldn't want to see it and ask ""what is the name?"". After long time look on computer, Finally, she said that the next day, you need to check in again !  Do not understand why she can work for Hyatt ? Very disappointed!";3
The hotel was in an ok location, don't think we would have ventured to walk very far from the hotel a night though. It was close to the train station and took 5 mins to get into the city and all the tourist attractions. Breakfast was ok but it is a shame that no other meals or snacks are served during the day or evening, we resorted to eating a proper meal at lunchtime and getting a sandwich from the local Subway and eating in our room at night. The pool is a good size and nice and private. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was adequate but needs modernising and updating, didn't like the fact that there was only a clothes rail and no proper wardrobe. We did use the onsite laundry which was cheap and easy to use.;3
Hotelâs nice and very comfortable and conveniently located, and all that, but our experience of the current housekeeping situation was rubbish. Told, on arrival, that housekeeping would come on day four of five night stay, but if we needed anything to just let front desk know - great, lovely! On our first full day, having stayed one night, we returned to find our room being cleaned, etc - unexpected, given what weâd been told, but always nice to have a fresh bed. By day three, coffee supplies had run out, so we called front desk to request some and were told it would be with us in 10 - 15 minutes - two hours later, when we were heading out, it still hadnât arrived, so on our return, it was back to the front desk, to request - we explained the situation and coffee delivery was;3
Two friends and I stayed here in October 2008 for 5 nights.  We found the hotel to be fine.    Our room was fine, we had two double beds and the bathroom and room seemed clean.  The only problem with our room was that our curtains did not seem to close but one clever friend would fasten them together with a hairpin every night before bed.   I would recommend this to anyone trying to have a great visit to NYC and save some money.  We only really would be at the hotel to sleep and it is so accessible to everything you will want to get to.  It was also quiet.  It is not a luxury hotel and it is not located in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan.  It does have internet access for a fee off the main lobby. The main lobby is actually quite beautiful and fancy.  The elevators are a;3
". . . but the down-sides:  1. The horrific noise (""background music"" at an unbearable volume) in the foyer/reception area.  2. We had to ask for new towels, as the room, despite having been cleaned, hadn't had the towels replaced. These took 30min to arrive (we were on the 2nd floor) - not particularly impressive when we were tired!  The hotel itself was clean and tidy, and the staff were unfailingly helpful a courteous. A special mention to Romeo who helped on several occasions. We found the hotel ideally situated for many museums, the Lincoln Centre, and Ed's Chowder House just next door.  Central Park, Columbus Circle and central Manhattan were a short walk. A good place to stay for our first visit to NY.";3
"On arrival at this hotel the only word that describes the lobby is ""Hectic"", there are people everywhere, hardly anywhere to move to and luggage everywhere. There are quite a few staff at the desk and they work through the queue quickly. This is a very old hotel building the the deco style but unfortunately the rooms are very small with very small bathrooms. The beds are comfy and the tv has a good selection of channels. The bathrooms could really do with an update and the one problem with the showers is that the temperature changes on its own and is not regulated well and the water switches to boiling hot which scolds you. The location of this hotel is good with Maddison Square Gardens behind the hotel.";3
We have 3 members of our family who have Birthdays in November my sons my mom's and mine. So the 3 of us plus my sister and my moms bestie all came to go to Universal studios. Our hotel was in walking distance which was great and if we didn't want to walk they had a trolley. So fast and easy for us. The room was big we got 2 queen beds and there was 5 of us. We all slept comfortably and even with one bathroom we were all able to shower and get ready on time 4 women and 9 year old boy. We loved the shower. I don't think there were enough out let's though as well as mirrors in the actual room I strongly suggest that you bring your own if there are more then two adults. The roon was set up great and there was plenty of storage. We had a mini fridge for our drinks and snacks. For;3
My wife and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon. We thought we'd pick somewhere that looked a bit special and would be nice to stay in. My biggest complaint is that it's supposed to be a 4 Star hotel but it's not really. It doesn't have the atmosphere or the service to have that sort of accolade, nobody even offered to help with the luggage! We're not hotel snobs by any means but we were expecting a little bit more and felt ripped off. Our first room was tiny, damp and had absolutely no view. We complained about the damp and were offered another room which was a bit bigger and overlooked the Lincoln centre but was not really that great. It really was a let down at the start of a special holiday and although we would go back to New York, we wouldn't stay here again. If you're;3
The main reason - really, the only reason - to choose this hotel out of the many others in NY is for its convenience right across from Lincoln Center.  For that, it is ideal.  Not that the hotel itself is bad - the rooms are OK and the service is good, reception and concierge are pleasant and helpful.  Bathrooms are excellent, with waterfall showers.  The dÃ©cor is not particularly attractive.  Beds on the firm side.  (I like that, but others may not.)  The biggest drawback when I was there (Oct. 10-13) was that the elevators were having problems (two out of four were not working and a third was erratic) which made getting from lobby to 10th floor a chore, sometimes with 10-15 minute waits for an overcrowded elevator.  Be sure you check with the hotel on the elevator status;3
Booked a double bed room. Room was very tiny and bathroom sink had no place to put anything, very inconvenient . Could be cleaner.;3
This is a very nice property that is within walking distance of universal studios and the city walk.  The surrounding grounds of the property are beautiful and its location on top of a hill is unbeatable.  The view from our high floor room was magnificent. The public areas are tastefully designed and clean.  Check-in was quick. The staff was friendly. My only gripe was being told to pay 8 bucks more for a buffet breakfast when as a hilton honors diamond member, it should be included for free as it is at other hilton sister properties. Also, the elevators were quit slow for a building that has 25 floors.  The reason I gave the property only 3 stars is due to the fee for internet access (I never understand why Hilton must gouge their customers to use the internet when sister;3
Nice hotel. Great location. Bathroom is very small and shower screen is very inadequate resulting in the entire bathroom getting wet during a shower. Staff very friendly and helpful. Good value hotel.;3
This is my second visit to The New Yorker. I think I booked more as it held very sentimental memories of my first ever visit and this Rhine I was lucky enough to bring my daughter and was excited to show her bits of fond memories. The first being when I was 21 and I am now 37. nothing has changed at all.  The room itself was very clean and comfortable.  We were 4 in a room and it was tiny. We had no where to hang our clothes so had to live out of our cases which was also hard as there was no where to put them! Didnât spoil our time as we literally only slept there.  Location is brilliant and the pizza place across the road is amazing!!! My issue was with the staff on reception. Clueless and rude come to mind. Iâve been Charged the equivalent of Â£15 for a bottle of water which I;3
I was hesitant to stay here with all of the other reviews I read, but I found the hotel to be clean, close to public transportation and the staff took care of us. We had a deluxe room with our own bathroom. While the room was small, everything was functional and quiet. I felt very safe in the neighborhood and would stay here again.;3
Overall, my stay wasn't too bad. I did indeed expect more, but I was still satisfied with my stay. The location of the hotel is perfect and the lobby is very luxurious and welcoming, but the rooms could have been a bit better. The bathroom was very small and the shower only had one door, which made the bathroom floor very wet and slippery after showering.;3
I have stayed here in the past... small but  ok... This last visit I discovered that that the rooms have not been maintained.... shotty showers, bar not refilled,  A/C grills dented.  This last time, I had a City view  and the room was a challenge to move about in(by myself).... the bathroom was beyond tiny(I'm a 5'6 women/size 2),  no vanity and I had to put a towel down in the sink in order to have a place to set my make-up etc...Called the spa and heard women yelling abt appts etc(joke and hung up) .Third and last time....  Pros... great lounge feel when you enter and location is central... Starbucks, Rosa Mexicana and PJClarks's around the corner...   Don't stay here and you can leave your Xanax at home!;3
The Wyndham is located a few blocks from Time Square and just a block away from Penn Station. We came by train so this was very convenient however this convenience came with a cost. It's New York City, so the hustle and bustle was expected but the many homeless sleeping on the sidewalk was a little more than disconcerting. The hotel itself is dated and could use a new paint job. Our room was very small. There were only two of us but the room felt cramped and the toilet is at a child's level. The staff are very friendly and housekeeping is accommodating, however, the room we stayed in had a musty smell and the rug felt clammy on bare feet. The bed and pillows were ridiculously hard and very uncomfortable as were the chairs in the lounge. If I could sum up this review in one word,;3
We spent 3 nights at this hotel earlier this year during our honeymoon in the States. After having spent 4 nights at the Mondrian Soho, we were really disappointed with the Empire. The staff seemed rushed off their feet and weren't that friendly and room cleaning wasn't up to much either. During our stay, the shampoo and shower gel weren't replaced and the air-conditioning was unbearably loud.Thankfully it wasn't too hot so we managed to sleep without it on. The hotel was in need of a refurbishment, there was peeling wallpaper in the hallways and things just looked a bit rundown and the rooms were actually quite ugly. All brown leopardy carpets etc.  It was a real let down after our wonderful stay at the Mondrian Soho. This hotel is definitely not worth the money.;3
Hotel is 5 minutes walk from universal. We were a party of 9. Two families and stayed for 3 days. Unfortunately we had a long wait to check in the Hilton Honors line (as we are honors members). When they finally got to us, they informed us since we didnât book though Hilton (we booked thought Booking.com) we do not get any Benefits.ï¿¼ We were understanding about not receiving the Hilton points. Although we asked if we can just get the perks (such as bottled water, coffee etc). They informed us that is not possible. Later that day the family we were traveling with informed us that they were able to get Continentalï¿¼ breakfast, even though they booked the exact same way we did. We went to the front desk and requested the same treatment for us. The manager on duty Khetera, pretty;3
The location of the hotel is great - opposite MSG/Penn St station and just a few minutes from Times Square and the Empire State. It is a perfect base to explore New York from.  Basic rooms are small for a family and you may or may not be lucky with the view. Our first room had no view but the second room, on a corner, had great views. The hotel is a bit worn but the rooms are clean and the showers were excellent.  There are plenty of places to eat nearby. We used the Skyline Diner, just 5 minutes away, 3 times whilst we were there. Probably only real criticism is the check-in process - the queues were long and disorganised. I think it was as stressful for the staff as it was for the guests. Oh, and beware, you will be stung for $20+ per night for Wi-Fi and phone calls even if;3
This was our 2nd visit to the hotel. We were disappointed with the room. It was tiny. The room should have been for 1 persons, but 2 of us in the room. No bedside cabinet, having to use window ledge to put water etc. Tiny bathroom. Its ok for just sleeping, very disappointed,  esp after 1st visit.;3
The hotel is in a great location, however it needs  an update. There was no hot water for 2 days which is a major inconvenience anywhere. The room was so small, it was difficult to fit bags and there is absolutely no closet space. The bed was very comfortable.;3
Location was great. Room and beds were a good size and comfortable. Decor is dated, the wallpaper in the hallways will give you a headache. No complimentary coffee or wifi in room.  Water glasses requested instead of the paper cups supplied but was told 'only if we have some and can't check until the restaurant opens' - in a hotel, really?! Watch out for the Love Kit as part of the mini bar if you're in a family room - really not appropriate! Roof terrace is a nice touch but feels like it's accessed via a maintenance area. Pool is tiny and very public, more a kids  splash pool. Reception we're courteous but not very friendly. Location is what sells this hotel. Clean and tidy but could do better.;3
I visited NYC June 4th-7th. The hotel was clean. But the rooms were very small. The pictures on the website show updated pictures and bigger rooms. But that is not the case. Also, this hotel charges you to keep your bags with the bell person if you need them to keep after you check-out. The bathroom is very small as well. The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to many thing if you are willing to explore. My only complaint would be the room size and the false pictures prior to arriving.;3
Heating system noise ruined what is an otherwise nice hotel.  When the heat comes up, the pipes expand and bang.  It is not an issue that can be eliminated without a major overhaul so we won't be visiting again unless we learn it has been resolved.;3
"The room was small - perhaps typical for New York but even by those standards, tight quarters. The bathroom was smal;l by anyoine's standards and with the hotel's decsiuon to remove the  ""sliding"" portion of the shower wall - wet.  If you like lots of water on your small bathroom floor this is the hotel for you.";3
This hotel is well situated - close to everything including great restaurants and pubs. The bell hops are very friendly and give great advice.  I found the check in staff slow and didn't speak English well so communication was a little frustrating. The room we stayed in was super super small - we were unable to leave a suitcase open because there was no floor space!;3
"For the (fairly reasonable) price, I could tolerate a few of these things, but together they added up to a disappointing experience: Cramped guest room and bathroom; view of rusty mechanical equipment in a deep pit between buildings; mind-numbingly noisy air unit in the room; wifi charges except in lobby and a couple of other places; $31 (including mandatory tip) for two small gin & tonics in disposable plastic cups on the pool deck; facility needs cleaning or repair in some places. On the plus side: my wife had a much better experience here, about 2 years ago, so your luck may be better; the rooftop deck is a nice place to sit (but go elsewhere for drinks); location is excellent for Central Park, Broadway, etc. Price was good.";3
The Hotel was very clean   tidy. Staff very helpful. Very busy yet got sorted with our room quickly. Staff near the lifts asking what room and looking at our room cards was very good as anyone can just walk into a hotel these days. Our Room was very small but clean and tidy. Was very dark only had a small window without any view only the other side of the hotel all windows. Bathroom clean tidy again very small and old fashioned. Slept well and it was very quiet from all the traffic from the city. I would have liked  a room with a view But if we did we would have to wait a few hours. After a long flight from the UK just wanted to have a shower and a rest before evening meal. Yet a room was booked I do think they should have had a good room and we did pay a lot of money for just;3
Everything was above satisfactory except for the bathroom It apears at though someone thought that two sliding doors at the shower was too much so the sliding door was removed. Pitty the poor housekeepers and ask for extra towels - you will need them for the water on the floor;3
First off we are talking of about $600/nt with taxes for a king size bed. That gets you the followings: Great location to Lincoln Center and subways,near Central Park  I'm afraid that's all for the positives. The negativers outway that. Unlike another reviewer the boiler in the hotel was working but the ancient apparatus that controls the heat-AC in the rooms doesn't function very well. We were here in the Fall, when it still wasn't freezing out and it was hard to control the rooms temperature.The elevators sound like they are ready to stop at any moment. The doors creak when they close and the elevator feels like it bangs around I the shaft. We stayed in this hotel last year around the same time, because we run the New York City Marathon,  and the room rates where about $100;3
Stayed for a couple of nights before a cruise. The check in was quick and friendly, lifts to the rooms but a bit disappointing after that. The room was scruffy and in desperate need of a refurb. There was an aircon unit in the room but was very noisy. Very old tv but it worked and there was free WiFi. Good position with lots of places to eat nearby. The subway was close by too.;3
The location is within a block of the subway and a couple blocks from Central Park.  It was easy to get to all the sights, but don't ask for help from most of the staff.  The room was cozy but the halls were not air conditioned and only one set of elevators that worked, I almost passed out from the heat.  No restaurant on site but several 24 hour restaurants and a grocery store.  Parking garage around the corner and hotel has door loading area.;3
Me and my boyfriend spent 5 days in New York it was the most amazing but crazy experience, the hotel was Lovely also in a really good place, itâs about a 20 minute walk to Times Square, but you pass loads of shops and restaurants on the way and the subway is about 5 minutes walk, and there is a Macdonalds and a pizza shop across the road which was amazing! the staff were also friendly and very helpful, we were on the 27th floor so the hotel is quite high, the rooms are dated and nothing like the pictures, even being that high up you could still hear all the traffic and there was a constant draft in our room but luckily there was heating,  personally we thought it was a lot of money what we paid, for the rooms we got, also one of the days the maid came to clean the room we got;3
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Universal simply because we were going to Universal Studios and for that it was perfect.  It is a 5 min walk from the hotel.  Plus you have the City Walk for restaurants and shopping in the evening.  The hotel however is in need of a refurb.  The rooms are very big but not the cleanest I have ever seen.  At breakfast, I went through 5 cups one morning until I found a reasonably clean one.  The breakfast was good though.  One thing I didn't like was the unfriendliness of the staff.   Throughout our stay there, only one member of staff was friendly and welcoming.  Also didn't like the fact that someone left a packet of what looked like an illegal substance in the safe.  You'd think they would have checked the safe was empty when the last lot;3
The New Yorker has a fabulous location in midtown close to the subway and a great number of the âmust seeâ NYC sights. Itâs architecturally stunning and the Trattoria Bianca bar and Tick Tock restaurant have great ambience and are reasonably priced.  However we had two real issues with our 4 night stay last week. First was that due to the hotel being full, the room I had booked and paid for was ânot availableâ. Despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all. The second was that the concierge tried to charge me $130 for tickets to a game at the Garden that I actually paid only $54 at MSG box office! So unfortunately I have to advise that if you choose to stay at the New Yorker, donât think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid;3
You get what you pay for. You hear it again and again, but this time it's truer than ever. Please pay attention to the following and you'll be fine, but remember to read all reviews with a pinch of salt.   1) The neighbourhood is shady. This has already been covered in some reviews. Believe it. I don't see it changing in the near future. This means that in the evening you'll see sketchy individuals wandering around. The sidewalks are not glamorourized - infact, they're dirty in typical city-style.   I stayed with a friend and I did not feel very safe with us two being girls. Walk around with someone else if you can.   2) There isn't much to eat around here except for a fastfood Wendys across the street a block away, and the hotel breakfast itself. The hotel breakfast is average;3
Recently stayed at this hotel for several days while visiting Universal Studios, Malibu, and other attractions in the area. First, the hotel. It's a Hilton and what you expect from a Hilton. However, it is annoying that they charge hotel guests $24 a day for parking and $8 a day for wireless. Even arriving at 3:30 pm they still charge $20 for parking. Given the cost of the room you would think that they could include parking and wireless like so many other (aka Sheraton) hotels do. The pool is a little on the small size given the size of the hotel.;3
I booked this hotel on the understanding that as a wheelchair user this was fully accessible. Unfortunately this was not the case and access was via a portable ramp which was not particularly safe but moreso was undignified entering and leaving hotel by holding up passers-by. All that being said the front of house staff were extremely helpful and special mention to Mourad for his assistance.;3
Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It is superb for location to see all of New York's major sites. The hotel is very dated, I know it was the height of modern when it was built, however could do with a bit of a re vamp. The rooms are very small and the bathrooms are tiny. No tea/coffee facilities, clean though. Great as your only there to sleep as generally out all of the day and evening. The tick tick diner located within the hotel served good breakfasts,although very busy and waiting time was lengthy. Tiny bit pricey but it is New York. Staff helpful enough. Rooms were quiet as quite high up.;3
good hotel, central location, rooms reasonably clean, comfortable beds, would stay again Close, walking distance  to everywhere, quite rooms, enjoyed my stay........... Nice view from the window , you can see anew York City;3
As fans of the TV show Gossip Girl, we decided to treat ourselves to a stay at The Empire where many scenes of the show were filmed for or our first visit to New York. When we arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon our room was still not ready so we sat around in the lobby for a while. When we eventually got the keys to the room to our disappointment the room was small and had a few flaws. The bed was made with sheets that had holes in them and the doona cover consisted of two flats sheets â one above and one below the doona, the aircon barely worked, one of the shower doors was missing and the fittings in the bathroom were falling out of the wall. The hallways in the hotel on our floor smelt strongly of marijuana and given what we had paid for the room per night this is not;3
We where in London for a concert and stayed overnight, the place was very cheap and in a good location so we could travel around the city before the gig. Hotel was clean, room was noisy but the beds and the room was fine. Good to stay if you want cheap and cheerful.;3
I get that many hotels were terribly affected by the pandemic, but I really feel this hotel cannot call itself a decent 4 star. Here's why: The good: -Excellent location, close to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square, Lincoln Square the Upper West Side.  -Nice roof top bar and instagrammable Gossip Girl-filmed spaces - Rooftop pool looks like it could be nice in the summer when it's open - Good, strong showers The bad: - No food or drink available in the hotel itself. No room service. No bar or restaurant. Rooftop bar separate to hotel and only open certain times from the afternoon. So nowhere to just chill out and have a drink or get any food within the hotel itself. - The rooms were small and extremely dark and dingy (even after we insisted on moving to a brighter room).;3
Selected the Hilton Universal for its proximity to Universal Studios and quality overall based on photos and descriptions.  We thought it was ok and our stay was fine but it didn't live up to our expectations and we wouldn't stay here again next time we visit Universal Studios.  Our room was average, a bit outdated.  Bathroom wallpaper is peeling. Bathroom toilet tissue is in an odd location way behind the toilet and awkward to reach. No magnification mirror in the bathroom and poor lighting.  Beds are only marginally comfortable. Stayed 2 nights and I made tea in the morning with the coffee pot in the room. Supplies weren't replenished by housekeeping so that I could make tea again the next morning.  The first morning we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was;3
The hotel is famous for its lovely bar area which is apparently fratured in 'Gossip Girl'. Unfortunately the rest of it is pretty disappointing to be honest. The bar is lovely when it is open, and the bartenders are not prompt. The reception staff are far from welcoming and we had to wait beyond the check in time and if we hadn't had kept on asking they wouldn't have told us it was ready.  The rooms were really small, even for New York standards but they were clean and the maids did a consistent job for the week we were there. The roof bar was dark and dingy and overpriced, the views you get from Bar 65 at the Rockefeller were 40 storeys higher and much better. Drinks were also cheaper and for a hotel outside of central manhattan I was surprised. Given the choice of hotels in;3
My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel in September. The hotel location is very good (if you want to stay in mid-town), close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the theater district.   We found the hotel staff to be professional, but not the friendliest. We had issues checking in as there was error in the computer system related to the confirmation. Also, at the time of checking in we were told that the room wasn't ready and we would get a call when it's ready. Unfortunately, we never got a call. What I found annoying is that the hotel has a $5/bag hold fee, even for overnight guests. This is the first time I've encountered this in NYC, and there was only 1 person, at that time working the bag-check, so we had to wait 10-15 minutes, because the line was long.   The;3
We stayed here as three adults in a superior double double room.  The location of the hotel is great. It's about a 20 minute walk to Time Square area and a 45 minute walk to Macy's. It is essentially on the edge of Central Park so a very quick walk took you in there.  We had a Facebook deal which reduced the price of our stay by 15% which I think was definitely needed as the hotel itself, especially in our room, looked a bit tired.  We didn't have any issues with the noise of the traffic outside and we were on the 8th floor. We had a few issues with the heating as we couldn't see how to turn it on during the first night and there was a large draught coming from the window which made the room very cold.  On the second night someone had come to show us how to use the heater and;3
Stayed here for one night. Most comfortable bed I've ever slept in a hotel. Average size room. Nice view of Universal City and Mountains. Very clean. Clean average size bathroom. Nothing fancy or special about this hotel but I paid $102 bucks so not bad. Nice staff. I'll be staying at the Hilton Cancun next month, I also joined Hilton Honers because it has its perks. Oh yeah, if you are staying here for a couple of days, I wouldn't because parking is expensive! $11 bucks per night. It adds up. Overall good, clean and comfortable hotel. If you are coming to Universal Studios its good, but otherwise stay in the LA Area. The Wyndham in Sunset is better and for about the same price, closer to attractions to.  hope this helps;3
"Overall, customer service was good, although, they do not know much about the public transportation system.  Positives: Our room came with ~24 inch TV, which was really nice. Also, it came with a microwave, which is also very convenient. It has a pool - too bad it is unheated and located outside by the parking lot. Last, it is located relatively close to a Metro station (about 1 Â½ blocks) and a Rite Aid.  Negatives: There were some faults with the room.  One, the refrigerator in our room doesnât work. It stayed at the same temperature, which was at room temperature, no matter how cold we set it. The room would be cooler than the fridge. Our box of ice cream turned into strawberry milk.  Two, our shower did not work correctly; it was either scalding hot or ice cold. The screw";3
Well the tittle says it all. We loved this hotel. Good food, good pool / gym, 10 mins to Universal, beautiful Christmas lights, good breakfast, polite staff (except one fool). A super place be when you want to enjoy Universal Studios.... BUT....  Expect that we were woken up at 3am by the front desk, since their new guest was NOT able to enter our room. Yeah they gave a key to a TOTAL stranger to us to enter our room in the middle of the night (because our room was unoccupied, BLOODY HELL)... luckily we had the double locks on! I was horrified, super disappointed about this fool behind the front desk and needless to say very angry about this. The hotel manager handled my case well with proper apologies and I am able to forgive them. But PEOPLE HAVE YOUR DOUBLE LOCKS ON! Without;3
Stayed here over the weekend and while I stayed here over 20 years ago as well the hotel is showing its age. Still decent hotel but will need remodeling soon.  Hotel is very convenient to Penn Station and thatâs good if flying from Newark and taking train into the city.;3
Good for a conference. Lots of space. You have to walk at least a mile for any restaurants that aren't in the tourist trap of universal city.   Would be a great spot to stay if UC was your main destination.;3
I was really looking forward to finishing my trip to the US with a stay at this hotel in New York City but it is fair to say that I was more than a little bit disappointed.  First, the positives. The lobby on arrival does look impressive. The lobby bar at night is lively and has a good atmosphere.   The check-in was relatively straightforward although our room wasn't ready (we were a bit early so not a criticism.)   The pool bar at the top of the hotel is decent but lacks that touch of luxury you'd expect in a 5*.  Location is decent. Close to restaurants, shops, subway etc.   The downside. The room, a 'double superior' was on the small side. The bathroom is tiny. The hot tap rarely got hot which meant shaving with cold or at best lukewarm water.   The room is also very noisy.;3
I stayed here FREE ( on my hilton club points) for just the one night in January when visiting LA, we were upgraded into the executive suite on the top floor and the room was dull and shabby. The room was of an average size with a poor view. The bed was hard and the bathroom was small with dated decor and fittings, and this was meant to be better than their normal rooms!! The service was very good and the staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast was appalling and would certainly never pay the money for it. I am not a fussy person and for a free night it really was fine, and probably would return if it was another free night, but I would not pay the prices they charge for a room. I understand the location pushes up the room prices but I am sure you can find cleaner and more;3
Even after a renovation a few years back, the rooms are small and tired seeming.  The bed was a queen, not a king, and felt like a double.  The wallpaper and tile were a bit worn.  Great location though.  Expensive bar and restaurant - don't eat or drink at the hotel.  All the convenience items in the room and the room fridge cost a fortune.  Of the four ancient elevators, only two were in service, so get a room on a lower floor and use the stairs or you will be waiting a lot.  The bellman and front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant.  There is a Starbucks next door where we got coffee and breakfast ever morning - the continental breakfast they offer doesn't start until after 8AM, and we had to be at appointments earlier than that so could not take advantage of it even;3
You get what you pay for. So much cheaper than every where we looked at. 2 night stay with no problems. Was it spotless? No. Were there bugs? No. Hot water? Yes. Street noise? Yes. Easy walking distance of subway and 1000 restaurants. Walked around the area at all hours, never felt unsafe. The bed is very comfortable!;3
The best thing about this hotel is its location and proximity to public transportation. The hotel itself is historic but needs an update particularly in the bathrooms. We had booked three standard rooms: two with queen size beds and one with two twin beds. The rooms with a queen size bed are much smaller than the ones with two twins. In this hotel it really makes a big difference! The mattress and pillows are not the best ones (forgot to take our own pillows with us), and none of us (6 altogether) slept very well. The bathrooms are very tiny, outdated and have no space for your things unless you want to keep them on the floor. The staff were friendly enough.;3
The Hotel is located right by Madison square gardens and within walking distance to Times Square. The rooms are extremely small, the shower is like being jet washed but itâs clean. The staff are really friendly and helpful, even when most of the guests were complaining of the strong smell of weed lingering in the rooms. When you check- out and still have some time to explore the city then itâs $5 per bag for the hotel to hold them. We stayed for 5 nights and the room tax was $120 which is expensive compared to other hotels.  Checking in was easy, make sure you have ID and the credit card you paid with as the hotel take a security payment of over $200 which you get back at the end and can also use some of that money to pay for the room tax.   PROS- good location, friendly staff;3
Stayed here on Wyndham points over a long weekend. We'll start with the Pros: great location right next to a metro station and Madison Square Garden, easy walk to many key points in midtown Manhattan (though countless hotels can boast this), good Italian restaurant and bar on site, in the room shower was hot and strong, WiFi reliable, historic exhibits about the hotel's early years were nice to see.   The Cons: We've stayed in Manhattan many times in recent years and this hotel had the smallest room and bathroom we've ever seen, even for NY hotel standards. The remodeled room was perfectly nice in design, but I wish the architect had configured the bathroom to be just a bit bigger, as you could barely open the closed door while inside.   The hotel is enormous, and the foot;3
Staff is excellent!  I've stayed here 5 times the last year, I have family that live just around the corner so it's convenient.  I have come to the conclusion it totally depends on what room you get. Pent house and premier rooms are great, but after that it's a real crap shoot.  The last one was the worst.  Smoked cover curtains and smell, a piece of the crown molding was missing and there were at least 10 squished cockroaches where the crown should have been, room 1007, no remote for tv.  Book premier if you can.;3
Good location - hotel far too hot - cocktail bar and waiter outstanding. Very helpful staff - could do with tea and coffee in room. Bed needs updating and rooms are a bit small. This our second visit and hotel starting to look a bit dated.;3
Older hotel in a great location, rooms are clean, housekeeping do a great job in cleaning and tidying.  Most staff are pleasant.    We had 2 bathrooms, both toilets blocked and overflowed.  The first time this happened it took 2 phone calls and a visit to front desk for maintenance to come and fix the problem.    Worst part of our stay was visiting the concierge desk at reception where you can purchase show tickets.  There was a lady with short hair at the desk who had absolutely no interest in helping.  We wanted to purchase Aladdin tickets that weren't too expensive as we are a family of 5.  All she could manage was to tell us how expensive they would be and probably would cost us $240 per seat. She then proceeded to tell us the only cheap tickets left would be for the;3
"Hotel was very easy to find from Newark Airport - took the NJ Transit and transferred to the subway at Penn Station and the number 2 to 96th street. Check in was smooth. We got a king sized bed. Our room was spacious and although the bathroom was tiny it was spotless. Coffee maker and coffee is provided. Wish there was a fridge.   There were three towels (although a bit threadbare), a hand towel and wash cloth; lots of immediate hot water. Shower is a little high for shorties but seems like a relatively new shower head. Shampoo is provided but it isn't the greatest so I recommend bringing your own. Hair dryer worked well and lighting is great in bathroom with makeup mirror. There is a safe and it's large enough to fit electronics.   WIFI worked very well and we were on the 6th";3
"The hotel has a great location and a very nice rooftop bar.    The room was very comfortable and had a nice decor. However, it was lacking on cleanliness, especially the carpet and corners.  The service was also not very professional. The first day I called ""0"" a few times, but had no response. Also, the check-out took around 20-25 minutes, as they took a long time to check the minibar in the room.   Moreover, during my check-out the front desk clerk was having trouble handling a complain from other guests and did not seem to give them a proper solution.   In general, not very impressed with the hotel. I will definitely not be staying in this hotel during my next trips to the city.";3
Rooms are small, I had to remind myself it is an old building. Beds were very comfortable! Staff was very nice. There aren't very many food choices near hotel. Was always a chore trying to find a place to eat. We had to go to Times Square for places worth eating at. Restaurant at the hotel was very expensive for what it served.;3
This hotel could and should be very good. It has loads going for it : prime location, good looking building, cool lobby, very friendly and helpful staff, comfortable beds, decent sized rooms for NYC. However, the rooms and corridors are in need of attention. Don't get a back room on the lower levels (like I did, before I asked to be moved), noisy outside with the hotels air conditioning units, a poor nights sleep guaranteed. But, it's the little things that stick. Quite trivial things really, but for some reason they really stick in the throat. Wi Fi, $10 a day in room (when it's free in lobby). $3 for a coffee in room from a machine (when there is a coffee shop a few doors a way). $8 for a bottle of water ( when there is a 24 hour convenience store around the corner). They do;3
My stay at the hotel went well. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure things went well.   The hotel is really busy with guest from all over the world. My room was really small but cozy.   The one con I experienced was that the chair in the room seem to have the worst smell I ever smelled in my life. The rooms could use a little more cleaning.   Overall, my stay was quick and went well.   Best,  Lew;3
We arrived to the Hilton at 8 am, hoping there was a room available and early check in if possible.  Our of a 25 floor Hotel there was not 1 available and it was a Sunday.  The cleanliness and staff attitude was great!  The menu prices and buffets were over priced.  The area location to Universal Studios was excellent.  I just didn't get the thrill I thought.  The ongoing elevator issues and the hair in my omlette was just disgusting.;3
Positives: Good location, good value, very friendly and helpful staff, clean beds and bathroom.  Negatives: Old shoddy furniture, room too cramped. Room looked out over scruffy back yard (Room Number 101 !!!). Thin walls, so noisy from other guests.  Overall it was okay as we went out early morning and just came back to sleep so didn't spend much time in the room.;3
"I was here for a seminar, so I didnât choose the hotel. Big pluses: comfortable rooms, deco design, pleasant and helpful staff. Negative: itâs an awful neighborhood and taxis are hard to get since people leaving Penn Station grab them first. The Tick Tock Diner claims to be the largest diner in NYC; itâs certainly the archetype.";3
This hotel is way past its prime time and judging by our room it is in urgent need of refurbishment. Perhaps other floors are better? There was absolutely no room to move around, bathrooms need updating, toiletries...better bring your own. Lifts don't work well, takes forever to get into one.   Having said that, we had a great view (upgraded view room), staff were helpful, wifi worked pretty well, it's decent value and the location is very central.   For breakfast try 'Best Beigels and Coffee' on 36th Street. One of NY best beigel shops.;3
I just loved the quirkiness of this hotel. The foyer was grand and inviting. The lift area, hall ways and room decor very much reminded us of the shining film which added to its character. The family room (two double beds) was small and the bathroom was dusty around the paint work. The beds and bathroom suit and towels were immaculate and incredibly comfortable. We each slept with one of our young children so that we had more room! The room had an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, and mini toiletries. The staff (as we found all over Manhattan) were friendly and very helpful. When we arrived we were given the choice of rooms and allowed to enter early (thank you Mohammed) The diner was good for breakfast but there is a pub called âHoundstoothâ a few blocks down as you turn left;3
Few blocks from Central Park, breakfast and pharmacy within the block, relatively quiet and clean. However, during the 2 nights we stayed there the toilet clogged twice, and we did not have cold water for shower one morning. Very old structure, the administration tries hard to make it work but... not always successful. Would need more significant investment to bring it up to date - which should be easily done considering the price charged (Manhattan prices). Anywhere else this property would be a 1-star.;3
We booked a suite online and no room was ready when we arrived. They said to come back at 4:30 and when we did we were told no suites available and we got 2 rooms instead. This was a girls trip for a special occasion and we wanted to be together. Staff was nice as there was nothing they could do but management was less then helpful. We definitely felt like we didn't matter and management did not care that they screwed up. They treated like we were some annoying teenagers not the 30s something professional adults that we are. We could have booked a suite at a million other NYC hotels instead. The rooms were ok - clean but tiny and outdated. Staff in the diner and the nicer restaurant in the lobby were very nice. Bell staff and valet were also great. Overall it wasn't bad but;3
"The good; Nice clean room, huge bed with lots of pillows. Free shuttle to Universal. Mini fridge in the room. Pool view. Helpfull staff.  The bad; The hotel does not have free wifi!!! (Only avaliable to Hilton honour guests IF they booked directly at hotel website) Extremly bad soundproofing in the doors, woke up each time someone walked past my door. Breakfast not included in price, and Very expensive. I know LA is expensive, but For 250$ a night, I Expect a lot more.";3
Booked here because of proximity to Penn Station / access to EWR. Figured rooms would be tiny in an old hotel and they were. No problem there. Downsides: once they have your email address they just don't let up in their effort to squeeze every last nickle out of you. Frequent offers to buy upgrades, meals, tours, etc., etc. Arrive daily in the run up to your stay. Want a check-in prior to 4pm? That will be $ 50. Late check out? Same.  If you're above the 20th floor better budget up to a 15 minute wait for an elavator. And hell awaits those with animal dander allergies. Decades of visitors for the Westminster and other animal pageants make this place a severe challenge to breathe in. Getting our train to the airport was a breeze though.;3
The only great thing about this hotel was the close proximity to Universal Studios and subway. It was nice to be within walking distance to it. We were able to walk to the park and the City Walk for lunch and dinner. Also, it was a quick walk down the hill to the subway train. We were able to quickly arrive at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, etc via that subway. A quick drive to local attractions too like the Warner Bros. Studio. The concierge was really nice. The hotel room was average. We could tell the rooms were dated. For example, the electrical outlets were very limited and a few did not work so I had trouble charging my phone and ipad. Of course the hotel was doing fire alarm testing/renovations during our stay and they did not give us advance notice of this.;3
I was on a short business trip to NYC, 4 days, needed a comfortable, quiet hotel in a safe area at reasonable price, close to the subway/metro.  I found the Astor to be just that.  The room was tiny but clean and comfortable.  I find that people often complain about a lack of space in budget hotels, however if you are only in a hotel for a comfortable sleep in a clean room with a clean bathroom then why look for extra space (which normally comes with a higher price tag).  I would use it again, even if accompanied by my wife.;3
Very quick check in and staff very friendly and helpful. Upgrade on arrival..The hotel is older style and most areas a bit tired which I don't actually mind as it has character I guess. Throwback to the 70s. The room is ample, the toilet tiny but great shower. Room serviced every day. The heating in room gets very noisy due to age. There is a charge if you want to listen to music channels on telly...bit mean.... Rooftop bar open but too cold to sit outside in January. It was my partners birthday a few days before arrival and they put a bottle of cava and card in room which was a really great touch. Tube a 2 minute walk and 2 stops to Times Square. All in all not a bad choice but don't expect 5 star but vintage.;3
I booked this hotel BEFORE I read the reviews on TripAdvisor. So after booking the pre-paid rate on their website I considered myself locked in the arrangement and was expecting the worse given the number of negative reviews about this hotel on TripAdvisor (especially just a week before I had booked!).  Although I will probably book elsewhere next time, it would be because this hotel is uptown. The only two flaws I would comment on are the dirty carpet flooring and curtains in the room but EVERYTHING ELSE was acceptable. It was hugely surprising to find a coffee maker and hair dryer in the rooms and mini gym as well as Internet/Fax facilities around the back of the lobby. I had a 3-night stay at this place.   Consider this hotel if: - you're on a tight budget - you want to be;3
Definitely a hotel like no other. I stayed in a single with shared shower and bath. The hotel is at the end of Jane Street and is kind of dark inside and outside. The single rooms are small and I couldnât get my overhead light to go off. It has a musty and old smell. The bathroom seemed clean. Young ladies at checkout were nice as was the gentleman in the restaurant.;3
Hotel was in prime location to Penn Station & near to all attractions. Hotel room was clean modern and had everything you needed. The rooms are small but you are not in the rooms when in New York as there is so much to do. The bed & pillows were comfortable & the staff were always around to ask questions & leave luggage we loved our stay.;3
Room is a lot smaller than the photos made it look. Like whoa.   Bed not comfortable and absolutely no view. But, snacks and refreshments available (thanks to âresortâ fee haha).  The thing Iâm not happy about is that there is a $150 deposit they collect AFTER youâve already paid for your stay and which is not listed anywhere on any booking platform for visibility. You donât get it back for a week. This leaves me feeling annoyed. They are supposed to take credit cards so they can charge you in the event of damage or stolen goods. Not make you pay as if you already did that and then make you wait to get the damn money back.  Anyway for NYC itâs a decent room and good location. Quiet. Room is clean, just s little dark.;3
First of all the hotel is in a great location for all site seeing activities. A Big Bus Tour stop is right outside which is great. Had to wait longer on our room which was abit of a pain but as a result we were upgraded.  We stayed in an unrefurbished room which was still great and very spacious.  WIFI in the lobby and in rooms. Safe and hairdryer provided. Only complaint is the way we were treated by security staff. One night both our key cards stopped working and we could not access the room. It was about 8pm and we had brought back food which was already cold and we were hungry. Seeing as we were on the 23rd floor we decided to just sit outside the room and eat it and then go to reception to get everything sorted. This decision was made because it was a burger and therefore;3
"If this review was based on just our first night stay I'd have to rate it a ""0"".  We arrived late, never thought 7pm was late before but that was the reason that we were told there was only one room left in a king junior suite on the ""smoking optional"" floor.  Well, my option was not to smoke but it made no difference to the room, it was definitely a smoking room. It looked like the hotel had accepted the fact that these rooms were abused and would only do so much to maintain them. Burn marks on the furniture, a deep, horrible smell, stains on the carpet - whew.  Thank goodness I was only paying $315 per night!!! We did get moved for the remaining two nights and the same room one floor up was very nice. An apology or upgrade would have been nice but nothing was said, oh well.";3
Expedia messed our reservation up and put us here instead of our original hotel.  I was concerned at first, but the hotel seemed really nice.  The check-in went very smoothly and the clerk gave us some breakfast tickets because of my son's 18th birthday.  When we got to the room, it was nice.  Small, but nice enough.  Our room had a great view of the Empire State building.  It was nice to work on my computer while looking at the view!  One night while in the bathroom, I had to kill a roach.  I didn't worry too much about it until my wife killed another one the next evening.  Maybe that's normal for NYC, but I don't like it!    The internet was actually pretty good.  Better than a lot of other places that I have stayed! The mattress wasn't the best, but sleepable.  The restaurant;3
Average hotel. When you first see the hotel it's lights aren't even fully working on the big red sign that you can see from afar. It's clean and staff are friendly. We did get a free bottle of wine and strawberries as they thought it was our wedding anniversary, which is wasn't but it was a lovely gesture.  The rooms are tiny! Bathrooms are also small. You also have to pay for the wifi in your room or use the free wifi in the lobby which is ridiculously slow as everyone else is using it.  The hotel is quite close to the nearest subway and to get to places it is very central. If you want a bargain search for century 21 which is very close for designers bargains for a huge reduction! It's about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. Central Park is also a short walk away and is a;3
"This hotel is very good for the money; it is  a BUDGET hotel, but saying that the bathroom and free toiletries were very good!!  now some tips for this hotel: 1) you have two subways stations very close to you: 103rd and 110th street: both go on the B train! use them, the walk from central park to times square is quite long - very nice but long! 2) for a shower pull the bath tap nossel (??) down when thewater is on and the shower works! thats how we got it to work :D 3) In the lobby to the hotel there are stairs right beside the front door; down there are computers, vending machines and a phone card machine. I hope this helps, it is a good clean hotel, we did not have one problem and any issues with the heating are fixed especially in room 712.  We did not have  problem with";3
Staying at the Jane Hotel feels like you've been transported back to the twenties. The reception and elevator look like something right of the Tower of Terror (don't worry, it doesn't drop) and the rooms are made to look like you're staying on a ship. This boutique hotel is conveniently located near the Meatpacking District and the Hudson River, it's a great hotel for solo travellers. The AC isn't very strong so the rooms are very hotel. Some of the hotel staff are more friendly and helpful than the others. I would stay again.;3
The Hollywood Hotel is a cheap, reasonably great locationed hotel. It's in the West Hollywood area near Vermont/Santa Monica & Vermont / Sunset metro stations. It's relatively easy to get around on the metro once you get the hang of it. Its' located in between Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.  We managed to get a deal online which included breakfast, hey its wasn't anything 5 stars but it certainly did the job.  Being my first time in LA it was a little nerving to get around at night in the area, and would feel safer if there was more than 1 person or larger group. Large amount of homeless and mentally ill residents in the area, but this is a whole for LA not just the area of the hotel.  Some nice little bars to visit on Sunset Blvd in town, and diners weren't too bad either.;3
We needed a convenient place to stay for a Saturday night in the city.  I did not want to pay $400, or be too far away from the subway.  The windsor was perfect.  Super close to the subway stop, so we were able to get uptown and to brooklyn with no problems.  The room was very clean, and I slept like a rock.  There was a bike polo tournament going on in the park across the street when checked in, and the next morning there were plenty of little deli newstand type places to get a quick cup of coffee.    We paid $228, and I would have no problem staying here again.;3
"The room was ok but a little tight for 3 adults.  It was sort of clean, but hair on sheets and towels â maybe they need to clean out their dryer.  We stayed on the first floor and could hear voices all night in the lobby and on the street â bring earplugs!  The bed was very hard as if it was a board with just a foam top.  The room was small, but that is expected in NY.  The staff was friendly and assisted us with holding our bags in a secured room before and after check-in; this was very convenient to be able to walk around NY without carrying all our stuff.  We loved the location as only a few blocks from Little Italy.  We parked about 2 blocks away on Allen Street for about $25 per day.  Grand Street Metro steps away from hotel â this is the Orange Line â B & D routes.";3
This is a nice hotel, but the staff seems unconcerned with providing customer service. We took cold showers for four days. That is bad, but what is worse is the total and complete lack of follow-up by staff. They not only never acted to solve the problem, they never responded to phone calls other than to say engineering would be notified.;3
Have just come back from New York last Friday, after staying at the Astor. If only there were coffee/tea making facilities in the rooms, I would have rated it higher! Having to get dressed and troll down to the basement at 7am wasnt fun! The basement also serves as internet/vending machine area/staff room. When we put the air conditioning on at night as it was quite warm, the radiator in the room started to bang and clank like it was going to explode!! (it was switched off) This happened every night, despite asking for it to be looked at. I found the manager very pushy, and seemed not to be as amenable if you dont book trips with him! I was slightly annoyed at the end of our stay, as we had planned to catch the Port Authority bus back to New Jersey airport, but as we were;3
We were initially very pleased with this hotel, until the third day of our stay, when we had two separate disappointing customer service experiences. The first two days we ate at the breakfast buffet, the food and service was excellent. Oralia made our omelets exactly as we ordered them and was very friendly. She had a smile on her face and was pleasant and cheerful to both co-workers and other customers. The third day of our stay, Oralia was not working and Elvira made our omelets. She used an extremely high heat, causing the entire restaurant to smell like burnt eggs. When my daughter asked her to re-make her burnt omelet, she got upset and argued with us that the brown, burnt part was the bacon. She continued to argue with us about it and asked if we wanted the egg raw,;3
A friend and I stayed at this hotel in mid-May. The room was small but functional. We got clean sheets & towels everyday. We did not have a view on the park but that was okey. Reading the reviews about the noise at night got me a bit worried but we did not have any problems. No noise whatsoever. Staff was friendly & helpful. The room could use some new paint though.  The nearest subway is on 103rd street, maybe a 3 minute walk. I'd stay there again.;3
I booked a night online in october,not too cheap but good considering London prices and location (was a sort of discount for last rooms available). I arrived there,at first glance i thought it was a 3-4floors building,the hall was ok, with a sort of bar where you could buy drinks,sandwiches,fruit and some food. The men at reception were cold, I didn't mind..but I was with 2 heavy suitcases, without lift or any help from stuff it was very hard to climb 3 floors. Room was ok, there were even glasses,plates,fridge.. on the floor  I found 2 kitchens, unluckily they were empty a part from a microwave not usable as someone stole the revolving plate in it. I tried a bathroom (with 2 sinks and a few toilets) and toilets were disgusting. a part from toilet itself, if you opened a window,;3
So really excited to stay here as great location and as a gg fan did want to relive the memories of Chuck and Blair. Value for money- fair I expected to pay more due to location in New York and was happy for the value Check in was flawless, great welcome email- reconfirming check in time and asking if we needed an earlier check in as an option which was a nice touch- Door men! Spot on, very friendly, welcoming and informative Lobby- breathtaking this is when you see the class of the empire, good vibe very clean and great bar  Rooms- clean and have what you need but on the small side for the price- very poor air con incame from a budget hotel into this and the budget had excellent air con (empire can afford it and they need an upgrade, this is the reason for my average score as;3
Came here for a weekend stay with my husband and our three year old daughter. No big complaints about the hotel. Customer service is good and our room was nice and clean. However I was pretty irritated that they charged us $10 to have a microwave in our room in order to heat up our daughters milk AND they even made us put down a $100 deposit on it in case we damaged it -- even though by the looks of it, that piece of crap microwave probably didn't cost them more than $20. We are Hilton Honors members so at the very least they should've waived the $10 charge. I have never had a hotel charge me for a microwave to heat up children's milk -- they should really be ashamed of themselves for that one.  The hotel is definitely convenient to Universal. You can take about a 10-15 minute;3
Hotel is a budget type hotel, rooms are a bit worn but staff are fantastic.  Location is center of the tourist area and very busy. Plenty of subway stations nearby and 5 minutes walk from Central Park.;3
The room was fine. There was a bit of problem trying to get the hot water to come up. We wasted a lot of water(15 min.) We tried several rooms and the hotel staff was not very nice to us.;3
Depressing rooms. Tiny. Old. Views? What view? Oh, you mean of the back of a building?  Very nice staff. Clean sheets. New bathroom, and nice amenities but none of that can make up for a brown, sad room w no view and the sound of an air shaft. I was fooled by the low price and high trip advisor reviews. Something doesnât add up here.;3
I was very excited to stay at this hotel but left feeling a little disappointed. Our room was nice but very small and there wasn't a lot of space to store our luggage. The bathroom was extremely small which made getting ready difficult. The beds are very firm and even though we booked 6 months in advance, we were given a room with two beds which we did not need. The rooftop pool is TINY and freezing cold. It was a very hot day but I could not swim as it was way too cold! The lifts are frustrating- they take forever! The staff were friendly and we did enjoy having gossip girl cocktails in the cosy lounge but I think there are better hotels in NYC.;3
This is probably the closest hotel to Universal Studios/Citywalk that you'll find.  It is very convenient if you are visiting the theme park.  We were there for the half marathon race that started at the entrance so it was perfect for that.  We had a corner view of citywalk although technically not categorized as a city walk  view.  The beds were comfy and the other pictures that people have posted are accurate.  We found the front desk/bellman/valet to be friendly and courteous.  The restaurant looked nice although we didn't eat there.  Not sure if I would stay again just because of the price and I thought city walk was overrated.  Plus parking was expensive, but if you are going for a few days to visit Universal Studios, it would be a good choice (since you'd be paying for;3
The location was perfect. I had a room on the 17th floor, view of scaffolding and paid the same price as someone with a view of the city. Rooms are very small. Overpriced but this is New York.  Exercise patience;3
I'm going to start with the good points, this hotel is in a excellent location, its next to universal, 5 minutes from metro to key links such as hollywood one stop away and santa monica. The grounds surrounding areas is lovely and the pool is nice, the rooms are nice not too fancy a little old but nice and clean. The doorman Tim was excellent at conducting the exterior of the hotel. But this is as a little as it goes, we stayed here for 1 week and then came back again for 4 nights, the first week we had a good impression of the place, elevators were little slow but if you read reviews you would know they are going a under a renovation so suck it up! After arriving back at the hotel for our second stay we were told that wifi was free and given a code we were not told this the;3
Location was excellent but selling point is roof top pool area which was closed and looked run down. Libby area in need of refurb. V small room with no view and barely working shower. Some staff were surly, others were reasonably helpful. The staff seemed a little battle weary;3
Ita really for the young families, hope tou could add more activities and variety. Also if you could avoid just making people dizzy, it gets boring at the end of 2hours leaves you with nothing much to do;3
I stayed only one night over Christmas. It is not my type of hotels usually, but, I had a $50 Expedia coupon, and since The New Yorker is one of Expedia's +VIP Accessâ¢ hotel, I was able to double the value of my points! plus 15% off one night stay. So I booked one Queen bedroom, and the total paid was $93.45. (Look for good hotel offer )  - The hotel location was alright. I personally prefer to be closer to Time Square. - I got there during the peak of check-in time, and the line was long. Check-in was convenient and staff was ok. - The room was small but clean. The bed wasn't bad either. - Complimentary WiFi.;3
Because of Hurricane Sandy the elevator, tv, and wifi were down, but the staff was uniformly gracious and concerned, sharing the bath was never a problem, the shower is terrific and the towels wonderful, and everything clean. There are only hooks for hanging things, so either plan on laying things flat or bring a few hangars. The cafe on the ground floor is bright and has a good menu. On weekends one might prefer a room higher up to avoid traveling sound of the music in the ground-floor bar, though they said at the desk that had I called down they would have told the bartender to turn it down.  An easy walk from a number of restaurants, shops, and the entrance to the High Line, and taxis nearby.;3
"This was the only property en suite that we could have afforded and that was close to central London. The location is indeed excellent. Only the service is rather poor. It would be great if the staff learns how to say ""Good Morning"" or ""Hi"". Wifi is paid and the computers in the room are extremely slow. Our room was very small - just enough space for the bed, but for visiting London it is not a problem at all. It was clean and proper curtains.";3
This hotel was well out of the way. It's a good hours walk down into Manhattan & the sights. The hotel is fine in itself. There is a great bicycle rental shop just around the corner. Central Park is just  a 5 minute walk east. it's on Broadway, but a long way up. You are nearer to Harlem than Times Square. An average hotel with friendly helpful reception staff.;3
The hotel canceled our reservations.  We ended up in  smaller rooms that were more expensive.   We made reservations with AAA and they were wonderful but someone decided to cancel our rooms without notification!  The beds were smaller and we were not made happy with the hotel staff saying sorry.   Our breakfast was messed up as well.  Only good thing I can say,  the walk was easy to Universal studios.;3
To be fair I read some bad reviews but it ain't that bad. The room was boiling hot on the middle of winter on the 6th floor so we had to turn the aircon on at all times. The lift sounds like danger on floor 2 and the hotel is out of the way right uptown. It's 2 mins from the C line subway which takes you all the places you need to go.   You will find better hotels closer to the action for not a lot more dollar but if you need to budget and don't mind a 20 min journey mid/down town, it's not the worst place in the world.;3
Though room was small, it was very clean and nicely furnished.  The hotel had a very euro feel.  It was definitely nice to be across from Central Park. The staff was friendly and courteous.  Would definitely stay there again.;3
just to say that overall we enjoyed our stay at the hilton, it was close to universal and the 405 freeway. However there are a few annoying problems we paid to stay on the executive floor and found we were on the floor below which wasn`t a hardship except that the lifts were so slow!! and being a renal transplantee the stair option was not too attractive. The executive lounge facility was far too small especially in the mornings serving the two floors of executive rooms or so we thought....however when you consider the numerous upgrades people seemed to be given from other floors offering access to the lounge it felt like a macdonalds most mornings despite the excellent staff. To appreciate a fantastic executive lounge facility you should visit the hilton arc de triumph in paris;3
Really close walk to Universal  Studios. We  spent all day and night at the park. We went back to the hotel to take a nap before the Horror  Nights adventure. After all day walking at the park and another long night. It was really  worth it. But if we weren't  planning on the night,  I would have probably stayed at a cheaper hotel and dealt with the driving.  This hotel is already so expensive plus they charge you $24/night for self parking even if your a guest. They don't even give you a complimentary bottle of water. They charge almost everything. We requested for our room to be cleaned at 6pm because it was never done while we were out all day. But they never did, so didn't have any house keeping at all for 3 days.  The room was also loud.  You can hear the doors slamming;3
A good price for a perfect location. Staff are courteous and pleasant. Though the room is not as big as shown in the picture, bathroom is small and has no bathtub. No breakfast included. But overall it is good if youâre not really expecting a luxurious place to stay;3
"We stayed at the Ramada for 2 nights. The hotel is of older style but the rooms are very clean. When we arrived we were given one room that was meant to be non-smoking but it was very smokey and horrible. The check-in staff gave us another room after a little persuading.  We also booked the hotel for the gym facilities, which are terrible at the hotel, so don't stay here if you want a working gym. Everything was broken! The location was ok - there is not that much close by so if you want a restaurant you will need to drive a few blocks up. The hotel is close to all the ""main"" Hollywood sites and near to Universal Studios.";3
Good location.  Check in is slow with big queues. Lovely lobby. Room service was good always visited and tidied up. The roons are dated although badged as traditional. Toilet frequently blocked, taps noisy, could hear next door in the shower. Paint peeling off the bathroom walls, shower leaked. Clearly in need of a refurb. No in room facilities such as a kettle only chargeable water. Italian restaurant nice but Tick Tock  average at best with some dubious characters. Acid test.... Would I stay again.... NO.;3
As others, we chose this hotel for its proximity to the Universal Theme Park.  You can walk or take a shuttle bus.  The elevators were extremely slow and it was not clear exactly how many were actually working.  Once you finally got on one, you stopped at many floors along the way down to the lobby.  The rooms were relatively quiet and ours had a fridge.  The regular cafe was under construction so the lobby bar area was being used as the dining area, but the construction noises across the hall were quite loud and we found the menu a bit odd.  We had coupons for the continental (cold) breakfast and felt there were plenty of choices: meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, scones, bagels, yogurts, cereals, etc. without adding all the hot items (of which there were many). If one had to pay;3
Look past the fact the hallways and rooms are a little tired, this is an older hotel with great access to the Empire State Building , Broadway and Time Square (15min walk). Subway station to Central Park (5min) and Maddison Square Garden (5min). Our room had 2 bathrooms and a seperate bedroom, with views of the Empire State Building. We had 6 nights and as a family there is a coin laundry 10 min walk around the block in 9th Avenue. This is a key when travelling with kids.;3
This hotel is a very historical property going back to 1919. The lobby has been updated and they've done a good job to make it friendly and presentable. However, once you go into the ballroom, or event rooms or even the elevators, you realize that this is a real estate fixer upper. Carpets are old, rooms smell musty, molding and wallpapers look worn and dated. Wyndham should invest in this gem. Shame they are letting it fall apart. It's only redeeming quality is that it is a block away from MAdison Square Garden.  Don't eat the food - absolutely disgisting;3
Me along with my 4 friends Planned to visit Universal studios, on our way back from San-Diego.   After good reviews on TA & the good price I recommended them to book this hotel. Of course the name also played a role,... if you are in Hollywood ... stay in Hollywood Hotel :D   the property seemed bit old especially the elevator was like thousand year old. The rooms were clean and well equipped and pretty big.   Checking process wasn't very comfortable, we were denied free parking, which was promised from the hotel booking site. And also the extra bed for one friend, which was sorted out after showing the voucher.   Wasn't very happy with the staff's behavior.  Bed was comfortable, there was coffee maker, iron, refrigerator, hair drier etc. were in room. For the price it seemed;3
We were appalled by the service provided to us by the lady at the front desk attempting to check us in as soon as we arrived.  She was not helpful and was pretty rude.  How could a hotel not have a bell boy? We were expected to drag our suitcases to the storage room and to and from our hotel room. The description on the website was misleading about the hotel's location.  It is not near anything touristy at all. Loads of homeless people around (we could see them from our hotel window, which was spooky). Rooms were clean and had the right amount of amenities plus wireless internet access. Other staff members were helpful in providing information. Breakfast less than average. Will never choose the hotel again especially because of its location.;3
If you are planning a trip to LA or to Universal Studios this hotel is a good choice.  It is conveniently located in the heart of Universal which means you can easily walk to the park or take the free shuttle.  I stayed here in January when visiting LA for a long weekend.  The hotel is outside of the city, but I wanted to be near Universal so it was a good pick.   It is a large hotel, and had a conference, wedding, and another event going while I was there.   The room was large, and clean.  I booked a king alcove.     My only complaint about the room is that they did not provide cups for the coffee maker, and there wasnt any lotion in the bathroom.   I would recommend staying here if you are going to Universal, but you need to be aware that it is a large hotel, and can;3
Empire hotel is a great location across from Lincoln Center. The lobby bar and rooftop areas are really great. Stunning views and even a 'tiny' plunge pool. But it all works. Rooms are nicely decorated but also very tiny. No bathtub just a shower but it had a great rainforest head and water was hot so it was good. The bed was very strange,  not a mattress not really a futon, not sure what it was but not very comfortable. Service was good. Would I stay again, no, need a better more comfortable room for that price.;3
We are seriously thinking of going to another hotel in the near future. It is not the staff, but the rooms. The Empire needs some major renovation and I would not recommend it to anyone. It is expensive and the quality of the rooms should be up to par not be overcharged for basic amenities.;3
Sure, we got lucky and booked our weekend trip to NYC on the hottest day of the summer two years in a row. This year, I booked a junior suite because the rooms are tiny otherwise and my thought was that ânicerâ room would not have the issues we experienced last year. Needless to say, it was 100 degrees outside and our junior suite on the top floor never got below 80 degrees. Which for the record, is not a comfortable sleeping temperature, at least for me.  You canât beat the location and the pool is a fun space that is full but never crowded.  Having the room on the 11th floor was very convenient to the pool. The pool is really the only reason we booked here again. Next year, we will find a different, more updated hotel, with an outdoor pool in Manhattan.;3
I stayed here for work to be able to access the downtown area for a meeting. Hotels Elevator is always busy and you may have to wait 30 seconds or 6 minutes for it especailly if you are on floor 20 and above... I would come back here with family if I had tickets to univeral studios.;3
I work in New York, do a lot of travel in and out, and usually stay at the Four Seasons. Checking my calendar I saw that I'd forgotten to book a hotel for a month long stay and my hotel of choice was booked up for the first two nights. Happily, I found that the Empire had an amazing deal on a suite from Expedia for the two nights in question and I booked about three days ahead. The location is great--right next to Lincoln Center, close to the park, etc. The hotel is beautiful, my room was enormous and since I had a corner suite, I had amazing views of Columbus Circle. The lobby is chic and stylish and inviting. The facility itself is great.   My issue was with the staff of the hotel. Granted, it was the middle of Fashion Week. Granted, I'm just a lowly guest who paid for a room;3
The Empire Hotel is a great looking boutique hotel, in a convenient location next to Central Park, and within easy walking distance of downtown Manhattan and all its attractions. It has two nice bars, one by the lobby and one at the top of the building. Drinks prices aren't too bad for New York.   The staff are polite and efficient, but I wouldn't describe them as especially friendly or helpful.  Our room looked initially very pleasant and stylish. It was clean and tidy, and although small it was perfect for our needs. But that's where the good points ended for me. Our second floor room looked out on to an enclosed concrete yard and a bank of air con units which hummed 24 hours a day and became a little annoying. Hardly a room with a view! I was surprised to find that WiFi in;3
The Jane has the advantage of a great location in a beautiful neighborhood in the West village that is quiet and safe. Next to Hudson St Greenwich St and West 4th st that are abundant with great little restaurants, cafes, and stores. Also just a few blocks away from the 8th ave/14th st ACE stop. The service was great, all the employees were polite and respectful with a smile on their face at all times. The room was much smaller than expected, even after I went through all the available pics online. My only recommendation is the addition of some hangers - bring your own! Also, a room sink and some tissues would be awesome as the bathrooms use air dryers. Nevertheless, the room was clean, comfortable under the circumstances and provided a bottle of water every day. The bathrooms;3
My original hotel was closed so I had no choice and the booking agent sent myself and my aunt to The New Yorker at short notice. What I will say is this hotel is in a great location a very short walk to Macyâs, broadway and MSG, and the subway is directly outside the hotel. On entering the hotel it appeared very grand with lovely Art Deco design, but I was in for a shock. What is labelled 4 star on A website is no where near it, 4 star for location, there are plenty elevators but only one or two appeared to be working. Resulting in queues and cramming not ideal with covid restrictions. When we exited our floors the carpets were very worn and the corridors dark and not welcoming. I was initially several floors below my aunt and had to ask to be moved to same floor, which they did;3
The hotel is nice and comfortable. However, attention was not the best. The last day, a lady in charge of housekeeping knocked on my door in the morning to ask if I had checked out, this was annoying for me because the suggested check out time was about 11 am but she was beating my door at 8 am when I was resting and this was annoying for me. I felt pressured to leave the hotel. On the other hand when I went to cancel my account, I noticed that you loaded the different cost universal charger. As the price does not appear in the service book, the first day I arrived at the hotel I contacted the front desk to ask for the price of universal charger and you mentioned to me that the cost was $ 15 plus tax, at that time I estimated a maximum cost of 20 usd, but the surprise for me was;3
The empire hotel is in a good location to get to a lot of the attractions, Central Park a short walk away, most attractions like the museum, Times Square, you can get to on foot, breakfast diners like Flames a short walk with good old American breakfasts on offer, hotel bar and lounge is good and clean, room was small and definitely in need of a refurbishment;3
I waited 20 minutes to get into the parking lot to find out the Valet parking was full.  They referred us to the parking lot down the street. We had two walk two trunks to the hotel. Keep this in mind if you have issues with handling your own luggage. My room key did not initially work in the elevator so I returned to the desk and it turned out it was an elevator malfunction. They do have other elevators.  The bathroom is tight. You will have to get ready separately Unless one person in shower when one is at the sink. View from the window is the parking lot.  The room is clean and quiet to sleep. The hotel is close to the airport to catch your next flight, although this street is full of hotels.  I was expecting a bit more service from a Hyatt.;3
We stayed here in December for 6 nights. The New Yorker was in a great location, perfect in fact, in the middle of everything and close to time square without all that madness!  Out room was small but comfortable and it was a little tired round the edges (bathroom) but nothing that I'd complain about as its an old hotel, we were higher up so the view was great. Tick Tock diner was fab, we had breakfast there every day and two evening meals, they do the best burger ever. Really handy to have that down stairs.  Only complaint was some of the staff were not that friendly to deal with at all. I'm especially angry at the extra costs. Due to a friend recently visiting New York we were told they take so much per night from your card for a room deposit and refunded at the end of the;3
The hotel has a great location next to the Lincoln centre near Central Park. Easy to get to the tube too. The standard rooms are well equipped if slightly old. The main problem is the air con outside the rooms. It's just so noisy that sleep was tricky. Try and get a street facing room away from the central well. The roof top bar and pool does have good views but the pool is deceptively tiny ( some clever photos done to make it look bigger) the breakfast is good in eds chowder and reasonably priced for New York. Overall fine for a short trip and families on a  middling budget . No where is cheap in Manhatten.;3
I love the Empire Hotel. It's my first choice when traveling to NYC. But this last stay was pretty bad. The water in the building was turned off and no one notified us. We didn't realize it until we tried to shower only to find there was no water. When the water did come back on, it was freezing cold and it took about an hour to warm up enough to use it, which made us late for an event. Then, we received our valet ticket with instructions to text when we wanted our car, which we did. But the car didn't come. Thankfully the bellman noticed how long we were waiting and asked if we had requested the car. When we explained that we followed instructions on the ticket, he said that info should have been crossed out and that we needed to see the front desk. He did take the ticket and;3
Booked a Queen room with a view of The Empire State Building, View was great but disappointed with room. Found the room small but at least comfortable, tick tock diner was easy for breakfast before touring and hotel position great to get around New York.;3
The lobby is obviously the focus of this hotel, impressive decor and obviously famous for its role in Gossip Girl. The rooms however are standard, TINY and if your one of the unlucky ones, are dark and dingy due to lack of sunlight from and inward view of the hotel. We were next to a generator which was constantly noisy and normally Iâm not bothered and can sleep through noise but with this and the old air con unit going (which is completely necessary or else itâs wayyyy too stuffy and hot) I had the worst 4 night sleep in a long time!  The rooftop bar is cool and the location is great. Subways close by but we opted to walk everywhere.  Overall, I would not return here unless I got a really good deal. I know visiting New York isnât all about the hotel as you hardly use it other;3
The internet didn't work, the TVs were all not working throughout (and if it had, it was one of those old boxes), the elevator feels like it's about to break.  The staff was courteous.  The air conditioner worked, and was noisy enough to drown out other noises.  Great location for the parks and the mellow upper west side of Manhattan.  The other people staying in the hotel were all polite and friendly.;3
It's a good and relaxing place to stay and I made all my business customer feel the best views ever, you guys should come and check it out and see for yourself ððð. Fully protected and the food is amazing ð;3
Stay was fine, the room was good. One of the concierges was very rude and unhelpful when asked a simple question. Overall pleasant stay but Ive had better stays at the Roosevelt and I liked the locale better.;3
"I spent 2 nights at the hotel; Staff was pleasant and facility clean.  On the other hand, the room was very shabby, especially the bathroom. The beds were fine, but the bedding was sparse and I needed extra blankets. Nothing felt luxurious here, but everything was adequate.";3
First of all the location of this hotel is excellent. Its situated in Vermont a quiet neighbourhood, and 15 - 20 minutes to Universal Studios, Paramount Studios and the airport. We did venture outside a few times and found it to be safe and had no issues, there is a small convenience store opposite which was handy for beers and snackss, but to other than that you need a car to get to places.  Its located near to a large hospital , so there were sirens going past all the time, so try to avoid the rooms located over the main road and side road. We  had issue with ants in the room, we left our left over takeaway in the bin and woke to find ants having a field day, so we left the bin outside the room, which was left by the cleaners for 2 days. So any food left over was thrown;3
Room would not cool down to comfortable level using room controls.  All hotel staff were courteous and efficient.  But set out room service tray on Saturday morning an it set in the hallway until Monday morning.;3
When first arrived was booked into room 701 (take note of this number) which was located next to the elevator (you can see where this is going can't you?). The elevator made a loud scraping noise EVERY time it passed the room. Result? Not much sleep. However the staff at the front deck couldn't have been nicer in the morning and changed our room for us. We ended up with a bigger room, with a better view. All in all the staff were really helpfull and the location, a few steps from Broadway, was ideal. It was two minutes walking from Central Park and ten minutes from Times Square. A lot of the big attractions were within walking distance.  The docor was very dark and not to our taste but that's a small issue. We'd be happy to stay there again.;3
where do i start? I'll start with the pros first, the list is shorter but honest:  This an apartment suite with basic essentials. Two girlfriends and I shared a bedroom bachelor room with a pull-out sofa. It has a simple kitchen with all the Ikea dishware and utensils. Simple hot stove with microwave and working mini-fridge. I was impressed with how clean the bathroom was. There is decent closet as well for your coats and shoes. Plenty of clean sheets/materials and drawers for yoru clothes. Everything is clean enough and it's perfect when you're on a budget vacation. It is right by one of the subway stations on the upper west side. Location is perfect to get to anywhere you need. I love this location because it is right by central park and this area is clean, convenient and;3
First time in USA, stayed in the New Yorker hotel which is very central in Manhattan next to madison square garden. The hotel is very dated but ok for price and amenities. The tick tick restaurant which is joined to hotel was very well priced and staff very helpful. Hope you like walking;3
elevators did not work during our entire stay. waited very long for the service elevator. upon checking in, we were told breakfast was included. It was not, we received vouchers for $6.75 for breakfast!  Manager promised to credit me 15% for the inconvenience. Never did!!! Staff was okay, but not too bright and security person did not speak english.  |I asked him where the breakfast room was, he directed me to the restrooms.;3
"The Hollywood Hotel is a pretty nice hotel, partially updated. I say that because our room had new ""wood"" ceramic tile, curtains, nice beds, bedding, furniture, a refrigerator, microwave and safe in avery nice cabinet but you could see dirty spots on the wall where previous pictures were hung and the wall had not been painted. There was also an old paper border that had not been removed. I am not sure why you would spend the money and put new stuff in a room and not paint! The halls, rugs and fixtures were very nice, there was a patio bar with nice furnishings and a lovely garden. The front desk staff were very nice but the check-in was more drawn out than in most hotels. It didn't seem that there was enough staff to take care of the client's needs.While the hotel was very nice,";3
You cannot beat the location!  Its on a major subway line and across the street from Penn Station.  We stayed for three days in early November for our anniversary (during the marathon weekend) and it was a bit steep in price ($1,000 for three nights) for a very very small room given the overall condition of the hotel.  The first morning we did not have hot water, and the second day the hot water was so hot that we could not adjust it to get it warm...it was either scalding or cold!  What's with that?  Also, we had a pair of pants missing that was hanging in the closet!  In the morning they were there, in the afternoon when we got back they were gone!  What's with that?  It is an old hotel so we did not expect it to be pristine, but overall it was kept up for the most part.  It;3
Make sure the card for the Regency room works prior to giving access to the customer.  Room was very comfortable and coffee was excellent.  Bed was excellent and noise was nonexistent from the busy street below.;3
Nothing special at all.. We stayed on floor 6 (interior) which was very noisy due to the air conditioning shafts and the nightclub next door - 3:30am !!!! Not much storage space at all. Avoid the minibar at all costs - total rip off. Concierge was very helpful. Good location - but no more than average - OK for a night or 2, no longer.;3
Hotel is massive. 37 floors.  Its in a great location with easy access to Macy's, Empire state building and Times Square. Its clean but a bit dated. 24 hour diner attached but no hotel restaurant. Also expected bar to be open all night to residents but it wasn't. There are 3 desks in reception which is confusing and Concierges were a bit pushy. Staff not unpleasant but not particularly nice either.;3
You can't beat the location here. You are one street away from Penn Station. Times Square is a ten minute walk away. Unfortunately the hotel seems run-down and in need of a major renovation. It just looks worn out (worn carpets, cracked tiling, creaky elevators). Speaking of the elevators even though there were supposed to be six of them it only seemed like a few were working. Be prepared for long waits and once you do get one it will be packed with people stopping at every floor. The room itself was incredibly tiny. If you are with someone I hope you are very close. The bathroom is tiny as well. The sink has no vanity and really no space to put your toiletries out. They also nickle and dime you for stuff here. To check your bag at the bell desk is $5 per bag..I gave it three;3
Rooms weren't ready until 4:30 which was ok but they have no shower doors...water goes everywhere and makes a complete mess....you have to pay to print anything and you are paying 200-350 a night...over priced and barely mediocre at best...would not chose to stay here willingly again;3
The hotel is in a good location as there are many eating places locally.  We were on the top floor, and could only be accessed by one of the lifts - it took forever to get to the 13th floor and then it was slow on the way down too.  We had to run the hot water tap and the shower for at least 15 minutes before the water was hot enough to take a shower.  This is meant to be a budget hotel, bit it was not cheap!  It was very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.  Free Wi-Fi.;3
Wasn't the greatest of hotels was very dated and quite noticeable that the staff didn't wanna be there, location is good and cleanliness could be better I would stay again but only if I had too, be warned that they expected a tip every second or that's the impression I got;3
Stay here only if location is at the top of your list. It literally is across the street from the Lincoln Center. If you do decide to stay here, get a suite. Regular rooms are incredibly small. We had a leaky sink and broken AC/heater fan and so got upgraded from a regular double/double to a suite. Huge difference in room size. Even with that there is little space for storing items or hanging garments. The bathroom is one of the poorest designs I have ever seen. The shower door only covers half of the shower entrance so water sprays all over the bathroom floor when one showers. The sink is flat and only a few inches deep, making it very hard to drain properly and also hard to use. It was nearly impossible to wet a washcloth without it dipping into the accumulating water in the;3
We recently spent four days at The Empire for a friendâs wedding, and although I would not classify it as terrible, there are positive and negatives on both sides.  The positives certainly include the location. Only steps from Lincoln Centre and Central Park, great restaurants as close as just next door and their in-house restaurant, Edâs Chowder House is an excellent seafood venue. The Subway is only a few blocks north at 66th Street and the little park across the street is a relaxing (and quiet-ish) place to have coffee from Starbucks in the mornings and watch the city wake up. Cabs are easy to find and shopping is not too far away at Columbus Circle if you want to walk, which I often did in the cool mornings.  The negatives for me included dark interiors at every turn: lobby,;3
We were looking for an affordable base in the LA area with secure on site parking (not easy to come by, we found!) and the Hilton seemed to fit the bill.  After coming across this hotel we decided to visit Universal Studios as part of our trip and I cannot fault it if this is the main purpose of your visit. The hotel was in walking distance (even for my parents, one of whom is awaiting hip replacement surgery) and Citywalk was a really handy venue for us to grab an evening meal after a busy day seeing the sights of LA.   The rooms were very nice - clean, bright, spacious and relatively modern. I thought parking was quite expensive (at $25 per day) but no worse than I had seen listed at other LA hotels.   The hotel was a large, complex-style resort with lots going on, and this is;3
This is a decent hotel with great service. The downside, the hotel was built in the 80s and looks it. The rooms are fine. I've stayed here twice and the second time the shower drain was clogged and showering resulted in an ankle deep bath. The up side, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is great if you have business in Universal City or are visiting the park.;3
Stayed here for a weekend getaway. I booked directly through the hotel.  The rate for this weekend was NOT cheap.  Start of a school vacation week, Womens half marathon, opera, etc.  I chose the hotel based on location we were going to The Met.   So here is the good -  LOCATION - perfect for why we were here, the opera.  Central Park is a couple of blocks away. Many restaurants and you can walk to Times Square easily.  STAFF - The door and front desk staff were very friendly.  THE ROOMS - They are mostly very small but this NYC. Most rooms here are. I donât really consider that a bad as long as you know what you are in for before you show up. And I do mean they are SMALL. The bathrooms are even smaller.  And the bad -  THE ROOMS - The first room we were put in the AC was making;3
I was here for the weekend for an event . I travel frequently and stay at many Hilton properties around the globe . First the good. The staff are friendly and really try hard . Very accommodating.  Food at breakfast good , servers on top of it. Self parking is the way to go but almost 40 a day . Valet almost 48 if I remember . Beds and pillows good . Now the bad. The carpets look and feel dirty. The showers need updating . Very old , and have the handheld nozzle. Water got scalding hot. AC grate was full of dirt and looked moldy . We couldnât move rooms , so many events that they were full . Remember this is right against Universal, so great for families . Close walk also. But also loud. Not a place to stay if you want quiet .;3
This trip had been planned for a little over two months, so I could spend quality time with my wife for her birthday.  When I called to see if I could check-in early the girl at the front desk was very rude, even before I arrived at the hotel.  My refrigerator leaked, the floor lights on the elevators didn't work and I was over-charged.  Not happy with this experience at all.  I stay in Hiltons all over the world and this is by far a disappointment.;3
we stayed 5 nights in Aug14. it is very old hotel. Rooms are ok but bathrooms are so small you can not even find place to put your creams or toothbrush. Elevators are awful. there is always long queue on elevator because 2 of them are not working. We choosed the hotel because of the location and outdoor pool. location is great and i guess this is the only positive thing related with this hotel. pool is so small we didnt think about to swim after we saw it. staff in reservation and concierge are very helpful. this is the second positive thing. i am sorry but thats all. so dont expect  much. we stayed much better hotel in NYC before in a same price. so i dont think that this hotel deserves that money.;3
Busy hotel in midtown, small room (typical NYC), really basic amenities (byo toiletries) and forgetful housekeeping. Room was tiny we couldnât unpack. Strong showers pressure was nice at the end of long day exploring NY. Check in/out was smooth though and location was great with many food options. I would stay somewhere else with bigger room next time a little farther away from the hustle and bustle;3
Daughter and I stayed one night there. Cramped and damp feeling. Very small rooms and very small bathroom. Not in the best part of town either. Wouldnât stay there again. It was also too far from where we needed to be so I should of researched the distance a little more. Just did not care for it at all.;3
This hotel and the Sheraton definitely most convenient in regards to visiting universal studios. However, the buffet overpriced and it's probably better to just grab something at Peet's coffee in the lobby and/or Starbucks at city walk. Only half of the elevators working were testing everyone's patience but weren't horrible unless you were in a hurry. Pretty much feel like a number at this hotel. Nothing too special, but expected for a big hotel. I did sleep soundly so I can't complain too much. Hotel room was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. Didn't visit the gym or pool area.;3
Stayed here for three nights for a business trip. Positives: great location, WiFi included in room rate, room was kept clean and all the hotel staff I dealt with were very pleasant.  Negatives: Typical NYC tiny rooms (barely room to get around the bed and thatâs it), old bathroom and fixtures, drafty windows, and noisy (could hear showers turning on in other rooms, and colleagues on other floors heard construction outside all night long). I would opt for another hotel next time.;3
This hotel is in a great location and that's probably why we would go back. We were sceptical prior to arrival because some of the poor reviews that were coming in but it was okay. The room was small with a small desk and tiny wardrobe so be prepared to live out your suitcase. No full length mirror only a small one in the bathroom. The bathroom was so tiny you had to use the sink side on. However, the room was clean enough. Most of the staff were lovely. The girl is a bit nippy! Just be aware that you cannot check in to your room before 3pm check in and you MUST checkout on time, 11am. We witnessed a guy getting charged $50 for checking out at 1140am!;3
We just departed.  If youâre looking for a quiet hotel, donât stay here. Windows are paper thin and street noise 24 hours.  Mattress on bed requires replacement  Shower was great and highlight of stay  Room generally stuffy and required noisy aircon to be on most of time.  Drink card a joke. $16 for 2 happy hour drinks and we got one free.  And then as weâre leaving a staff member gives me a card asking I mention his name even though he did nothing for us.  Suggestions -   1.  Given the price of a room, offer a free drink or âsomething, complimentary as a sweetener / inducement to stay there again.  2.  Staff smile a little more and do something to endear yourself to the customer;3
"There were call girls working the rooftop bar and clients smoking pot on the rooftop bar and in their rooms (reported to reception and cleaners sent up with air freshener spray - to little effect). Also had building work constantly in reception area. Room was tiny; far too small for family of four and nowhere for the suitcases. Staff were OK and bar staff friendly (but they do work off tips....). All in all, not a stresee free break....";3
I traveled into NYC for business through Penn Station and this hotel was a perfect location for that trip. it is just across the street from Penn station and has a subway entry just outside the hotel. The rooms were very old with multiple layers of paint obvious. My room had peeling paint on the shower tiles. The beds we just okay, more firm than I like. There was no refrigerator in the room nor vending or ice on my floor. I did have a beautiful of the Empire State building. If you spend a lot of time in the room this may not be the hotel for you. I was in the room to change clothes, shower, and sleep, so it served my purpose well.;3
"Not surprised by significantly small room, as that seems typical in NYC. But the condition could be better. The hot water handle on the sink came off, a lot of chips and cracks, the shower would go ice cold then scalding hot every few seconds. I paid extra for a ""view"" room which was nothing more than a view of the brick building next door. So disappointed.";3
It is a good location with shuttle service from/ to LAX airport. The front desk could not find my membership so there was not member service, no higher floor option. There is no complementary breakfast for members either. I woke up from the noise probably from TV next room around 3am and from talking around 5 am.;3
Location of hotel is very convenient.  Lovely ambience in lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Check in was easy and we were met with a friendly attitude and courtesy by Rudy at the front desk and Daniel the bellman. Room was clean, poorly lit, somewhat cramped but efficiently designed and beds were comfortable. We liked that the window would actually open and we could get some fresh air . We were told at the front desk that we could get a Keurig coffee pot sent to our room but were not told we would have to pay three dollars for each K cup of coffee. We needed a new bulb and housekeeping was there quickly. The room had a mini-mart's worth of things to buy on the dresser and took up a lot of already limited space. It seems they were a bit into the retail business's as well as;3
This was very bang average. The cheaper rooms (still $500-600 per night) are very small. The bathroom is rather unremarkable and small. It also doesn't offer any sizeable shampoo or shower gel. As well as this, there is a very loud aircon that will either keep you awake or (when turned off) the heat will do the same. For this amount of money my three night could have been better spent.   * * *;3
The hotel is walking distance to universal studios.  We walked there on our stay.  Hotel was clean however we were unaware of a $25 a night parking fee.  The self parking was a LONG walk to elevators and to our room.  We asked to use a cart for luggage and was told we could pay a bell guy to do it and we couldn't use them.  Not happy with that.  The elevators were VERY slow and half the time only two were working.  Our AC unit wasn't working either and it was hot.  They did however fix that.  The only reason we would ever stay here again is for going to Universal Studios being so close.  That's the only reason.;3
Stayed here for work b/c of group rate. In the middle of TimesSquare. Staff was ok and door man helped me get a cab during the craziness of the UN General Assembly. Fine for a work trip, but wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again. Small things like no bath robe...;3
We  stayed at the Empire Hotel over the weekend, and on Sunday morning, the hotel had no hot water. It is impossible to say anything positive about a hotel that cannot provide guests with a hot shower.;3
The best thing about this hotel is its location and proximity to public transportation. The hotel itself is historic but needs an update particularly in the bathrooms. We had booked three standard rooms: two with queen size beds and one with two twin beds. The rooms with a queen size bed are much smaller than the ones with two twins. In this hotel it really makes a big difference! The mattress and pillows are not the best ones (forgot to take our own pillows with us), and none of us (6 altogether) slept very well. The bathrooms are very tiny, outdated and have no space for your things unless you want to keep them on the floor. The staff were friendly enough.;3
Not the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, but certainly not the worst. The hotel is close to the subway and easy to find. I found the staff a little standoffish but they checked us in quickly. The room was small and basic, but sufficient and was cleaned every day. The hotel allowed us to store our luggage on the last day in their luggage room, for no fee, which was much appreciated as we had a late flight booked. There is a good bagel shop round the corner too!;3
We spent 10 days in this hotel and the over all impression is that it needs a freshening up. The first room we were put in was horrible-old dirty wall to wall carpeting, very dusty, run down, stinky (stale cigarette smoke and very sharp air freshner smell) and yellow from nicotine. The furniture was huge and outdated and a big television cabinet took up most of the floorspace. The television was from the age way before flatscreens and the reception was very bad.  We asked to be moved after spending 30 min in the first room and there was no objections. We got a new room that was much better-cleaner but still run down and with wall to wall carpeting. There was a flatscreen on the wall and the reception was ok. Both rooms had airconditioning wich was quite loud so we turned it of;3
First time staying at this hotel. Location good, staff good so what's the problem? This hotel is very very old and no matter how much one cleans , it's just old. Rooms very tiny, not functional or stay friendly. Bed is about the only thing that's from this decade, oh and TV.  Nothing is positioned correctly because of the size.  Bathroom horrible , can't maintain water temperature so you either burn or freeze.  Overall it's not bad because most of NY hotels are worst.;3
We were disappointed with this hotel.  We'd stayed before and loved it and were looking forward to returning. But it felt run down in comparison with our previous stay - lots of cost cutting which really took the shine off our experience.;3
The best feature of this former SRO building is its location. You simply cannot get closer to Lincoln Center as it across the street. In addition, with a few decent restaurants around- one could argue that this is a serious hotel to consider if you have business on the Upper Westside.  I have stayed here more than twice but I must confess that I wanted to wait until I had a better experience. I cannot forget room 139 which okay was so small it was silly but there was no air or heat unit, although it faced one outside. That is the view. If you are suffocating and cannot open anything, you get a feeling that you are in a coffin, albeit a pretty and designed one. The use of space is so smart because if you really think about it, these rooms are very , very small.   The front desk;3
We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Thanksgiving day parade route. The room was small and the bathroom smaller. On the positive side, the room was clean and comfortable. The staff was pleasant. Otherwise the decor was dated. Lots of restaurants and shopping in the area.;3
Overall the Hotel was expensive, but that is expected for NY. The rooftop very nice view. We had 2 drinks only and price was $40. Bathroom was not comfortable. couldn't figure out the shower set up and the sink was designed with not much space between the faucet and the basin.;3
I'm a current guest , the stay was going great until today so upset ,, I think there car service or at least the driver we had today needs to listen to his customers!!!! He insisted on dropping us at the wrong location after I and the person with me told him over and over no !! Not this location ,however he wouldn't listen to us so this caused us to miss out on the filming off a program at Warner bros studio , very upset , also way over priced . I've also found some employees a little dismissive , let's hope my last day here doesn't let me down;3
Booked through Priceline. Upon arrival informed that we would need to pay $125 non refundable per deposit for our terrier. We prepaid in part b/c they advertise dog-friendly. $125 is not friendly. Then we were given a dirty old dingy room. So we were forced to overpay (Priceline was unhelpful) and then stashed in the ghetto. Oh, no free water or coffee. So prepare to spend 7.50 for a plastic bottle of water. Disaster. This is no 4 star hotel. The lobby is nice, the bartender;3
Good location near Pent Station,restaurants and shopping malls.There are many Halal carts around for quick take away foods. I requested for upgrade into a newly renovated room and was given a room at the 8th floor.The room was spacious but overlooked into an air well and directly facing opposite rooms windows so we have to keep the curtains closed all the time.The bathroom is very small and the wash hand basin is very shallow and water splashes everywhere.The biggest problem is the foul smell coming out from the ventilation system.There is an extra fee charged for internet and calls.So you need to make landline calls to make your money worth.We did not have time to do that because we were busy touring the city.Otherwise the hotel is okay.;3
Enjoyed a 5 night stay in December. Excellent location opposite The Met. Sadly our room was very small and the air con was noisy but otherwise we enjoyed our stay.  Also - being charged for wifi in 2015 is a little cheeky... Only free wifi in the lobby..... The concierge (both guys) were excellent. Thank you for restaurant bookings! And Juel and Nikki in the hotel bar were flawless. Thanks to you both. See you next December.;3
Deception: When you look and see that the same dish your friend asked for and yours is totally different. When you arrive in the room to settle and your pillow smells of perfume from the previous guest, I will rethink before booking a room.;3
You wonât find another place The Jane. Itâs really authentic and in a beautiful spot at the Hudson River.  If you are looking for at cheap stay in New York this hotel is a obvious choice.   But you must be aware that the rooms are even smaller than a cabin on a ship. I was really surprised compared to the pictures. I figured it out though.  Another thing - the hotel has centra heating. I was here in March and the weather was quite cold, but my room was so hot that I had difficulty sleeping. Even though I turned on the fan and the AC, the heating was unbearable. If I had known that, I would never have chosen The Jane. It kind of ruined my trip because I couldnât sleep. But a part from that, then concept works.   Remember to visit Old Rose the Italian restaurant within The Jane.;3
For anyone looking for a glamorous hotel in the prime location of Hollywood, you'll be disappointed. The room is tight and not very modern. There is however complementary breakfast which may somewhat offset the lack of food choices in the typical LA neighborhood (busy & safe but not Beverly Hills).  An important safety issue to note is that you must make sure to fully close the door. Once I walked into the wrong room because that guest's room wasn't locked despite being closed. Later I discovered the door in my room was also not fully secured. I suspect the doors are old and quiet loose. Be sure to tighten the door handle when you go out.  This is really a hit and miss hotel depending on what rate you get the room at.;3
The hotel is only 3 stars and priced as such.  The rooms are just okay.  We had warm water showers and two of the elevators weren't working. The rooftop bar was great location to sit and drink on a beautiful warm day. The hotel is an excellent location for visiting Lincoln Center, which had concerts, ballets, theater, and film from morning to night.  Much of the Upper West Side is walking distance including Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History, restaurants and cafes, and lovely residential tree lined street. Only a $9 taxi ride from Grand Central Station.;3
Five stars for location. The crossroads of the Upper Westside. Across from Lincoln Center. Steps away from the subway with connections all over Manhattan. Buses galore. Rooftop bar with gorgeous views. Staff pleasant and helpful. Room small but adequate and very clean which is of utmost importance to me. PJ Clarkâs right downstairs. One of the oldest names in pubs in the city. Restaurants galore.;3
I stayed here a night going and a night returning from Asia.  The bed is a real comfort and the rooms themselves nice enough.  But the shower.  Iâm all for conserving water but to not be able to rinse the shampoo from the little bit of hair I have left is ridiculous.;3
We booked for three consecutive days and planned on one more night two days later.  Since the Hotels.com doesn't allow for a split booking, we tried to get the one day at the same rate from the front desk when we checked in.  No dice.    The room was clean but the lighting was very dim.  We booked a queen double and it came with a couch and small balcony.  The bathroom was small and we only had a shower.  My fiancee prefers a bath.  The free breakfast was simple but worthwhile.  Eggs, link sausage, real waffles, pastries, canned fruit, cereals, juices, milk and very good coffee.    Wednesday and Monday nights there is a free comedy club in the bar.  At least it was free.  The surrounding neighborhood is not extremely desirable but it is OK.  Walking to the drugstore two blocks;3
The location of the hotel is perfect. It's close to shops and restaurants, a few blocks from subway station and a pleasant walk from Times Square. Hotel lobby is charming and check-in was quick and easy. Rooms are safe and clean, however too small and dated. The main problem during our stay were low outside temperatures that weren't compensated by proper heating. The air-conditioning was actualling cooling our room which meant I has to sleep in jumper and socks to stay warm.;3
We always read reviews before picking hotels and I knew the Jane had rooms that were noisy and that most larger rooms had views of the Hudson .I therefore asked for a high floor with a view. When we checked in to our captain's cabin about 5.30 pm it was on the second floor with no view .The bathroom door was also jammed shut and had to be opened by an employee.We were told that if we got down to the lobby early in the morning we might get a better room .Both of us were very tired after a night with very little sleep and the flight from the UK and were not happy to be kept awake by the techno beat reverberating through our pillows until the early hours and also having to call down for someone to open the bathroom door again which took some time with various tools while I stood;3
I travel to london every year and so I try to find cheap accomodation since the main reason for my travel is to roam around london and shopping. I bearly stay in my hotel room so finding cheap accomodation where I can just leave my bags and return at night to sleep is my goal. I stayed at Abercorn house around 4 times both with my friends and with my mum. Don't except much, it is only the best accomodatin if your aim is to have cheap accomodatinon, could leave your belongings somewhere and to sleep.;3
My friend and I traveled to NYC and last minute added a night to our weekend stay. We ended up booking the Jane mostly because the price was good and it was available. We stayed in a bunk room which was somehow smaller than it looked in the photos, but we were expecting small, so no big deal (the rooms were just more narrow than they looked online). When we checked in everyone was really friendly and accommodating, the bathrooms were close to our room which was nice. Truly my friend and I liked the value and vibe of the hotel and planned on returning in the future- that is until we woke up the next morning t find someone had been in our room while we were out the night before, and they stole out tickets to the ballet! So the night the tickets went missing we had gone to dinner,;3
I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews for this hotel. But I arrived the welcome was good, went up to the room, room was ok a bit out dated being an old hotel. Didn't find any nasty surprises good location, subway outside, laundrymat out the front, phamacy and store just down stairs, I enjoyed my say there and would stay again, the only thing the AC did make a bit of a racket.;3
If you're interested in staying at a pretty place with a fancy bar and celeb sightings, this is the place for you. If you are looking for a well laid out, stress free get away, look elsewhere. Everything at the Empire is attractive--from the wallpaper to the pretty lighting. The bar is comfy and the rooftop is super swanky.   The sink is way too shallow to brush your teeth and wash your face within 2 minutes of each other. The towels are thin and sparse. The shower's glass wall seems to be placed on the wrong side of the shower head. There is no way to avoid getting the floor wet. I imagine that the ceiling of every bathroom has a water stain from the floor above. The elevators seem to come on a first come first served basis, so you'll see them go past your floor a few times.;3
Upon arrival we were quickly & efficiently checked in. As we were in New York for my 30th birthday we had a free room upgrade to a room with a view & vouchers for a complimentary breakfast at the tick tock diner. Before arrival I was advised of a Â£45 per night incidental charge but this was just held on the credit card, not taken, what wasn't expected was the non refundable $29 + taxes per night service fee, which for WiFi that dropped frequently & a gym we didn't have time to use we thought this was quite steep.  Our room (2435) was a corner room on the 24th floor, it was a good size with a fantastic view of the Empire State building & Madison Square Gardens to the right. The room was clean & the bed was comfortable, the curtains are blackouts & keep the room really dark in the;3
We have just returned from The New Yorker and there are lots of things we liked but on balance the bad knocked the good points down to average. We had our resort fees included in our package with Virgin which was great, however, I do feel the fees are not value for money. We contacted the hotel before we arrived to ask for rooms close together and a nice view. We got one of those requests and had a great view of the Empire State Building. The hotel is clean and staff helpful, it is in an excellent location, so convenient for the attractions and subway.  The not so good now, the smell of weed seems to seep into the rooms through the vent, the rooms are very small and there is no fridge or kettle/coffee maker unless you pay for them. Also, the lifts were a nightmare when we;3
"I booked a night at the Empire for a romantic night out. Besides looking great and great location I chose them because I read that they accept cash deposits for incidentals. I like to keep my card at home because i'll just charge and charge; keeping my card at home keeps my credit score high and my debt low. I booked through Orbitz and looked forward to the weekend.  I was dismayed when I got there and was told I couldn't book the room. Turns out that Orbitz had the wrong info regarding cash deposits and I mistakenly thought that I read that on Empire's official site. But why have different info out there in the first place? Fix it, you are a major hotel, that shouldn't even be an issue. And on top of it all the first person I spoke to at the desk had a MAJOR attitude... Like I";3
"We stayed for 4 nights in mid July 2017. Pluses- location and rooftop bar. Minuses- pool and fitness center closed indefinitely and no explanation. (Reason we booked) postage stamp size room. Tiniest bathroom- about like cruise ship. Mini fridge was full of high priced stuff to buy leaving no room for anything you want to stock. Housekeeping on ""limited service"" per front desk our first day but did come empty trash and bring fresh towels when I called and asked. Did come other days. Staff was efficient but not friendly. All the help acted on edge like they were suspicious of everyone or felt they were being watched. Will not stay there again. Didn't eat in restaurant so can't speak to that";3
"I was staying here with a friend while sightseeing in New York. I was a bit concerned at first as it seemed quite a budget hotel and there doesn't seem to be a website. We were told check wan't until 3pm when we arrived at 2pm having been awake and travelling for nearly 16 hours! We couldn't get a twin room as a 'two-bed room' must be specifically booked. The lift was tiny and extremely slow. The room was basic and small and there isn't any breakfast.  However when I told reception that as friends we'd prefer separate beds, they did change us to a ""king-bed room"", which must have been a super king as the bed was massive and comfortable. The room was clean with air-con; noisy but definitely worth having. The private bathroon had a shower that was powerful and hot. The room was";3
The Hilton at Universal City is a weird combination of great and not so great.  The rooms although a little dated where very big and comfortable, with great lighting. Very clean and comfy beds.  The restaurant is ok but the buffet is way over priced, and do not be taken by the glitz of the all you can eat seafood buffet.  The food was not that good and unless you eat a huge amount of food the $44.00 price tag is not a great value.  The Seafood at Bubba Gumps on City Walk was much better.   Just a few minutes walk to Universal and the City Walk.  The City Walk offers food, entertainment,  and shopping. It is a fun way to end the day. The true shinning stars of this hotel are the Bell Service Desk staff.  These men and woman are friendly and happy to share their knowledge of LA.;3
I'm so disappointed in this hotel :( After years of enjoying their rooftop hotel, we decided to actually stay here for a conference - big mistake. This is a 3 star hotel masquerading as a 4 star. Picture the following: no door attendants to speak of, except the occasional nondescript staff who meander over and half-heartedly make an effort to open the door after you've helped yourself. I say nondescript, because they wear random northface-like jackets, sneakers, and look like they haven't shaved or showered in months.  Make your way to the very well-designed lobby, which is FREEZING because the doors are so poorly designed, they swing to-and-fro freely. Reasonable check-in, but then you find yourself in hotel rooms that lack so many niceties separating 4-stars from 3-stars.;3
Rooms were dirty, toilet visibly stained and carpet very dusty. But overall the customer service was excellent and the location too. Consider introducing breakfast onto the package. Also, give discounts to repeat guests.;3
Me and my husband stayed here for three nights 8-10 August 2017. We booked a king suite with jacuzzi bath tub (room 136) and our first impressions of the room were very good. The jacuzzi bath was great, and the free shower gel/shampoo/soap etc was quite 'upmarket' compared to other hotels I've stayed in. The suite had a small kitchen area with coffee making facilities/microwave/fridge - all in good working order. The sofa and chairs in the room were extremely comfortable and a nice touch with designer cushions on the sofa. The decor in the room was really lovely, although the lighting was pretty poor in the room, despite it being double aspect. There was lots of space in the room with nice tiled floors, although the floors could have done with a clean, as walking around bare;3
Recently stayed with family.  Staff was professional and accommodating.    Decor is a bit worn and dated. The Lobby was pleasant but the hallways were claustrophobic with a slap in your face of 70's funk.  Location is very good.  Close to Central Park, Subway and a hop skip and a jump from the Lincoln Center for the Performance Arts..;3
This hotel is in agreat location with plenty of restaurants and shops close by and the Empire State Building is within easy reach as is Penn Station.  Upon arrival we were very impressed by the lobby area, although it was ALWAYS very busy - I think passers-by came in for a cool down because the Air Conditioning was very good.    We were checked in very quickly by a polite member of staff.  As it was my Wife's birthday and our Wedding Anniversary during our stay, I had already emailed the hotel and asked them if there was any chance of an upgrade.  When we were checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a larger room with a view of the Empire State Buiding.  We were happy about this and also glad as the room we were given was not that large and I wouldn't have;3
Regadigg this hotel, the location is great, just next to Penn Station, subway, just a few blocks from the Empire State Building.  Once you check out, you can store your luggage for a $5 US per bag.  This is a good option.  What I didn't like about this hotel, is that I believe is overpriced.  The rooms are outdated, bathrooms are really small.  Room decoration is depressing and outdated.  The hidden fees!!.  Be aware of it.  they will charge you a hidden fee for internet use, even if you don't use it.  Overall, if look for location.  You wont spend time at the hote, and you don't need amenities.  It is ok;3
We stayed for one night (10/4) the hotel is beautiful and stylish. They were late giving us our room by almost 2 hours which was really disappointing. Obviously this was inconvenient in a number of ways, not being able to relax before rushing to change for dinner, late to our reservation and simply harried until we arrived at the theater. Do NOT stay in a room on the 10th floor, the nightclub is above and it is loud until very late/early. I'm not sure if it's open all year or just when the weather permits. All the staff we encountered was friendly and tried to be helpful. Very close to Lincoln Center. The room was a suite, an upgrade (I think) from the corner suite we originally booked, two bathrooms would be convenient if you are staying longer with more than two people in the;3
Like many others, I agree that the location is the best things about this hotel. And you do get what you are paying for. Basic, however quite dated rooms, accommodation in great location. Everything within walking distance. Room itself is as big as showbox, sheets were new and clean, service friendly.;3
Front desk and maintainance staff were helpful. There was no top sheet on the bed unless requested. The bathroom had major water damage. The towels smelled bad and the hallway smelled like cigarettes.;3
I used to live in NYC and had never had to stay in a hotel and was fairly horrified by what's available at what prices.  After we got over the shock of the VERY no-frills aged appearance of the hotel and the fact that there were a lot of funky things like peeling paint in the bathroom, wires hanging out in the room and different colors of paint (within the same spot) in about 47 layers, including covering some old doorbell on the inside of our room, we decided it was not as bad as we first thought. Really! Our initial impression was that something was going to come crawling out or that we would hear the people in the neighboring room breathing (thin walls) but none of that was the case. It was actually quite clean and very quiet, (we stayed on the main floor in the back) just;3
We booked the room looking for somewhere central with a bit of space, payed for a larger room. We were on 36th floor with a great view of Empire State. The room was very small, without enough room to put our suitcases out of the way. On top of the daily extra fee which is added to your room cost for use of internet, gym and phone we paid extra again for a coffee maker and fridge. The bathroom was tiny and had very limited shelving to put anything. We heard a lot of noise from our neighbours, including voices, toilets flushing, blow dryers. We also had room service knocking on our door at midnight to deliver pillows and blankets - wrong room and it was hard to get back to sleep.  On the positive side we were close to Penn Station, Tic Toc was fantastic and was the bar and;3
Hotel is conveniently located at LAX and near highway 405.  Rooms are large and contain all the comfort needed. Beds are great. Prices for parking are however exorbitant. Also the cost of a breakfast is exagerated. Taking into account these extra's the hotel is definitively not the best value when visiting LA...;3
The location of this hotel is great, it is a few minutes walk from Central Park and close to the subway so you can get anywhere in the city. We were in 717 which was a deluxe king room, a couple of upgrades up but still quite small. There is a stylish bar and reception on the ground floor which would have been an interesting place to hang out had the staff not insisted on keeping the main doors open making the area very chilly at all hours. The hotel is twelve floors with a roof terrace on top which has a retractable roof making it good for winter and summer. This area seemed to be taken over by trendy young types all evening with even a queue to get up on Saturday (residents get priority by the way). Plenty of options are around for eating. Eds chowder house next door serves;3
Pros: Location, mattress comfort, room cleanliness, value for money.  Cons: extreme noise in the room from the A/C. Even if the A/C is off, the neighbouring rooms will annoy you. Small room. Poor breakfast.;3
Upon arrival the lobby and bar were very nice. They have done a good job of refurbishing it, but they have done nothing to the bathrooms. Our bathroom was the size of a closet & there was mold everywhere. You could not stand in front of the sink because there was no room! Every time you took a shower the bathroom floor got flooded due to the half shower door. The rain shower was useless. The rooftop bar was nice, but Saturday night we had loud people screaming in the hallway & slamming doors. The location was wonderful. We were across from Lincoln Center & Central Park. There are plenty of great restaurants within walking distance.;3
Very good service, with a very friendly front desk. Nothing special, a good-looking breakfast buffet that we did not try though. The reason you stay here is to be able to walk five minutes to the Hilton Universal property. It's a very easy walk even with kids. Worth the money;3
The Empire Hotel is good for its central location, close to Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle and Central park. Many Starbucks and convenience stores are in the immediate vicinity, as well one of the best food trucks (for breakfast). The rooftop bar is very nice too.  On the downside, the standard room was on the small side, the AC rattling very loudly.;3
Just returned from 4 nights at this hotel. First impressions good.. very sexy! Long line to check in. Their room card machine had broken down so the only way to get into the room was for reception to page security to let each client in individually, which clearly took some time. The room was tiny with very little storage in spite of being a superior king. Air conditioning unit ancient and the dial to control the heat was missing. Made the mistake of unpacking before checking the bathroom, which was in a dreadful state of maintenance. Wooden surround of the shower was actually rotted and you could lift a piece of splintered wood right out. Paint flaking off the woodwork, metal surround of the magnifying mirror rusted and 9 inch space between the sink front and the wall meant the;3
For the $65-$75 price range this is a ok hotel. You can't ask for more for this price. Small room, ok bathroom. Lot more room for improvement through, but for a one night sleep this would do. Anyway if you are going sight seeing and not wanting to stay in the hotel this is a good place. located in front of the central park and about 5mins to the subway even though we didn't use it frequently.;3
We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  It is in a great location, next to Madison Square Gardens and Penn station. It is a very busy hotel. The staff were friendly and some were helpful, others not so. The rooms were old and worn.  There was also a lot of noise from the corridors and the surrounding bathrooms, it sounds as if the plumbing system could do with an overhaul. 5 am every day.;3
The position is excellent. The hotel is  50 yards from a subway station leading in short time to midtown Manhattan. It is located in a quiet and very pleasant section of Upper Manhattan. It is surrounded by nice, familiar restaurants, where we ate 3 nights in different places. Inside, unfortunately, it really needs some works. The carpets are very old and worn up, the furniture very essential and out of date. On the other side, the bathroom is spacious, with a bathtube and good shower. The staff is kind and cooperative, ready to give indications to the tourist. In  a few words, very good position, but could be made much more comfortable.;3
I stayed at the New Yorker for 2 nights: the location can't be beaten. It is located on W 34th st and 8 ave. across the street from Madison square garden. Time square lies on walking distance (10-15 minutes). Although the rooms are very small its in consensus with the average NY hotel. Good price-quality relationship with clean rooms but mediocre bathroom.;3
There isn't anything special about this hotel -- basic amenities, average service, wifi is NOT included, rooftop bar that everyone raves about randomly closed. It is a very expensive place to stay but you're in a prime location. It's pretentious on the outside, kind of crummy with outdated appliances on the inside.;3
Nice rooms, free breakfast is good, the location isn't great and for Â£100 per night you are away from everything. Next to subway station and buses to Santa Monica so not to bad . Builders started banging at 8 am on our first morning . Not great after a long flight. Nice Waffles though;3
The location is wonderful, the staff VERY helpful and the price in December reasonable. However, we had to change rooms 4 times due to the immense smoke odor in this âNO smoking hotel.â Needs vast updating.;3
Room is indeed very small, service is at good and friendly level. Water on the room for free but not the bottle Sanitary is clean and well working. Location is very central, lots of nice shops and food;3
We spent two nights at the Hilton Universal City. Overall, the experience was pretty average, but it does serve a purpose.  Our experience was slightly marred by the fact that we turned up and they'd lost our reservation - then charged us a higher rate than we'd originally been quoted. They did put us in a lovely room with a great view of the studios and the hills. And it's very convenient for visiting Hollywood.  But all in all it's a fairly soulless place - and very expensive too. You have to pay for parking on top of your room, room service and telephone calls are extortionate and you have to pay for breakfast as well! It all adds up to a pricey trip.;3
We stayed for three nights at the hotel, and it is what you pay for. It is in need of some modernisation and some fix ups cosmetically. The rooms were well worn, but the bathroom was beautifully clean, with some lovely clean white towels. The bed was extremely comfortable. Much better than some higher priced hotels I have stayed at with my husband.  The room however was very, very cold. I had to ask for extra blankets as I was shivering. However I do have to mention in the hotels defence that the weather was freakishly cold. However most of the cold was blowing in through gaps in the window, and I really do think the hotel should look into getting these draft holes fixed.   Staff at the hotel were faultless, concierge very friendly and helpful, as was the nice lady who arranged;3
We chose the Hilton for two reasons 1) it is a Hilton and 2) the Location was close (walking distance) to Universal Studios. Unfortunately, this hotel did not live up to typical Hilton standards. Our room was good, but we found that the supposed clean wash clothes provided had hair in them and the toilet was clogged. After a long day at Universal Studios we had to wait for the maintenance person (who was pretty prompt) to come unclog the toilet, however getting fresh wash clothes took well over an hour. I stayed awake waiting for them to arrive, while my family slept, but of course the knock on the door twice (for maintenance and wash clothes) woke everyone from their sleep.   On the bright side this hotel is steps away from the Universal Studios and City Walk entrances.;3
Cute hotel on the upper west side. I wouldn't choose it if you want to be close to mid town but if you don't mid a walk then it's perfect. It's close to the park with plenty of places to eat around it. The hotel itself is very well decorated however you have to pay for wifi- to be expected in NYC. We had a suite however it wasn't the biggest but still very nice, we had complimentary champagne and fruit on a tribal which was a nice touch;3
So arrived here for a 5 night stay. Perfect location. The receptionist greet wasn't great, she could have put on a smile, but it was no big deal! Rooms are small which was expected but barely a view to get excited over.  Beds were comfortable with lovely soft pillows, we both had a great night sleep every night. Windows are only double glazed so you can hear a lot of noise but when you've had a long day touring the city, you're ready for your bed!  Our bathroom came with a bath and a shower, which was a bonus. Enjoyed a nice long soak after lots of walking.  Towels changed daily, beds made daily apart from one day, where they came at 8.30am, we were only just getting out of bed but they still gave us clean towels.  You do wait for the elevators for a very long time, there are;3
"Stayed for 5 nights on our first visit to New York The Hotel ""Days Inn"" 215 94th Street was a very long way out but plenty of taxis around and cheap. We walked down daily and taxied back at night. The hotel is being refitted and all though very tired it was clean and lovely fresh bedding made it a pleasure for sleeping in. Coffee machine in room and a good tv.  Bath and shower ok, but only had hot water when heating was on usually in the mornings or after 8pm. Very noisey central heating system but got used to it Staff ok and pleasant. Would recommend this hotel if you like a good walk.";3
Our room was so small we couldn't lay out our luggage properly. Room was hot no way to control temperature. And wifi is the room is extremely expensive and un reliable. Great location and the staff were very friendly.;3
My wife and I stayed here in April 2005. It was a trip that we organised at the last minute and we were being quoted $250 dollars and more (much more) per night at other hotels that had vacancy's. We were a little concerned about staying in the Lower East Side, but we did not have many (any) alternatives and at $150 per night, we decided to go for it.  The hotel itself is about average, very clean and the rooms were serviced each day. It is a modern hotel, but it is starting to show some signs of wear. The bathroom is modernish, but I prefer modern over antique charm any day so it was fine. It was necessary to run the shower for a few minutes to get hot water, but once we had worked this out, it was not a major problem. We reported this to the hotel and they say that they are;3
My 12 year old daughter and I stayed at this hotel in December this year.  Yes the hotel is basic, but clean enough.  Rooms were small but adequate for 2.  I agree with peoples comments on the fact that you are only sleeping in the hotel so why pay a lot. We got a reasonable deal here flying with American Airlines, whom were excellent with masses of room on the plane.  The hotel is quite a way out but after the hustle and bustle of Manhattan the peace is most welcome.  We to suffered from a cold room but we asked for an extra blanket which we got straight away and were then more than comfortable.  I was a little concerned before we went about getting to and from the hotel but after the first night's long walk back to hotel we tried out the subway.  Not pretty but cheap and;3
"We made reservations with this hotel because my husband was having 2 procedures done at Kaiser Sunset which was a couple of blocks away.  We booked with a non-refundable rate.  After we made the reservation we got a email from the hotel showing all of the ""extra charges"" like parking in their parking lot $27 + tax a night. We had a 7lb dog with us & were told there was a $50 + tax a night cleaning fee for her.  We got there after 3pm & checked in, went to WaBa & got take out.  Came back, ate our food & went to bed. Our little dog slept in her canvas crate & was not out in the room.  The next morning my husband had his first appointment at 7am so we left at about 6:30am & I told the front desk we didn't need housekeeping.  Our dog was left in her crate the whole time we were";3
I wish the rooms were nicer.  My shower barely worked, leather was repaired with DUCT TAPE, paint is scratched and peeling in the bath.  Overall, rather sad.  BUT the hotel staff is EXCELLENT in every way, from Pasquale at the front desk to the wait staff. If only they'd redo the rooms.;3
Was on the 10th floor, room was clean, service was not to good at reception as they are very slow at checking in and out, having to pay for wifi was a joke as signal would always drop out. plus side it is close to universal city walk and studios and universal city is units own little world away from crazy LA, as a city would not recommend to anyone even after 3 visits.;3
Not what I expected and not worth the money.  The hotel needs a refresh.  Some staff very helpful while others rude or abrupt.  Didn't sleep through the night for a week.  Noisy neighbours and staff slamming doors in hallway all day long, especially early in the morning.  Charge for coffee in room!  Tacky!;3
Arrived at the hotel around 7 pm on the 20th of november, staff very pleasant and check in was quick and hassle free. Room was clean and tidy a little small but we didn't mind as it was only a base for our trip. Of our 4 days staying here we had no complaints.We checked out on thursday which was thanksgiving, as everywhere was so busy that day we were rushing gathering up our things, and i left 3 very sentimental brackets behind of no value to anyone else. A half hour after leaving the hotel i sent an email and phoned the hotel and explained exactly where they were as i knew where i had left them. two days later i received an email saying they were not there. To say i was very disappointed is an understatement and it will definitely put me off or recommending this hotel to;3
My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of November to the beginning of December and can't fault it for the price.  The accomodation was relatively cheap so we weren't expecting 5 star (rated 3 star by the travel agent and it lived up to this rating) however when we arrived we were kindly greeted by the doorman who helped us with our luggage and a very pleasant receptionist who checked us in.    We had a view of Central Park which we requested and the room we were given was quite small but adequate.  The room next to us was larger which would have accommodated our luggage better but the room was clean which is the most important thing.  We had fresh towels every day, as expected and the room was well tended despite our untidiness. The shower had great pressure;3
Nice hotel. Staff very polite. Opening doors for you asking if you need help with anything. Room was very noisey heating/aircon units sounded like a plane taking off. try and get a room as high up as possible to reduce noise level;3
I was in town for a week for my 20th college reunion and gave this hotel a second chance as the last time I had stayed I also had a bad experience. The location to the 96th Street subway is excellent and there is a pharmacy and McDonalds nearby. The wifi is horrible.  There is password protection for the one in the lobby, but not in the rooms. Probably why it is so slow - everyone in the adjacent buildings must be using the room wifi as well. I had to use my personal hotspot to use my tablet and now my data is all used up for the entire month and It's only 7 days into October. Every other Days Inn I have stayed at offers some kind of continental breakfast. There was nothing at this one.  Housekeeping never bothered to check to see that I brewed hot water in my coffee pot and;3
"Nice place. Showers didnt heat up during hours 9am-5pm. Kinda dodgy neighbourhood. Maids very intrusive but very nice. Would have preferred a ""no maid today"" sign to stick on my door as was only myself and had four towels. Only really needed the maids every couple of days. Internet was good but around 10pm, wireless only worked on half of the room. Additionally, phone ""pizza delivery"" button sent me to a very strange number.";3
Overall the hotel was convenient to everything and was walkable to Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Empire State State Building, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. I was disappointed in the $35 facility fee per day when in my opinion there were no amenities except the gym. Also you had to ask for a coffee maker and coffee and that should really be standard. Overall staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms were small but clean. I felt they did a good job regarding safety of their guests. The tick tock diner was great for breakfast and dinner as we ate there late one evening after a play.;3
My friend and I travelled to the Los Angeles area on April 4-8th.  She had tickets to the Ellen DeGeneres which was the main reason for our trip.  We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel - The Hotel of Hollywood, which was booked through Expedia at a really good rate (128.03 taxes in per night).  We neglected to rent a car since the hotel was located near the Santa Monica & Vermont station - a two minute walk - if that.  $5 will get you an all day pass, $1.50 to ride the bus, per stop.  We checked in on April 4th around 4:30-5ish.  The staff at the front desk were nice.  We were given the keys to our room and at first glance, I was a little disappointment (can't speak for my friend) at the room.  It was definitely dated (wall paper, old fashion curtions etc).  When viewing the;3
Nice greeting on arrival - Room dated and needs some attention as there was a lot of wear and tear on bathroom door and bedroom furniture - overall staff were very friendly and helpful - ideal spot for being at the Lincoln centre and top half of town with central park only a block away which was great for early morning walks.;3
The place has undergone renovation.  One elevator still doesn't function.  The others are very slow. The front desk staff was friendly.  WiFi is free but slower than dial up service.  If you need to be on the upper west side, it may suffice.  It's difficult to hail a cab in the area,.  There is a subway station 1 block away. Look for another place if you can.;3
The location to Universal was great...you're able to walk there if the weather permits, but there's also a shuttle every 10-15 minutes in the morning, and 15-20 minutes in the evening that will take you to Citywalk. The staff was friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions.  We stayed on the 4th floor, which was not that high up, and on our side, the view was of trees, part of the freeway and a carlot. (We weren't there for the view, but maybe something a little more exciting!) The ice machine was diagonal from our room, and would've been perfect if it actually worked. So, we decided to try the next floor up (since the lobby was on the 3rd floor [yes I know, weird!]). As soon as the elevator doors opened, it looked like there had been a wrestling match on the;3
Good value this close to downtown. Room was adequate. Travelled uptown by metro every night no problem. No facilities so eat out and bring your drinks in. Some good places to eat close by in China town or Little  Italy.;3
"ABOUT US: My gf and me (both of us are from Singapore). I'm 35, she's 29. We are budgeted travellers who just need a clean and quiet place to sleep.   After the mixed reviews, we decided to go with the inn based on the budget and location to the subway. We stayed in morningside inn on oct 9th to the 12th.   Arrving with an open mind and preparing for the worse, the ""notorious"" front office was noticibly plain but clean. The young girl working there was nonchalant, but quick to check me in. I paid cash to prevent any future discrepancies. (Although, be mindful that the young girl do not have access to the cashier after office hours, so pls bring exact change! )  So far so good. Now the room... I booked a double room with shared showers. The room is really plain but clean. A bed";3
* Breakfast could have a bit more better. More cheese pls. Breads were not good.  They have all the facility to do so, I beleive thath they need someone from the food industry to just look into the quality.  * the elevator also needs to change. Its like from 18th century. very slow.  * the neighbourhood is very shady - dont feel safe if one wants to take a walk.  * loved the Live coounter for breakfast.;3
Before u go up to room and u booked from a second party website make sure u ask which bed you will receive I had bad luck and even tho I booked a room with queen bed I received a room wit 2 full size beds;3
Many problems that should not exist in a hotel in this price category:  1. Internet access was among the slowest of any hotel I've stayed at. Really, really bad. So, bad I gave up.  2. Could hear my neighbors speaking even in hushed voices next door. This could be because there was a half-inch gap under the door between our rooms. Seriously, in a business-class hotel room?  3. The thermostat had absolutely no effect on the temperature, so the room was a freezer the whole time I was there. It just kept cranking out cold air even when I set the temperature super high.  4. Unlike most business-class hotels, this hotel does not assign rooms for high-level Elite guests (like me). Your status means nothing in getting you a decent room. It's just first come, first served. So, despite;3
"This hotel is completely legendary. Wonderful historical exhibit in the lower level showing posters for big bands, GIs during WWII, info on the mechanical and electrical systems. Lobby is fantastic. Great location. Very nice diner just off the lobby is great for bkfst. Bed and bedding are very comfortable. Security is excellent: you must show your room key in order to enter an elevator, Soundproofing f/ outside noise (sirens, honking horns, etc.) is very good. Wonderful, big bathtub. Room was small but I don't care. The place is very clean. However they nickel and dime you to death. $25 to to check in before 4pm. even if your rm is ready. $5 to hold onto your luggage before check-in. Most outrageous: $40 for ""facilities fee"" covers business center and fitness room whether you";3
Stayed there for 6 nights. Asked for a high floor, king size bed and got a very good price for it (NYC standards).  No one mentioned the rooftop bar above the top floor rooms so got to hear too much noise at nights... the 3 out of 4 elevators not working didn't help either. wifi is free of charge only at the lobby. in the room it costs way too much and the hotel should have made it complimentary if only for the elevators inconvenience that week. Had to update my room's key card 4 times (!) in 6 days.  late check out (2pm max) was possible by request only the day of checking out.;3
The bed was comfortable, the water was hot (though hard to adjust sometimes), there were no bugs, the towels and sheets were changed when we didn't leave up the privacy sign.  It's an old building, but didn't smell musty. There was peeling paint in the halls.  The WiFi was barely adequate.  There was no street noise, and when I called to have another room quieted down, it happened quickly.  There should have been a towel rack for a hand towel in the bathroom (We hung it on the doorknob.)  It wasn't possible to close the blinds tight.  The bottom sheet was neither fitted, nor sufficiently large.  No laundry facilities available to guests.  The room's info notebook hadn't been updated recently: USA Today not available,  restaurant listings not up-to-date.  The room was just big;3

Got a renovated room, however, room was small and had no desk and chair which was important since I was travelling for business.  They failed to clean my room after my first night however they cleaned up after I mentioned it.  They cleaned every day after that for the remainder of my stay.  Friendly and helpful staff.;3
This was our second time staying at this hotel, and worse than the first experience. We stayed there in early November, and although it was in the 60s outside in the evening, the heating/cooling system was on heat only, and so we could get no cool air. The room was tiny (a queen bed room) and stuffy. The only way to get fresh air was to leave the patio door open, but since our room was on the ground floor, that was a problem. I can't sleep if it's over 60F in the room. The location is very convenient to the 101 freeway, Hollywood, Studio City, Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards. Getting anywhere in the LA metro area is relatively easy (for LA). They do charge extra for parking, but the rate is reasonable for LA, and the parking lot is very secure and well-lit. There is a;3
"The first room we were put in was not in acceptable condition, but we were moved upon request. If the room advertises a ""pull out couch"", do not count on it being  in useable condition.otherwisethis hotel is fine and is in a great location.";3
Just wanted to write some good reviews re: this hotel! My sister in law and I stayed here for four days in june. Its really a great hotel for the money we got. There is the metro right there, and teh bus is at the door step which is very great. Also almost all the buses go to Vermont street, which is the street the hotel is on. So it was very convienient!  Our room was very clean, bed was very comfy, we had a microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker,. THe pool was good, nice and relaxing. and the breakfast was the same every day, but we still enjoyed it! THere was cerele, fresh waffles, eggs, sausage, croisants, bagles, toast, jams, cream cheese, fruit...so for FREE it was worth it!  I wouldnt walk around the area at night, but than again i wouldn't walk any where in LA at night;3
Great location.  Great restaurant but rather indifferent service. The room was unbearably hot and  my daughter became ill and it took some time to elicit help and a solution.  Also the concierge was rather unhelpful.;3
Arriving after 36 hrs flying to find out our booking was for one night (previous night only) instead of the 5 it was supposed to be we were so tired and just wanted a shower but instead we had to sit on a couch in the freezing cold lobby for 20+ minutes as the front door was open and a very cold breeze came in. Lady who served us was quite nice, she eventually (after me going over to the desk to find out what was going on!!) offered us a 'much bigger room' and free breakfast for our troubles. Breakfast was lovely and definitely brightened our spirits, the room had a huge bed but in the case of a much bigger room, I would hate to have seen the shoebox we were originally booked into! Housekeeping attended our room on more than one occasion, one morning even while we were still in;3
Hotel location was great for access to Lincoln Center. The bathroom situation caused considerable distress, particularly the failure to correct a major defect with the shower until the the very last day, despite numerous notices. Overall the service was very good and we only wish that our experience had been betteer.;3
Checked in easily and early. When we got to the room it was warm so I turned up the ac but the fan speed never changed. After a day out we returned and the room was just as warm as before. Maintenance tried to fix it by said it was bc of the sun heating the room, gave us a fan. For over $250 a night that is not a solution. Went to dinner came back two hours later room was just as hot and the air felt humid. Called the desk and was told there were no rooms to move to. Went down to the desk and amazingly had a room for us and free breakfast. No rate adjustment could Be made since we booked through universal studios site. Convenient location but mechanicals need some fixing.;3
I thought if Charlie Watts stayed here the hotel would be really cool but it was a bit disappointing.  Maybe you have to be in the penthouse suite but our room was very small with absolutely no outlook.  We were meant to have Frette linen but it was nothing like Frette I have had in other hotels. The bed was comfortable and free wifi in the lobby was good.  Loved the Terrace rooftop bar but didn't like how they took an extra $500 off my credit card to cover what they thought our expenditure would be over 3 days without telling us. Also out of 4 lifts I think only two were ever working and there was always a queue.  Great restaurants nearby, loved brunch at the Chowder House and bar boulud for dinner.;3
"That was my second time at the Empire in NY, and I can say the value for this stay was not the best... paid 299 per night, what was not exactly a great deal. Service was poor since the reservation, when I sent the hotel an email asking if I could have a package delivered to me prior to check in. Answer was a very short yes, but I ended finding there is a cost if you wanna get anything delivered to you. For me, paying 299 a night, that's not a top quality service to charge for getting a document from mail for one of your guests. Room was not ready when I first got to the hotel (which was ok, since it was morning and check in is at 3pm) but absolutely no effort was made to let me know when the room was ready (""just keep coming back to check""  is again not the best service one can";3
The location of the New Yorker was fantastic, very close to Penn Station & Times Square etc. The check in was very quick & the staff were very friendly & welcoming. Rooms were very nicely furnished & big enough for the two of us, we also had a great view of the New York skyline. We did think it was a bit overpriced however & there are much cheaper places to stay.;3
Don't get me wrong--3 stars doesn't mean the hotel was bad. It was decidedly average for its class. I save 4 and 5 stars for more outstanding experiences.  First and foremost--The hotel was clean and room-cleaning service was efficient. With that said...here are some issues I encountered...  Fitness Center--Cramped and many of the treadmills and bikes needed repairs.  Room lighting--Never could figure out how to turn on bedside lamps.  Lack of Housecleaning Options--Many hotels now ask if you'd like sheets changed. If you do, you leave a pre-printed sign on the bed. Same with towels--any towels you want changed you just leave on the bathroom floor. I really appreciate this, as it is somewhat friendlier for the environment.  Main Restaurant Dinner Menu--The dinner menu in the;3
"The hotel is conveniently located and the rooms are adequate for overnight stays. Chose a suite if you will be there for an extended period. The only issue I had was with the ""mandatory"" Facility Fee of $25 plus tax for each night which supposedly covers internet access and international calls, if you use them or not. I was able to have these charges removed, but that appears to be the exception. I feel that if it is a fixed add-on, it should be included in the advertised room rate, and not as a sneak-on adder.";3
Pros: - decent location. - adjoining diner is good and staff in there are great.  - friendly doorman who sorted a taxi for us.   Cons/disappointments:  - booked two rooms at the same time 9 months in advance and requested rooms with views. Neither room had any view to speak of. - one room was vastly different to the other in terms of size and decor despite being booked at the same time and it being the same type of room.   - put a note on the booking and contacted the hotel additionally about it being my dadâs 60th birthday during our stay as most hotels do something nice. Nothing done at all. Very disappointing.  - maid service done daily but the bath was dusty every evening. Obviously not cleaned properly.  - no tea or coffee making facility in the room.

Stayed here for four nights on my first trip to Los Angeles. Overall, hotel is not bad, although it needs updating and new decor. Our room was on the small side, but good enough for two. Bathroom needs some work. Our room was on the main floor right next to reception so it's noisy all night. Beds are okay, pillows not so much. Location is good. There are food places within walking distance. Metro stop is close by, maybe a block away. There is noise almost all night since there are a few hospitals nearby. Neighborhood is safe...no real issues there. Not a bad stay.;3
But they really need to update all of the rooms. My last visit with them wasn't too bad. Now they have microwaves which is awesome. My knob on the shower was hanging off the hinges.;3
Very well located and I quite liked the old skool Art Deco feel off this hotel. And whilst I hear what people say about it being a tad tired (it is) for me that wasnât a distractor. Large room with super comfy beds. Teeny tiny bathroom, which I think would be a tad painful If a large person or you were trying to navigate kids in and out of the shower, etc. but it was very clean, with lots of towels.  Very long queues for lifts but hey ho not a biggie BUT they charge $5 (Per Piece) to store luggage, which is an outrage. Not once in all my years of travel (work and social) across the spectrum of hotels Iâve stayed in have I had to pay to store luggage before/after checkout. On principle, I would never stay at this hotel again. Nor would the three others in my group.;3
Great location, near Lincoln centre but room was not very big for a family even though being described as deluxe.  Not super clean, but adequate as long as we didn't spend too much time there - pool should be disregarded as is the size of a small fountain and can only fit two people really at most - maybe a third splashing and we felt a bit misled.  People were mostly very helpful, and we will have to weigh up if we go to NY whether we would really stay again but good for a short trip.;3
Waited for almost 30 minutes to be attended to . Receptionist, very rude to the guest in front of me and very loud. Stayed for 2 days, but no prior message to alert me that there were no room service because of the weather and not enough house keeping staff to clean the room.;3
We stayed at the Empire for five nights as the second leg of our honeymoon......as were on honeymoon a bottle of Prosecco  appeared in our room with two glasses which was a lovely touch! The hotel was centrally located between two subway stations, near to Central Parc and the Lincoln Centre. There were plenty of restaurants within a stones throw away.   Our room was small and dark with no view and very little storage space  & virtually no wardrobe space. The noise from the air conditioning unit was quite loud, fortunately we did get used to it so it didn't effect our sleep. The bed was large and comfortable. The room average, a bit shabby in places, and the repairs that had been made had been done to a poor standard. As other reviewers have pointed out there is no complimentary;3
As expected in that it is fine and would suit a lot of people looking for a bargain and somewhere to be in for a few hours overnight, but I wouldn't do again.   Pros: The location is amazing tube very accessible nearby and lots of restaurants and shops. There was a locker room available to drop our bags off first. The value of the room. The facilities are just fine, and you get what you pay for. Fridge available in the room.  Cons: The walls are so thin to the hallway you hear absolutely everything it is just so loud which is why i wouldn't stay again. On the floor we stayed on the toilets wasn't male/female it was mixed which i didn't like. there were showers available for women/men only. I didn't look in or use the kitchen. There is a TV/lounge type room as well which i didn't;3
Stayed at the New Yorker for 4 nights.  Location was the key to this Hotel.  We were able to connect with the hop on hop off bus and walk to many of the main attractions.  The New Yorker was a Hotel to lay your head.  The room was very small and the bathroom was dated with very little moving room.  If it is a little bit of luxury you want you won't find it at the New Yorker but if you want s basic hotel in a central location the New Yorker is for you,;3
The Jane was booked at the last minute as I arrived during NYC fashion week and my preferred hotels were booked. The Jane did not disappoint, my room was very small ( I believe the building is an old sailors quarters on the Hudson River since converted in a hotel). Loved Cafe Gitane on the ground floor - fantastic coffee which is somewhat of a rarity in America. Super cool art deco themed foyer and pleasant, helpful staff. Would book again albeit a larger room.;3
OK except for fire alarm for 30 minutes in middle of night and elevator and electrical shutdown for many hours. No room maintenance next day. No mention by hotel by email or staff by person apologizing for experience, not any move to make adjustments for it.;3
Sort of like the airlines....they ding you for everything. Bottled water $8 says it all. Small room but adequate unless you want to swing a cat. Breakfast buffet came to about $30/person. No free wifi.;3
I stayed here on a recent visit to NYC. Although the hotel was not very modern and facilities were basic it was fine for my trip. The bed was comfortable, the shower was the perfect temperature and the heating worked well. We were unable to connect to the wifi for the first two days of our stay but after informing the front desk this issue was fixed. Front desk staff were very kind and helpful. Lifts need updating though! Would stay again.;3
I haven't been to this hotel in a long time.  This is mainly a hotel for people visiting Universal Studios.   They have upgraded their rooms and hallways but the elevators... you may have to wait for a while.  The only thing that surprised me is how long they have had this issue..like for years.  The last time I stayed here in 2011 they had only one elevator functioning, and at least this time they had 3 of the 5 working.  I don't know how long it takes to replace an elevator, but you may have to wait a bit in the morning to catch one.  The parking garage seemed to have enough spaces and access was easy.  The staff is very accommodating and help answer any and all questions I had.  There is a coffee bar with quick breakfast stuff to go if you are in a rush as well and don't have;3
Great location- very safe! Rooms are small and air conditioned barely worked.  Had to call for a fan to circulate air.  The elevators are extremely slow and 2 were not working.    Apparently the hotel provides miles per stay but was never mentioned at check-in or check-out.....very poor customer service.;3
decent hotel at a decent price. close enough to the sights.;3
its very close to Times Sq and Central park, which makes it attractive. Also Broadway is right round the corner. The rooms are a bit cramped, espl the ones with 2 Queen beds. no free Wi-Fi in the rooms. there is a bar in the lobby, but the food options outside are better. deals on room rates are available;3
*Centrally located and  a good base when visiting NYC * Staff were friendly and efficient *Security staff in the lobby which is good given the issues evident in NYC since cannabis was legalised.  *Room was sufficient. Badly needs an update. Stains on carpets and headboard.  Bathroom door chipped quite badly ,paint work needs freshening up in room and throughout the hotel.  *Compared to European standards this is not a 4*star hotel. At best it's  3*.  *I would recommend this hotel as its centrally located and sufficient if youre not in your room all day. If you want a little luxury look elsewhere.;3
I was informed that this property had undergone a renovation...I would like to know when that happened.  Room was very small.  Almost too small for two people.  I wouldn't recommend it if you're there to see the sites, because it's a taxi ride or subway ride to anything.  The bathroom was clean, however tiny, tiny.  No way two people could be in there at one time and there was only a small shelf for toiletries.  The layers and layers of paint around the window near the tub kept flaking off...it was really kind of disgusting.  Bellmen were kind, but that's about it for staff.;3
Good location, just across the street from North-West corner of Central Park. There are 2 metro stations (B,C line) and the hotel is just between  - 5  minutes walking.  The hotel is quite old and the rooms are small. Not dirty but everything in the room is worn out.  If you get a street view room it will be very much noise. Ask for an upper level room and no street side. You will have the view of the next building, but not so much noise. The worst thing is that the windows have the AC system included and because of that there is always noise getting into room, just like the window is not closed.  It's better to use the stairs for going down, because the lift is the slowest one possible :);3
Pretty much standard Park hotel . Big good size rooms and bathrooms . Great view from the 11th floor . Hotel bar / restaurant reasonably priced for a hotel I assume that is to compete with the universal city walk which is five minutes wall ( brisk ) . There is a. Shuttle service but since the walk is as I said 5 minutes ( though uphill via a bridge ) we never used it . One can take the shuttle down or walk downhill to Burbank and the metro where there is also a fat-burger an Carl's junior and a subway . You can take the metro one stop to Hollywood. Worth doing . Downside place is dull and feels pretty isolated ( not they're fault ) . Also the smell of cleaning fluid everyday after our room was cleaned .;3
We got this property for $120/night plus Priceline fees. If you want an Upper W Side Property, the location is excellent.  At checkin they suggested a room on the top floor, Based on previous Tripadvisor reviews about the heat up there, we declined and got a 5th floor inside room. Checkin with Emanuel was quick, smooth, and efficient.  As it was an inside room, there was NO view, and very little light from outside. Too, there was NO noise from outside, which was nice.  There was very loud noise coming from the pipes at odd intervals.  It sounded a bit like someone was trying to break into our room through the floor with a cold chisel. This occurred every hour or two for a little while.  Also, the bathroom plumbing would make noises at times. The bathroom was TINY, even by NYC;3
Was very nervous about staying here, the beds were comfortable along with pillows, room was sort of cleaned each day, some things replaced each day, some not, but a phone call to front desk, the issue was soon resolved, my main concern was the NOISY air con, it was so loud. Good location, subway so very easy to use, especially with the iPhone app, would I use again probably not, but defiantly the area;3
"I have relatively low expectations for a hotel:  a clean room; a reasonably comfortable bed; and a  place to get clean.  A helpful, courteous staff is a plus.   The Empire staff was a plus.  They were unfailingly courteous and very willing to help; however, the room did not quite meet my low expectations.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable, but the bathroom was an interesting experience.  The number of clean towels varied daily.  The number of wash cloths varied from none to four.  Hot water was sometimes available. Toiletries were replaced at random. The hotel is in a great location but needs to improve a bit to make it worth the money. This was our first stay at the Empire and will be our last.  There are other hotels in the area that do a better job.";3
"Can't reach the shower head that is 7 feet above the tub; tub had no shower curtain or sliding door; water got the floor wet. wi-fi didn't work i the room - there was an additional charge for that. The employees were excellent - they shoul dget jobs at hotels that would appreciate them more.";3
As a first holiday together as a couple, we thought why not New York in the summer! Hotel itself was booked through a BA package so got a reasonable deal.  We found hotel room to be small but to honest we were only sleeping there so not too worried. Housekeeping kept our room very clean but like other reviews could do with some up dating. Concierge was helpful and had maps etc, however needed to print baseball tickets which cost $5! Pool was not really a pool so be warned photos on websites are deceptive, didn't spend anytime up on roof terrace. Entrance always seemed to be busy with people going up to private functions. Stayed in a few hotels in New York and The Empire served its purpose for a bed to sleep in but we didn't spend any extra money in hotel itself apart from using;3
I'm not one to write reviews, I simply never go back to a place when I'm not happy!  BUT this needs to be said: We arrived to the hotel late afternoon to a indifferent and cool reception from Hotel staff.  No details of the services/facilities offered and no luggage help or direction to our room was provided.   Our non-smoking room smelled completely like smoke had been embedded into the upholstery for years.   A generous size room by NYC standard but very poor lighting installed and with no natural light at all.   The shower screen was missing making having a shower impossible to do without water completely flooding the bathroom EVERY TIME.  Be careful, the cleaners steam clean the bed sheets with bleach!  We found this out not long after our room was cleaned, as we happen to;3
Not really a critique of the hotel, which I suppose is not fair.  The hotel itself was fine.  $99 per night on  a weekend in NYC, great.  Rooms are tiny...I have NO idea how they made them look the size they did in the pics.  They are small...but clean.  And the communal bathrooms are fine.  And contrary to other reviews, the staff was OK. Friendly, semi-helpful...OK.   However, 2 points:  #1.  The guests are the most ridiculous people I have ever been around.  How did you folks manage to find each other and book the same hotel?  I mean, geeze, I've never seen so many people trying so hard to be different, yet ending up looking and acting EXACTLY the same.   #2.  We went into the hotel bar during the early hours...nothing special.  $9 canned beer and old furniture.  Just for;3
before I checked into this hotel I read something about hotels not changing their sheets as they claim to do.  So as soon as I checked in, I asked for my sheets to be changed. The head service person ensured me that all sheets are changed and rooms cleaned for check-in.  OK - I didnt want to be a pain or paranoid, so I let it go.  Then, looking for something I dropped on the floor, I find a black lacy pair of underwear tucked between the chair and wall......ugh! it was used!  I called the housekeeping back and told them, and when they came to the room they asked if it was mine.  NO of course not!  Did they inspect the room?  i liked the front desk people, but really......;3
Hotel has clearly been around quite a while.  But clean, neat and orderly.  Very helpful staff.  Excellent location on the Upper West Side.  Good value.;3
"Stayed here for a week on business, stayed in the New Yorker View Suite Queen on the 26th Floor.  Room was a decent size for NYC. The ""living room"" area was pretty spacious with a fold-out couch for additional sleeping space and the layout was open enough you could probably get an extra roll-away or queen size air mattress on the floor for even more sleeping space if staying with a whole family.  Pics on their website for this suite are accurate and look exactly like the room I stayed in so bonus points for accuracy there.  Hotel has a diner co-located on the ground floor that was honestly probably one of my favorite places to eat during the entire trip. The chicken tenders & waffles with a side of bacon hit the spot multiple times. Nothing blow your mind amazing about the";3
Overall, average service, but the hotel is well-maintained and clean. The concierge was unapologetic about the delay in checking in. Instead, she just gave breakfast vouchers without an apology. It was also disappointing the pool deck wasn't open during the week.;3
The Empire was an excellent location for us.  Right near the subway and great for long walks in Central Park, going to the museums, Lincoln Center, shows!  The price was okay and the room was small, like a European Hotel.  Room was clean and comfortable.   They 'nickel and dime you to death.  Room coffee and water they charge you for as well and Internet (we just used our cell service).  If we were going to that area of the city again, I'd look at other hotels.;3
We picked this hotel for its location near central park and is well placed fo the bus and subway,  it is a good half hour walk away from madness of times square. The lobby area is nice but the rooms could do with a bit of an update. The maintenance standard are not great as the bathroom door in my parents roon still had decorators tap on it and the plug sockets were loose. They charge for everything from the internet/WIFI to the coffee inthe rooms. Although the WIFI is free in the lobby. $8 for a bottle of water and $3 for a coffee in the room, th ebar is not cheap either $14 for a glass of white wine. If you stay here I would say pop to the shop round the corner and get your water and coffee there. Loads of places to eat near by, The flame restaurant is a 5 min walk away and;3
I needed a place to stay for one night after a transcontinental flight. As I stepped out of the terminal, there was the shuttle bus. The hotel is just a few minutes away from the airport, very conveniently located. Check-in was smooth, the room was nice and quiet and the windows are exceptionally soundproof. The fitness centre is on the top floor with fabulous views.  But... I am allergic to feather pillows so I want foam ones. Most hotels have at least one foam pillow among the four pillows on the bed. Not here. Most Hyatt hotels have a spare foam pillow in the closet. Not here. I wanted to call housekeeping but the phone did not work. So in my jetlagged state I had to go down to the front desk and was promised that they will take care of it. In most hotels that takes 10-20;3
Well, I have read the reviews, so i didn't  expect more. Negative: Location was not  ideal for me. Of course by train one can go everywhere, but I prefer walking. Positive: The room was bigger than many, more expensive  hotels and very very warm to an extend that I would prefer it a bit cooler! It could have been cleaner though.  Positive: Bathroom was clean, with very hot water throughout  the day, seemed recently renovated. Staff was ok, the two bellmen were very polite. In general I would suggest before choosing  this hotel to consider  location, as you may end up paying the difference  in transportation.;3
The good: Location, Lobby, Front Desk attention.  The Bad: rooms too small, Internet expensive and slow,  poor elevators service, poor channel selection on TV.  10th floor is noisy when there is a party on the floor above. Pool is very small.;3
"We're a couple who looked up prices for hotels on priceline.com. We had previously booked through them but decided to call Days Inn directly and ask them if they could give us a better deal. We ended up saving 60$ for 2 nights and we booked the night before; so much for the Priceline myth pertaining to having the best prices.  We were delightfully surprised by the free parking in the vicinity surrounding the hotel and the proximity to the subway (a 2 min. walk) and the ride a mere 10 minutes to Midtown. In fact we didn't even have to circle the block to find parking, we found a free spot a block away. Just be aware of the alternate side parking due to street sweeping. Some Manhattan garages charge 40 dollars a day so we saved over a 100 dollars just with that!   The people at";3
This was our first visit to New York and we chose this hotel because of the location. We were not disappointed. Only ten minutes walk to Times Square and close to all the sites either walking or nearby subway. The checking in was quick an efficient and the staff polite. Our room was 1019 which had no view. There was a bit of noise from the elevator but no street noise. The room was cleaned every day and the towels and toiletries replaced daily.  As someone who travels extensively around Europe I am used to tea and coffee making facilities in the room which were sadly lacking. Coffee was available for free in a morning from the lobby at Breakfast time. I thought the hotel was over priced a little compared to hotels I have stayed in the past but that may be down to the fact it is;3
I stayed here to attend a conference in the city and the rate was pretty low which is why I chose it. It was an adequate room, pretty small though. My interactions with their staff were pleasant and they were quick to bring more coffee and water to the room when requested. I don't think I would stay there again even though I really had no complaints.;3
Stayed 12 nights and spent a few days in an upgraded room with a view of chrysler, empire state and madison square.  PROS Delightful service from check-in and security staff. Fairly easy to get a free room upgrade.  A lot of ppl complain abt the resort fees but I think itâs convenient- I had made an online purchase for tickets that didnât get through so I didnât hesitate to make an international phone call to my credit card company. I also had to make an Amazon return, so I was able to print out the return bar code from the Business center. It eased me of the small anxieties I get when travelling.  Convenient location- can walk to most broadway shows, Chelsea market/high line, super close to Madison Square Garden which is great if you donât want to wait too long in line at a;3
We arrived at 1 o clock to be told it would cost to check in early but that she would do it for free ( didnât really understand this as the room was ready).  All I can say about this hotel is that itâs very average. Good location, however our room was absolutely tiny, run down bathroom, and air con that didnât work very well.  On check out we had to pay to keep our bags in the hotel whilst we went out for the day- hadnt we paid enough? If I returned to New York would probably pay more to stay somewhere else.  No other issues apart from these;3
Jennifer, Daisy, Nelly, Joe, Patrick, Tonya................have been unable to recover nearly a $1000 credit charge for a reservation in October, which was cancelled in September well within your policy.   I have talked with so many people and you have confirmed my cancellation.  However, you have a CCI group who represents you somehow who is NOT honoring your policy and therefore because they rep you, your reputation is on the line with this.   Please assist me with this $1000 refund.   I would hate to see this happen to your other customers.   Elizabeth;3
Although I loved the historic hotel and its has been renovated very nicely the service is below par.  The good:   Location is central and less than two blocks from Penn Station which is great if you arrive by Amtrak.   It is a historic hotel that has been very nicely renovated. Rooms are very small but nicely done Price was very reasonable for Manhattan  The Opportunities for Improvement:  I arrived at 9:30PM and was told my room wasn't ready!  Never had that happen at any hotel I've stayed in before after 4pm and this was 9:30!!!  The front desk clerk suggested I check my bags and get something to eat and my room SHOULD be ready by then.  When I asked how long should I expect for the room to be ready she said 90 MINUTES!  Meaning I wouldn't be able to got to my room until;3
Room was small but with a cupboard so able to store bags. No tv in room. Bed and bedding clean with comfortable bed. Bathroom old and a little run down. The rooms had thin walls and you could hear everything from other rooms.;3
First the good things : top located near Nolita and Soho. Many good restaurants around the corner. Good beds. Clean and spacious bathroom. We had a room with view on the 5th floor on the corner with windows on 2 sides. But the rooms need updating. All curtains are torn. Lots of stains in the carpet. Old furniture. The painting hung askew. Of course you are not in New York to stay in your hotel room.... We got a good deal and we would stay here again if they have the same offer next time.;3
I arrived at the hotel on a Tuesday at 11am and there was no que to check in, was asked for my credit card in case of any damage deposit and was told that I wouldnt be charged anything extra as the hotel was paid for.  I was booked in for 7 nights and luckily had a room on the 36th floor with a great view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden! The room itself had 2 double beds, a tiny wardrobe and a bathroom. Slightly dated but that is the draw of an art-deco hotel so no real complaints there.  I used the gymnasium on 2 occasions and although it was quite basic in there, it was better than i expected and not very busy.  The staff in the hotel are very helpful and there is security you show your room key to before going in the lift, i befriended one of the ladies;3
We stayed only because of the location, which is very close to the park.  We took advantage of the free shuttle, and waited 10 minutes once, 1 minute on return. The room was fine and beds comfortable.  The large buffet was somewhat pricey @ $20 per person but most of the food was  decent quality, with the fresh squeezed oj and omelette bar as highlights. The common area decor is a tacky mish-mash of 80s, Asian, and gothic renaissance, dappled with bronze sculptures.  I would definitely stay somewhere nicer if we weren't just in town for the park. With the $24 parking and $150 basic AAA rate, it's  not a great value.;3
"I got this hotel for an absolute steal at $75 per night, so on that basis alone I would rank it positively. We only use our hotel to sleep and shower and don't need luxury or a lot of amenities - just somewhere clean and safe. This place definitely fit the bill.  First - the good. The staff is extremely friendly and checking in and out was a breeze. There was always a doorman on duty and by the second day they were greeting us by name and making friendly chit-chat. They also were helpful in recommending the best places to eat in the area. The room itself was nothing special but it was fine; on the smallish side but pretty normal by NY standards. The sheets and towels were extremely clean and we had a private bathroom, which was marble. It looks just like the pictures I saw on";3
The room was ok, about the same size as other New York hotels I have been in. The doorman/bellhop service was terrible! Not that I find opening the door and being greeted a huge deal, but when Iâm paying for it, not leaning against the door and blowing smoke in my face is appreciated. The bed was excellent and location would have been better if the station near the hotel hadnât been under repair( not the fault of hotel in the slightest). Overall good experience if you are more interested in being in the city than the hotel.;3
Pros: There were two gentlemen working the front desk who were very friendly and professional. I had to switch rooms after my first night (more on that later). They had me leave my luggage with them behind the front desk when I left to go sightseeing in the morning. When I returned in the evening, I was able to pick up my luggage and my new room was ready. Another time they were very helpful and let me use their front desk computer and printer to print my Mets tickets from Stub Hub.   Hotel is in a great location if you are using the subway. It is a 60 second walk to the 123 subway station, and only a 5-10 minute walk to another train line that lets you off right by Central Park. You are only a 15-30 minute train ride from all the major tourist attractions in Manhattan.  The;3
No complaints about the hotel as it was clean,the double room was not massive but enough space to move around in.The location was excellent for moving around the city and near rail and coach stations.Not far from Time Square and any type of shop you want to visit.The Tick Tock cafÃ© within the hotel serves good food and there is an excellent cafÃ© one avenue down on 7th avenue called Andrews cafÃ©/diner which is superb.They rate there food establishments A B C D etc so watch out for an A in the window as by law they have to show the rating in the window.;3
"We stayed here for a couple of nights in the city before embarking on a cruise. We checked in around noon and were promised a call when our room was ready. After dropping our bags with bell services, we hit the city for some lunch and light sightseeing until our room was ready. As we had been traveling since 4:00AM, we were pretty tired and were ready for a little rest.  We returned to the hotel at 3:00PM (""official"" check-in time) having not heard anything about our room being ready yet. Sure enough, it was not. The guest services representative said it would likely be another hour, as the previous guest had just checked out. Too tired to do any more sightseeing, we relaxed in the lobby until 4:00PM. The room was still not ready, but the representative said they would find out";3
The hotel needs a more secure parking system so that individuals parking must prove that they are the hotel guests they claim to be and the parking attendants can verify their room numbers.  We have had a fraudulent charge added to our bill, which is clearly due to lack of appropriate security for the hotel parking.;3
We viatited the hotel as our last stop on our honeymoon and was so excited to stay as it was a Hilton (and the most expensive) so we thought it was going to be amazing but once we got to our room we were disappointed. Stains on the floor, not a nice view, bathroom water pressure was crappy and it was a shower/bath, stains on wall paper in bathroom, looking out our window saw the pool wasnât clean and we kept hearing water dropping from above our closet. We were also very excited for the buffet but when we went down there was hardly any food and what was there didnât taste nice. Other than all of that the staff were very helpful and always friendly!;3
The location was fantastic and the exterior of the hotel stunning. Beyond that, it was âjustâ a Premier Inn at significantly higher prices. We stayed two nights and the bedding and towels werenât changed after arrival. The beer was disgusting. The family room was a standard double, single and camp bed. The camp bed was small, creaky and uncomfortable.   All in all, for the price I expected better.;3
We got this hotel through an online offer, so we paid a lot less than the advertised rate. For what we paid, we were happy enough.   Pros: - It's located right next to a subway station (including an express line) so it's really easy to get anywhere in Manhattan.  - Lots of places to eat in the local area. - The bed was huuuge and very comfortable.  Cons: - The girl on reception was incredibly rude - The 'gym' they advertise on their website actually just consists of three machines, surrounded by mirrors to make it look bigger - When the lift was working (rare), we had to wait at least 5 minutes every time for it (we once waited 10 minutes and then gave up and walked down the 8 flights of stairs. When we got to the lobby, there was a sign up saying the lift was out of;3
Fix the plumbing or at least act like you care and you fix the hotel!  I have stayed her several times and never had any issues.  Unfortunately I cannot go back without knowing they have addressed the problem.;3
The hotel is beautiful from the outside, the inside is old and small. This may sound negative but I would stay here for the second time. The location is great and the Central Park is across the hotel.;3
In understanding that this is a tourist destination and location is everything, I have paid for hotel rooms at the same rate that had updated everything, made the stay feel comfortable and felt taken care of and heard. At this location, Art Deco is thrown around to hide the out-dateness of it all - from the dim lighting (even with all lights on), terrible shower head, TV reception out of the 80's, paper thin walls and promises to my simple request that was never fulfilled. To boot, the moment after checking in I was great by a rep for a timeshare. If you need to be in the center of it all for accessibility sake without the need for modernized amenities and comfort go for it. However, I have paid similar prices for a lot better. And considering this is owned by Wyndham, I would;3
the hotel just location (walking distance 10min) free shuttle bus to universal studio, old building need refurbish, the service is poor, we booked hotel package incl. universal ticket,  we had disputed about this with reception staff, after we complained senior staff give us solution, porter not helpful, the day we arrived elevator jamb, only one still operation so all guest in out make crowed on the foyer, during breakfast we must wait 15min, restaurant service is bad (only few waiter) all guest must wait 15-25minute to be served, manager do nothing to improved excellent service;3
We stayed there for three nights in room 971. The rooms was dusty and had a musty smell. They would not provide house keeping. You had to call every day for clean towels and additional toiletries. I thought I had gotten a mosquito bite while I was sleeping but after I arrived home, I realized I had bed bug bites...three raised itchy bumps right in a row on my shoulder!;3
Located not quite in the center of the city. Quite a distance from main activity area. Small rooms and need massive renovation to optimize the room space. Not a helpful staff barring few individuals.  Parking no guarantee, lucky if you get nearby parking. There are shops around to get your laundry etc done. We two friends stayed for three days with claustrophobic feeling.  Commute time and cost is better spent taking a somewhat higher charge rooms near Time Square.;3
Hotel is dated and in need of an upgrade, but it is not bad overall. Doormen are so friendly and helpful. Best place to stay if you are going to the opera, it's virtually across the street from the front doors.;3
My partner and I stayed recently in the Days Inn on Broadway. As a regular visitor to NYC I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room, it was very big for NY standards. The room was clean and tidy, if not a bit dated, and the bathroom was also clean. I was however extremely disappointed in the wifi and the very ancient television. My partner is a Computer Software Engineer so being connected to the Internet is very important for him. I chose this hotel based on the fact that it said free wifi. Unfortunately the wifi was incredibly slow and often did not connect. Usually I would not mind something like this but at the prices we were paying I do feel that it was false advertising on the Days Inn's part. The TV also was fuzzy and would only connect to a few of the channels;3
My stay at The Jane Hotel was for 5 nights. I was near the bathroom and heard the hand dryer throughout the night which was very annoying, but not enough to ask to move. Don't stay here if you're looking for the comforts of home, because you won't find it, this is a very low maintenance place. The rooms are smaller than I thought with enough room to move along side a small twin bed, which also isn't the most comfortable bed. I thought the community bathroom was going to be a pain, but I never once had to wait for a shower or toilet, and there was always quit a bit of traffic. I was surprised at how many people were staying there. My bed was made daily but my towels were never replaced and I had to ask for a fresh set the second day in, to which the staff members were very;3
Hi! I don't usually review hotels, don't use hotels very often and I'm not one of those people that complain about everything. This is a great hotel, people are friendly and it has a bar on the top floor and it is nicely decorated. At the same time, I felt like it didn't offer what a normal hotel would, such as free wifi, free breakfast, a door or shower curtain on the shower, a normal coffee machine (charging $3 for each packet of coffee is a little excessive-especially when you can get Starbucks downstairs), it also took us 10 minutes to get an elevator (one of the elevators don't work and the others take forever, they decorated the elevators with these steel moldings which I'm sure weigh a ton, they don't need those). The pool is also very small. Wifi is $13 for a day! Our;3
We were given a room with a Broadway view but the windows are were so thin it was like sleeping in the street. The second night we asked for a room with a courtyard view and it was even worse. Again, the windows are so thin that we heard the air conditioning noise of all the (outdated) machines installed in the courtyard. Unbearable even with earplugs! A pity because the hotel location is great. But if you want to sleep, go elsewhere!;3
Ok so i think hotels in America lack the quality of standard we are used to in Europe and this is why i'd say this was more like a 3 star.  The reception area is pretty with the big chandelier etc but when you get up to the floors with the rooms you realize this needs major updating, even some paint would be good.  The receptionist told us he had given us a nice room?? it was pretty much of a brick wall was not a view, so not sure if he was joking or not.  The room was clean, beds comfy etc has a safe, tv etc.   The hotel is in a good location, could walk to see most sights. 10 mins from Time Square, close to Madison Sq Gardens.   Loved New York but next time i'd maybe try a different hotel :);3
I stayed here for one night. We were upgraded to a two bed room as I was travelling with my friend and we had requested a twin room.   The outside and communal areas of the hotel are excellently furnished. The lobby and bar area are really nice and comfy and the hotel offers free wifi in these areas.   Check in was good and all staff at the hotel were welcoming and friendly.   The room was a bit small. But had everything you need. The bathroom was a little bit tired and a bit small. There was no shower door. The actual rain shower was great. The showers were very refreshing.  The bathroom did not feel as clean as other areas and I feel in some ways let down the room overall.   The beds were incredibly comfy and I had an amazing sleep. It was the sort of bed that encompasses you;3
A The hotel is little run down very small room but good value, comfortable enough with a  friendly staff and a great location.  Great neighborhood.  Because of price and location we will probably go back.;3
We arrived LA in early morning, the lady not only holds up us for couple of hours (until 3pm. we pretty sure the room was ready) but also give us a street front room. Besides this unpleasant experience, the Hotel overall was good.;3
I have not checked into this hotel and I am already very dissatisfied.  Before you book this hotel, I strongly recommend visiting the Universal Sudios website for special package deals.  I just went on to purchase my park passes (for 1 day) and noticed a special deal with the Hilton Universal City.  I could have gotten two, 7-day passes ($67 per person/per day), free hotel parking ($17 per night), free hotel breakfast, free transportation to and from the park, and, of course, hotel at discounted rate.  This would have been over a $300 savings for us.  You think there would have been some advertisement on the Hilton website when booking...;3
Stayed here from the 18th Feb 2016, in all fairness it is what it is, friendly staff clean and accommodating do not expect bell staff to carry your luggage after a long fought or any luxuries but if on a budget and the amount of time you spend in your room who cares???? bed was comfy took me a while to work out the air conditioning as room was sweltering hot!!! First night was not so good due to extensive heat, lift was a little scary, if you want to be right in the bustle of time square this is not a good location as costs around $20 in a cab to Times Square or the subway is not far from the hotel, knowing what I know about location now I would have been more in Times Square area. But very central to subway and overlooking Central Park , can't complain at all for the price and;3
Amazing location off the Hudson and High Line. Walking distance to Chelsea and the village. Cordial staff. Tiny room for one person. It was comfortable with everything I needed. Don't do the shared bathroom unless you want to relive your college dorm days. Interesting smells. Bikes are a nice bonus.;3
My Room was very comfortable, all the things I needed to spoil myself. Not too far away from the shopping areas, with access to multiple Restaurants & multi cultural foods. Staff was friendly,  the lighting could have been a little brighter.;3
We stayed here for 3 nights on our way from San Diego to San Francisco.  After some careful research and review of fellow 'Trip Advisors' we selected this hotel not expecting any bells and whistles but good average hotel standards and that is what we received.    Location was good for our purposes and if you are looking to see any of the Frank LLoyd Wirght architecture, Hollywood tourists or even Griifiths Observatory the location could not be better.  The front desk staff service was inconsistant but nothing to be upset about.  The attendant in the gift shop didn't realize that the front desk will mail your postcards for you and had told us that we needed to go to a post office to get stamps - but couldn't tell us where one was.    the included breakfast was just okay and;3
Reasonable value for money in NY. However, room 310 is horrible. Make sure you don't get this room. The bed is over a foot short of a normal single bed. I'm 167cm tall and had to sleep scrunched up. The other foot or so where some of the bed length should be is taken up with water pipes,that, while surrounded by rope, are warm to the touch.  In this room you have the added 'bonus' of hearing the water running when people use the bathroom! I asked to be moved due to the size of the bed, which they did without question on the 2nd night (apparently full on the first night) quite clearly being fully aware of the issue. Whatever you do, make sure you request NOT to be put in room 310. Also, be careful of the slippery marble in the bathroom.;3
This hotel is good value when you remember it is a 2 star hotel, the decor is tired and some things didnât work, such as the wireless and toilet flush. Service was okay, biggest disappointment was arriving at 10 pm local time where told the only room left was a small one, even though we had booked 3 months earlier and told them we would be arriving late. However the did let us move the next day. On the positive side a great non touristy location and a great walk through Central Park to get down town to be a tourist.;3
This hotel is ideally located for Universal Studios and City Walk, both being a 5 min walk up the hill (a free shuttle is available but seemed pointless!).  It is also a 10 min walk down the hill to the metro stop, which takes you in to Hollywood.  Citywalk is a great place to shop and eat out, and Universal Studios is a must.  The room was just the right size and was nice and clean.  The staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful, in particular the concierge desk who helped us with a number of enquiries. I only had two issues with the hotel: 1) the cost of everything is very expensive.  Parking is $20/day, which seems a bit steep to me, and the internet was about $8 per day.  Both these things should be included in your room rate in my opinion.  We also ordered breakfast;3
Small room and bathroom but enough when you're in only to sleep. Nothing else to say. Oh yes, don't forget anything in the room and call after (less than 3 Hours) to ask them if they found it. They never find anything and you had forgot it somewhere else for sure :(;3
Bathrooms are too small. Avoid any of the rooms that end in 11.  They are next to the elevators where you hear them all night. Good location. Within walking distance to Central Park and Lincoln Center.;3
"The location is great, the bed is very comfortable and clean although the bathroom is very small which does not have ventilation and a very small toilet; the bar is ok but the restaurant is generally poor.";3
The Morningside Inn is a very good hotel. The rooms are clean. The hotel is really close to a subway, food outlets and is right next door to a Church. We all enjoyed our stay!;3
This hotel is directly across from Lincoln Center. In fact, It is the closest hotel to Lincoln Center. It is very busy all the time. The bed room was very well appointed. The shower was postage stamp size and had only 1/2 the shower area covered so water goes everywhere in the bathroom.  The bar is very busy also and the music is very loud. The employees at the bar, restaurant and entry are very pleasant . The doors to the street are open most of the time and there is a very cold breeze felt in the bar and looby. They charge $12.95 per day for the internet. There are no business programs  available on the TV. We had no water for about 2 hours around noon than it was brown for a while.Saturday night there was a pulsating beat from the music from the bar all the way to the 11th;3
Great hotel! Great location!  Bedroom was a good size. Bed was comfortable.   Room was clean.   close to all necessary amenities. Good restaurants in walking distance.  walking distance to the subway station;3
Upon check in we were met with pretty unhappy staff.  Nobody seemed very happy.  There was no offer of assistance to get the luggage to the room.  The door man who you would think would help you get a cab was not very helpful either.  Every time in was faster to request another ride service rather than wait on him. The room was just okay.  Bathroom was extremely tiny.  I thought the rooms had a mini refrigerator in them but that was not the case.  I did call the front desk and they brought up a small one to keep in the room for a $20 charge.  The bed comfort was okay but the pillows they have are the really small ones.  Instead of a couple regular size pillows, there are like 6 half size pillows that were not very comfortable.  When taking a shower, the water would only get hot.;3
Stayed one night in city to visit my son. Booked a room on Priceline- big mistake. We had 3 people and could only buy 1 room not knowing we'd show up and get a closet. Spoke with Rob 2 nights before and asked if we could secure a room with 2 beds. Was rudely informed of a $50 upgrade fee and then informed that the room I had would not allow 3 people (fire hazard) - basically being forced to pay $50 bucks more. Noted on other sites that several ppl were given free room upgrades. Extremely small room - we bought an air mattress and suffered through 1 night. Could barely move. Sheets were filthy and covered in blood (pics), makeup on pillow cases.. clearly not cleaned. Called for new sheets- took two trips to get actual sheets bc the man was confused and kept brining mattress;3
Nice hotel but could do with being painted staff   need be a bit .more helpful  asked for a kettle for my room but got a coffee machine instead after a day run out of pods for the machine so asked at the front desk girl that worked there said she would send someone up to how room but had to wait four hours later still no coffee pods so I was a little mad by now so I complained and. Got them at last;3
I was assigned room 137 and it was very noisy form outside ventilation fans, room windows are to the inside service patio and next building terrace was less than 3 feet away, so it is very uncomfortable....;3
"On arrival at the hotel, the grand foyer is lovely, unfortunately the check-in was not particularly friendly. Arriving at approx 1.30am, we were dealt with in a curt manner and no friendliness from the man. Rooms are very small and certainly not the photo that was shown in the Virgin Holidays images. As the room was just to sleep, we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall; this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view - no response was received. The elevator situation is main issue with the hotel - we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning. We chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up, returning to their";3
We stayed at The Empire Hotel for one night during our honeymoon in April. To our delight we were upgraded to a Suite in the top floor that was simply stunning, with two bathrooms, walk in wardrobe and a huge living room. We could not believe our luck. And the views on to Lincoln Centre were just the icing on the cake. Oh, but the drawback: it was right underneath the hotel bar/club and the music did not stop banging until 3 o'clock in the morning, making it impossible for us to get any sleep (we had to get up a 4 to catch a plane). We asked for earplugs but these only blocked some of the noise. Staff were helpful and brought us the earplugs quickly and free of charge.  I would recommend this hotel but only if you're young and want a dance club in your room or if you can sleep;3
We are a family of 4 who stayed here in October 2019. The rooms are compact but clean and we had a partial view of the empire state. We were lucky enough to have a coffee machine in the room to get us started for the day but I'm not sure this is in every room. This hotel is in a really good location for all attractions and we would stay here again if we had another trip to the big apple. The only negatives would be the extra price of the city tax which I think is high and the fact they charge you to hold your luggage (per case too) in a room on check out day is ridiculous. Never had this in any other hotel in the world!!;3
"WE stayed here for the last few days of our visit to NYC in October 2015.  It was very centrally located, and we were delighted that we could just walk out of the hotel and be in the middle of all the shops we wanted to visit.  The hotel was packed when we arrived to check in, and we had to queue for a little while (which was a pain), but we eventually got to our room (on the thirty-something floor) - had to use a particular lift.  Rooms were very clean, not impressed that there was no shower gel bottles provided.   When I called housekeeping about this, they brought up more soap bars - which was just what I did not want!  They said they didn't have any s hower gel in stock at that particular time.  We were even less impressed with their ""cover charge"" policy - this was";3
The location is brilliant. We saw War Horse which was right over the road at Lincoln Centre, and Central Park was a short walk over 2 blocks I think it was. There are two subway stations within close proximity. So as far navigating our way around the city from the hotel, it was a great base point.  The room was sooooo tiny. Nicely decorated - but it didn't make up for how ridiculously tiny it was. We also noted that it was our honeymoon and no one was interested. I don't expect an upgrade and bubbly - but a congratulations or acknowledgment from staff might have been nice.  The housekeeping service was painful. We had to call no less than 6 times begging for new towels, particularly a floor mat as the shower leaked onto the floor. We resorted to using spare towels for this every;3
My friends & I are all big Gossip Girl fans which is why we decided to stay at Empire hotel! Very nice hotel when you first come in the lobby & bar area is decorated well.  Reception staff were very slow & didn't really acknowledge us just went through the check in process quite robotically.  We had 2 rooms, there were 4 of us in total, 2 of us shared a double bed in a tiny little room with a view of a brick wall & the other 2 had a huge room with 2 double beds & a view of the street & buildings out the back. Considering we all paid the same amount & made the booking all together & the hotel was clearly not full in the middle of February, I'm not sure why it ended up this way with the rooms. But it's New York & you're out most of the time anyway so we didn't really mind.  Hotel;3
We stayed in NYC for two weeks this summer mostly visiting friends but wanted a few nights with a pool in a good location so our boys who are 6 and 9 could take a dip to escape the heat. Entrance and doormen were very lovely and welcoming, great lobby and a good start to our stay. We were given a very nice room overlooking the street with a slight view of central park and lovely buildings opposite. Bathroom was smallish but nice enough. The pool however was disappointing. We all laughed out loud when we first saw it as it was much smaller than we had anticipated but was happy enough and not overly surprised as the hotel seemed good value for a pool and the UWS location. Annoyingly however the pool had such high levels of chlorine that after half an hour on day 1 our eldest son;3
"Close to metro line so we were vey central; quite a schlepp if you take the metro from LAX so rather use Uber; microwave and fridge in room which was very handy; clean beds and rooms; lots of  in the rooms; reasonable cooked breakfast which could cater for fairly fussy eaters; sauna was great.";3
location was great. Beds comfy. Room was ok but as said in other reviews the bathroom is a design disaster, only a half panel to keep water in the shower!! we went to Starbucks underneath the hotel for coffee as I refuse to pay for in room coffee. we also refuse to pay for the ridiculously overpriced items in the room. $8 for water. and another example -$350 for a bottle of vodka. oh and a cheap touch was the sex kit you could also use...... tacky!! I didnt interact with the staff except for the man who stored my luggage on departure day who was great. I found it amusing that Pascal (on the desk) asked me to leave a TripAdvisor review after he was quite an abrupt little man!! so to sum up, if it wasn't for the location I would not of stayed here and when I return to NYC I wont;3
The Empire Hotel is in an iconic and ideal location just steps from the Lincoln Center and Central Park.  Its entrance is nice, with cheerful doormen.  The lobby is just off a high-end bar with comfy couches and nice separator curtains.  Ed's Chowder house is just above the lobby, and its a great place to grab a (fairly expensive but probably worth it) bite to eat.  The hallways are trimmed in brown tones with what appear to be the white shadows of tree branches.  Its a somber look, but very nice.  It does look a tiny bit worn, but overall its a good look.  Our room was on the back of the hotel, which trades a view for quiet.  Its a trade I was happy to make.  In fact the room was one of the quietest I've experienced in a central New York Venue.  Very nice.  The decor, which;3
If you ever find yourself travel on a budget and want to spend the night at upper west side Manhattan, this is a good choice.  The subway station is just two minutes walk away, and there are plenty of decent restaurants/diners around the block. I did not get the renovated room, so the bedroom has definitely seen its better days.  The elevator is very slow though, I just took the stairs when heading down.  My room did get a unusually roomy, well-proportioned bathroom, so that's a plus.  It is almost as big as my last hotel room when I visited Manhattan a year ago.;3
Stayed two nights. It was sold out on New Years Eve so we thought the place would be LOUD. On the contrary, it was very quiet. Weird. Ate at the free Buffet breakfast both mornings. Nothing fancy. Most of the other guests at the buffet appeared foreign (heard East Europeans, Australians, and Japanese). Front desk performed what they were asked, but no more. Room was clean, just old and slightly run down, but no funky smells. Parking lot felt secure. Daily fee. Finally, be aware, while this is Hollywood, you do not want to do a tourist walk around the hotel. Wrong neighborhood for that. If you drive and use the hotel as a base, works well.;3
The hotel has been rejuvenated....it looks good,,,,however the rooms and especially the bathroom is like entering a tomb.  Dark..dark!  Why?  They have a makeup mirror with no lights on it...what idiot bought them?  Too dark to put makeup on in the bathroom, must use hall mirror.   Put some lights on in the rooms...the 20 watt bulbs don't cut it.  Restaurant...what restaurant?   It is like all bar food.  Improvement is needed!;3
I stayed here for a week in July on business.  I had a nice room but was paying top whack for a superior double, so would have expected as much.  It was pretty dark though, as was the lobby, the lifts and the corridoors, which were all very brown... The service was fine, the hotel has a high turnover of guests so always lots of coming and goings with guests.  Hotel pool is more like a large bath and was full of kids when I saw it.  Roof top bar is fine, great if you smoke, seems to be populated by twenty and thirty something's with high heels and clearly deep pockets.  A round do drinks for five was 100 dollars.  The location is great and there is a Starbucks one minute walk away for breakfast.  It opens at 530 so is great if you are jet lagged. There is also a 24 hour duane;3
+  very good location, you're in the middle of the town, close to times square (10min. walk)!  kingsize room is very big&comfortable, with a modern bath&great shower.   -  very loud (bad&dirty windows, street);3
All was going well until there was no hot water for the whole hotel for a night and the following day. Rooms are clean and tidy. Luckily the builders weren't working on the scaffolding outside the windows or we would have had them peering in the window in the morning and making a racket. Come on Premier, No Hot Water, not great is it.;3
Very expensive hotel given our room smelt of stale smoke. $400 for the night so it was our most expensive hotel during our 3 week stay in the USA. The staff for helpful enough so no complaints there. Just couldn't believe the price for an extremely basic room that stank.;3
We arrived at night for our 2 night stay at the hotel.  From the outside in the city-lit street, the Ameritania looks beautiful.  The lobby is red and looks high end, but it is not. Check in was easy and stress free. I was given a room on the 8th floor. First the key cards didnât work and I had to go back down to the desk. They are super sensitive to cell phones. We brought the new keys back up and opened the  door.  Upon inspection of the room, it was a small NYC room (standard). There was just enough room to walk around the bed and get to the bathroom.  The headboard was peeling itâs faux leather.  If you want space, the standard room is not for you. The bathroom had been remodeled, but lacked clean finishes (caulking on tile, etc). You can see that the hotel is trying really;3
You are paying for proximity to the park.  And you will pay handsomely. The rooms are adequate. If you're going to Universal Studios then this is a good place to stay. Short walk in and out of the park. A little disappointed that you don't get early entry for staying here.   During our stay the elevators were ridiculous. I think only two of them were working and we waited and waited and waited to go up and down. If I was booking today I would actually avoid this place until the elevators are fixed or updated. Or demand a steep discount.;3
Stayed here 5 nights in August ...our stay was at the end of a17 day holiday ..there were 3 of us ..3 big cases and associated stuff... Needless to say we didn't unpack ...because there is one tiny tiny space to hang clothes up and 2 drawers. We spent the whole of the stay climbing over cases and tripping over various items ..we were in a superior room ..beds small but comfy. This was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in ...and we have travelled all over the world. There is no where at all to put your cases ..even the beds go right down to the floor ..no case stashing under them .   For those of you travelling with children who can read ...please check the contents of the tray that contains room service items for you to purchase..this will save any embarrassment when;3
Like a lot of people on here, I was pretty nervous about this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews but booked it anyway because of the near-unbeatable price. I consider myself to be a pretty practical person and don't have super high standards when it comes to hotels. My friends and I were pretty much just after a place to sleep and thats what we got.  We chose the 'shared bathroom' rooms. Our rooms were very basic but clean and spacious enough (although that could be because we had 3 person rooms for 2 people). The beds aren't all that comfortable but they replaced our pillows with nice new squishy ones a couple of days in and that hugely improved the situation. The rooms have TVs in them with cable which is good. The shared bathrooms were pretty average, definitely;3
We booked the Empire via Trailfinders as part of our honeymoon, as it seemed to be in a great location and it looked like a classic NYC hotel from the photos we saw.  The location was perfect, right on the south-west corner of Central Park. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee places within a short walk, as well as two subway stations on the 1 line for easy access to Midtown and Downtown.  The hotel has two bars, in reception and on the roof. Both were comfortable, classily decorated and served good drinks. The rooftop bar especially was buzzy in the evenings, though it was too chilly to enjoy what looked to be a cool outdoor area beneath the giant, red neon sign!  Staff were very helpful and friendly across the board, from start to finish. No issues there;3
Location is the reason to stay here, and the rooftop bar is very nice.  The hotel is no longer a luxury hotel, but the rooms have always been clean during my many stays.  The elevators shook a bit and sounded scary too, over a week, then one bank of them went out!;3
This was our second stay at the New Yorker. The first was fabulous, not as great this time, but Iâll get to that later. The hotel is in a great location for visitors to NY. If you arrive by train, penn station is only across the road. The blue line subway is just around the corner and the red subway line is just a block away. 10min walk to the high line, 15mins to Times Square.  The hotel has a 24hr diner downstairs and a bar and steakhouse attached also. There is a fitness centre downstairs, but if youâre doing sightseeing, you should be too buggered to use it!  The staff arenât the happiest bunch, but were happy to help me out when I had some questions. The hotel looks like it needs some TLC. The floor we were on, the hall way carpets looked very worn. The bathroom ceiling;3
Air conditioner is very noisy. Basically everything is noisy. Great service however the quality of the room is not worthy of a 4 star hotel. If you open the window, it gets even noisier... Asked for a room change but the front desk reluctantly said no...;3
The Hilton is conveniently located within walking distance to Universal Studios but is a little on the pricey side for what you get. I really expected the place to be perfect. And the staff to be on top of their game. It was just average and a little outdated.;3
Stay Report - 12/13 to 12/14  Location:Â The hotel is located about as close to LAX as you can get which makes the terminal walkable.Â  That's a good thing these days as the delays getting in and out are still horrendous.Â  Also do note that hotel shuttles now pick up on the departure level not the arrival one.Â  I was also able to walk to pick up my Avis rental the next day and it was a pleasant one mile stroll.Â   Hotel:Â The hotel has a nice lobby with a bar that stays open until 12 and a decent sized market which sells a lot of to go items.Â  The second floor has a business center (key card activated) and a lot of meeting space.Â  I didn't deal with any waits for elevators.Â  The hotel is right next to a huge parking garage and in fact shares its shuttle with them.  Check;3
Good localization. Fair price but they charge for parking and extra eggs in the breakfast. To leave thebags is no practical. Very noisy hotel and no options to have dinner. Cost benefit is ok, only this. Room is fair.;3
"The hotel sounds on the website as if it's close to lots of attractions...and in terms of miles it is...but it's not walking distance from anywhere and the traffic is so bad in the area (and dangerous) that even driving 4 miles takes half an hour. Also the local neighborhood is very dodgy and dangerous, I wouldn't walk outside anyway.  Booked through their website on a rate reduction due to staying more than a night and didn't get the rate advertised when I was charged - they then charged exorbitant taxes ( about 4 different taxes in all per night - far more than anywhere else in California charged) to justify the cost so it ended up being the rack rate anyway.  Room was nice; bathroom and shower were good. Parking at $18 a day plus tax was a rort given there was nothing really";3
I'm not sure I would stay here again but I did enjoy my stay overall. The rooms did not feel as clean as I would have liked, the beds are small and the a/c doesn't work well. But the location is amazing and the staff is great.;3
My room appeared to be clean, except when I went to put left over food items in my frig...there I found 4 half full bottles of soda left by the previous hotel guest. I also found some trash under my bed and what appeared to be the cap of a syringe on the side of my nightstand.  Those 2 things put a damper on my hotel experience.;3
I wanted to give a warning to watch out for the parking at this hotel. I paid for a parking ticket from the parking desk at the hotel for the garage right behind the Hyatt. It was $34 per day for in and out privileges. Each day when I left the garage I paid $32 each time in addition, so the $34 I was talked into at the hotel was a total rip off. Beware.;3
"I was here for business and found the overall hotel very nice; if you are here to see Universal Studios! However, from a business point of view it is merely average. I know they are currently redoing the elevators, which is much needed, as waiting for them took quite a while, but I think the bathrooms may need a little help, too. Mine had a leaking faucet that kept dripping loudly and started staining the bathtub.  Some other cons: The food is way expensive for what it is. Literally, double the price of what you'd pay in a restaurant. And of course, my pet peeve overall: parking fees! Why in the world do I have to pay for parking when I am staying in the hotel and already pay over $200 a night? It's such a rip off and just makes me mad. Hotel was booked out and even though I am";3
Clean and tidy, however linen and towels were not changed except on request and the hot water kept running out mid shower!! The people were pleasant and great value for money however considering itâs a very well located hotel.;3
A hotel in a good area not farvaway grom the center and very near to Central Park.Small room for three people with beds.Very slow in the reception.No wifi in the rooms!The pool is not working until the end of the year but they are not mentioned it when gou enter in their webside.Not the best value for money.;3
Hotel was under construction, not a huge deal, but wasn't notified during reservation. Room was very clean. New carpet.  Our view was nice, we could see Harry Potter's castle. It was about $75 can fare from airport, I'm sure there are cheaper options - look into Lyft while in LA. Staff was friendly. Safe area!;3
Iâd seen The New Yorker many times on holiday sites and hotel booking pages but never visited previously.  Location wise, youâre at the rear of Madison Square Gardens so pretty central and itâs easy to access both my office and most of touristy Manhattan.  The hotel would once have been very grand indeed but has certainly seen better days.   The reception, sorry lobby is spacious but with few check in counters for some reason. The lifts / elevators are guarded by security but they do helpfully point you towards the right set on your first visit (and can also guide you to the gym (basement level) if needed.  My room was spacious with a dual aspect, a rarity in any major city. The bed was comfortable but overall the room was again a little Spartan. The furniture will need to be;3
I have nothing inherently bad to say about Morningside Inn. Very conveniently close to the subways, and easy to walk up and down Broadway. It had great scenery in the neighborhood. The hotel itself was pretty basic. Just a bed, dresser, and tv, which was all I needed. The bathroom and the toiletries are things that could be upgraded a bit, but overall, my experience wasn't bad.;3
"We stayed here in August - this past weekend. The location is great and it's close to a cute cafe, Starbucks, and several shops to pick up fresh fruit.  The subway is right on the corner and it's so easy to get anywhere in the city.  I would only give it a 6.5 out of 10 for cleanliness, though.  The floor we stayed on, the 8th, was old, old, old.  The room was small (which was fine) but it's so old it seemed dirty and run-down.  the AC unit in our room was VERY loud! At least it blocked out my husband's snoring...... Apparently, the 11th floor and up is amazing. They've been updated and are a whole lot nicer; i imagine more expensive, too.  The elevators were slow, though, and very tiny.  There are two sets of elevators but it seems the other ones haven't run for sometime.  The";3
My main issue was parking. The designated parking was 3 blocks away & usually full at $41 a day when you eventually get a spot. Good staff, the rooms were a bit dated but clean, & no ice box. It was a decent place to stay overall.;3
Booked through expedia and we were only there for one night and were not expecting the red carpet.  We got in late and left very early.  The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet (for big city).  We were a bit north of the touristy area but a train, a block away, did a non stop drive to the times square area.  The hotel was not too hard to find and had a bit of a sterile appearance.  The front desk had a minimal school like desk and the staff was more interested in clock watching than serving.  I was to leave my credit card info with them and was a bit hesitant about that but it all worked out.  The room was okay, bathroom was clean but tiles chipped and so on.  Don't expect to get an extra towel or special treatment unless someone happens to know where they are kept and someone;3
The AC stopped working in our room after about an hour. It took many phone calls and 3 hours before they decided they couldn't fix it. Then told to pack up our luggage and come back to the front desk to get a new room key. The new room had working AC  but beat up furniture, much smaller TV and a faulty outlet in the  bathroom.;3
This is the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  Smaller than a cruise ship cabin. Bunk beds, comfortable enough. There's really nothing else in the rooms - some hooks for clothes and TVs for each bed.  I think it would be fine for one person who is up for it.  For two it was much harder because there's no room for luggage. Literally.  You won't know what to do with suitcases. But if you want to stay at the Jane to say you stayed at the Jane, well I guess there's no stopping you, is there?  It really is a glorified hostel for $145 a night.  Other hotels can be found.  So the good: friendly staff, fun quirky atmosphere, great lobby, classic elements, clean bathrooms, bathrobes, clean towels each day, a couple bottles of water in the room each day So the bad: tiniest of;3
I booked this holiday through expedia, and as I was doing my first solo trip to New York I wanted something that was close to some of the main tourist places as well as being close to the subway and restaurants.  This was my 3rd trip to New York, and I was looking forward to the break and just being able to have some time to myself.  Unfortunately my transfer from JFK took longer than anticipated so by the time I got to the hotel I was tired, hot and hungry.  It was after 9pm, so when I got to the hotel I was relieved to see there wasn't a queue, even more relieved when I was taken to the VIP desk where there is a seat, not because I was a VIP.  I sat did the usual explained that I was so tired after a nightmare journey, she seemed pleasant and just breezed me through check-in.;3
The price was moderate, but the rooms were tiny and the shower didnât have a door so everytime you showered you would get water all on the floor. The shower head was also from above so it was impossible to not get your hair wet. There was also mold on the ceiling which was gross. The rooftop was my favorite part and very cool, except the pool itself was kind of a joke with how small it was. Overall it was okay for 2 nights, but I would go somewhere else next time.;3

I stayed at the Empire for two nights in early November. It was my first trip to New York City, so this review is based off limited knowledge of the city and other accommodations.   THE GOOD:   - Location. On the Lower West Side, this hotel is within super close walking distance to Central Park, the Lincoln Centre, Park Ave shopping, basically all of midtown Manhattan. It's about a 20 minute walk from Times Square, and a 20 minute drive to downtown Manhattan (Ground Zero, ferry to Staten Island/Statue of Liberty, etc.)   - Staff. Although my interaction with the staff was minimal other than checking in & checking out, my friend called down for a razor and they brought one up very quickly. They also surprisingly didn't charge for it, which was nice since the bottled water in the;3
I found this hotel on TripAdvisor. I read the reviews and selected. This hotel was best choice. Although Wifi was not free. The hotel is very close to central park. Staff are very nice. My room was very clean and very serene.;3
It's basically in Central Park and pretty close to the Subway (should you feel game enough, keep hand sanitizer handy!)  No park views, small room, friendly staff, no free wifi (you have to pay $10 and its mediocre at best) - the worst part is a lack of a fridge in the room, would have been great to keep some water bottles etc cool.  Does everything a basic hotel needs to, not like you're going to be spending your whole holiday in the room anyway.;3
We stayed here for three nights while my kids went to summer camp nearby. Upon check-in, we were told we had been upgraded to a larger suite, so we were really happy. However, that was probably the last happy thing about the hotel.   Pros:  1) Room is very large by NYC standards. We had two double beds, a sitting area and ample space to store stuff.  2) Bathroom spacious  3) Lobby area very nice 4) Housekeeping staff and doormen accommodating and helpful 5) Location is just great! 6) Reasonable price  Cons: 1) Room smells like pee when you just get in. Later, nasal fatigue sets in and you don't notice it. 2) Worst problem for us: Door stopped working. At first, I thought it was a key card problem, so I stopped by the front desk to get a new one. Went upstairs, didn't work. Went;3
Fantastic location close to to the train station and the Empire State Building. The hotel is an Art Deco building that has character but in need of a coat of paint in places. The room was very small but clean the bathroom was functional and the bed comfortable. This hotel is an excellent base for a short break we managed to most of the sights on foot, only using the underground once to get to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Ground Zero. We had planned our holiday well as we wanted to see as much as possible in only four days, but on the few occasions we needed to ask for advice we found some of the hotel staff as well as the staff at a couple of places we visited ignorant, rude and unhelpful. This is not something that we encountered in LA or San Francisco on the same;3
This hotel was recommended by the travel agent as a four star hotel which it isn't ð.  You have to pay for everything in the room e.g. coffee pods, tea bags etc.  There is a well stocked minibar but prices are expensive.  Buy your own snacks and drinks.   The first room we were allocated was on the tenth floor, the air conditioning was very loud, the shower not working properly and the wallpaper was coming away at the joins.  We asked to change rooms, the staff were very good and showed me two rooms on the first floor.  I chose one room and we moved our belongings.  We then found that there was no safe and the air conditioning was not working.  As we were very tired, we reported this to reception the next morning and went out for the day.  On our return, the jobs had been done.;3
After extensive research done on this and other websites, we decided to stay at this hotel for a week on the first leg of our summer 2005 West Coast trip.  We chose the concierge(club) level as the amenities offered (drinks, light food) was worth the small extra fee and afforded us the ability to have a quick breakfast or light snack during our days in Los Angeles.  Note that rates for less than a week were charged at a daily rate, once we decided upon 7 nights we were given a cheaper weekly rate.  The location was good.  For visitors to Universal Studios, a short walk got you there in about 7 minutes.  We avoided most of the LA traffic by staying here, as it was easy to find off-highway routes nearby that, with the help of a map, took us wherever we wanted to go.  We did a lot;3
My husband and I recently stayed here, ending our epic honeymoon with 4 nights in New York. Being a special occasion (we also celebrated our 10 year anniversary at the Jane), we splashed out for a Captain's room. Overall the decor and general feel of the place was interesting and fun. There were aspects to our stay that we were pleased with, however there are a few areas that disappointed us. The main issue we had was that we had no idea that the hotel bar was actually a hot night spot on the weekend. This bar was listed as a hotel 'amenity' therefore I would have expected to be able to use and enjoy this during our stay. We had hoped to enjoy a drink at the bar on the Friday when we returned to the hotel however once we saw the queue outside and the many security guards it;3
"Great location if going to Lincoln Center.  Attractive dÃ©cor, small rooms and weird bathroom set-up.  Nothing complimentary; not even a cup of coffee. We were never told anything about a concierge at check-in, so we got no help from one; had to ask others (locals on the street) where to dine.  If not for the close proximity to Lincoln Center, we probably would not stay here.";3
Great position about 3 or 4 blocks away from subway to catch B or C trains to the top of Central Park. Small rooms but clean with nice bathrooms. Fresh towels and tidied rooms when you return from a hard days shopping. Tea and coffe availavble in the bsement room but advisable to buy some of your own milk as they ususally forget to buy some!This is handy as to buy breakfast your gonna have to walk a few blocks to get some - so helps you on your way. I have plenty of designer clothes and toiletries but none were stolen or used etc - we did however keep money on us at all times. Eating before you get back is also a good idea as there are not many places to eat immidiatley close to hotel. Harlem is quite near but not in the direction that most tourists want to go, ie shops etc. Be;3
Great location  in Midtown West across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, built in 1929 and huge - hundreds of rooms.  Staff was pleasant. Large lobby. Our room was old and  tiny but clean.  We were up high and in the rear so the room was surprisingly quiet. Construction facade outside -   my guess is that Wyndham just took it over and is planning a major renovation   - but is does not look like a prime high end Wyndham hotel just yet... Our main objection was to the Priceline rating at 4 stars.  I would say 2.5 perhaps 3, but we got a very good price ($82 per night plus tax and fees) so we were happy to be there. So if you can deal with a tiny room in an older hotel for a good price, the New Yorker may be for you.;3
So you're gong to New York and you check the hotel rates around town......not willing to spend $300 per night or much more.   Choose the Days Inn and I think you will be relatively happy while saving $$$.  The positives were:  the room was comfortably furnished, hotel located with easy access to the subway system.....lines 1 and 2 right out the door with  access to Broadway on the Express Line (2) with two stops, comfortable bedding. Good restaurants within walking distance.  The negatives:  public areas were bleak, elevators tired in need of freshening up and cleaning, some staff at front desk were not as gracious as they could be, halls dark.  Bath Room....about 60 square feet....sink with pedestal.....no Pullman only a small shelf for storage, no magnifying mirror and;3
"The fact that this hotel markets itself as being ""near universal studios"" is a bit dubious. LA is a massive place where nothing seems to be close to anything else, but I wouldn't count a 30 minute metro ride as ""close"". Unless you have a car or are prepared to pay for taxis everywhere, the first thing to do when you arrive here is to go to the Santa Monica metro station (3 minute walk) and get a metro pass for the length of your stay. This is the only affordable way to get from the hotel to anywhere interesting (DO NOT try to walk!). The hotel itself is clean, friendly and attractive but it's in an area that feels very dodgy at night (we only ventured out for dinner once). If I were to return to LA, I would pay more to stay somewhere closer to the action.";3
The room was very clean and the hotel is in an excellent location right in the heart of Manhattan.    Overall a nicely renovated and clean hotel.  I didn't use many of the amenities in the hotel itself but you don't have to go far to find anything you might want or need.  A short walk to Columbus Circle, Central Park and can even walk to Times Square and the Theater District.;3
The New Yorking is a very historic hotel located right in the middle of all the action in Manhatton. Easy walking distance to the Empire State building and Time square. Tons of shopping all around including the massive Macy's store. Lots of food choices nearby as well. The rooms are very small and dated but comfortable.;3
Given the location, the hotel price was reasonable compared to others. Walking distance to Central Park and Times Square as well as many restaurants, etc. The only frustrating  part of my experience was the door banging housekeepers first thing in the morning. It was ridiculous. The banging and slamming of doors was a constant all morning long!;3
Very lax service for the extremely over priced $32 buffet. Wait staff had to be asked for water and coffee refills and got bills wrong.  Ordering off mene fo breakfast equally expensive and incredicably wasteful portions of food;3
The staff was awesome.. from check in to check out. Friendly, funny, patient. Couldn't ask for better. The room however, could use some TLC. plate covers missing, paint chipping, rust in the shower stall. The bed was comfortable, but everywhere we looked we thought, 'how sad. I bet this was a really nice place in its day.' The neighborhood was a little sketchy, but then it is Hollywood.;3
Such a shame with this one, the lobby is nice, location is great (10 mins from Griffith Park and Universal) but the bedrooms let it down. We had room with 2 queen beds and the bedroom had dated decor and the bathroom had peeling wallpaper and cracked tiles, not the photos you get when you book. And doesn't work out so cheap after they add on parking and quite a few different taxes. Wouldn't rule it out but just be prepared!;3
When I first entered the Hilton, I thought that I was going to have a great stay here..  At least , that's what I thought. When you want to check in the hotel, it takes approximately 20 minutes, and, me and my sister were put in the 11th floor, while my parents were put in the 22nd. Plus, the elevators are really slow, and the only good thing is that it sa really close to Universal Studios.;3
I had a reservation for a 2 queen room, but once I got there they had âover bookedâ and only had a 1 queen room, I was traveling with my family. When I asked if they had any update options they said they are completely booked and to come back tomorrow morning to see if we can get the 2 queen room. When I asked for roll away bed for my daughter since they gave us a 1 queen room, it took a hour just to get the roll away bed. The next day when we finally got into the 2 queen room. Something was wrong with the AC, it was very loud and was hard to sleep at night. I stayed at this hotel a couple times but this had to be the worst experience.;3
"Well located between Times Sq and Central Park, this hotel has very small but clean, nicely decorated, and updated rooms, with bath. Staff are friendly and responsive to requests. The price was reasonable for NYC, but breakfast isn't included, parking across the street is USD 40-50 per night, and extra taxes also round up the cost.  Unfortunately, we had to call Reception every day of our stay to request that varying deficiencies be corrected: e.g. no towels; no shampoo/soap; no Internet and TV; room not made up by our return at 4:45 pm. The AC/ heating unit was absolutely required for air circulation but was so noisy that a decent night's sleep was impossible. We thought much could be done to improve things.";3
The hotel is in a great location and the room was very comfortable. Room 961 had a great views but was a little dusty and there was a used Dixie cup under the bed. Also the closet doors had smudge marks on them. My check in experience was the worst I've ever had! My husband booked the trip for me and put the reservation on his business card. When I got there no one offered to help with my bags ( 2 suitcases) and my arm is in a splint. The lady at the desk was Atefah and told me that they could not take my husbands card because he was not with me yet they told me to have the card at time of check in even though the room was in my name and card was in his. Since the card was a debit/credit card I could go to the ATM. So I brought all my luggage over there and proceeded to withdraw;3
List of positive and negative things about the hotel:  Positive: - Helpful waiter in breakfast dining area - Friendly and helpful door men - Location of hotel is excellent - Clean halls and rooms - Nice and comfy beds - Very little noise at our room (717) - Lobby personell helpful with turning off noisy machine at conference room.  Negative:  - Lighting in our room was poor.  - Lobby personell denied us coffee/tea at our conference room that we rented for 200$ for a few hours. We had to go out and buy at Starbucks and bring back to hotel. When we asked to have some water, we had to serve ourselves from the lobby and bring the cups into the conference room. Lobby personell were very unhelpful with this.  - Conference room was untidy, cold, did not have a projector and had a loud;3
Location perfect. When first looked at, bedroom (deluxe king) was perfect but soon discovered was not designed with a traveller in mind. Very little hanging space in wardrobe because of shelf on which sat mini bar and safe below. Bathroom was very small with hand wash basin only 3 inches deep. Looked good but was not functional. Hook on back door out of reach. Impossible to get Wi-Fi. supposedly free in lobby but free at Starbucks next door where we had breakfast each morning. All staff were very pleasant;3
We found the truth to be somewhere between the good and bad below. Terrific location for subway connections yet relatively peaceful surroundings. The place suffers from too much use, peeling wallpaper, scuffed paintwork and worn lifts and air conditioning. I know that the lifts are safe - don't anyone worry on that score - they don't sound it though. A closer look showed that everything was very clean - it didn't look it though. The staff were very helpful no buts there. And the neighbourhood is great with cheap food on the doorstep - we both ate breakfast of two bacon buns with two decaffs for a little under $10 dollars. More light and brighter colours would transform the first impressions so we won't return when we next visit unless we read of such a transformation - good luck;3
Your room , though well-appointed, is very small, particularly , the bathroom, and you charge for in room coffee, that makes it very inconvenient and unwelcoming.  Wwe have traveled all over The world and the USA, this is the first time we have encountered this.;3
"First of all, the good:  Location is fabulous, so close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, all the subways, and there are lots of restaurants and shopping in the neighborhood.  Also, of course, Lincoln Center.    The OK:  The furnishings are very dark and look as if they should be replaced, for the most part.  I was upgraded to a larger room, but it was still fairly small.  Still, the housekeeping was good, and my room was clean.  Also, I wasn't able to get into my room until after check in time.  The bad:  There was no closet in the room, only a wardrobe that also housed the safe.  As I had brought several dresses (this was a business trip), I ended up having to hang them on picture frames so they wouldn't wrinkle.  And the bathroom was very small; you couldn't be in it and";3
My girlfriend and I traveled America for 3 weeks in August-September 2014. We stayed in New York City for 3/4 nights and were carrying as little as possible, on a budget.  Positives: The Jane is a unique experience and certainly adds a memory to your travels. The door and luggage service is very helpful and professional. The rooms are clean and have a safe, and towels, dressing-gowns and slippers are provided. The shared shower rooms are not a problem and are clean. Above all, The Jane is in a very good location. It is in a safe area (in the evening too), and there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars to dine at. It is also just a short walk to The Highline, which really is one of NYC's hidden gems. The walk to Times Square (North) is around 30mins and slightly longer south;3
Room can best be described as dated, but it needs more than a fresh coat of paint as fittings are v old. We booked a double double room which sadly was not clean (hairs on/in the bath and dusty ledges) and have moved the furniture to get more room, as its v cramped and badly laid out. The room is simply not big enough for all the furniture.;3
Our stay our the New Yorker was nice.  The location was very convenient to Penn Station and the Theater District.  Prices were decent, nice art deco rooms, Tick Tock restaurant next door great, house keeping very family, clean rooms.  Front desk was accommodating but the room was mixed up.  They sent me a confirmation about upgrading and early check in but I didnt get that room.  They told me I needed to tell them since it wasnt in system.  They eventually got us the correct room but did try and charge us mkre then promised.  Check prices and make sure you get what promised.   Concierge could have been nicer, he did not help and was sort of rude.;3
Stayed here for a couple of nights. Firstly got the wrong room and couldn't change due to it being booked (fashion week). For a 4 star I was surprised that they didn't give complimentary robes/slippers. Also wifi was only available downstairs for free but connection wasn't always that good. Another unwelcome surprise was the fact there was no air conditioning - rooms were liable to get quite hot and even though it was cold out by the morning we were baking! Don't think I would want to stay here in the summer. Doormen were lovely.;3
Let's start with the negatives, the hotel rooms do feel a little outdated with all the lamps ect. The hotel and rooms were not to bad the only real issues we had were the air conditioning systems being extremely loude. To the point that sleep was difficult, and it wasent jus our room, no 315 it was everyone's, you could hear whenever an air conditioner had been turned on. One of the most uncomftable things would have been the hotel elevators they took about 3 min to get up 3 floors and are are out of date needing to be retested and certified witch I know in Australia is illegal to operate an elivator to the public witch has not been recently tested. However I'm not to sure on the Los Angeles government   The positives The checkin staff were great also very helpful whenever you;3
Disappointed that we had double beds, not queen or king and it was a tight fit for my daughter and I on one but my son had his own bed. Felt it was rather expensive but did not expect otherwise in NYC. Elevators were a challenge but we dealt with them as an experience! Staff were all very helpful and friendly.;3
Good location, Nice, clean, good customer service but not worth the cost, would go for something different next time. In room they charge for everything, even the coffee! Thumbs down for that. The pool is more like a hot tub size. Of course view from the roof was great but couldn't go up at night because it was closed for a private event, :(;3
Doubting between the 3* and 4* rating, because it was a good hotel for our NY citytrip, just some minor items that might not be a big deal for some guests. So a 3.5* for us :)    The location is great: on Broadway, near different subway stations and Times Square. The staff was also friendly at check-in and check-out. The doorman, Jeff, was a great companion during our wait for the shuttle to take us to the airport. In the end, it was an hour late, but he helped us by calling them, telling us not to worry and taking the time to give us some valid life lessons :)   The hotel itself looks nice and modern, the bed was very soft and there was a great shower, so everything we needed! The minor items that we discussed during our stay: we got a very small room, I think it was about 3m x;3
"One thing to mention here is location may be great, but the room was small and cramped. Service was okay - we only stayed one night but that was enough. For one of the more ""famous"" hotels in NYC, it failed to impress.";3
This is a very busy hotel due to its proximity to Universal Studios.  However, the hotel staff does try to ensure each guest is satisfied and that each room meets Hilton expectations.  However, my recent visit was somewhat below average, due to issues with the assigned room.  I am a loyal Hilton patron and will remain so, despite my disappointing visit this past week.  I hope that this review will help this hotel staff to fine-tune the quality of the hotel rooms they assign to guests.;3
"A couple of friends and I had stayed here for a couple days a few weeks back for my ""birthday weekend"". We had gotten to the hotel before the check-in time and were able to drop our suitcases off so we could go tourist around and come back to check-in. The gentleman that first helped us at the front desk was Nelson and he was very nice and very accomodating. When we finally came back to check-in there was a huge issue which Mikey was happy to help us with yet Michael G. couldnt be bothered with. After a half hour of trying to check-in we finally were able to get our bags and the gentleman that helped us with that was George! I commend him and all that he does! Had it not been for George we would have probably checked out the next day, he was the kindest Front Desk Service";3
We spent 4 nights in this hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated but at bit worn out.  There is not a lot of space to put your luggage, but I suppose this is always the case in New York.  The personnel was friendly and the hotel is very well located to visit New York by foot or subway.  Our main issue was that our neighbours did a lot of noise and you can hear everything through the walls and doors.  We recommend rooms that are in the upper levels as the AC make a lot of noise in the lower levels.  Besides the noise problem, we recommend this place as the bed is comfortable, the room is clean, the bathroom is modern and the hotel is VERY well located !;3
I have wanted to stay in the Jane because of its historic significance. The survivors of the Titanic stayed here. The hotel is old and has wonderful decorations reminiscent of a bygone era. The doormen were very friendly and helpful. At one point, I needed a cab and didn't realize that required them to run down the block to hail a cab since there was construction in front of the hotel that limited traffic. Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were friendly.The hotel has an elevator.   The rooms are small. I brought along a 6 foot long charging cord for my cell phone and it stretched the length of the bed. At the foot of the bed are shelves that are only a few inches deep. Therefore, if you are over 6 feet tall, I'm not sure you will fit in the bed. The room felt larger;3
This place is a great price, great location, clean room and safe neighborhood. Free wi fi really came in handy. Nothing fancy but will do if you are trying to get a good price on hotel while in the city. The only problem was we had a window that faced the club across the street. It was very loud during the weekend and on one week night we were there.  We finally figured if you left the tv on all night that would drown out the noise.  The only way I would recommend this hotel if you be sure to ask for a room on the opposite side of the club located on Broome st.;3
The rooms have been renovated, but not a great renovation. The shower is falling apart, the TVs are old, the bed is uncomfortable, the closet has a curtain instead of door and the hot water takes forever to come out.;3
The hotel lobby was nice, but the rooms were small and the AC units in the rooms were old and noisy. Also the room we had just looked onto other rooms and the ventilation system for the hotel. None of this was mentioned during the booking procedure.;3
We stayed here in August the location was good. The hotel was surrounded by many different restaurants and subway. Was very disappointed that only one elevator was working the entire time of our stay, the sofa bed was broken and uncomfortable, and I couldn't believe that the hotel didn't have a microwave on the premises.;3
This hotel is vintage, with Art Deco decor therefore you stay for the history and location which is central and very convenient for penn station and port authority station, Madison square garden Macy's and the Empire State are all within a block  Our room and the public areas were always clean and tidy. Hotel feels safe. The only down side was no drinks facilities or fridge in room although coffee making was stated on hotel site. We would be happy to return;3
"The good: good water pressure in the showers; great location and train/subway access; professional and friendly front desk staff, particularly Crystal and Jose; pretty good WiFi in Lobby; in-room safe; security to confirm people are guests before boarding elevator.   The bad: really crappy WiFi in rooms, at least on the 27th floor (disconnected every 10 minutes, inconsistent performance when it was working) and bad offshore tech support (meaning, they will tell you to reboot your device or pretend they did something when in fact nothing usefull is done); slow housekeeping which means rooms may not be ready for new guests by checkin time.  If in-room wifi is important to you then I recommend you consider an alternative place to stay. No filtered water cooler in fitness room.   If";3
Best price in Manhattan, 3 blocks from Subway line #1. Excellent location near Central Park, Columbia Univeristy, theater area. Very budget, no frills with shared bathroom. Better than dorms in a hostel. Clean linens, clean bathroom. Helpfull staff. Laundry available, close to shops. Ok safe neighbourhood for the experienced budget traveller.;3
Stayed here one night for business.  At $194 I thought I could get unstained sheets/linens, and a spotless bathroom.  I didn't.  Had a huge corner king room with sofa, and work table.  Nice lobby/atrium area.  Breakfast buffet seemed pricey, ($17-$19,  can't remember) but had huge selection.;3
We booked our room directly through the hotel website and payed 89.95 with the AAA discount which is a very good deal in New York City.  We too had read several bad reviews of the hotel on this website and were scared as to what we might find.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The lobby area is old looking, but nice, and the staff was prompt and friendly.  PARKING is not fun around the hotel.  You can pay $20 a day around the corner, but if you want to save money and park on the street, beware of the crazy NYC rules.  On the left side of the street there is no parking on Mon. and Thurs. from 11:30-1, and on the right side of the street there is no parking on Tues. and Fri. from 11:30-1.  You can park anywhere on wednesdays.  Apparantly they clean the streets at those times.  It;3
A little disappointed if Iâm honest , I know itâs an Art Deco hotel and from 1929 , the lobby looks fantastic , when u move to the lifts they look worn and old , everywhere look freshly painted but over the top of old paint , it all just looks well .. old and not in a good way ,  The room is 2 small for 2 beds and the beds are not double beds , we were only here 2 nights so I let it go , but I will be talking to our travel agent who booked it;3
Room:  We had a standard room.  It was small by US standards.  The hotel has been around a long time, so we were not surprised with the smaller size.  We were in NYC to sightsee, so the small room was OK.  But letâs be clear, we had very little elbow room. Location: Wonderful.  Short walk to basically everywhere including Time Square.  Also easy access to the subway.  Active area for cabs.  Biggest appeal of this place is the A+ location. Service: Busy hotel. Service felt a bit rushed. Bit the concierge was just delightful.  Full of good tips and help on several requests.   Price: Given the location the price we paid was a great deal.  Small room sure, but a good value.  If Iâm back in NYC looking for budget lodgings, Iâll return.  But honestly, for a few dollars more there are;3
"Price was right, and the rooms are nice and bright. Very pared down, old building. Beds are hard as bricks though, and skip the ""continental breakfast"". It's served in a basement boiler room and is prepackaged junk. There's a great bagel shop around the corner that's a thousand steps up. Location can't be beat, and definitely check out the late night Indian cafeterias and Bob's your uncle- which is a super chill bar.";3
We stayed at the Empire for its convenience to Lincoln Center. However the room was tiny, and the bathroom was so small there was nowhere to rest a toiletry kit except the floor. The controls on the heating unit were unfathomable. My wife and I could not figure out to turn on the shower. We called the front desk who said they would send someone up. After about a half hour and another call, my wife finally pushed on the handle with all her might and it started working. Really? At this price?;3
The traffic was the worst in any other Hyatt I have stayed in- Horrible.  And the food selection was bad, room service ended at 10pm.  The hotel itself is modern and clean.  But they have to make it guest friendly in regards to the traffic.  We waited over 40 minutes for a Uber due to traffic and Alamo missed our flight due to traffic.;3
If you want to be in NYC and not waste hundreds of dollars on a place to sleep, this might be a great choice for you! Across the street from Central Park, close to subway stops, very small but clean rooms. Bed only, no chair or couch. Also has a closet and small TV. WiFi is an extra charge!;3
An avarage budget accomodation close to the centre of London. It is quite noisy and the wall's noise isolation is very poor. Communal areas like kitchen and toilets are relatively clean. The reception staff does not seem to care too much!;3
The good, We did a two day as universal studios ticket, the property is a short walk from universal studios and all universal shopping eating areas right outside. Now everything else the property is showing it's age, as noted by others the lobby area has some construction going on, the elevators were very slow. We had change rooms because the shower valve was broken, for which no one noted apologized for, the carpets are worn and wallpaper is in bad repair. The property really just needs to updated and refreshed.;3
The hotel is in a superb location, so you can get to almost all the key attractions easily.  Most of them are a simple subway ride away, but some of them, like the Empire State, Macy's, Times Square and Rockefeller Center are walkable.  However, our room was very small, the lobby is constantly crowded and the service is not great.  You pay for the location.  OK for a 2-3 night blitz of the sights.;3
Stayed here for 8 nights this month on a city trip. As everybody here we booked the room to save some money to visit the city, its expensive enough. Loved the clean room on arrival, the quiet street between two busy ones (Broadway and Amsterdam), the fridge in the room, the a/c and fan , the cable tv. The bed was a bit small for two adults, the bathroom also, but not to bad overall. Disliked the quality of cleaning during our stay and the late check inn (4 pm) and early check out (11 am), even if you mail you arrive in the afternoon (we did at 3.30 pm after traveling 14 hours and with a six hours time difference)  there was nothing to do about it : wait till 4 pm !! Also strange : pay all 8 nights before you even are allowed to check the room.   In general : its for NYC a pretty;3
the rooms are small but comfy enough because you are mostly outside. In the middle of the night we've heard some loude noise from the heating en it was very disturbing. The night after, we've shut our heating off so we could sleep, but we've asked for an portable heating in the room and we did get it. the staff is friendly and helpfull. i will recomend this hotel for people who are just sleeping in the hotel and are willing to live back to basics for a couple off days.;3
Great Location for sight seeing. Rooms as to be expected. Breakfast was average but good selection. Heating failed the first night but ok the second night. Beds comfortable  and staff friendly. Would visit again due to location;3
The room was super small and the bathroom was even smaller.  Hard to store luggage and the there was no counter top in the bathroom.  There was also no shower door and water went everywhere.  No great for a family of four.;3
We stayed here as a base for our honeymoon in NY. We were not looking for luxury. However, it is very basic. When you enter, it is lovely and grand but the rooms are very very basic and the bathrooms are very out of date. We were on the 22nd floor. The shower took a good 10minutes to become hot so had to turn it on as soon as we got back. The closet continually smelt of cooking. There was a vent inside it and I am not sure if this came directly up from the diner below but we had to keep our clothes out of there and on the chair in the bedroom. The bed was comfy enough. The doors are heavy and so you hear them slamming at all hours. We had a very busy and loud floor! As a base it was fine but if you are looking for a bit more from a room, or a quiet hotel, then do not stay here.;3
Good value for money. Very spacious room with 2 double and comfy beds. Clean. Size of hotel made it seem a bit impersonal and although efficient, staff we encountered were not warm or friendly. Waiting for lifts wasnât too much of an issue for use despite being up very high. I would probably stay again because of value for money but would have lower expectations of staff.;3
I chose this because I wanted something near the Lincoln Centre.  It could not have been much closer!  Check-in was very gracious (as was check-out as, by chance, it was the same lady) and we were delighted to have a room well before the 3pm check-in time.  The room was a reasonable size although the bathroom was a little cramped.  The shower had only a half door so water sprayed everywhere and had damaged things like the door frame.  The bedroom decor was a little dark  but that is a matter of taste.  It was clean and comfortable.  I shall definitely stay here again (have already booked).  I am, however, very critical of the fact that they charge for a cup of tea or coffee that you make in the room.  This is the first hotel where I have experienced this - $3 for a cup of coffee;3
First the good things: Friendly staff and nice location between Midtown and the Upper West Side. Particularly good if you are planning on going to a concert/opera at Lincoln Center as it is right opposite it. We were given an accessible room  and the size was good, which is pretty rare in New York. However, the furniture was dated and in some instances broken.  The wardrobe was tiny and the bathroom was in bad condition. The shower wasn't working properly and needed patience and care to make it work. There is no room service as apparently the restaurant doesn't belong to the hotel. Didn't try the restaurant but had a look and wasn't impressed. All in all an OK experience, but i  expected a bit more from a 4 star hotel.;3
By far the best thing about this hotel is the Location - you are 5mins from Macys & other great shops and across the street from both Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. Their diner Tick Tock is also good, food all day and night and the quality and price are reasonable. The gym and business centre are also fine.  Rooms are a bit hit and miss...my sister arrived the night before me and woke up with bites all over her arms, chest and back. They moved us immediately to another room and say they investigated and couldn't find the cause. I have my suspicions! The rooms are old and worn but the rate at the hotel is pretty cheap so i think you get what you pay for. Water pressure and temperature were both good in the room and so was the wifi.  The hotel is huge, separate banks of;3
"I usually stay mid-town; however, I found myself in the upper side, which was delightful. The rooms need to be updated, but it has all of the amenities with an updated TV.  The hotel staff is very helpful and if you have any concerns they step up to the plate to resolve the issue. If you aren't planning on staying in your room...give it a try because the location is nice.";3
The hotel is location in a really good place - next to Madison Square Garden. The rooms were OK - average size, clean but very dated unless you love art deco?! However you only use the rooms as a base to sleep so that wasn't a problem for us. The lobby has a small take out coffee/pastries and the Tic Toc Diner is good. The $25 dollar a night fee when you arrive is a money making scheme by the Hotel. We were aware of it before we went - not really sure what you got for this mandatory fee- access to the tiny business suite and the small gym perhaps ?? You also have to pay $2 dollars for every bit of luggage you store once you have checked out !! This seems another money making scheme by the hotel. I must say though the staff were very nice and helpful. The only reason I haven't;3
Stayed here for one night on a quick trip to Manhattan for business. My assistant found it and booked it and certainly that choice wonât win any brownie points from me.   Iâll keep this short and say that the hotel is huge. 42 floors I think. Art Deco style. Though the style is lost behind a veneer of shabbiness. The room was small and clean. Not well appointed or overly comfortable. My mint green bathroom looked like it was original to the 40âs. Not even a toilet paper holder. Simple a roll on the sink shelf.    The kicker for me was the walk to the room. The hallways are interior. No windows, bad lighting, kind of dirty, and all combining to a scary vibe. I felt like I was walking the hall of the hotel from The Shining.   It is however a busy hotel. Lots of budget tourists on;3
I got this hotel on Priceline for 75 bucks which is an absolute steal for NY for a 4 star hotel.  However, when I got there they said I had to pay a facility fee for 27 bucks or something which I thought was stupid.  They coldly said that Priceline should have let you know, which they didn't.  Anyway, the front desk man was very nice and gave me a two queen bed room, which is rare for NY and the room size wasn't huge but for NY it was.  The room looked like it hadn't been renovated since 1975.  I mean come on. Bathroom was gross.  Definitely not a 4 star hotel like the travel sites claim. But all in all, if it weren't for the good location across the street from Penn Station, this wouldn't be an ideal choice.  That and the upgrade is the reason I'm giving this a 3 star view.;3
Lots of restaurant options, and friendly service. Rooms are typical in size of an older New York hotel - small but set up well.  It is clean but could use a refresh.  Conveniently located near Penn Station.;3
Stayed in the Empire as part of our team location for the MYC marathon. Paid 350USD night, with taxes etc ended at 400, could have done much better elsewhere. The staff were good and accommodating, they changed our room immediately once we complained of the noise from the aircon unit. The rooms where OK, good bed but no hanging space, very bad for business trip. the shower and bath were OK but could use a touch up as the door already had water damage. the room beside us had glasses out in the hall for 24 hours that weren't cleaned up. The lobby is well designed, but a bad wind comes in from the street and makes it cold. People were putting their shoes on the tables in the lobby and no employee asked them to remove their feet, people later put drinks and food on those surfaces.;3
This hotel is in an excellent location in the middle of the city.  The price is right, the lobby is OK, and the restaurant is OK, too.  Our bedroom was facing the Empire State Building, that gave it a nice view but we asked for Queen bed, and they gave us a Double bed.;3
"We stayed one night recently, to go to Macy's parade.  We paid only 99$ for a double and $129 for a quad.  At those prices the room is fine.  We are budget travelers and accustomed to budget accommodations such as this.  The location is fine, located between two subway stops (2 -3 blocks either way), about 30 minute subway ride to lower Manhattan.  The area is mostly residential, the nearest coffee shop or store is 2 to 3 block walk.  Parking is challenging.  The room was small, as is all budget accommodations in NYC.  It was clean, comfortable beds, freshly caulked shower, no micro-wave or fridge in the room.  While there was an ice bucket there is no place to get ice.    The was one problem; The room was extremely hot, impossible to sleep in.  There is no thermostat.  We had";3
Stayed here for 2 nights in September with my wife. The room was small and the view out the window wasn't great, but the bed was very comfortable and I slept well. I wasn't too impressed with their shower but the room was clean and sufficient for our needs. The hotel was only about a 20 minute walk to times Square but close to central park, with some decent places to eat nearby. I didn't have breakfast here so can't comment on that, there was free WiFi in the lobby but not in the room. The gym was small but ok for a basic workout. I'd stay here again, for what I paid it wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't terrible either, we stayed over the labour day weekend so knew that value for our buck was compromised.  If you are in NYC for a short time doing the regular touristy stuff it is a;3
I've stayed in a lot of NYC hotels, so I don't hold the small rooms, aging building, noisy AC or street noise against the Empire. Unless you spend a fortune, that's just what you getting in the Big Apple. However, a good hotel compensates for the negative things that can't be changed by acing the things that can be changed. This is where the Empire deserves some criticism.  1) Service, while friendly, is very inconsistent, and the hotel seems to struggle to get the small stuff right. Day 1: room service meal arrives with no salt and pepper. Day 2: one of the room's two water glasses seems to have been removed permanently by the housekeeping staff, and there is no breakfast menu to hang outside the door (there was one on day one). I used up the hotel-provided moisturizer in the;3
My daughters and I visited this hotel Dec 2004 and found the rooms ok. I had asked for two non smoking rooms one was the other one the ashtray was in the chest of drawers and my sheets smelt of smoke but what the hell a quick spray of perfume and I was out for the count anyway. The window did not shut that well but we all used our earplugs anyway and I have stayed in a 5 star hotel this year and I think people are too quick compare places with there own home of places they have stayed in before. You go to New York to take in the sights and shop till you drop and if you are going to complain about the room all i can say is you can't of filled your day enough. We where so tired it did not matter. Keywest diner is good for breakfast and the hotel is handy for the subway. We shall;3
My girlfriend booked this hotel through trailfinders for my 30th birthday and it got off to a great start when our room was upgraded to a deluxe double room. Pasquale on the front desk was espeically helpful. The room was a good size for NYC although the general decor was a little tired. We had a great view of the Lincoln Centre and it is within walking distance to the Lincoln Centre & Columbus Circle subway. The heating unit in our room unfortunately was a little noisy and we had to turn in off at night to sleep. Also the wifi was not working properly for our stay which was a little annoying as we had to go to Starbucks (located next door fortunately) for their free wifi.Overall we were generally happy with our stay but there could have been little improvements to make it a;3
Stayed here for 5 nights and was centrally located for all the main sights and close to bus stop for hop on hop off routes. We finally arrived at hotel about midnight after long day travelling and nearly as long on bus from JFK, tip if you can fly into Newark less traffic that route to city centre. We were upgraded to a room with a view looking at the Empire State Building and madison square Gardens, room had 2 large beds, 2 comfy chairs and desk. Not enough power outlets to charge electrical items, there were even 2 in bathroom. Bathroom was very small and dated but clean and lots of hot water and good water pressure. Diner next door good for brekkie though not cheap, but what is on NYC. Have to pay $2 per bag to leave after checkout and then another $2 to reclaim later. Most;3
Hotel is close to subway, rooms are OK, bed comfortable, bathroom was clean, people are nice. Not fancy at all, but reasonably decent. Only 2 elevators and they are slow, so I recommend you get an upper floor, so you get them empty on the way down (we had floor 11 and it was fine), or a very low floor and use the stairs.;3
Facility charges don't make sense, feels like a tricky way to up room price and not clear during shopping for a hotel room. Be prepared to pay more as you check in / out. Love the location yet the room didn't have much room to move very small it looked bigger online when I made the reservations.;3
The Pros:  Location was close to Penn Station.  Bed was comfortable. The windows open to cool off the room.  Security in the lobby checks for room keys at the elevator bay.  The Cons:  Bathrooms were old and the shower went from freezing to scalding hot every couple minutes.   Elevators took a very long time to come in the mornings.   a $25 Maintenance Fee?  Are you kidding me?  For wifi and a fitness center??  Who charges for wifi anymore?  I would never stay here again for that reason alone.;3
We stayed two nights.Next time it will be a different hotel in a better part of the city. It is an older hotel in a not so great neighborhood. The parking lot is gated to keep out the homeless who live in encampments on the sidewalks outside the hotel. We were disappointed to be notified when we checked in that parking is an additional charge, $30 a day! and that their is no free breakfast because of Covid-19. At other hotels we stayed at a minimum,  provided  a bagged breakfast of muffin, juice and a granola bar. They should update their website to inform potential patrons of their current conditions. The fountain which is in the back is not operational. Even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door. Housekeeping entered our room and it frightened our daughter who was in;3
I am surprised! In the year 2017, wifi is not free in this hotel!  Every coffee shop and cheap hotel has a free wifi these days...I said I am Hilton Honour for points, the receptionist( manager) said, it doesn't count as I booked through the internet and not directly through the hotel's website. She gave me wifi though as I complained and said because I am an HHonour! I asked for a room with a view, she said she gave me the best in that category and otherwise I had to pay an additional fee. I went to the room and there was a bad smell and view of highway and I could clearly hear the highway's noise. There was complementary bottles of water in the room. I went back to the receptionist, brought my concerns and she gave me another room. ( although she had it at first place and did;3
My suite had a musty smell to it.  The throw pillows on the bed and sofa sleeper stinks. Tried to take a picture of the city from my room but the windows were filthy. The room needed a lot of dusting   I had to buy air freshner.  The size of my suite was awesome and My bellman Eugene was Great!!!;3
We stayed here for four nights on a city break during April 2019 in a Metro Room.  Things got off to a bad start - the room we were given initially was quite cramped and had a window with a large gap which created a constant whistle from the wind and meant it was very noisy from outside too. We called reception and they sent someone up to look. He couldn't fix it and said he would either come back to fix it or tell reception to move us. We then went out to have a wander around the area. On returning, we found nothing had happened, so called reception again - they knew nothing about it so I explained the situation all over again and they did give us another room.  The new room had a much better feel to it - better layout and a bit more space. Bed very comfortable. All very clean.;3
I've been meaning to write this for a while. I stayed last October for a week and am not sure I'd stay again. I'm a single woman, middle-aged, fairly well traveled. Don't need luxury, just a clean room & a little service when required.  I had the room on the first floor at the front, right on the street. It's a huge room by NYC standards but a bit grungy. The window air conditioner had substantial gaps between the expander panels and the window frame so I asked immediately if something could be done about it. Turns out I had to ask twice a day for the first three days I was there. As a single traveler, this seemed a safety issue even though the staff somewhat dismissed my concerns that it wouldn't be possible for someone to get in thru the window because it was too far from the;3
"On two nights business related stay in Manhattan I chose the hotel for it's location near Penn Station.  Arriving at the hotel at noon, the clerk tells me me my room is ready but my rate only allows me to check in at 4pm. Therefore for a mere 50$ I could check in early. The weather outside is turning and the rain changes to snow. Let's do it.   What a ""customer first"" experience... NOT!  I head over to store my luggage and the guy asks me for 5$. I have never been at hotel before that charges money for this, but here I go.. Than I ask if I can tie my backpack to the big luggage, and the guy says sure, but it's five more dollars, I'm like no way and head out into the snow...  Everything else is normal, but old and a bit rundown, though everything works and nothing is obviously";3
I have waited a few weeks to review on trip advisor as I have completed 3 other reviews including the hotels own review and the Wyndham review and was hoping to get a reply from my feedback. Nothing to date so they have not attempted to defend themselves and have obviously accepted my comments. On arrival we queued for around 20mins to be checked in. We booked via Expedia and had completed their room preference questionnaire but these are pointless as the last 3 times we have done this the hotels claimed they had not had any requests from Expedia?? At check in we were informed there was a daily facility charge for the use of the gym and high speed internet. WARNING there is no choice! We had 2 rooms so were charged twice $150! I did explain that we were on holiday and would not;3
Very basic hotel. Small room, nothing exceptional but it's a great option if you don't plan on staying in the room for long or often. Close to Harlem and right in front of the park which was great. Would stay there again.;3
Great location if you are planning to spend the day at Universal Studios Hollywood! My friends and I stayed for one night and were given a double room on the 7th floor (Room 766). It was large, clean and quiet. The carpet had a few stains, but that was to be expected. And the shower head needed changing (pressure wasn't great). The Peter Roth amenities were great and it was overall a good hotel for the convenience and cleanliness. I didn't eat at Cafe Sierra only because I had the dinner buffet there a few years back and go food poisoning for about three days. Not sure how it is now, but I wasn't dying to find out! Pool was clean too, but it gets a bit windy on some days.;3
i never found staff so acid in my hotels experience. The cleaner get into my room while i was naked after a shower. The bathroom wasn't clean at all.. an hundred bucks in the trash.;3
The location of this hotel is great, metro station is just 2 mins away and central park within walking distance. Upon arrival we had to change our room due to constant noise just outside of the room. The new room was bigger but a strong smell of stale smoke. The room itself needed a 'facelift' the door didn't close properly, the shower was half broken, one of the bedside lamps didn't work the remote control for the tv didn't work.   The reception staff were friendly however we asked for a wake up call one morning at 4.30am and we didn't get it...thank goodness for our alarms on our phones. The concierge spoke to us like we were stupid telling us at 2.30pm that the St.Patricks Day parade had finished when it actually went on till 5pm. Thank goodness we ignored his advise and went;3
Seriously, the rooms were great. Not sure what it is but the hallways creeped me out a bit. Otherwise OK, no frills, typical mid-town hotel. The room had a bit of an old style Victorian almost leaning Gothic feel. Although it was OK, it was not good enough for me to stay at again. Just too many options for a blah place... Great if you need a place near Penn Station...;3
"Location is perfect. Such easy access to subway and trains. Lobby is attractive and busy! Paid extra for a view and got it on the 29th floor looking at the Chrysler Building. Not too much street noise except when window was cracked. Nice to have a room where the windows open. Room was very small to the point I was not sure where to open the two suitcases we had. Bed was definitely not a queen-size; at best it was a large-ish double. I booked a queen but did not want to move after seeing the view and the long line at check in and wasn't sure if this actually WAS their ""queen size."" Bathroom was ok but also small.I don't use much make up or product so the small shelf was okay but if you like a large counter top you won't get one.  Water changed from scalding hot to cold in an";3
Below is the reply I sent to management at The Jane. Following your stay The Jane sends an email asking for feedback. And so, here's my feedback.  --------------------------------------------------------------  Hello Jamie et. al.,  In all candor The Jane is suffering a bit from neglect. Iâve stayed at The Jane essentially since you opened and time does take a toll on things. This last stay was problematic.   First, the positive. Your staff remains exceptional! Front front desk, to bellhops and tidying crew, your staff is exceptional. There is something about the uniform and way they interact with guests - there simply isnât a greater team in a mid-range hotel group in New York.   Second, the less than positive. I stayed in room 353. The room next to mine must be individually;3
The Empire  Hotel's location is wonderful. Across the street from Lincoln Center, walking distance to  Central Park and to Broadway. The area is quiet and lovely during the day, lively in the evenings. It's also very close to ABC studios, so we were able to see a few talk show tapings - a fun, FREE thing to do in NYC if you can score the tickets! Also, the pub downstairs is great and there are other good restaurants all around.  Anyway, the hotel is a little tired but totally adequate. Small room and bathroom, nicely decorated but showing some wear. Ours was an inside room with an ugly inner courtyard view (i.e. big AC units and pipes) but street view was more $$, so we skipped it.;3
The location of the hotel was so easy to get to. We took the train from Newark airport to Penn Station which was no bother even with a pushchair. When we arrived at the hotel, the cot was not yet in the room but they promptly brought it to us. The room had only two small double beds so for a family of five. 2AD, 3CH (18,10 & 13weeks) it was a bit tight. The bathtub was very old and had been repainted and the paint was flaking making it look grubby but the water was hot. There were plenty of towels for the whole family but the complimentary shower gel and shampoos etc were not smoke for a party of our size. It was a good job we brought our own. The beds were comfortable and clean despite being in the small side and the staff were friendly enough. All in all it was just somewhere;3
The Jane was a fun adventure.  The room was as advertised, a clean cozy room with bunk beds.  The shared bathroom was clean and during our stay we never had to wait to shower.  Not a romantic getaway, but a perfect base for my son and I to visit city colleges.;3
We stayed at this hotel last year and the service has changed since last year. I have emailed the hotel and as yet have not had a reply. We ordered room service , was read back the order and when the order was delivered one item was missions. When we phoned room service we was told quite rudely that we hadn't ordered the item , I said I had and was told rudely again I could have the item delivered but have to pay room service again which I refused.we asked for the mini bar to be opened twice and it never happened.!! I booked the room on the Internet and booked a senior rate but was charged more on the final bill. The bar area was laid up early evening for meals so you don't feel comfortable having just a drink. It's a shame because last year we had a good time at this hotel. And;3
Weâve been staying at this hotel because of its convenient proximity to Lincoln Center. (Please see my previous reviews.) At our most recent stay, we were upgraded to a fairly large suite, with pleasant views of Lincoln Center. The bed was comfortable. The room was chilly and there was no heat. Temps were forecast to drop to the high 40âs. I telephoned reception and was told that an engineer would be up shortly. Some hours later, still no engineer, I telephoned reception again. This time I was told that the heat had already been shut off for the season, but they did send up a handy little electric heater. (One wonders why the first reception person did not have this knowledge.)   Wi-Fi worked fine and was included in the cost of the room. Thus, it is no longer necessary to;3
"We stayed here for a couple of nights over the weekend. The outside and hall is clean and ""hotel like"", we were very surprised. The room was also unexpectedly clean and tidy.  Considering the little amount we paid we were not expecting anything fantastic but the bathrooms were just disgusting and nothing can justify that! There are 2 shared bathrooms on every floor which is fine with us, but people are just disrespectful and dirty. After a  shower you felt like you needed another one.   Besides that, the hotel is very close to Times Square (10 minutes on the subway) and there is a great diner a couple of blocks down on Broadway for breakfast. We'd probably stay again but no shared bathroom this time!!";3
The hotel is in great location .Room was ok for the size for one person . My only complaint was the front desk people was  rude and not all there .;3
I won a 26 hour trip to NYC for a Foo Fighters Concert. The Hotel was only used for about 5-6 hours by us but in that time it seemed pretty nice. We were impressed by the atmosphere inside. It looked nice from the inside and not bad from the outside. For you starbucks people there is one next door. Very convienant for Lincoln Center and City Park. We went from Florida and were able to see the leaves changing, Awesome. There is a sub station very near so nice too. Beds were comfortable, nice flat screen, very dark unless you turned on a light, my view sucked and looked into an alley/ Just like everyone says very small bathrooms. No fans in them, and small rooms. Shower head was updated and it even had and extra cleaning feature for the women... if you needed that. Shampoo and;3
It's a nice hotel overall. Few annoying things the room keys deactivate everyday so after going in the really slow lift to your room you will have to go all the way back down again.  Most annoying thing was paying $200 for parking.... Standing at the desk waiting to have our room keys reset once again and a couple next to us checking in said they didn't want to pay for parking so the receptionist said she will remove the parking fee..... So we paid $200 they pay nothing??;3
Ok let's be honest and just say that the hotel is very basic and is in real need of a good repairman.    Now let's look at the positive....the room was clean, the staff was friendly, the hotel has good security, they do provide basic hygiene needs.     If you want to save money and you just want a room to sleep in because you plan on exploring during the day...this is not a bad room. It is in a bit of a run down side of town but never felt unsafe because it is very secure and the police presence is very high to insure safety. It's within a 2 mile walk to ground zero and overall I have no regrets staying here. If however you are someone looking for perfection then be realistic about what you can get at this price and go spend double the money someplace else because these people;3
We chose the Hollywood Hotel for its proximity to the attractions we wanted to see in LA, and most things around the Hollywood area are very easily accessible from the hotel.  The hotel itself is a little old but still pleasant. We received complimentary breakfast each morning during our stay and the staff were very helpful, especially Cinthya who gave us an early check-in following a long flight. Due to the tiled floors in the hallways every noise echoed around the hotel and could be easily heard in our room.  Unfortunately there was no extraction fan in the bathroom meaning it got very steamy and hot after a shower and the shower curtain was basically useless, causing shower water to spill out onto the bathroom floor making it slippery and unsafe. Not the best hotel we've;3
This is great hotel if you are attending Universal Studios. It is right behind the building. Otherwise it is a bit overpriced.  The front office folks are very nice and attentive. Rooms are average. The one are that needs attention is the breakfast options -- They are overpriced and really not much of a option at $20 / person.;3
We stayed here as part of a package with TUI and while the photos show it as quite glamorous,  the rooms and decor are a little dated.  We had booked a twin queen room,  but on arrival were shown to the smallest room I have ever seen with a single queen bed squeezed in.  Needless to say, we turned straight around and spoke to reception,  who confirmed we had in fact been booked into a queen room as per the request from TUI.  There was no problem upgrading and luckily they had a junior suite available, which is what we wanted in the first place.  I Can't fault the staff as they were always friendly and very helpful.    The location is very good and for first time New Yorkers like ourselves, wasn't too much of an assault on the senses.  We arrived late on the first day due to;3
"Fortunately or unfortunately we were only able to stay one night.  I realize this is New York City, but it is not an inexpensive place to stay.  When we arrived, we checked in and when we got to our room, it was the size of a closet.  One double bed, and barely room to walk around it.  I was also traveling with a dog for a show, which they knew ahead of time.  A ""potty area"" was set up in the basement for the dogs, and the front desk was very anxious to take my money to use it, but not so anxious to open the room when it closed at 10:00 p.m., which was rediculous.  They did give us a larger room, so I have to give them credit for that, but I'm not sure why anyone would think a room that small would suite double occupancy.  We had a family emergency and had to leave the hotel";3
"The bathroom looked like it hadn't been renovated since the 40s. The water pressure was nonexistent.  The ""queen sized bed"" was definitely more like a full sized bed. The rest of the furniture definitely looked dated and worn out.   The location was nice, however, and it was convenient to have a diner (albeit pricy even for New York) in the building.";3
This hotel is economically good and rooms are always available. It is also good for family stay. I would suggest if anybody have low budget. I stayed with my wife and my daughter and they also like it.;3
Was here for just one night in early February. Some plusses, some minuses.   This seems to be a rebranded Ramada Inn - in fact the area map they gave me still had Ramada on in, not Hollywood. The place had a very 1960s vibe architecturally, but without 1960s charm. Rooms overlooked the outdoor pool area, with a rectangular slice of the sky above. I liked that I could step out onto a patio from my room - what Minnesotans doesn't love that in February? - but there was no chair to sit on in order to enjoy the warm air.  Got a great rate, but the person who made my reservation didn't send me a confirmation. When I called and asked them to send it a few weeks later, they didn't. Not sure what the problem was, but when I called a third time, I just took the confirmation number over;3
We've just returned from our first visit to LA, and had booked 7 nights at the Hilton.  Reasons for booking: location (close to CityWalk) and the fact that it was a Hilton, a brand that has pleased us in the past.  However, we were dismayed when we saw our room: we had a view of the Freeway, and could hear the traffic in the room.  It was dark, small and poky, smelt of smoke and cleaning fluids.  We asked to move but the hotel was full, so front desk promised that they'd sort us out the next morning, which they did.  We were moved to a higher floor with a view of Universal, which was better.  The room was lighter and quieter.  The big issue with this hotel is the cleanliness of the rooms.  There were areas that had not seen a duster for a while, and the previous guest's hair was;3
"Stayed here for a week with my husband.   The bathroom was small and the shower flooded the bathroom, when we talked to to reception about this we were told ""it's supposed to do that"" which is obviously rubbish and it is just poorly designed. After just a few days we noticed a horrible smell of damp from the bathroom even though the room was cleaned daily.  The concierge was helpful but at times gave us the wrong information regarding the subway at the weekend. In my eyes a concierge should have good local information yet he didn't have a clue which services ran where at weekends and because of his information we got lost a couple of times.  The hotel is in a good location, times square is only 5 minutes away on the subway. The only downside to its location is there isn't much";3
Overall this hotel is very nice and clean and perfect if you want a place to stay between flights. I checked in after travelling for 15 hours and the lady checking me was uninviting and quite rude about paying an extra fee to check-in early, despite the fact I booked an overnight stay for only using the space for a day. I understand this was my wrongdoing but out of courtesy I thought as I made 300usd for a day use that she shouldn't charge me and early check in fee. The lady at the other counter butted in rudely. It was not inviting after travelling so long and I believe their customer service was poor. This made me not want to stay here again.;3
Hotel is in a great location. Near Penn Station and Subway system.  Ideal when you train into NY Penn.  Rooms vary in size from Small to reasonable.  Great Gym but you do pay for it in your bill but worth it if you travel.  I stay here often mainly due to the value and location compared to other hotels.;3
"This Art Deco classic is well maintained but is in need of some major up dating. Although clean, the color schemes are dated, the carpets are clean but are of a different era (or two). Function food for large crowds is passable, luke warm, ""10 seat round"" function tables are too small for 10 adults to sit and eat a full dinner. Good location close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.";3
We stayed at the empire hotel for Christmas. This was a late honeymoon for us and I had seen the hotel on the website and decided to go after reading mixed reviews. Yes, the rooms are small but its Manhatten, how long do you want to spend in your room? On the first night we did get a room that was next to some very noisy air con units outside but when we went down the next day they swapped us with no problem. The bar downstairs was very nice. The bar food we had was yummy. We didn't make it to the upstairs bar but I'm sure it was lovely. The location was brillant. Central park just a couple of blocks over, lincoln centre right next door and columbus circle was just brilliant. We were there for 3 days and managed to get pretty much everywhere by walking. Thats how good the;3
It's a good job there's so much to do in New York as it means spending less time in this hotel room.  It's was tiny.. It was loud, with a view of a brick wall.. The air con was loud though it was good.. The bathroom fan was loud.. And the tv.. Well I felt like I was back in the 90s.. It took up half the room..  Saying that.. I strangely kinda liked it.. It had character.. And the decor was green.. My fave colour.. The room was always clean, and made up, housekeeping did the best they could with it..   Our room was on second floor so could easily walk up the flight of steps to it when we eventually returned each day.. the lift seemed to take forever..   Handy to subway and cafes, crepes on Columbus is very good just a couple of blocks away, go there for a good breakfast.  Overall;3
I recently traveled to NYC with my husband and 2 of my children. We stayed at 3 hotels of similar price. The Paramount, The Empire and The Ameritania.   The Paramount was right in the middle of Times Square the the Theater District which made it extremely crowded and the room was cramped. The lobby was nice and the room was quiet with a city view. There was almost no room between the foot of the bed and the wall. After feeling cramped, we woke up to a bill for the resort fee of $27. No idea what was worth $27? The lobby?  The Empire Hotel has an amazing rooftop terrace and a small pool. It was the only one of the three with a pool, so it made a huge difference in entertainment/relaxing environment/and wow factor. There was a lot of staff and the lobby is amazing. The coolness;3
Hotel was in a great location, not far from Empire State and Macys. Inside hotel it was viable that they are still doing a lot of renovation work and some floors looked newer than others. Our room was tiny and very basic but to be honest it was clean and we were not in there that much to notice. The tick tock diner connected to the hotel offered amazing breakfasts, so would definitely recommend.;3
I booked this hotel because it was close to my friend's apartment and because I got a terrific rate. I always look for a couple of things when I am traveling: This had free wi-fi (sometimes maddeningly slow), a free hot breakfast, and the parking was only $22 a night (in LA it usually goes as high as $40). It also has a pool, which looked nice but the weather was too cold to use. The hotel is walking distance to a strip mall which had a drug store and a nice yogurt place (also a Staples). You can also walk to some fast food type restaurants. Checking in seemed to take forever, and I can't figure out why. Now, let's get to the specifics. The room was a box of decent size with no artwork of anything on the walls. A dresser, double bed, desk, chair, end tables, refrigerator,;3
I felt as if Hilton is becoming greedy with money versus quality of services and room type. the price for parking and price for room service is outrageous.  Very money hungry and I was not at all impressed this time around.  I stated last year and the prices and quality of all was much better.  I could not even get a two bedroom room;3
Nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Certain parts of the hotel including the rooms felt neglected. Drinks prices were expensive for the location and quality (personal opinion). Location is reasonable for access to all parts of Manhattan.;3
Abercorn House is not a luxurous place. But it isn't expensive either. For London standard it's cheap. Rooms are clean, bed was good. For the money you pay, is a very good place to stay. It's great value for your money. Location is fine, with the tube you are in Central London within 15 minutes.;3
We stayed here last summer for five nights.  Rooms were basic but very clean, no breakfast, although there are plenty of diners serving breakfast nearby.  Good location, close to subway.  Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly.  Ideal if you are looking for somewhere to rest your head at night.;3
"The decor is very nice, very Art Deco lots of gold and dark colors. Loved the lobby couches and tables. The check in was easy but there was only one person checking guest in and everyone in front of people was approaching the desk with some sort of problem/issue. I checked in very easy went straight to the room on the 2nd floor(No view at all/would not recommend). The room was small very tight but it's NYC no big deal. The room decor was also Art Deco very nice but had some wear & tear(peeling wallpaper, cracking paint on the bathroom door, small spaces were dusty & there was a spiderweb in room corner yikes). There was a small fridge in the room under the ""closet"" it contained a load of beverages but with NO price list. So I left it right there because after seeing the ""fresh";3
I decided to stay at the Jane because of the excellent location/price and because a friend had recommended the location to me. I stayed for six nights. Hands down, it's hard to find a better deal in Manhattan. Before I stayed, I called the hotel and spoke with the staff. Both times, they were very professional and friendly. The decor is vintage and cool, and although some people have complained about the SRO-era residents, I did not find any of them to be creepy or sketch during my stay. They pretty much mind their own business The problem isn't so much with the hotel or its staff, but really with some of the GUESTS who stay there, particularly on the weekends. During the weeknights, it was pretty quiet. I didn't think the halls reeked of cigarettes or anything like that. I;3
A little disappointed if Iâm honest , I know itâs an Art Deco hotel and from 1929 , the lobby looks fantastic , when u move to the lifts they look worn and old , everywhere look freshly painted but over the top of old paint , it all just looks well .. old and not in a good way ,  The room is 2 small for 2 beds and the beds are not double beds , we were only here 2 nights so I let it go , but I will be talking to our travel agent who booked it;3
No hot water from shower, old furnishings, indifferent staff. Not worth the high room rate. The room elevators looked like they would break down any moment. The location to Universal Studios and local businesses is good but otherwise try to avoid.;3
"Great location by Lincoln Center. Friendly and efficient staff.  Unfortunately, we had a very noisy room, both from the traffic and the air condition device. There was a good selection in the mini-bar but no glasses, only paper cups. We called the front desk who promised to send someone with proper glasses, then the guy comes with more paper cups, claiming that ""they just ran out of glasses"". I find that very hard to believe...";3
"The location is superb. Walk to everything we needed to do. Service is excellent, especially housekeeping. Hotel rooms need work. Pillows were comfortable bit beds hard and all three of us had body aches in morning. Rotting baseboards from not having a glass enclosed shower. No hot water for 2 out of 5 days.  Airconditioning low output. An elevator out of service long waits. Internet service was 12.95 a night, should be included at a ""luxury hotel"" was spotty and slow, had to log in multiple times. Free internet in lobby, seems cheap to charge in rooms. Expected better based on website.";3
I stayed in this hotel which is in north hollywood, in the month of january. The hotel was clean and quiet...the neighborhood is a little edgy but not undesirable for a stay at least in my opinion. The hotel room was large with basic furniture and the food was good. The carpet should be changed but overall i enjoyed my stay and you are close to places of interest..;3
Stayed here for 4 nights - Check in was fine, room on the 27th floor. Thought we would have a nice view. Opened the door - the room was the size of a shoe box - no view at all, we were facing a wall. Room was clean. We ate in the Tick Tock each morning and really enjoyed it. The location is perfect, right across the road from Penn Station and a few blocks from Port Authority, around the corner from Macys. Now I did have a few issues with the hotel - 1. The concierge was sooo rude - she spoke to me like I was a bold child when I enquired about an airport shuttle - our flight was not leaving till 8pm from Newark and she advised me that I would have to take a shuttle at 2.30 and when I explained to her that this was far too early for us she got up on her high horse and when my;3
The hotel is in an excellent location and not far from the subway or Times Square. 5 min walk to both. It really is in the middle of it all. The staff were really friendly and couldnât do enough for us. The place is clean and had everything we needed ie iron and board, hair dryer etc.   We booked a double room as we figured out we would not be in it much apart from sleeping, I say that tongue in cheek as the windows do not keep out the road noise and the air conditioning unit is like an aircrafts engine running, even when you turn it off you can hear next doors, Iâm a heavy sleeper and didnât sleep well at all, I would be pushing it for 4-5 hrs sleep a night due to this and when Iâm gone Iâm gone!!   Itâs hard to say whether I would recommend as the location and staff were great;3
I wanted somewhere to stay in Manhattan that was cheap but close to everything.  This place is perfect for that!  It's not a Hilton...but the room felt as cozy as any other hotel.  The building is old and seems to be mostly all original so it looks a lil run-down....but personally I like the old rustic look/feel.  The room was CLEAN and the sheets smelled and felt fresh, the room had a bed, fridge, sink, table, bed and TV....bathrooms are shared with others on the floor (but you use it privately - meaning not a locker room bathroom).  The location is awesome - 2 blocks from subway station, few blocks from central park, quiet and NICE neighborhood.  If you're travelling to NYC to be out of your room for most of your stay then this place is great!!!!  If you're looking for a;3
we left as the lobby bar is very active(we checked in on a monday) and the bar is the lobby pretty much--not a great thing for a woman and her 18 year old daughter. The bathroom had mold at the sink and the wall paper was peeling--we had a junior suite and I would not stay there again.No food after 10 unless you are in the bar and nothing between 10 am and 6 pm during the day.;3
It was a nice place to stay the Subway 1 2 and 3 stop is right in front go check out the brown Stones free parking since family live that way but you have to read the signs the parking garage is 35 a day plus tax we paid around 80 to park since parking is hard to find;3
"Stayed at the Days Hotel after a problem at another hotel during the UN Convention making New York incredibly expensive and almost all hotels sold-out. We eventually ended up paying a premium to stay here for 4 days and upon check-in we were upgraded by the friendly receptionist as we had paid ""a good price"" - which we took to mean too much!  Online we had booked an inside room via Orbitz, but were upgraded to the newly renovated room up on the 12th floor, which was comfortable, with flat screen television and newly installed shower, with showergel, shampoo and conditioner in the room on arrival and restocked when needed. Work was clearly underway on the 10th and 9th floors and on numerous occassions i shared the elevator with workmen, however our room was on a clean, newly";3
Description of Service. The only service offered by the hotel is laying of bed, change of towels. All services mentioned in the brochure were not there. No entertainment of any sorts. The public relation is not cordial.;3
This is the second time I have stayed at the Empire Hotel in New York for a business trip. Impressions this time around: Check in was a bit of wait. Not an efficient layout to wait either. The room is small. It's NYC so expected. Inner courtyard room is quiet but don't expect to put your shades up unless you like to expose yourself to the neighbours. Clean white crisp sheets and 3 pillows okay. Lighting in room & bathroom sufficient & more than other boutique hotels. Bathroom small & I'm a sm/med size.  If I was large, you would be uncomfortable and possibly stuck! I am insulted by the charge for everything ... Water (Fiji) is $7.50 and coffee with creamers in room is $3. I abhor nickel & dime per item. $300 inclusive a night should provide me with free in room coffee. The;3
"The Wyndham New Yorker is a great hotel to stay at if you haven't got a lot of time in New York. It is well located, close to the Subway and within walking distance of a lot of New York attractions. The accommodation is relatively basic, though tidy and clean. The ""resort fee"" charged by the hotel is excessive, given there are almost no resort features in the hotel.";3
Rooms are small but I guess you won't be in them long. The bathrooms are pretty good and plenty of shower gel etc and hairdryers. Staff are nice. I would say it is still pretty expensive given that the rooms are tiny. Location is excellent. Close to gay scene, hudson for running, highline, Whitney. In fact you can walk anywhere. Lots of good eating options near by.;3
"On arrival at the hotel, the grand foyer is lovely, unfortunately the check-in was not particularly friendly. Arriving at approx 1.30am, we were dealt with in a curt manner and no friendliness from the man. Rooms are very small and certainly not the photo that was shown in the Virgin Holidays images. As the room was just to sleep, we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall; this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view - no response was received. The elevator situation is main issue with the hotel - we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning. We chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up, returning to their";3
I stayed with my daughter in December. The receptionist and the guy in the lobby who books taxis to the airport were rude and unhelpful. Our room only had a view of the wall opposite but the beds were lovely. We got charged Â£20 a night for a facility fee for facilitates we didn't use (gym and office) which added an unplanned Â£100 to our five day stay. This is a rip off which had left me very angry as i had budgeted very carefully for this holiday.;3
There is always a possibility of the ac or heaters not working and having to deal with engineeringThe hotel is otherwise good and very well located for my trips. There was no coffee machine in my room and the front desk said thats the case for the first 3 floors cause the guests did not want to have them??Really!!!;3
We were looking for a hotel that was close to family that we were visiting in LA.  The Hollywood Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.  We had a room with 2 double beds, microwave, refrigerator, WiFi, and TV.  The beds were very comfortable. If possible, get an inside room.  We were on the street and it gets pretty noisy at night.  A hospital is very near by and the ambulances can get a bit noisy.  The daily hot breakfast was a delightful surprise! The hotel is just a brief walk to public transportation which we used several times.;3
Top location mid town where you want to be. The rooms are clean if not a little tired. If you ride the lifts you will notice a number of the floors have been turned over to some form of student hostel / university accommodation. Which whilst nothing against students seeing pad locked Room doors from  the lift is not what you expect from a 4  Star Hotel. Effectively not a 4 star hotel when compared to other 4 star hotels I have stayed in in New York it is cheaper than the others I have stayed in but not by much.  Overall good location and clean;3
I like this hotel for the security they provide to their guests. They will not allow you to use the elevator unless you show them the key card. However, this is quite old, my friend was not even impressed upon seeing my room. On my second day, the paint from the toilet bowl stripped off. I reported it to the housekkeping and it took them half day to remove it. I even beg the other lady if I could use other room for my number 2. Go here for the location, but there are other hotels around that is more modern and chic and cheaper.;3
I stayed at the Days Hotel for a couple of days on a business trip. Although the hotel looks a little oldish at first sight (and could do with some renovation indeed) it was actually rather quiet and comfortable.  Rooms are spacious and clean, and include standard amenities and a large safe. Bathroom as well, old but clean enough (the shower had a slight tendency to pulse hot and cold water though). The neighbourhood is safe and there is a subway station (96th street) conveniently located one block away. There are also many restaurant to choose from for dinner in the area. On the downside, as mentionned in an earlier review, the heating system can be a little noisy at night, and their free wifi was pretty weak (a real struggle to make video calls). Overall, the hotel is quite;3
"Went to NYC to visit our Aunt. She lives extremely close to the Empire Hotel and she was paying so she decided on this hotel.  The first room we were assigned Aunt said was too small for us (she was staying at her apartment and not at the hotel) so we moved to a larger room which was better and over looked Broadway and 63rd.  The hotel is way too dark the elevators slow, cable tv ok,  and there are some upgrades needed especially in the bathrooms, tiles chipped and shower leaked. not too much storage space.  Also I thought this was weird, the hook on the back of the bathroom door was so high I couldn't reach it (I'm 5ft2"") that has never happened before.   Overall it was a good hotel to crash in after hectic long days of sightseeing, location was great, with an awesome fruit";3
It's a decent hotel and relatively cheap for NYC. I found a great deal in booking.com and booked it. Spacious room but very cold. The radiator did some noise all the time. Water in the bathroom was leaking. General service is ok and the people are very gentle.;3
"Other than the fact that there was no bell service, the staff at this hotel were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel room itself was OK. Very small sink so it was hard for 2 females to get ready at the same time. The bed was stiff, but better than lumpy. The heating unit was atrocious. You pretty much burned your hand off trying to change the temperature, which you had to do often. Basically, there was no temperature control so you either froze or sweated your butt off. The hotel has a rooftop bar, which is NOT associated with the hotel. Common misconception of many guests. Do NOT go to this bar unless you are a 21 year old looking for a dance club and a hook-up. Very shady people going in and out of there. Wouldn't doubt if they deal drugs from their ""office."" Location";3
Firstly the positives. Beds comfy and pillowâs comfy. Good location for sights. Thatâs about it.   Room is tiny. Really not big enough for a family of 4. I slept in bed closest to the window and there was a cold draft. Noisy ( I know that I should expect noise from the streets as in central Manhattan) shouldnât really be subjected to hearing next door flush their toilet or turn their taps on and off.    For a family the room is just not big enough so if there are more than two people in your party donât consider this.  Homeless people loitering outside   With some investment it could be really lovely but itâs shabby and dated. My daughter said she felt like she was in the Hollywood Tower of Terror.;3
I stayed here recently with my daughter. Check in was good, staff were very pleasant and welcoming. Our room was a Queen room on the 23rd floor. It was small but appeared clean and as we didn't intend to be in it very much, we were happy with it. We went out for dinner and then decided to have an early night as jet lag overcame us.  We had been asleep for about 15minutes when we were woken by a very loud noise which was ongoing, sounded like a large amount of water pouring onto the wall of the room. I have never heard such a loud noise in a hotel room from something outside of my room. We decided that we couldn't tolerate it, phoned reception and were allocated another room on the 29th floor. We weren't particularly happy at having to repack and move but had no other option. The;3
On arriving at the New Yorker Hotel my initial thoughts was WOW ... check in was quick staff friendly .. we was on floor 22 in a room with no view and very drafty windows ... I had to put 3 pillows at the bottom of the window to stop the draft . The rooms decor was dated but clean the cleaners do a good job.  Tick tock diner was good n staff friendly not cheap to dine but then no where in NYC is cheap to eat . same as the  Italian with in the hotel.  The hotel is central and a good base to stay in the city. Wld I recommend this hotel  ... yes the only gripe was the windows .. We booked with booking.com n paid for the hidden charges as a whole price and was cheaper so we wasn't stung with hidden add ons.;3
We were very disappointed with this hotel. It was not a hotel but a motel.  The room we stayed in was very small, the bathroom needed decorating. There were no catering facilities. Had to go out for anything to eat or drink.;3
Room standard lower than expectedFirst room really low standard and was able to change room after compleiningService/facilities moderate for the priceNo breakfast included in room priceGood location near Central Park and metro.;3
I booked last minute through a discount site after other plans fell apart. The New Yorker offers easy access to Penn Station, Madison Garden, Macys and tons of great restaurants. The property is best for families, groups, International travelers and couples on a budget stay. Hipsters and party seekers might choose something else as this property has a strict no-smoking policy (including vape pens). Housekeeping was very nice, attentive and the hotel was clean. I would stay again if seeking a quick stay in the city.;3
We were nervous after some of the more dour reviews and had low expectations when we arrived.  We found the room in need of some minor repairs but clean overall.  The room was quiet, comfortable and met our needs.  The staff was great and accommodating.  Reservations, check in and check out were a breeze.   The apartments were 1/2 block off the subway and within walking distance to great pizza and two great groceries. For the price we paid, we couldn't have asked for a nicer, better situated room.  If you come expecting a modest, city style apartment and don't need luxury, then Woogo Central Park really fits the bill. Thanks Woogo.;3
Nice place for those that are not claustrophobic, or those that  don't like bright rooms. It was kind of what i expected of new york small room. we had 2 double beds no room to swing a cat. & we had 4 people all with luggage. Nearly checked out after 7 min after experiencing 10 - 12 people squeezing into lift which is for 8 maximum.Tagain claustrophobic i got off every time more than 6 people got in as you can imagine it took me time to get to my detination The pool is very small lap pool the reason we booked was because of pool and picture of pool roof area.. what a mistake -I wanted to escape the darkness but  you can't take your own food or drink onto the roof area. paid $20 for a gin & tonic.decent walk up to the roof area after leaving the lift. lobby area again dark, 3 of;3
I have stayed at the Hyatt Place and Marriott courtyard, both very similar to this hotel but both I would say are better than the Hyatt regency so next time I go out I will be going to one of those instead.;3
Was a bit disappointed with the hotel, it is a nice retro style hotel but room was quite small really, bigger downside was the complete lack of basics in the room, not kettle to be able to make drinks in the morning, you either had to pay for expensive hotel coffee or go out and get coffee from cafes close by, also had an issue with the Wifi use when they tried charging almost $50 for use as when logging on is not very clear on the free version and the pay version.  Having said all this the hotel is in a good location, I would use it again if the price was right. Madison Square Garden is on the doorstep of the hotel and Times square just a 15 min ish walk away.;3
I always give honest reviews and was a little disappointed with this hotel.  Start with the negative  We stayed 4 nights in one of the cheaper rooms, well it must have been as the view was another hotel window on 33rd floor.  The room was tiny and the bottles of water they put were double the price of the 7eleven across the road loud roadworks could be heard as the windows didnât close properly  The lifts were hit and miss it took 15mins to get to reception Saturday morning as the full lift stopped on every floor down to 21 then went up again so annoying.  Plus points  Location was excellent and felt safe as security wouldnât let you up without a door card How water bath and shower were ok.  The diner attached was top class see my Tick Tock review  Most importantly the bed and;3
"The location on Broadway across from Lincoln Center is hard to beat.  The staff was nice and courteous.  Our first room was so small it was hard to get around the bed because there was not enough space to get suitcases out of the way.  The ""closet"" was an alcove about 18 inches wide.  Due to a fridge and a room safe, there was not enough vertical space for my wife to hang her dress without it dragging on the safe and fridge.  We got a larger room for $50.00 per night more.  It had a wet bar and a little lounge area but no dresser.  The closet was higher and about 6 inches wider.  There was no dresser or shelf in the closet.  I asked for a dresser and was told there was a shelf in the closet.  I told the desk person there was no shelf; she insisted there was, saying she had seen";3
On arrivel were given a room on the second floor which was small old and not clean.When when i told the man at the front desk that we booked a room which had free wifi and was bigger then the room we received he was rude and insisted that it was our room. The next day the lady at the front desk did change the room when we asked. we received a room on the ninth floo which was bigger but there were days when we had no hot water .The area is very good near the train and one can find supermarkets  near by. We paid extra for the fridge. The hotel is undergoing renervation at the moment. if you are  young and looking for a place to sleep this could suit you but on the whole i would not recomend this hotel.;3
Ideal location, but overpriced, and some staff dishonest. Most I should say weâre very pleasant. But checkin clerk told us there was a $10 fee for WiFi, one off. This turned out to be Every day so we paid 50 instead of 10. After the cost of this hotel, itâs simply dishonest. The $45 dollar a day retainer also seems a little high also, although you do get this back minus the charges.  Would we stay again? Likely not! The hotels dated, but filled with history so whilst the corridors look like something from the The Shining, itâs actually tolerable.;3
Hilton HHonors Diamond and Gold beware:  If you arrive on a weekend you will not get an upgrade to an HHonors floor and get no free appetizers at bar as you would on a weekday!!! Bad show by management Next, be prepared for loooooong waits at the elevators especially on weekends. 15 minutes is common. Bellmen are allowed to use the same elevators as passengers making it even slower.  Not a sign of a well-run hotel.  The buffet almost completely blocks the hallway leading to the parking garage.  Do not eat that food as I saw people sticking their hands in. Room is ok, not large.  Amenities sparse.;3
Disappointed in the room - too small and outdated.  Disappointed in the rooftop - first night was not allowed to use it or even enter it to take a look or see the view.   The 2nd night saw what a joke the pool is.  It's the size of 2 bathtubs linked together.  I am guessing around 3x10 feet!   Seriously.   Disappointed in the wifi.  Seriously, no free wifi?   On the plus side, it was across the street from my convention at Fordham and across from Lincoln Center.;3
I was notified that the check in time was pushed back by one hour only once I arrived and tried to check in. The hotel refused to watch my luggage for free despite giving me my room late. Then I bought a late check out and the room cards deactivated at the original time. I had to go down to the lobby and wait in line to have the cards reactivated, preventing me from gathering my belongings and getting to the airport on time.;3
The great thing about this hotel is the place. The design in the lobby and hallways are exclusive, all though the room I spent the night had water damages in the bathroom and the hair dryer did not work. Nothing is included in the price, not Even water!  Pool was close due to maintenance. Staff was very service minded though!;3
"The hotel is a little better than I expected after reading all the reviews here.  The room is not big, but not too small for 2 persons with a king size bed. The decoration is up-dated and pleasant.  The bathroom is ""surprisingly"" big with good shampoo and lotion supplies.  We asked for a room with a ""park view.""  The hotel staff was nice and granted our wish.  Since the window faces the East, it can get quite hot in the morning and it is difficult to see anything out of the window with the shining sun.  It rained the last day and I could finally see what's outside through the dirty window.  The view was nice with a lot of trees (and nothing else).  Also facing the street can be very noisy with traffic and occasional sirens.  We encountered two staff, both are nice and friendly.";3
"Overall the service, room, restaurants and location were great. I only give the hotel an ""Average"" rating due to the beds. My wife and I received a room with 2 twin beds, no problem. The problem was that not one, but both beds had mattresses that were totally broken down, making sleeping uncomfortable. Both mattresses seems to have a metal band going around the perimeter, but as soon as you sat on the bed you almost sunk to the floor. Fortunately, we only stayed 2 nights, but those were some long nights. Not what I normally expect from a Wyndam property...The rooms are also small, but we did not spend too much time in the room, so that did not matter to us.";3
This was our first holiday to the states, the hotel room was really small not big enough for three adults, Staff not very helpful it was the wife's Birthday when we were there front desk staff said they would send a bottle of champagne to the room, before we went on the holiday we sent about 4 emails asking for some info I even asked about organising a birthday cake but we had no response from hotel. The only guy that replyed was John on the transportation desk he organised a car to pick us from the airport and then he got us back to th airport, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone,;3
We booked our room because if the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor, but the experience did not match the 5 star reviews that s many people left. This hotel is 3 stars maximum and one of the stars are for value. But the truth is I would pay more in the future than stay here another time. The room as others mentioned was tiny. There is no closet and room for only one side table with a light, which might not be the end of the world, but when only one of you is ready to go to bed and itâs the person w the light, itâs not ideal. The drab brown colors in the room felt depressing and our view consisted of looking at another building. Also depressing. Though we didnât hear city noise since we didnât face the city, we did hear the sound of an air shaft. Unfortunately the guests before;3
Due to the terrible weather the East Coast experienced this past weekend on Dec. 5-7, I was unable to fly in on Friday as scheduled. The hotel staff were friendly and cooperative when I asked to waive the Friday night fee of $160. The hallways are narrow, it looks quite old due to normal wear and tear, elevators are slow, cramped, & need to be renovated, but the bed was surprsingly comfortable and the bathroom was surprisingly CLEAN- sufficient for sleeping in. Showerhead had good water pressure and warm temperature, no leaks at all. However, the room was supposed to be a nonsmoking room- but when I first walked in, it *REEKED* of cigarette smoke, which made me CHOKE and GAG!!! All they did was hide the ash tray into the desk's drawer. It was relatively quiet, so I actually got;3
This hotel was ideally located on Broadway a few blocks down from Columbia University where our daughter was studying-the purpose of our visit. It is right next to a subway station so ideal for touristy visits to downtown Manhatton. The staff are very friendly and helpful but the hotel is very dated and our initial room very small. Wi-fi is supposedly available in the rooms but we were unable to access it-which meant a trip to the lobby where it was available. When we eventually complained we were moved to a bigger and better room-we should have complained earlier! We then noticed a number of residents complaining about lack of wi-fi and they were also offered a move.;3
I reserved a standard queen room on Expedia for $190/night. The website notes that these are queen beds, but our room wasn't even large enough to fit a queen bed. Instead we had a full size bed and a bathroom where you could barely open the door. I've stayed in NYC plenty of times and have never paid so much for such a small space with a view of the interior building furnace.   The good news is the location is good and staff was friendly. However, this room should have been further discounted because it is about half the size of their normal queen rooms and didn't include a queen bed. Maybe this hotel simply stiffs Expedia travelers. That would be pretty terrible if that is the case.   I will not stay at this hotel again. There are plenty other places with friendly staff, nice;3
I stayed a week at the Riverside Studios at the end of last summer, and the least I can say is that my first impression was rather negative. The pictures on the website are incredibly deceiving and give the impression of a real gem at the door of Manhattan.  Well, let's make it clear, it doesn't look anything like the website. Oh well, maybe the outside entrance does, in some way... Kind of...  Once inside, I was quite taken aback by the apparent bad temper of the giant at the check in. Rather impressive, unpleasant and making you feel rather unconfortable. It all relaxed quickly though, after agreeing on some imbroglio on my booking.  Next surprise, the room lock didn't work, and we therefore had to wait for the housekeeper to fiddle around with grease and a flourish of tools;3
During my stay it was high season and the room costed +500$ a night, as metropole hotelroom prices yield. So in this case I must considerer price-value more conciously as ever before. LOCATION-LOCATION-LOCATION and well cleaned!  Furthermore: the hotel is poorly maintaned and service is very unpersonal;3
It seems upscale but the food is crazy expensive and the staff Atleast at the front desk is pretty rude. There is a shuttle that runs to and from universal city walk, but itâs hit or miss on a schedule. If u want to get to universal studios early just walk. Itâs a super easy and fast walk. Donât rely on the shuttle. The rooms are clean. But the isnât anything I can say other that is fine. Just fine. You wonât be disappointed if u use self parking and donât expect to eat there and donât have any customer service expectations. Then itâs fine.;3
Had to stay here for business. what a waste, should have stayed at the sheraton next door if it wasnt under construction. ordered breakfast, french toast came back UNCOOKED...dripping with egg. ordered nachos at the bar downstairs and it came with unmelted kraft slices, disgusting. the bar servers were so nice that i just felt bad. there was maybe one person max at the front desk which is ridiculous, much less another person standing at the hilton honors desk area. if you  have to stay here the rooms are fine but don't go around looking for top notch service...;3
The Empire Hotel is beautiful hotel. The designer boutique style hotel is located in the heart of Lincoln Center. If you like classical music, ballet, opera and art cinema-Lincoln Center is the place for you and your family. Just a short walk over to Central Park and some great restaurants in the area.  If you are a light sleeper I  donât recommend this hotel. The windows in the hotel are outdated and you can hear everything outside.;3
I visited London with my girlfriend in May, because we went to see my favourite band American Football. We stayed in Abrecorn house for 4 days. It's located in a calm area, although when we stayed there, they happened to be constructing a building next to the hostel, so it was very noisy (we were in the centre most of the time during the day, so it didn't bother us, except in the morning). We rented a double room with shared bathroom in the second floor. We had three kitchens, wto toilets and showers available within a few metres. They were kept clean in our floor, but we checked other floors and they weren't kept as clean. Our room was tidy though and we had no complaints (it had a big drawer and a fridge). Kitchens are well equiped and reasonably clean (one of the kitchens on;3
My company was in town for the dental conference and we booked 4-night stay for four employees at the normal price ( many people staying in that hotel got our rooms for cheaper ). Not only were the rooms very small, almost closet sized space but when I went to front desk to ask for a double bed room or an upgrade. The management and front staff were the worst. Now I know never to use this hotel to book my employees ever again. Thank you for the bad experience.;3
We stayed there three nights in July on a trip from UK, and loved it. So much so we booked in for another 2 nights at the end of our holiday. Then we had big problems. The hotel has a nightclub with young trendies turning up in numbers. They employ two very  large thugs in suits as doormen. My girlfriend tried to get to the bar for some ice and one of these gorillas told her to get out. When she said we were paying $250 a night to stay there he told her he didn`t care. She then went to have a cigarette outside on the stairs to calm down and the other thug shouted at her to move. When she again said she was a resident he said he didn`t care. She returned to the room in tears and I remonstrated with reception.  Although they were sympathetic, it is obvious the night club set up is;3
This is a great hotel for someone who is travelling alone, because the rooms (the majority if not all) are for one. Great location in greenwich just below 14th street, the staff very nice, and for New York, great price. I recommend it to anyone travelling by themselves.;3
"Although the hotel itself is nice and offers a great location, please beware of the pricing ""bait and switch"" where your reservation price is not honored upon your arrival and they present you with a ""rate increase"" at the front desk far too late to do anything about.  AC didn't work and toilet overflowed.  Not a good representation of a Hilton Hotel of this expected caliber.";3
We stayed here after arriving in NYC from Penn station so location was great. However the check in took about 30 mins only two staff on and even though there was a big queue no more more staff were allocated to the reception. It was 23:30 and we were tired so not a good start. The room was very small even by New York standards so good job we were only staying one night. If you stay here you will need ear plugs for the street noise. There is a 24 hour diner on site as well as an Italian restaurant. We had breakfast in the diner which was good and reasonable. Check out was also slow with a queue so the concierge ended up checking me out.  I was looking forward to staying in this iconic hotel but felt a bit disappointed by the experience.;3
This hotel is in a fabulous location, close to Penn station and tube lines and close to Empire State Building. Down sides were that it was extremely busy which led to queues to check in, queues for lifts (today one bank of elevators broke down). We were upgraded to an outer room with windows (didnât know you could end up in a room with no windows so watch out for that!).  There were 3 of us sharing and it was a tight fit. No fridge, TV signal not great, and shower wasnât great.;3
We found this hotel in a great position, rooms were newly renovated and clean. Overall the hotel is very good. I would have given a extra point if the reception staff had not have been so cold, indifferent and unhelpful.;3
"I have to say that if it wasn't for the credit card problem (deposit) (the hotel charged me for something I did not drink; asked for a refund and they refunded me) I'd have given a higher grade to this hotel. It is well located, staff was friendly and helpful (especially a blonde girl who works at the concierge). Rooms are small but since I was solo, it was ok. When I first checked in they put me in a noisy room, complained and they changed me. But I have to say that mistakes like charge a guest for something he did NOT drink, eat, etc is not acceptable, specilly when you check out and they tell you: you are clear to go.";3
I stayed in a Queen room with a view and the room was reasonably sized however quite dated and the bathroom had aged and needed some attention.   Half way through the holiday I turned on the bath tub tap and brown water was coming out of it. I called reception and his response was to let it run for fifteen minutes and see what happens. Throughout the holiday the water was not totally clear but was not as bad as it was when it first happened. However I felt that the staff member was not approachable to solve the matter.   The maids were very good throughout the stay. And every staff member on our floor (29) would say morning to you and have a good day which was nice.   The elevators are very very very slow!! You could be waiting up to five minutes in reception and then when in;3
small room,great tv,great bathroom..great location if going to Lincoln Center..however they do charge for coffee in the room..coffee machine in room but they charge!!! front desk very friendly..staff also very helpful;3
The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is across the road from the Lincoln Centre and  within walking distance of Columbus Circus, Central Park and other attractions. There is a Starbucks directly below - which is just as well because the restaurant is very tired and tatty and breakfast is expensive and disappointing. There was also a good choice of restaurants immediately to hand. We loved The Smith. My daughter and I stayed at the Empire the week before Christmas, but it must have been the only hotel in NYC which had not one single Christmas decoration up. What does that say about the hotel and its management? Shame. The room was very small, but adequate. The bathrooom likewise. Liked the L'Occitane amenities though.It was variable as to what we got every day in;3
We chose this Hilton so that we could walk to Universal Studios which we did. We upgraded to an alcove executive room which was spacious.  We did have to call twice to get robes which should have been in the room and they did not replenish the amenities we used the first night.  One of the window seals was gone so we had wind noise for about 12 hours during our stay.  They did have duct tape but it was coming off.  It also took about 10 minutes to get hot water in the shower.  There is no Executive Lounge which surprised us since we thought that was what booking an Executive room is all about.  The elevators were not all working which caused many delays going up and down to the top floors.  We did get coupons for continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  We tried to let;3
Very disappointing start to my birthday celebration - my sister and I were put in a really pokey room, not much bigger than a cupboard, couldn't even put our suitcases down to unpack them!  Even the door to the room was smaller than the rest along the corridor.  The dÃ©cor was very dark and dreary, as in fact, was the rest of the hotel.  Very gloomy.  Evidently the room was booked by The Flight Centre thru Gullivers Travel hence the tatty room.  They evidently book the cheapest rooms in all the hotels.  So make sure you don't get a room booked by them thru your agent!  Fortunately, the hotel eventually upgraded us to a larger room on 11th floor for the rest of our stay, but on the whole, did not find the hotel particularly good at all.  They could not even tell us the rate of Tax;3
We paid a lot to stay here and I was disappointed with the size of the room. The bathroom was certainly 2 star. The bed was lovely to sleep in, there was a lot of noise from the street and from other hotel guests. The staff were nice a friendly and the place was very tidy. We had no view to speak of but the hotel is in a prime spot for touring.;3
Advertised as a boutique in midtown? Nice location for tourists and to get around. Booked through their site. Two beds on the 8th floor. Unbelievably small bathroom. not enough room to turn around. Staff courteous. Worst restaurants in midtown stay away!!!!! just not above average in any way. Price was in line with NYC but very few amenities. would not stay there again. The view was an airshaft.;3
My husband and I stayed here for 4 days. It was around the corner from subway and short walk to Central Park. We did have to change rooms after the first night because of the loud noise coming from the scaffolding that seems to be on almost every building. Usually wouldn't bother me but it was literally outside our window. They were nice about the room change and gave us an interior room. Nothing special about the hotel as far as amenities go but we just needed a clean place to sleep at night and this place did the trick.;3
I want to give 4 stars, the location was brilliant minutes away from Central Park and Columbus circle. Door staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms it self are small, really small but itâs NYC..... the room had every thing you would need but was tired and could do with updating and there was no air being circulated in the room;3
"We stayed several days at this hotel in February 2013. First, be forewarned that photos on the hotelâs web site make the hotel look much better than it actually is, although I can of course see the point in hiring a good photographer.  We both thought that whoever was hired to decorate missed the boat. For example, the lobby: it is a tall and narrow space; its African motif (and tacky furniture) might have worked had the walls been painted in light shades (and perhaps by adding large mirrors). Instead, everything is done in severely dark tones, rendering the already narrow space appear even narrower. The lobbyâs lighting is very poor even at midday, so that even just reading the newspaper or a map is a challenge. And there is annoying music playing nonstop. In short, the";3
This hotel is right across from Universal. If you are going to the park it's perfect. You can walk to the park or the hotel has a shuttle. We walked and it took a little less than 10 minutes. The staff at the hotel were all very nice. Check in and out was easy. I requested a higher room floor prior to getting there and we got a room on 9th floor corner which had great view of the city and universal. The rooms aren't too bad, but the hotel itself needs an upgrade. Kinda outdated. The beds were soft and the room was clean. The elevators are slow, but I think they are addressing this.  There is a restaurant on site. The breakfast buffet was good. Had plenty to chose from. Staff is nice there. Our breakfast was included so not sure on the price.  The dinner menu is expensive. The;3
My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights at the hotel in June 2004. It was our first time in New York and even though we loved the city, the hotel didn't impress us very much.   Negative points: - It is very basic and needs remodernising - The lifts felt very unsafe when travelling up to our floor - The bathroom was old and not very nice. - It is on 94th street which is too far away from all the attractions  Good points: - Huge king size bed - Nice staff - Internet access charged by the minute, which was very handy - They allowed us to keep our bags in a room when we checked out free of charge  When visiting NY again, we won't be staying at the Quality Hotel.;3
First of all, this hotel is worth it just because of the location! Subway station with lines 1, 2 and 3 in just one block is just what you need. Basically in New York you don't even need to be in the city center to have easy access to places - it is more important to be near a subway station. The hotel looks old-ish inside, but who cares! The elevators really are as slow and at times difficult to get into with all the other guests waiting, but that doesn't really matter. The city is so hectic anyway, so we didn't mind the waits by the elevators. Also the wifi was really slow in the evening when everyone else was also using it, but who needs internet when there is so much to see in the city! However, the bed was comfy, the bathroom is spacious and clean, and the room was cleaned;3
Four hour delay in finding me a room, despite reservations made a month prior.  They did upgrade me to a larger room. Shower leaked and flooded bathroom, even after they supposedly repaired it.  Otherwise nice room, good maid service.;3
First, the posotives:  This is a beautiful hotel, within walking distance to Universal Studios. Our room was very nice, clean, and had a nice view. We stayed on the executive floor and I have no idea why we paid extra for this. The first night we had a small plate left in our room with a couple of pieces of small fruit and a chocolate. Otherwise, there didn't seem to be any amenity associated with our room.  Check in was a nightmare! We waited at least 30 minutes in line to check in and then it took the staff 20 minutes to handle the check in process. The associate was nice, but just seemed to make the process MUCH harder and longer than necessary  This was happening to everyone, hence the 30 minute wait. Our reservations had been made in advance and reconfirmed the previous;3
I've stayed here many times and been pleased with it. There are quite a new faces in the lobby and at reception... and not as friendly as the previous staff. $325 before taxes is veering towards to low value for money. As the Jane was fully booked, I stayed at The Maritime for my last 2 nights and it was only a bit more expensive for a much bigger and lighter room.  CafÃ© Gitane (tenant) is the big let down. Faux french, indifferent smug service from people that are a bit pleased with themselves (and have no right to be). It's one of those places that I find irritating on contact, and instead I go to one of the many wonderful restaurants in the neighbourhood. The breakfast is sub-standard and no refills on coffee is a no go. It's a lovely room, but it's an odd fit in the hotel.;3
There seemed to be a lot of negative reviews of this hotel so I dreaded what we would find when we arrived for our holiday in New York. However, we were pleasantly surprised. This may not be the best hotel in the world but for what you pay, I think you get a reasonably good deal.   The hotel is situated on the West side of Central Park in upper Manhattan, in an area that is a little insalubrious at night. However, we had no problems and even coming home late at night, everything was very quiet and we never felt afraid.  The hotel, has the normal features - a lobby, reception, a bellboy/man, a basement area where you can access the internet, get complimentary tea and coffee from a machine and go to the toilet.   Our room was satisfactory. It was clean, provided a tv with many;3
This a a completely adequate but not at all special hotel.  I attended a conference at the hotel, so it was very convenient, but the decor could definitely use an update - it looks like the lobby and cafe were done in the mid 80s.  Rooms were large, clean and reasonably well appointed.  Room service was prompt and decent quality, with a reasonable selection.  Easy-to-use internet access in the rooms, although it was down for the whole hotel for 3 hours during my stay - very inconvenient!  I also had a snafu with messages in which a message was not delivered to me because I recieved two messages from people with the same name and the desk clerk assumed it was a duplicate.  If style and service are important to you - I might consider looking elsewhere.  If you're looking for a;3
We were two couples visiting NYC after a Caribbean cruise and chose the Empire because of the price point and location.  The hotel is suited close to Lincoln Center and easy access to performing arts that the Met has to offer, literally steps away and across the street.  Columbus Circle is just down the street and Central Park close by too.  The hotel has seen better days and although renovations are underway there are some tired looking areas.  We arrived ahead of registration and the hotel staff offered to store our bags until the room was ready.  Our friends room was ready so we stored our bags in their room and headed out to explore NYC in sub-zero temperatures that hit the city recently.  After a full day of touristing we returned late to the hotel and stayed in room 1041.;3
Great breakfast to start your day is a plus. Hugo, the chef, is very friendly and helpful. Great asset to the hotel. Unfortunately the internet connection is not always functioning, although there is internet all throughout the hotel.;3
I struggled with the overall rating to give this hotel.  Maybe 3 1/2 would make me feel better.  First, we did not arrange nor pay for this one night stay.  We were guests of an art seller that invited us to NYC to see a particular studio.  Our room was not yet ready when we arrived before usual check in time, so they took our phone number and promised a text when the room was ready.  We walked next door and had a bite for lunch and returned, at usual check in time an hour later, to find our room ready (did not receive a text).  The front desk staff were polite and pleasant.  Our room, a two bed corner room, was larger than expected for NYC.  The entire hotel is somewhat dark, art-deco-ish, which I actually liked, but we needed to have both window blinds wide open during the day;3
3 nites, Tuesday - Friday.  Pretty busy with tourists, weddings, conferences.  Easy walk to the park, easy Uber to Hollywood.  We booked thru hotels.com but are Honors members.  Were given an accessible room on the 4th floor.  Lobby is 3rd floor.  There are several conference rooms on the 4th floor and we had to deal with setup noise starting at 6:30a.  Next time we'll eat at Burbank airport as there' a lot of selection.  The Hilton is pretty limited and pretty slow for lunch.;3
We chose the Empire because we were looking for something different from the usual chain hotel and what we thought would be authentic twenties style New York. We based our choice on the recommendation of British Airways, and info. from the Empire's site. The decor is pseudo art dÃ©co and the main lobby a bit somber, so not to everyone's taste. What's really a pity is that this atmosphere is destroyed by the loud boom boom of pop music as you enter.  Positive Points: *The situation: very near Central Park and within walking distance of Mid Town. *We specifically requested rooms around the sixth floor overlooking Dante Park and were not disappointed. The view of Lincoln Center at night is great. *The receptionist on arrival was polite and helpful. *I suppose because there had been;3
Had this hotel booked for us by an agent who knew it was a special trip for us so we were disappointed, Location is great, an easy walk from Times Square and just across the road from Central Park.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  BUT it is tired and the decor is so dark it is not a place you want to spend time in.  Bedroom furniture was on last legs, paintwork was in poor shape and bathroom adequate - just- poorly equipped and badly lit, no plug in sink!  AC unit noisy and innefficient.;3
I'm really torn about my experience at The Jane.  First impressions were great. We arrived very very early and hoped to drop off our bags and they actually allowed us to check in. Jose helped us with our bags and the doormen/bellmen were great throughout my stay. The room was tiny but anyone who read reviews ahead of time would be prepared for that. The room was cute, the bed was comfortable enough, and there were some great details - tv at the end of each bed, slippers and a robe for the bathroom. The bathroom was kept clean and besides a few times when I had to wait for a stall, it wasn't an inconvenience sharing a bathroom.  The area was also great - easy to get to the subway and easy access to other places by cab.  The negatives: the room was freezing. There is an A/C unit;3
In room, there are snacks and beverages are expensive. No need leave there in rooms.  Should be in gift shop rather than room. Outside MM candy cost 99 cents compare your hotel $6.00.  12 oz water cost $5.00 compare 12 bottles cost $3.99.;3
We have stayed at the hotel in the past and had a wonderful experience. This recent stay was disappointing to say the least. The room looked tired. The street noise was so awful (3:26 A.M. to around 5:45 A.M) that sleep was elusive. It was actually quieter during the daytime. The staff is courteous. Parking with the valet was a pleasure. The place is clean. The location is ideal.;3
Excellent room. wides halls and reception. Location is not good. Neighborhood looks like so danger at night. Front desk people is not kind. Restaurant employees have hurry. I think the customer service will improve a lot of.;3
The hotel met our requirements due to its cost, location and what was included. Stay here to escape the hustle and bustle of downtown Hollywood which is only 4 stops away by train, which you can catch close to the hotel.  The purpose of our trip was for sightseeing, and therefore were away from the hotel most of the time, but that said when we woke we enjoyed breakfast (although there could be more variety which is not down to the staff Hugo and Maria who are working with the food they are given available to them), and always returned to a clean and made up room.  The staff were always pleasant and knowledgeable and were on hand to answer any of our questions.   Our only regret is not to make more use of the pool.;3
My boyfriend and i stayed at astor on the park for 4 nights, my first visit to new york for my 30th birthday. Having read good and bad reviews we like most were worried about what to expect on our arrival. On checking in staff were friendly and helped us upstairs with our bags, we had room 407 so had a park view room was small but very clean and bed so comfortable bathroom very modern and clean. We used the subway lots during our stay two nearby on 103rd and 110th and even used it late at night to get home and felt very safe this is a very cheap mode of transport as you will always have other things to spend your dollars on!!!! And taxis can be very expensive. We had an amazing time in nyc and astor on the park is just the ticket and such good value, yes the radiators are the;3
My family and I stayed at this property, July 7-10, 2007. There were four of us in one room (husband, son 7, daughter-18 and myself). My husband was there for a convention and the kids and I tagged along for a vacation.   We were a little skeptical with this property especially after all the negatives reviews it had received.  But we had no choice as this was the hotel my husbandâs employer booked.  This stay was booked on hotels.com for $149 a night.  But we were surprised at how decent the hotel was.   CHECK-IN:   Pretty simple, fast and easy.  We arrived at 1:30pm and of course our room was not ready.  The staff was polite and advised us to come back at 2:30pm. They recommended we leave our luggage (10 pieces) with the bellhop, David, while we went to get a quick bite.  David;3
The hotel lobby is nice.  I booked through groupon so I was given a smoking roomâ¦yuck.  If you don not like smoke stay away from the 3rd floorâ¦from the moment you get off the elevator:  it wreaks.  The room was awful..stained carpets, the groupon sale was not worth it.  The next day they moved us to a non smoking room.  Night and day!  I would only go back to this hotel if I could call and make sure I was not on the 3rd floor!!  In saying all that for the price I would go back to the 4th floorâ¦.but would rather pay the higher prices than stay on floor 3.  It was that bad!!;3
Well, what you read on this site is pretty accurate.  The room was mini sized... just enough space for the bed and small desk.  It was clean, the bed was pretty soft.  So there was some ok things... BUT... when I got off the elevator I couldnât find my room.  The reason??? Because it was IN THE STAIRWELL!!!! Yes, I had to go through the fire door to the exit stairwell and there on the landing was the door to my room!!! It was terrible.  Loud... people donât mind walking up one flight of stairs and standing on the landing and talking, loudly, until they go through the door to the hallway, and their room.  At ALL hours!!! The other thing that was very annoying... the shower! I could not stand under the shower unless I was at an angle... because, this has to be the only hotel;3
"Before I start with the negative, let's highlight the good points: 1) Location: The hotel was located in a safe neighborhood & easily accessible. 2) No bed bugs : this speaks for itself.  3) Friendly front desk staff at check-in. The gentleman who greeted us at check-in was very friendly & welcoming, definitely something nice to see in a large hotel. This was the bright spot for me in the entire trip.   But unfortunately, there was some room for improvement:  1) Maintenance: Our room phone was not working. No dial tone, no nothing. We actually went down to the desk and told someone, they assured us it would be fixed, but that never happened.  2) What ""recent renovations""? : The room itself was small (not unexpected in a NYC hotel) but also shabby. The TV was an old model with";3
Recognizing that we normally stay at Hamptons and Courtyards, the size of the rooms and amenities were disappointing, but typical for major cities and old hotels like the Empire. My wife, who travels less than me, was unhappy with the lack of space. The pillows were lumpy. The bathroom had no ventilation for steam.;3
I returned to this hotel because of a great experience, only to be disappointed. The check-in was a 20-minute wait when we arrived with only one person at the front and a long line up of people. Then they promised to text me when the room was ready, again it did not happen. Finally, when I went over my final billing and used points, I had one staff member at the front desk who could not help, and another one being rude to me when I was simply asking a question. 3 strikes and you are out when it comes to customer experience. The hotel is great, and the rooms were excellent.;3
"Firstly, I had high hopes for this hotel after reading others reviews and that it was a ""5 star"" hotel.   Unfortunately it didn't live up to or anywhere near our expectations. Although the lobby and bar area's are nice and clean we were really disappointed with the rooms. The first room we were in was tiny (one of the smallest rooms I'd ever seen) and located right above the air conditioning units (loud is an understatement). After being moved to a slightly bigger room away from the air conditioning we didn't complain, although the room was on the second floor facing the front of the hotel. The windows could do with some sort of sound proofing because the sound of the traffic (although nice to hear sometime because it remind you you're in new York, became a bit annoying after a";3
My wife and I stayed here for a few days in February 2017. It's just a few hundred yards from Penn station and an ideal base for seeing or shopping in New York city. It's a very busy hotel and reception staff are very efficient and helpful. It is extremely clean but unfortunately, it is in much need of a thorough makeover. Our room was 'compact' to say the least. Decor was dark and old fashioned and no tea/coffee making facilities!!! Still, it served us well as a base and perhaps the best feature was the Tick-Tock restaurant adjacent to it which was absolutely marvelous. Like a lot of city centre hotels, the Wyndham doesn't really need to try hard. Easy money.;3
The location is very central which is the best part of this hotel. We did luck out when we booked two doubles, the room came with two bathrooms and two closets which is perfect for a girlfriend get away. The downsides were the dimly lit room which looks old and tired despite some attempts to update. The front desk and baggage check-in clerks have attitude, but I think that's the NY customer service. The worst part was when it came to pay, there were so many additional fees on top of tax at 14.75%, there was a resort fee, city tax, etc. Be prepared for a shock when you get your final bill.;3
There were good and bad things about this hotel. Good things included cheap rates and close to bus/metro stops. These are a must if you don't want to spend tons on taxi fares. In a lot of ways though, it still would have been nice to have been more centrall located...maybe West Hollywood or Beverly Hills. The neighborhood was entirely iffy...don't go walking about by yourself at night, but the hotel is very secure.  I would consider the rooms entirely average for hotel rooms. I know a lot of people have been complaining on this site about them, but I bet if they had looked at their room at check in and asked for something to be changed, it would have been. The cleaning staff was very polite and efficient, so I doubt it would have been a problem.  Noise is a problem in this;3
We shared a bunker, a small room. The two of us barely fit in the room, but we managed. A room good enough to sleep in. The room was a bit moist, which gave a bit of an oder. The location was good. A lot of restaurangs nearby and the metro wasn't far away. The shared bathroom was clean. Not a lot of noise during the night. Good stay over all, Good value for the money. You get what you pay for, with the location as an extra bonus!;3
Upon registration we were given a room with a loose window on the upper floor. Sounded like a tornado coming across the space.  When I called to complain, was told the entire building was that way.  My husband complained and we were moved.  Do not let them try that with you...;3
"If you're looking for a cheap place to stay in New York City, here you have it. But by ""cheap"" I mean affordable for this city. Looking for hotels in NYC can be a nightmare if you're travelling on a budget and if you want to stay in Manhattan. It's clean enough and it gives you quick access to NY attractions. The rooms are small, as well as the bathrooms, but it's enough for spendind a few days in the city. I don't think you could find anything better...";3
Stayed for 4 nights with my family at the end of our holiday.  Booked back in Feb from the UK and choose a double double executive floor  room, which was described on the website as spacious with a seating area, armchair and ottoman and you would be provided with 2 fluffy bathrobes.  As my children are 14 and 9, I like the idea of a room with a bit of space, and was use to American rooms to be big with bigger than expected beds.  Not in the Hilton.  The room had 2 double beds that were not a lot bigger that the single beds at some UK Hiltons, a desk for working and a bench seat (big enough for 1) in front of the window.  This had to be moved blocking access to the bed if you wanted to sit on it, and not that we really cared but only 1 waffle bathrobe.  I went to reception to;3
Not the best trip.  My room had no water the first day and only cold water on the second day due to unforeseen problems with the water heaters.  The staff was very apologetic.  Rudy, was especially fantastic!;3
As others have mentioned, this hotel is in an ideal mid town location, but we found our room to be disappointingly small and in need of updating - 'tired' being an apt description. We arrived late evening after a flight delay and the receptionist made a show of searching on his computer to find us a good sized room. He gave us the impression that he'd found one, but when we got up there it turned out to be one of the smallest double rooms we've stayed in (at the very end of a corridor on the 31st floor). Only one seat (the desk chair) and no room to swing the proverbial cat. We were by then too tired to argue, but quite disappointed. One morning we also had the unpleasant experience of brown water coming through the bathroom taps, which left the towels and flannels stained. When;3
I purchased the daily WiFi for $12.95 from my computer. When I tried to access the wifi from my iPhone the receptionist said the internet access charge was per device. It may have mentioned that in the small print somewhere but who would think that such an otherwise nice hotel would insist on ripping off their customers this way. Very disappointing and greedy. The room is microscopic which is ok if you don't have much luggage but we're traveling internationally with several suitcases and no place to put them. The shower only has half a glass door leaving the other half exposed. It's a soggy bathroom after a shower as water can help but escape.;3
If you are traveling alone, and don't need a massive room at $300 up this could be your dream hotel. But it could easily become a total hell, if you dont know what you are getting into.   Im 6'5, and I was worried that the beds would be too small. They are fine. Standard length and width single beds, with room at the end for your feet to hang off. Cant talk for the bunk rooms, but I expect the ends are closed in.    The rooms are compact, but had everything i needed. Water, Wifi, nice towels, robe, slippers, pencil, pad, Ipod alarm, and a dvdTV. Loads of storage above and below the bed, including a safe. And house keeping were a pair of charming ladies, who would service my room as late as 5pm.    The shared bathrooms are great. Nice products, good showers, never had to wait,;3
Like most properties in NYC the rooms are small.  We were fortunate enough to get a corner room which had 2 large windows.    Pros:  Major chain backed, clean rooms and corridors, subway near by, near MSG, walking distance to Times Square and friendly staff.  Cons:  Small room, check-in was a process, did not get my loyalty points.;3
The room looked out onto another room, enabling us to see and be seen directly  by other customers. The aircon and heating system caused me and my fiance to have a few respitory problems. The location of the hotel was very good, and really close to what we wanted to see. Good location, ok execution.;3
Pros Fantastic location, clean rooms, 2 bathrooms (tho paid extra for this), large room, good security, comfy beds,   Cons  Rooms are freezing despite heating, rooms are very noisy and you can hear voices from the next room and their shower and taps running, we were woken up every morning around 6.30am by the shower in the next room, $5 charge per bag to leave your luggage if you have a late flight, $75 quote for late check out, not enough seats in the lobby for people waiting to leave;3
We stayed there for 5 nights in May 2011, we booked a double bedroom with private bathroom. All in all it was OK for the price, but VERY basic and not that clean.  Be warned : you MUST verify room before accepting it. We were given room 603 at first but we refused it : room was really tiny, bathroom really tiny as well, shower tap was dropping non stop, aircon had no button to switch it on or off! After refusing it, we were then given room 610, which was really larger (both room and bathroom) and aircon was working this time.  Positive points : - Price : the only valuable reason to stay in this hotel : for 5 nights in a double bedroom with private bathroom, we paid only 700$ - Room : the 2nd one was quite large, including a closet, a fridge, a drawer, TV and a big bathroom. - TV;3
"We stayed 3 nights to visit the area.  The location was perfect, however the front desk, ""check-in"" was very slow with a long line.  The area is crowded into a corner of the lobby, poorly staffed, and inefficient.  The hotel does not have a comfortable bar/ lounge for a social gathering or watching TV, the restaurant food is substandard with a very limited menu.  There is no complimentary coffee, no newspapers in the hotel, and no airport shuttle. Our room was not serviced until after 4 pm when we called the front desk to complain. As Hilton Honors members, we have stayed at much better hiltons.";3
Location is quite good to upper end of city. Kind of a nice balance between being close enough but not in the absolute chaos that is NY. Booked off Internet. Place generally looks a bit tired. They clearly used a wide angled lens. The room was extremely small, cramped and pokey. HEating/AC was semi broken. Had two settings, too hot or too cold. Had to sleep with window open at night to have reasonable room temperature which made it noisy. Pool didn't open till end of May although I don't think this was indicated at time of booking. Shower dial didn't work so could only use overhead shower. Toilet blocked while we were there. Internet costs were a real rip. Staff were always friendly, helpful and very professional. Have stayed in better places in NY at around the same price;3
Overall this is not a bad hotel, it's quite centrally located and very close to some major subway lines, the room was comfortable and reasonably spacious for the price.  However... Prepare to spend a large amount of time waiting for the slowest and smallest elevators you have ever taken in your life, we unfortunately got put on the top floor and only one of the elevators in the whole hotel goes to the 13th floor. They're also used by maintenance staff to take up and down trolleys of supplies to the room and when they're in there, there's no room at all for customers.  I witnessed quite a few customers getting angry at the hotel staff over this issue.  Elevators aside, this hotel is a good one! It's great for people who are looking to save some $$$ and don't plan on spending all;3
"When I last reviewed The New Yorker, I said I was happy enough but would probably look for something else next time.  Well, this is ""next time""...and the price for the location (or the location for the price) at this hotel were just too hard to go past.  We had a seven night stay and once more we really appreciated being within walking distance of so many landmarks - The Empire State Building, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Herald Square, Fifth Avenue, Times Square and Broadway are all within striking distance.  Right outside are the subway entrances, to take you further afield.  Although the lobby is rather charming, much of the hotel is quite dated, though we found our room to be clean and comfortable - good beds, pillows etc.  When we arrived, it seems there was a";3
Staff were friendly and helpful. Maintenace seems to be an issue here. There was only one elevator working and it took forever to get up to the room and get back down to the lobby. It pretty much stops at every floor due to the amount of guests trying to get up and down. 3 elevators in total. 1 out of order, 2nd stopped working 2hrs into our stay. So only the 3rd was working. The room was very small and bathroom tiny. Also the bathroom not clean. Hair from other guests all of the place. I will say, the bed was very comfortable though, but I believe I was being bitten by something. Not sure if bed bugs or not. It was a great location though! Central to everything and again, very helpful staff.;3
Hotel itself is lovely however do not book the lead in category rooms. They are the size of a cupboard. No joke. Area lovely and walk able to times square however next time I will check sizes of rooms. This hotel is the new kid on the block with the young and beautiful heading for the hip roof top bar. guest list only and flanked by bouncers. If that''s thing great but was not for me. I would stay again but would 100% upgrade room type to ensure bigger. My 6 ft husband had trouble getting in and out of the bathroom it was so cramped.;3
The biggest asset of this hotel it is the great location, in the middle of Manhattan, close to many central touristic spots like Broadway, the Times Square etcâ. It is also surrounded by many shops, restaurants and a few subway stations. Besides that, everything else was just ok. The room was small but clean. It had thin walls so every noise was noticeable. The bathroom wasnât comfortable, mainly because there was almost no space to keep all the toiletries. The service was just fine, quite polite but not really friendly. The lobby was always overcrowded and it looked like a busy train station. Also, they charge you to keep your luggage and in addition, tried to charge (30 dollars per day!!!) for something strange such as hotel services (wi fi, gym etc). After arguing with the;3
Great hotel, good location,  friendly staff but way too small a room, I couldnât move around not to talk of play around with the Mrs.. and I recall asking for a big room. Not very happy. The only bonus is that the hotel is right in the middle of everything and just a walking distance to Time square.;3
1st time visit was great, 2nd time was horrible with my luggage situation and how things were handled overall, and 3rd trip started off terrible-you would think that what happened on my second visit that they were not give me a a terrible experience for this trip. Check in was horrible with their service.Tried charging me 75 dollars early check in with knowledge of my bad experience the last time I was there.  The manager was supposed to call me in regards to this but never did.  I had to call several hours later to complain about the service upon check in and not getting a call back.  The manager took off the 75 dollars, I was happy about this.  I was just hoping to get better service upon check in.  I should not have to start off my vacation upset. I love the location but with;3
"Cons - 30th floor room that was so small one of us had to sit on the bed while the other got ready. Tiny 4ft 6"" bed that we could bearly roll over without knocking each other out of bed. Should be a single person room only, can't believe they can market it as a double. Customer service average to blasÃ©, but they still expected major tips. Pros - decent location for all midtown sights, modern refurbished rooms, average price";3
Nice location.  Very close to Central Park.  Only issue was our room's bathroom.  The maintenance of it (e.g. caulking of the walls and around bathtub) was very bad.  The back half of the shower doors seemed to be missing.  The condition of the bathroom made the overall hotel room feel really cheap and allowed to be rundown.;3
Had five days at the New Yorker in July. Location very central and a great base for sight seeing.  Is a grand old hotel but could do with a coat of paint to bring it back from looking tired and dated.  Staff were great Our room was spacious and the views from our room on the 22nd floor were exceptional.  Only real negative was getting slugged with a USD 45 per day âfacilities feeâ on departure. We had prepaid our stay well in advance and did not expect this fee. They said it was to cover wifi, gym and business centre - none of which we actually used.;3
"The Empire Hotel is located just next to Lincoln Center and all the great cultural institutions there. It is also reachable by public transportation: the subway ( A , 1, 3 line) is just 50 meters away.   The lobby makes an good impression, the reception desk and check in is managed professionally and and customers are treated usually well.  My room had been a ""standard"" room to the inside, not to the street. Still it is quite noisy, but what else would you expect in New York ? You hear still all ambulance cars, but also every door in your hallway, all water, shower and toilet form your neighbor rooms and the heating/aircondition device is extremely loud.   The room is ok, quite dark, but you will find all you need. It is all very practical, the furniture is made with very cheap";3
Stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights. Itâs location is fairly central for getting around New York and all the attractions. Our room was always kept clean. The room itself was small and basic but that wasnât really an issue for us as we were only using it to put our head down each night so it served its purpose.  Be aware they charge a compulsory $31 a night fee for facilities. I personally think this is a bit of a scam. They say itâs to allow use of conference centre, gym WiFi and international phone calls. I wasnât in New York for a conference or to use the gym and my phone provide 02 charged Â£4 a day for the internet, phone calls and messages which is a heck of a lot cheaper than they are charging.  My partner is with 3 she didnât have to pay anything with her contract.  This;3
"The hotel is conveniently located and the lower floors are very clean and secure. The check-in process was very slow, however, and there was always a line and a wait. We were told our room would be ready by a certain time and then it was not; this happened three times. The room was small but comfortable; however, the bedrest/pillow smelled horribly. It was obvious that it had not been cleaned, which is a bit disgusting, especially when the high price of the room is considered.";3
Stayed here with my husband on the second leg of our U.S. trip. We had been told by a travel agent that LA has no high or low season - it's hella expensive all year round. We stayed for 4 nights with a budget of around Â£100 per night and struggled to find somewhere in one of the hotspots. So, we looked at the places we wanted to see and found that they were mostly around the Hollywood area, and chose this hotel based on location and price. When we arrived we immediately regretted this decision - it is right on the main road, so it was noisy day and night. That said, I had requested a room near a lift which was granted, and we were given a room round the side which apparently would be quieter - it was still noisy. We thought the location would look better in the daylight since we;3
"Me and my friend where there for one week on our vecation, the hotel is close to centrum but very chabby! The wallpaper is peeling off the wall and we got a smoking room, and it was super nasty because if we just touched the wall our hands become yellow. They really need a real clean up on the walls and carpet, it is so dirty. Tha bathroom was ok, but the water was dirty, i know new york dont have ""clean"" water but this is sick. The staff was nice and helpful. The hotel had no breakfast even tho' on their webside they say they have.  Kinda stupid, so we had to pay  for our breakfast every day.  I would stay there again because the location and the price, no other reason.";3
"We chose this hotel for a 1-night staycation because of the rooftop pool--which only a handful of NYC hotels have. The pool deck is quite small, so go early if you want lounge chairs. The service on the roof deck was good; staff members were frequently walking around taking drink orders upon request. We had a relaxing afternoon, but were disappointed that the pool was shaded and also not heated, so it was FREEZING. Management: If you read this, please heat the pool!  We booked a ""Standard Room"" that supposedly had a Queen bed. It was definitely a Full not a Queen. The bed, the bathroom and the room overall were SO small--and that's coming from NYC residents! I would suggest future travelers upgrade from the ""Standard Room"" if possible.  The location is excellent for";3
I stayed at the Jane in a single cabin room with shared bathroom access. The room was tiny yes and being a corner room was not ideal and it was even smaller in size. The hotel is a lovely historic gem and an amazing area of NYC. The location alone made my trip. But I will mention a few things to be aware of. This hotel has SRO tenants who also live there which made for some interesting interactions in the shared bathroom like when I witnessed a tenant washing a crockpot one evening which was a bit off putting for a hotel guest who has to use that bathroom. I feel tenants should be accessing a shared bath that is not also used by hotel guests if thatâs what itâs being used for (there were 2 on the 4th floor). Otherwise the bathrooms were mostly clean. Being such an old hotel you;3
Stayed at the hotel for one night as it was close to the Universal Studios. I was told it was a very nice hotel and when I arrived, everyone was extremely helpful however, when the concierge assisted me to my room, he demanded that he gets a tip.  The concierge stood in my room and rubbed his fingers in my face to give a hint for me to give him a tip.  For him to do that to a guest is very rude and shouldn't be tolerated at all.  I do give tips to people who deserve it but, they should not be forcing you to tip especially how the concierge demarnded the tip.  I would be happy to talk to a manager about this.;3
Great location, average room.  Spacious king suite but bed was very hard and window was broken which allowed a lot of outside noise and smells to come inside.  It was never fixed during our stay.  Bell staff was very friendly and helpful.  Lighting is a little dark in rooms and hallways.  Food in their restaurant was delicious.;3
We stayed here at the beginning of December, it is a great location, being within walking distance to the majority of attractions in NYC. In my opinion, the decor is very dated, I felt like i was in the 1930's (what I imagined it to be like). The beds were small also, I'd say the same size as a UK small double. My wife and I aren't huge and we had just about enough room, I can imagine larger couples would struggle and would actually need to the two doubles in the room.   The rooms wasn't too much of an issue as we were out all day. Being a city hotel, it is very noisy at night with the passing traffic but this is accepted. The hotel is clean, can't grumble at that. The tick tock diner was fantastic (separate review to follow)... Would I stay here again? Possibly.;3
Pros:  - Close to Penn Station - Close to Subway which will take you direct to WTC in one direction and Natural History Museum in other direction - Comfortable room albeit quite small - Hairdryer/Safe Provided  - Good view of Empire State Building  Cons: - Outdated furniture/bathroom  - Water takes ages to drain in Shower, your feet end up dirty! - No Coffee facilities (this alone drops it down a whole star for me, such a simple change) - No Room Service etc - No bottled water provided in room - Location feels unsafe, see below.  Overall, an adequate stay. We were here 4 nights. I think if youâre just stopping in NYC this place would do you fine but for slightly longer trips I found myself wanting a little bit more. Just basic stuff that is missing such as coffee making;3
My Husband and I checked in here Nov 2012 after us being at sea for 4 days in the rath of hurricane Sandy, We where spoke to in an appauling manner and given the key to the janitors closet as are suite.  After hours of complaining that are room was to small the hotel Manager told me that this was just because we booked a standard room with a travel agent and should book straight though the hotel in the future!!  Devasted since we wer on hunimoon and had no room at all to move in this tiny little room.  my husband had to stand in the shower and pee into the toilet as there was no room for him to stand above the toilet.  finally the manager suggested us paying more money($120 per nite) to get a standard room on the second floor where we had some room to breath.  Altough this is a;3
Great location.   Great security procedures at the entrance and in room. We must show the room key to the security personnel before getting in the elevator. When we returned to the room during the room cleaning was in service, the cleaning personnel asked us to put the key card to open the door in order to proof that we stay in that room.  Bed and restroom cleaning are good.   The hotel should improve the cleanliness in the hallway, corridor, entrance, and the far to reach areas in the room, such as lightning/lamps, bathroom-vent on the ceiling etc. It was very dusty and dull the the hotel very greatly. The dead-bolt at the door was out of order. The room smelled a bit and we sensed overpower use of the air refreshing spray to override the odour in the room.  We were so far;3
Astor on the Park is conveniently located on New York's famous Central Park. Although this hotel is situated on the upper west side and on 106th street is quite far from the action, it is approximately 20minutes walk to the Museum of Natural History and around a 30min-40min walk to fifth avenue, Broadway, Times Square and the Rockefeller Centre. It is also in easy access of the subway on 103rd street or 96th street with all of the above in easy reach on train lines B and C.  The hotel itself is very clean- fresh towels and rooms cleaned everyday. Other reviews have described rooms as being small but the twin double bed room my sister and I stayed in was surprisingly adequate in size. The staff are friendly with a hint of the stereotypical straight-talking New Yorker!! They were;3
Hotels in NY are very expensive. Park West Hotel is not the exeption. Booked throught Booking and everything went well. Staff were a little rude on the payment options. Apparently they havn't had a great experience with Booking so they asked to pay the nights in advance AND to leave an open voucher for the rest of the stay.;3
Our room in the New Yorker (A Wyndham hotel) was smaller than hotel rooms I've had in Paris and for less money. The plumbing was old and doused us with alternatively hot and cold water.  It seems Wyndham added a coat of paint and their name only. The lobby was ok, the cafe and restaurant were average too.  The staff however was very good. Location is great.;3
Do NOT come here on a weekend in october unless you can fly on a broom. I had a reservation but could not get near the hotel. After trying and being locked in traffic for 1.5 hours, I finally called and asked to move to another hilton. They finally let me without a penalty because I was hilton honors. After the halloween thing was over, it became reasonable place. I stayed here because it was near my son's house. This is best for families who want to tour the universla studio. No spa nor any spa services nearby. Pool looked nice but it was cold and rainy when i was here. Mostly families and people here for conventions.;3
For 1 night, it was average but not up to the quality of Hyatt hotels we've stayed in before. We sort of felt like we were staying in a Holiday Inn Express for over $300 per night. The decorating was all d4ab gray. There was no room service. The food was good (portions too large), and the staff was friendly and accommodating, though.;3
"The hotel was nice and well located. Staff were friendly and the room was clean. Price was relatively cheap for a nice hotel until they hit us with some bullcrap resort tax. On top of the city tax and some other tax, we ended up paying closer to double what the advertised price was. As my wife was pregnant at the time, we weren't really able to make use of the ""resort"" facilities they had available, which featured a business centre (so resorty) and a fitness centre (just what I look for in a resort). Wyndham New Yorker, lose the resort tax. You are not, and never will be, a resort. Cut it the f out.";3
The hotel is well located for the northern end of Central Park, Columbus & Amsterdam Avenues and the 100th Street subway. It's price is reasonable - for NYC. The room was worn and tired but clean. It was very small and was certainly not one of those shown on the website. That all said, the staff were friendly and everything was clean. With no desk and only one seat, it is best for those planning to be out all day.;3
We asked to check in early and they asked for a fee of $70 then they reduced to $50.  If we donât want to pay for early check in then we have to pay for luggage storage.  The room does not have coffee machine or the refrigerator.  If we want to have those items, we have to pay additional for each item!  The location is a couple blocks from Penn station and 10-15 min walk to Koreantown or Timesquare which is convenient.  Overall, I wouldnât recommend unless you are willing to pay for those additional fees!;3
the rooms are quite dark our room was to the courtyard and there it was very very noisy airing was actually hardly possible the handling of the shower we actually did not really understand until today could really score the two rooftop bars. the presentation was very inviting and the look just great;3
"Nice, if small rooms. Location superb but the ""lady"" at the reception dealing with my waylaid shirts was obviously a member of the East German border police in an earlier life. If you don't like what you do, get another job please.";3
"The hotel is in a great location - across from Lincoln Center and a short walk to the Time Warner Building, Times Square and Central Park. It has good restaurants nearby - The Smith across the street (had a great meal) and PJ Clarke's adjacent. There is a Starbucks two doors down.  My room was comfortable but very cramped. The window looked out on another window just a few feet away. Instead of a closet there was an 18"" bar above the mini-fridge that had a curtain I could pull closed. My colleague had a room next to the elevator and he just had 3 hooks to hang his clothes on. Space must be such a premium the maids don't have big carts, they use one of those $20 fold up carts with the collapsible handle you buy at Staples.   Don't expect a corporate chain hotel - the printer did";3
The hotel is an easy walk to Universal Studios and Universal City Walk or, if you prefer, you can catch the free shuttle bus. The rooms are comfortable and have all of the things you would expect from a hotel. The foyer area is a little dated, but very clean and tidy and with fresh fruit water for free to quench your thirst. The prices of this hotel are quite high, so look out for deals to get better value for money. We booked two rooms but had only one car. We were charged twice for parking (once on each room) but this was easily rectified. Staff were friendly and helpful.;3
House keeping dont read notes, bathroom door didnt lock in our room, bring your own tooth brush/paste.   Beds were comfortable and sheets were clean.  No hotel Garage, they charge $60 if you valet (each day), $40 if you park yourself (get it validate).;3
We stayed here for 3 nights. The location of this hotel is fantastic - it is a few minutes walk from the south west corner of central park and about 20 minutes walk from Times Square and the Rockafeller Centre. This was the highlight of the hotel.   The hotel is pleasant enough, but our room was quite small and there was no view from the window, apart from the massive air conditioning unit outside which hummed constantly. This meant no sun light or breaze could get through the window. During the night, about every 2 hours, a VERY loud clunking noise would begin which woke us every time. We  subsequenly asked to have our room changed the next day, which they seemed happy to do. We were to pack our things and that our suitcases would be moved to the next room. When we got back;3
A good hotel, which could be a lot better with a few simple touches.  The service was great and the hotel is clean and well-kept, but (as of September 2016 anyway) there is no bar service in the evening, nor any evening restaurant service. The hotel has a lovely interior courtyard bar but it's effectively wasted since you can't get a drink [apparently this was due to staff shortages, but how hard can it really be to find a barman in L.A.?]. Also there are some nice shaded terraces but these are off-limits in the evenings, again when you'd most want to use them. Of course, we only found out these things long after we'd checked in.  Recommend you check directly with the hotel as to what amenities are available, before booking.  Service:  helpful and informative. Rooms: nice -;3
I probably shouldn't complain about this hotel because I got a really good deal on Hotwire. That being said, if I had to pay full price for what I got I'd be quite unhappy. My husband and i just spent 2 nights at The Empire so it's all fresh in my mind. Check -in was a snap, lobby and bar scene is nice, decor in general modern and edgy. Our room was a standard with 2 double beds (with Hotwire you don't really have a choice of beds. You take what they give you). It was small, very small. And upon entering we realized right away the heat wasn't working (not good when the outside temp was about 17 degrees) . We put a call in right away and they said they would take care of it. And they did. Then we checked out the bathroom. It was tiny. Barely one  person could move around in it.;3
It is a conveniently located hotel, which is why I've given it a 3.  It looks like a really nice hotel, and the lobby is beautiful but all in all it was one of our least favorite places in our 6 week trip in America.   We asked for a room that was high up, but we didn't get one, which was disappointing. The WiFi barely worked - not ideal when you are travelling and relying on it to plan everything - and even though it says in the guidebook in the room that the hotel does offer laundry services, when I phoned up to ask about it, I was told that they actually don't.   The mattress didn't quite fit the bed that well either. Once you venture further than the lobby, you see that the rest of the hotel doesn't quite have the same nice appearance throughout.   However, it was a place to;3
Great location - in walking distance of the Metro, Little Italy, East Village - very basic amenities. You may need to ask for extra towels, or toilet roll- Happy with Clean beds. Bathroom could be updated - as with the carpeting throughout the property.  Located on Forsyth Street opposite open community space/park. Nice change from being boxed in.;3
This is one of the more difficult reviews I have done. The description which the hotel puts out to the world is completely accurate. The rooms are small but the bed is comfortable and clean, there is air conditioning and most amenities you would expect from a 2 star hotel. The staff were helpful and professional. My major gripe is the bathroom facilities, there simply are not enough - there are three showers for an entire floor and this is not acceptable, it means queues and cold water, this is  a shame as the rest of the hotel is fine.;3
The rooms are small but well kept. For New York the small rooms are probably not unusual but being from the wide open spaces of Texas, not what I'm used to. The beds are comfortable and luckily the famous flat pillow craze of Texas and Costa Rica hotels hasn't caught on here yet. The towel situation is a bit lacking as in having hand towels is sporadic and hanging them anywhere but the pull out mirror is an impossibility. At the time of our visit only one of four elevators worked regularly with another working sporadically and two others out of order completely. The hotel otherwise is pretty good.;3
"You basically need to do everything by your own. No warm welcome at the door. Don't ask don't tell policy at reception. Just a sleep-n-fly kind of hotel rather than a full-ledged Regency hotel. Make sure you check-in at the hotel first if you arrive in a rental car; neither the hotel or the rental cars have shuttles that will take you to/from the hotel. I basically had to come back walking from Hertz. The hotel shuttle will take you only to the airport and departs from airport every 10 minutes. Avoid at all costs the coffee in the take-out cafe at first floor, it is the worst coffee I have had in my life.";3
I was a liitle bit worried about all the reviews that i read in advance but the price was unbeatable and it was only for 2 nights and i was looking for something in that area for Xmas eve. And the lobby of the hotel is nice and it's brand new but the rest of the corridors, scary lift and almost unlocked doors of the rooms need a quick change.  Anyway, the room was accurate for 2 people and pretty clean. The room has got TV, refrigerator and it's ok. The furniture don't match at all (some of the them are made of metal, like in an office) but the bed was confortable and clean. There were some scary cables on the floor but we hid them behind the fridge.  So, it worths a cheap price and you must know where you're going. It's not bad at all and i do not think it's dangerous or risky.;3
Stayed here in July with my teenage son while visiting my sister in New York. The check in staff were very friendly but we had to bring our own suitcases into reception, the bell boy did not help us.  The rooms are small but most hotel rooms in New York are and we found our room very dusty in place, my son found mold on the backs of the curtains. The carpets looked well worn and the bathroom was tiny. For some reason when you went to the toilet you could not shut the door but the toilet roll holder on the wall was very awkward to reach.  On saying this the beds were very comfortable and the sheets and pillowcases were very soft and comfy.  The room service was very expensive which we found out the first morning of our trip when we ordered our breakfast...30 dollars for 2 of us.;3
My room was very nice. The linens were clean everything else was also clean. It had a cute little TV. Overall I really liked my room and was surprised because I expected it to be unkempt. The only thing I didn't like was that I didn't get my own shower and toilet, but other than that it was a nice stay.;3
We stayed here for 6 nights over the thanksgiving period. The hotel is in a great location! Round the corner from Macy's and a block away from Madison Square Garden- you can pretty much walk to a lot of places! The hotel has 2 restaurant/diners next door which are convenient. The hotel itself is very popular and busy, but the rooms are slightly outdated. On our first night we were upgraded to a bigger room but unfortunately the bathroom was very outdated with no bathtub/shower instead just a walk in shower. However the hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming, Driss at the front desk was exceptionally nice and changed our room the following day- we stayed on the 31st floor and albeit a smaller room, we had a great view of Empire State Building, the room is more updated and;3
Initial appearance was good, lobby was busy, plush and the presence of aircrew indicated the hotel is used as stopover accommodation for major airlines.  However stepping out of the elevator the decor in corridors and rooms appeared tired and in need of renovation. Also rooms are very small. Service from housekeeping was mediocre and the doormen were not interested in assisting wheelchair clients in & out of the hotel. The only positive is the hotels location on the junction of 34th St with 8th Ave , an easy walk to Empire State, Macy's, The Highline park & Madisson Square Garden.;3
We chose the hotel according to the location it did not disappoint and the pool that was disgusted was dirty yes once we did not use it.ð¢The rooms were older and the view of the air conditioning was extremely loud that it was not possible to sleep at night. Wifi in room 10 USD per day per facility ???? 2017 year;3
Starting with the good:   -- Reception staff were friendly and informative. Special mention for Mohammed who was friendly, professional and gave us all the information we required.  -- Staff in general were helpful and friendly.  -- Clean room, with a very comfortable bed.  -- Iron and hairdryer included, together with some complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.  -- Nice view.  -- The Tick Tock Diner open 24 hours did some perfectly decent food, which was welcome when we were jet lagged.  -- Good location. Steps from the midtown highlights. 34th St -- Penn Station tube station on the corner made getting to the museums on the Upper East Side and getting downtown a doddle. The High Line just around the corner on W30th and 10th is recommended and an easy way to walk to;3
WAY over priced for the quality. They are sticking it to customers because they can.  Staff was great.  Hotel was clean.  Beds were terrible. Pillows not to my liking but might be fine for others.  Too hard. TV was WAY across the room from the bed and too small for the distance.;3
Normally I stay away from airport location unless I'm catching a flight the next morning.  I decided to stay here. Had an issue with deposit and not being able to pay cash but the manager was nice enough to resolve this issue. Beautifull lobby with full bar and restaurant and even a huge cafe. Room was nice but no fridge, unfortunately. The pool area lacked a little. Parking is an insane price of $32 so be warned if you bring a car here. The restaurant food was okay but nothing remarkable. A Very friendly server at the restaurant. I enjoyed my stay but would not come back due to the parking fee and lack of nice pool area.;3
Not a bad location in Hollywood, few metro stations away from the walk of fame and Dolby theater. About 5 min walk from metro. Car rental service available directly at hotel. Rooms are clean, but the beads are horrible. Materess definitely needs an update. Great breakfast! Loved it. If renting a car don't get a hotel parking, there's plenty of free parking after 8pm until 8am on the street arroubd hotel and if leaving hotel after 8am just put few dollars in tme meter. We parked at 8:30pm... And picked it up at 9am, so it cost us 1$ parking instead of 24,99$/night.;3
Confirm that your room will have lighting to see and an outlet or docking station for phone, etc. Lamps and bed tables are featured in every photo online.Also, bathroom was dated and housekeeping left a crib in our room.;3
The location of this hostel is good - being really close to Hammersmith station and plenty of pubs and cafes. Overall though we didn't love our stay - the room was small and we could hear the planes all night out the window. The shower wasn't particularly clean and the toilet didn't flush. The staff also weren't super friendly and funny smell in hallways. Another downer is no free wifi - you have to buy it.;3
Rooms are clean and nice. Windows are too old and thin, you can hear a lot of noise coming from outside and  the cold also enters in the room (not nice when you have 5f. degree outside). I would suggest to offer the coffee (it costs 3$) and a bottle of water as basic amenities. Room service is ok, but it takes too long (30/45 minutes to get there.... Even only for a club).;3
We stayed at the Empire Hotel for a week. The location was brilliant for tourists: minutes from Central Park, next to the Lincoln Center, 15 minute walk from Time Square. Only complaint, location wise would be that the number of reasonably-priced eateries in the area was limited (or they were hidden well and the hotel didn't help us to find them!).   Our room (superior, 4th floor) was spacious for NYC, had a great bathroom (though drainage from the shower not good and risked over-flowing a couple of times). We were able to see out onto the Lincoln Centre Plaza, which I liked.   We found the service average - it was polite enough but we didn't feel really welcomed to the hotel and there was certainly no effort made to provide any extras or useful information. Free wifi was;3
"We were traveling to meet family and visit Universal Studios Hollywood and stayed for two nights.  Since we are Hilton Gold members we convinced the family members we were meeting to book their rooms here as well and subsequently spent the entire trip apologizing for the poor quality of the hotel.  We arrived at the same time and while we were assigned a higher floor as is listed as a preference in our Hilton profile, when we gave our room number to our extended family at the front desk when they were checking in the front desk made absolutely no effort to look for rooms on the same floor.  I understand that people may join a rewards/loyalty program for ""special treatment,"" but quite frankly its embarrassing when that special treatment (which isnât all that special anyway) isn't";3
Great City Location The New Yorker is in a fantastic place for exploring and getting around the city, situated right opposite Penn Station and Maddison Square Garden and a short walk from Times Square and Hudson mall and piers. Hotel staff were friendly and professional and hotel clean but although itâs an old hotel with lots of history it needs a bit of an upgrade/paint etc looks tired but bed comfortable and being the city that never sleeps it was well received after a long day on our feet. No tea and coffee in rooms but a coffee bar in lobby and the Tick Tock 24 hr diner too, good choice of breakfast and meals and also a McDonaldâs and Starbucks right opposite hotel although plenty diners and bagel shops on each corner too.;3
My husband and our two boys stayed here for a weekend. Our view of the park was beautiful, and the location is perfect. The room is very small though. I knew that going into this trip, but it was tiny. We struggled to setup our pack and play. The room and bed were clean. I did kill a cockroach on our 2nd night, but it didn't wreck our trip or anything. If you choose to stay here, just know that it's bare bones.;3
The stay was reasonable. Location was very good with good transport links and dining options available nearby. The wardrobe space was limited with inadequate hanging length for clothing. Lot of noise in the room from air conditioning plant and particularly from adjacent room TV;3
When reading the other reviews I was very worried about staying at the hotel. However much to my delight the majority of the bad reviews turned out to be wrong! The rooms are spacious and clean as well as the bathroom. The shower did take a while to heat up (I tended to be the first one in though). Our TV worked - the basic news channels however other people in our group's didn't. We however never watched it and if you're going to New York to watch TV you should re-evaluate why you are there!! The rooms were really cosy and warm and never felt cold once. The beds were changed daily and wifi worked well in the lobby. We were on floor 9 and had trouble getting wifi on the first night however for the rest of our duration it worked fine in our room. Overall the hotel accommodated;3
We had a one night stay at the Hilton universal way so that we can go to the universal studio as well as explore LA.  The hotel is in great location for universal studio and does have a shuttle running from the hotel to the park every 15 minutes, however, it is quite far from central LA so you would have to get a taxi which can be expensive.  The hotel is clean and nicely presented (lobby) but the the executive rooms look tired and could do with a make over as it does fall below the 4 star standard you would expect from the likes of Hilton.   Staff were generally pleasant but there was one member of staff at the reception desk who was rude and snappy. We got to hotel at 9am so we knew we have to wait to get in to our room and that was fine as we were planning to leave our;3
Pretty much what you'd expect for a midtown hotel. Rooms were small and dated, we would have had a superb view of the Empire State Building and 34th street but it was obstructed by scaffolding! Check in was quick and efficient and staff were always very polite, easy to get a taxi outside and location was perfect for us.;3
Too old room bathroom and very noisy hotel (ac and street) Its not what you are looking dor when zou go in nyc.   The location is great and front desk very helpful The bar is great but expensive  The water in the room cost 8usd which is just not acceptable;3
"Room was rather high priced for what we got compared to like a Comfort In Suites (would've rather stayed there...)  Gave us a room with a door adjoining another room, which was like thin as cardboard.  Could hear the peoples ""business"" going on, which was uncomfortable with two kids with!  Even the wall were this, as the room on otherside, could hear them simply lauging at the tv show they were watching. Yes room was clean, nice size bath, but for iver $200 a night nothing special.  No breakfast etc.... Only stayed because semi close to Universal Studios.  Next time would stay somewhere else, save the money, and just take a cab that short bit and still come out ahead. Nothing speacial for the money..........";3
I would have to agree with the other reviews about this hotel. We stayed here because we just couldn't pass up the price since all we would be doing was sleeping there. The rooms are clean and warm. Just your basics though, do not expect anymore than that. We had a clean bed with cable television, a dresser, closet, nightstand and a refrigerator. The staff was extremley friendly and very helpful. I never once had a problem with people using the bathroom when I needed it. It was also cleaned every morning. It's not a gorgeous hotel, but it works for the budget minded traveler. I will stay here again on our next trip to NY.;3
I have visited many hotels. Some with resort fees and some without. This hotel has absolutely no reason to charge a resort fee. There is no pool, no jacuzzi, no lobby amenities. They don't even think enough of their guest to provide a drink of water in the lobby, a bottle of water, or a water fountain. This hotel is a 3 star at best. The rooms are tiny! The bathrooms are dated and in need of updating. There is no vanity, therefore, there is no where to place anything in the bathroom. They charge $25 a night for a rollaway bed. Although, our check in person waved the fee. The entire hotel is dated. Most of the electrical plugs are hidden behind the beds.;3
We checked in about 130 -2pm. Our room was not ready by 4pm. Victor and Jose took care of us and checked our status. Due to the delay, they got some hotel credit and expedited the process to get our rooms. Thank you.;3
The hotel was clean, which is always great, and the room was pleasant enough.  We were handed our key and charged on arrival then left to it to figure everything out for ourselves. The oven in the kitchen didn't work and the food we bought from the reception area was out of date - aside from sleeping we spent the rest of the time away from the hotel. We were aware of the shared facilities but we were in a room directly opposite from the which resulted in it being very loud. Also, the towels provided were tiny so take your own towel!!  The only way to describe this place is mediocre and ok. I'd rather pay more for elsewhere next time though.;3
I stayed here two nights because I needed to be in close proximity to the upper west side.  My room was maybe 300 sq ft...It was clean but incredibly tiny!  Front desk was extremely strict about my check in time being 3:00, even though they had ample rooms available and I had arrived at 2:30.  I waited in the lobby until 3:15 before re approaching, as the front desk staff had said they would call me when my room was available (they never would have called).    I went to the rooftop bar which was empty at 6 on a Thursday.  On the weekend it was clearly quite the club spot, but I was so disillusioned with my Thursday experience I chose to go elsewhere.  It is adequate if you need to stay on the UWS (and clean), but I would not expect much more than that.;3
Although the New Yorker is classic and iconic it is also very loud. I know itâs not the hotels fault that the city of New York does their road work over night but it was VERY loud all night. Concrete saws, jack hammers and dump trucks literally right outside my window! My advice would be get an inside room or pay the extra cost to get very high.;3
hotel was clean and we had a good nights sleep. very central for us and doorman always gave directions if asked. we did not need any more than this as we were not there to see hotel.breakfast very expensive so we never ate there;3
This hotel was a mixed bag for us, the location is great and if you're prepared to walk the World Trade Centre and Times Square are doable. Closer, there are plenty of good bars and restaurants.  The hotel interior and staff uniforms reminded me so much of the Tower of Terror at Disney World that it made me a bit uneasy getting in to the lift.  We had a 2 person bunk bed room with shared bathroom, the bathrooms were very clean on obviously maintained regularly through the day which was great. If you planned on taking a cat to swing in the room it will hit every wall with ease. The rooms are tiny. With two large bags there was near no room to stand on the floor. The wifi in our room was becoming unbearable after 4 days.  Would use the hotel again, but I would be upgrading the;3
Empire review   Would like to first off state the best thing about this hotel is the location. We arrived early (understandably weren't allowed into our room until bang on 3pm check in). Having travelled from Scotland and been awake for 21 hours we were looking for a sleep but found ourselves in a very loud room in the hotel, on the first floor, right next to the air conditioning machines. Which never go off and made a loud noise. Having politely asked to change rooms we were told the hotel was full. We were given no other options and spent the rest of our 5 night stay with little sleep. We found the staff on reception and the female concierge to be less than willing to help however Yuri was an excellent help, who went above and beyond for us and spent about an hour on Saturday;3
Came for a 2 day business trip. When I arrived I received a complimentary room upgrade which was nice. The front desk and concierge are lovely and very helpful. The room was nice - but - you could either turn the heater on and bake, or turn it off and be a little cold. In addition the toilet blocked up which was not pleasant. Luckily it happened just as I checked out... Great restaurant, just a little pricy. I would come again, but they should pay attention to the little details, as these are what make the difference between a nice stay and a great stay.;3
"Check-in staff very enthusiastic about the newly updated property.  Lobby looked nice and clean.  Rooms small, air conditioning filter hadn't been changed in forever!    Coffee table was a large hunk of glass with sharp edges, not sure who thought that would be good for a kid friendly hotel next to universal????  parents watch those edges.  TV is from the dinosaur flat panel beginnings....maybe a 32"" but looked more like a 20"" computer monitor.  Food is ok and not much else around for off property dining.  Won't be back for next Universal trip.";3
The check-in process was efficient. And the lobby presents nicely.  The disappointment is that this is a hotel with interior rooms that face exterior walls of the hotel only. And the view is not pretty. Water stains from the heating/ac unit make for a very unattractive view (see photos.)  When I was about to go out for a drink about 11 pm, I realized that I could not control the heat. It was about 83F in the room! I went to the front desk and reported that the thermostat isn't working. He told me to try the unit on the wall. I did. It also was not functioning. So I went downstairs again, and this time another employee tried to fix it. He could not. So I was given another room.  The new room had a working thermostat. But the room is not designed for queen bed. There was not desk;3
"stayed 2 nights at the Hilton universal city just 8 minutes walking from Universal studios. That's the main attraction here. The hotel rooms are outdated. The t.v. in my room was about a 32"" t.v. who would expect that at the Hilton. I've stayed at Hampton Inns with 40"" t.v.'s.  Also the carpeting was a little on the worn side. But the main floor of the Hotel is where they spent the money. There is a nice lobby with sofa's, free Lemon water, and a nice restaurant (very pricy). The shuttle to the Universal Studio runs every 20 minutes. or you can walk, 8 minutes. Also, there is no negotiating with the parking situation. They charge everyone 24 dollars a nights! Another way for the hotel to make money. Absurd.!  Probably won't stay here again even though I got a great rate on the";3
Great location for 5 nights but first impression was not a nice area to be in.  Easy walk to theatres and time square and Empire State Building   Recommend a hop on hop off bus tour to get orientated.  Didnât realise you had to ask for a fridge in room until we were unpacked and canât even make a cup of tea. Bed was very comfortable. The kicker was $5 per bag to store when checking out and the resort fees per day for nothing!! What a rip!!!;3
The description says its just a couple short stops from Times Square - it makes the distance to the center of town a little misleading.  Its 8-9 stops on the local train and we never saw the express.  However, the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean, and they were very good about storing luggage for us.   We got a handicap accessible room so I think it was bigger than most.  The room itself was a little dated, and the floor a little uneven - but overall we slept well!;3
"Stayed here for one night while visiting the city for a concert festival.  We had actually attended a party here in the lobby a few years back and forgot just how great the location was - right next to Lincoln Center and blocks from Central Park.  I was able to get our room for a decent Saturday night rate (in other words, expensive anywhere else, but moderately digestible for NYC). The room was fine - no view, but comfortable bed with a tiny, but updated bath.  Looking closer at anything revealed the wear and tear.  We hit up the lobby bar after our concert.  It is a trendy little spot.  We had a few glasses of wine and some snacks and really enjoyed ourselves.  We would return; overall, it's a adequate hotel in a great spot.";3
The hotel is well located and the staff, especially the concierge were very helpful.  The lifts were very temperamental and we often stood there for several minutes before we got it up to our floor.  The dÃ©cor was very tired looking and could do with smartening up.  Although we had been allocated a deluxe twin, it was on the small side and there wasn't much room in the bathroom and in fact when the bathroom door was shut there was quite a bit of dirt behind the door.  The bed was comfortable.  I was very surprised that there was a charge to use the coffee machine in the room.  Thank goodness there was a Starbucks next door.;3
The hotel is a few streets from Harlem but the area itself is just opposite Central Park and quiet and we felt very safe.   We stayed in room 309, and had a view of Central Park, (I reckon any room number ending in 06, 07, 08 or 09 will have a view of the park, other rooms look onto a crappy courtyard).  We were just 2 mins walk from the subway (A, B & C lines).  We had a double room, which was nice and clean, comfy bed, great shower, tv (some rooms have a dodgy reception) and our room cleaned every day.  The only negative things were that we could hear the room next door when people are walking around as the floors seem to be thin.  Also, there was a wet patch of water coming through our celing on the first night from the bathroom above, but we informed reception of this and;3
I stayed at the Empire Hotel for business.  Terrific location & a hop-skip to the subway.  Very key.  The Empire Hotel was a bit of a flea bag the last time I was there.  But that was over 10 years ago.  The NEW Empire has had a makeover.  The lobby is a little too dark for me.  It felt more like the lobby of a nightclub -- not a hotel.  But the staff was friendly & efficient.    The room was a good size.  The mattress & the decor was above average.  Overall, the room was solid.  But beware of the bathroom.  Besides being tiny (not a surprise), the sink isn't very deep & the faucet is just a few inches away.  Not big deal right?  Well, turn on the water & there's a good chance you'll create a little mess.  But hey, it's just a lilttle water right?  Well, how about if you're;3
A lovely hotel and a fabulous deal for a hotel in Los Angeles. Good room rates and a free breakfast buffet included. All good! .. right? ... My only criticisms are that it's location is a bit too far east if your business takes you to West Hollywood and further west.  And the breakfast is great but the coffee is weak and the juices watered down.  Go elsewhere for your breakfast beverages.;3
Empire is a boutique hotel â defined by me as:  small rooms, funky plumbing, some charm but very hip.  If you are attending Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall, Columbus Circle or even the upper East or West sides â then the hotel is a perfect location. I thought it was pricey - $304.89 on Thurs. and $382.68 for Fri and Sat nights (tax included) â my last big city experience being Philadelphia â but others tell me that is a reasonable NYC charge.  The room had a view of the rest of the hotel â so the shade was down all the time.  The staff was fine â in that NYC detached way.  The valet suggested I find my own overnight parking which would be less expensive than the EMPIRE $60 a night â and it was.  I used best parking in NYC and found a nearby garage for $98 + $7 tip â for the 3;3
Myself and my sister stayed in a twin room with private bathroom.  The room was very small and basic, however clean and manageable for a short stay.  Really good position for getting around London, Hammersmith tube station is a 2 minute walk up the road.  Lots of shops, restaurants and bars also 2 minutes up the road.;3
We are a family of 4 adults now and the beds were small but doable but we are average size people. If youâre tall or large it would be hard to sleep two. The rooms are spacious though. Good location and the price is on the low end so no complaints;3
We selected this Hotel because they offered free shuttle to Universal Studios. The price compared to other hotels around was higher and they charge additionally $20 Self Parking or $25 Valet Parking per day. As Hilton Honors member they offered $55 ticket at the check-in when booked online. When we checked in, there were no tickets available for this price and of course they offered a ticket at their hotel, which was fine because it was the same price. Maybe a trick to sell more at their hotel.   We were four people in one room, so I had pre-ordered extra set of towels online, a free service offered to Hilton Honors. Disappointed that it was not there. Had to call front desk 2 times and wait for about 30 min until they finally brought us extra towels.  The room was nice with a;3
Pros: Great location - close to Penn Station - walkable to Times Square. Clean rooms but they could use some updating. Wi-Fi worked perfectly. Rooms were sound proofed.  Cons: 3 out of 5 elevators were out of service...so long waits. bathrooms were ancient. No coffee machines in the room. (Starbucks across the street) They charge a 'resort fee' upon check out...;3
I stayed two nights. The room was very nicely appointed but also very small. I have a hard-sided suitcase that opens like a book (bi-fold) and there was literally no place to put it on the floor where it wouldn't completely block the path/walkway in the room. I had to step over the suitcase to get past it. The bathroom is also nice appointed but very, very small. There is no wastebasket in the bathroom because there literally is no place to put it. The overhead shower is nice but the controls are very confusing. The WiFi in the hotel is incredibly slow. Good for email but not much else.;3
Iâd seen The New Yorker many times on holiday sites and hotel booking pages but never visited previously.  Location wise, youâre at the rear of Madison Square Gardens so pretty central and itâs easy to access both my office and most of touristy Manhattan.  The hotel would once have been very grand indeed but has certainly seen better days.   The reception, sorry lobby is spacious but with few check in counters for some reason. The lifts / elevators are guarded by security but they do helpfully point you towards the right set on your first visit (and can also guide you to the gym (basement level) if needed.  My room was spacious with a dual aspect, a rarity in any major city. The bed was comfortable but overall the room was again a little Spartan. The furniture will need to be;3
room was good, hotel good, location ok, but if you have a car doesnt matter, breakfast was good. found some tiny cockroaches in the toilet.;3
A great location...about 1/2 way between the San Fernando Valley and the city of LA.   Nice, thoughtful staff...we were upgraded to a suite as our room was not yet ready.  The property itself, however, is showing its age.  It is a nice property...that would be even nicer with a fresh, new look.   Don't let this keep you away...but don't expect to be 'wowed!' by the look and feel when you get here.;3
Had to ask how to turn on the AC. Would have liked to see small desk/hutch & chair/stool for my laptop & notes. Had to pull dresser over and sit on edge of bed. Staff was accommodating & helpful, though. This was probably a more run-down place in the past, but they appear to be making efforts to upgrade things. I would stay here again.;3
Well Iâm not sure where to begin here really ... me and my partner stayed here for 7 nights during January 2018.   We had an early flight into JFK & headed straight to the hotel. We were told very quickly that there was no chance of an early check in so we left out cases and went off for the afternoon. When we arrived back we got our room... we had the top floor so squeezed in to the tiny lifts and got to our room. Which from what we could work out was one of the ârefurbishedâ rooms although it looked like I had been done about 10 years ago. It was very well used!! On the plus side the heating definitely worked!!   We were lucky enough to have no issues with the room, everything we needed worked, the bed was comfy and considering we were in New York the hotel was basically;3
Chose the hotel's rooftop bar to host a cocktail reception for my wedding.  Can't say enough about the staff who ran the reception... they did a wonderful job and my guests were thrilled with the location and food.  The hotel, however, was not all that it was cracked up to be.  The staff seems overwhelmed with even the smallest requests and the rooms are really just not worth the prices they charge.  There are just too many good hotels in NYC to come back to this one.  Sorry Empire.;3
After checking all budget hotels this one was had good location and affordable price. One bedroom room was ok no TV or private bathroom. The bathroom was shared next to the room. Overall solid budget hotel in NY, subway is 5 min away and you will reach downtown in 15 minutes. If you are on budget and looking a place just to sleep in this one is for you.;3
Due to a sudden bereavement, this was not our originally booked hotel, as it wasn't available, but location of The Newyorker is brilliant! Our window overlooked Madison Square Garden! Couldn't have been better for the subway, it was just at the side door, and the main Penn Station was across the road! Our time here had unfortunately been cut down by a day, but we got here, and the staff at the hotel are all excellent, from what we experienced anyway.  It is definately Art Deco in its furnishings, but rooms were lovely and clean, comfy bed and nice big TV, your not in it that long anyway! Would definately consider it again, if on location alone.;3
Hotel rooms are in need of an upgrade.  You get what you pay for in NYC.  I like the location, your in a neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and bars.Easy access to subway downtown. Bed was OK.  Room was kinda small for four people, next time I would get two rooms.;3
Hotel was a decent choice. Location is excellent and close to Penn Station. Price was low and room was as you would expect for that. Not the cleanest and not the best, but fine for the cost. Staff was not as friendly as you would expect.;3
"I have stayed at Hilton Hotels in Europe, Asia & Africa. I normally associated the Brand Hilton with quality. The USA Hiltons have proven me wrong. I stayed at the Hilton by Universal studios. The initial room that I was placed in was extremely ""crummy"" no other word describes it. I complained and was upgraded to a less crummy room.  This was one of the worst hotels that I have stayed in. The Hotel looked like something straight out of a 1970's horror movie.   Most of the staff were really good, good service generally but could not make up for the shoddy appearance of the Hotel. The main lobby was fine though and the elevators were painfully slow.   Location to Universal studios was great ... I just should have booked at the Sheraton.";3
We opted for a Captains room with ensuite. Good size room, king size bed with views over the river. Beautiful original bathroom big enough to move around in. Robes. Very helpful staff. Great roof top bar. Quiet despite proximity to roadway. No coffee in room. Excellent location and facilities for the price. Highly recommended.;3
"Due to flight availability our family had to spend the night of Feb. 1 in New York as we were boarding the Norwegian Breakaway on Feb. 2. This was Super Bowl weekend in New York and we felt fortunate that we were able to get rooms. The Hotel is in the ""Heart of China Town"" and we were thrilled to take advantage of this fact.";3
We selected this hotel as one option in a wedding block, and booked a standard room. We were very disappointed with the condition of the room. The bed was not very comfortable, and we were only given 3 pillows. The A/C struggled to keep up, making sleeping very uncomfortable, even though the weather wasn't too warm. Our view was directly into other rooms and the roof HVAC fixtures. The paint and wall paper was pealing and chipping all over the room, and the room was in need of a serious renovation. The bathroom door knob was loose and close to falling out, and the sink drain must have been clogged, because it didn't drain. Without a shower curtain, the very small bathroom floor was always soaking wet. WiFi was an extra charge, and there was no bottled water in the room, except;3
I was going to the listen to the Dalai Lama at the Beacon Theater on Broadway, and found this hotel to be only a few blocks walk away in a quiet residential neighborhood.  After reading the reviews, I have some trepidation about staying there, but my stay was uneventful .  The sheets were clean, the refrigerator worked, the bathrooms were immaculate, and the shower had hot water (see pictures).  In fact the bathrooms on my floor never seemed to be in use.  The hotel is old, but the price is unbeatable for a decent private room to sleep in NYC.;3
We spent two nights at this, the only great thing about it is itâs location (walking distance from Metro station), but it doesnât justify the very high prices they charge in exchange to the value you gain hotel (We paid 632$ ð¤ª), rooms are very small, no fridge (or you can pay to get one), no breakfast included, not even a coffee machine or complementary drinking water! Fitness center is small, and there is no swimming pool, even Lobby is not a good place, for me this was my first hotel to stay at New York ever, but I wouldnât recommend or get back to it ð;3
My husband and I just spent 4 nights in this hotel. I booked it because we had already be there some years ago and we had found the position very convenient to visit the city. Moreover the hotel has a free wifi that we use a lot being abroad. However upon arrival the wifi was down end despite the reassurance it remained down through all the weekend (we arrived on a Friday evening). During our stay we read the tripadvisor's reviews and realized that we had been very lucky because our room was a renovated one so clean, with a neat bathroom and also a view. The AC was noisy but perfectly functioning. True the elevators are really slow, smelly and hot and the second set is still under maintenance. The lower floors are really smelly too (a curry smell came in when the elevators' door;3
We are just back from 4 nights at The New Yorker.  The location is superb but the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  The staff were friendly enough but the whole hotel needs gutting, I appreciate it is an art deco style hotel and some features in reception are very charming, but it needs totally refurbishing, our room was clean enough but so so dated and I doubt it's been touched since it was built, it felt very old, dreary and depressing.  The worst thing about the hotel was the lifts, we would wait up to 15 minutes morning and evening for lifts down to reception and then back up to our floor again after a day out!  There were at least 3 lifts out of order with no signs informing anyone of this, the queues of people waiting for lifts in the lobby was ridiculous.  This really;3
Very well located. The rooms are dirty and the feanitures are too old. You should to clean up before enter and if you will spend a long time there maybe will be a good ideia buy your oun pillow and mettress.;3
So, I've been to this hotel every year for the last 4 or 5 years.  Part of an event and the rooms are arranged for such.  So we stay here versus somewhere I may want to try otherwise.  Overall, the hotel is fine.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the place is clean and there food was good.  But the elevators are horrible.  Last year we ended up waling down form like the 10th floor.  This year we had to literally jump out of the elevator at an unknown floor because it was going up and down, not stopping and opening randomly.  And it wasn't just one time or us.  All the guests were complaining and I tihnk the hotel knew there was an issue but wasn't really aknowledging it.  Be transparent, let us know there is an issue.  At times we'd wait 10 minutes for one of 5 elevators to;3
Arrived at The New Yorker Hotel and I am very disappointed so far.  Staff at front desk, not exactly welcoming or even helpful, a touch rude to be honest.   Once arrived told we have to pay an extra fee for the honour of using the WiFi, phone calls and gym, none of which we need but not optional.  I wouldn't class this hotel as spotless in anyway, it's quite dated, shabby to say the least in many areas and as for the room, Queen with a view, don't bother.  No coffee machine, no fridge unless you want to pay an extra 65 dollars a day.   Let's see how the rest of the week  goes.;3
Cons:  A little old and definitely a little tired.  Rooms are small and thereâs no minibar.    Pros: Reasonably priced for NYC.  Clean, excellent service, excellent location for us taking the Amtrak and arriving at Penn Station.  Rooms are small but serviceable, and thereâs certainly enough room.   Bottom line is the next time I come back on the train, Iâll stay here again.;3
"PRO's **Location is fantastic - close to Lincoln Center, Central Park and Columbus Circle - easy access to subways too.  **The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the hotel itself was very well appointed.   CON's **We reserved (and were provided) a room with two double beds - it was small...almost painfully so.  **The bathroom was so small that you had to actually step into the bathroom and shut the door before you sat on the toilet.  **Ice buckets - maybe its the hallmark of a good hotel (no filling of the ice bucket yourself) but I found it a bit off-putting **Rooftop pool - this ""pool"" (if you can even call it that) doesn't have a view as touted. The pool is sunken into a portion of the rooftop bar area and the skyline is largely obscured by a wall. Furthermore, the";3
The location is the biggest selling point. Its literally right behind the London Eye. We even had a view of the river (from the side).  The staff are fantastic too and there is a free left luggage facility for guests.  The breakfast has a good selection and the dining room is nice.  The family room was huge. Almost too big because it felt half empty of furniture but still a great size for a family. Cleanliness let them down. Uneaten chocolates on the floor, dirt in places. It felt clean enough to use, but just don't look too closely.  We had a few annoying issues here though. The bed was not the normal premier Inn bed. It was smaller and harder. It looked tiny against the large bed frame that's built for their normal size beds.  The mattress was firm and the pillows were so;3
This is a nice 4* hotel, well furnished and literally 5 minutes walk from Universal Studios. I stayed here for 2 days and the hotel staff were very helpful and polite. The hotel is a little dated but still clean, well apportioned rooms if you get an Alcove Room like I did, and has great views over Universal Studios.;3
"Nice Retro hotel however I seriously have issues being lied to about the beds.. they state itâs a QUEEN.. itâs somewhere around 55x74 because we measured it and that is the size of a double/full.  So if you want great reviews Wyndham donât lie to people.  Our backs were killing us the entire stay and in the 3 nights Iâm sure I slept less then 5 hours each night.    Now letâs talk bathrooms.. take note; if you plan a bathroom the size of one on a cruise ship at least be smart and turn the faucet to the side so you can wash your face wifhoyt hitting your hands on the middle I stalled faucet.  As for the sink itself, itâs less then 2 inches deep so the water absolutely flows over the sides no matter how low the flow.  Showers; the showers are built with a step in recessed base of";3
This is an older hotel.  you can tell by the way the rooms are configured, hall carpet and the combination air conditioner/heater in the room.  don't expect to be able to take a bath as it is the small shower tubs.  Otherwise, the budget is right at around $120.00 & you can get Wyndam reward points.  The rooms were clean, coffee pots w. coffee & tea in all rooms.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  NY Subway is just around the corner which can take you to anywhere downtown.  Taxi fares were $15.00 from hotel to Time Square and theater districts.  You also can arrange shuttle bus service in the lobby to JFK or LaGuardia for $21.00 vs $50.00 for cab.;3
I booked this hotel in January, 11 months before our trip, as a birthday surprise for my wife, and let them know it was a special gift for her. We arrived on 23 December, and the room we were given (2129) was awful. Tiny, grim, dark. However, when we asked to change, Julia ( who is still training) went more than the extra mile to provide us with a much bigger, much more comfortable room, (2830)with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. Thanks so much to her for this, it completely changed our holiday.  The hotel itself is a bit tired. Very brown.... a new lick of paint would make a huge difference. But it's a great old Art Deco building, lots of history, and in a fantastic location. And the staff are great, very helpful (particularly Julia and Samira). The Tick Tock;3
The hotel prides itself on its history. It could use some updating from that history.   For examples -  the bathroom tub/shower has 4 knobs for water, not convenient. Also a major shortage of electric plugs.;3
Stayed here for 5 nights and on check in was told we have to pay $26 per night facilities charge . This is for wifi in hotel use of business facilities and the gym . What if you don't want to use the facilities . You still have to pay for it regardless . Not good if you are on a tight budget like myself . Only helpful person was the concierge . No tea or coffee facilities in room . Only decent thing about hotel is the location right by madison square gardens and empire state building . Would not return .;3
We stayed here twice, a week apart during late April and then mid-May. On arrival the hotel has a big lobby area, but was clearly very busy, with masses of bodies filling the area, checking in, and out. There was also a curious smell in the Lobby area, that existed across the hotel to a lesser extent.  We were unable to check in early, and in fact not even on time, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes the first time, and longer the second time. Checkin is reasonably straight forward, however the delays in getting rooms means there are often queues of people waiting.   We booked a two room suite each time, and although the first suite was cheaper, for the same number of days, it was far better, on the 22nd Floor (of 40). The second suite was much smaller, and less comfortable;3
Really small rooms, but since i didn't plan to hang out in the hotel i really didn't mind! Bathrooms and showers are shared in the corridor. they were always clean and rarely occupied. helpful relaxed staff. the room was way too hot though. The heat was controlled centrally so don't know what happened. even though i had the fan on and the window open it was almost 25 degrees celsius in the room. But overall an okay hotell.;3
"I stayed here back in December and gave the place 5-stars.  Love the location!  Last time the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  And, last time my husband and I got upgraded to a really nice room.  This time I was alone and OK with no upgrade. The room was very nice, though quite small, and I did keep banging my shins on the bed...  But the reason I am giving them 3-stars now was because of the lack of REAL coffee in the room.  Here is what you get:  There is a Keurig maker, and you get (4) complimentary pods....not per day...(4) for your stay.  After that - you pay for them.  And they are not all coffee: My room's 4-designated pods were: green tea, hot cocoa, flavored coffee, and one half-caffeinated coffee.  And, ""NO!"" you cannot switch out the pods you don't";3
The hotel does the basics right, but generally seems quite worn down and out of date.It seems like they're trying with a pool, roof top bar, gym etc - however all of these amenities really aren't recommendable.Bed and room was clean though.;3
Stayed there in March 2012.  The room was very very very small. Too much furniture in it, but in saying that, you dont spend a lot of time in the room.   What got me about this place was that they are doing renovations downstairs, but in the parts that guests dont use.  The restaurant for breakfast was pretty average, and the food pretty basic, but ive had worse.  Some of the staff were great, and some not too good.  The lift was the slowest i have ever been in. As far as attractions, we just caught the subway (a five minute walk).  If you stay there, about a 10 minute walk down the road is a fabulous 50`s Restaurant, definately worth a look and you must try their Shakes.  As far as safety was concerned, it was ok. I would recommend it, for the price anyway.;3
I was very disappointed when I got to the front desk and the staff was unaware of the promotional  items that were listed on the website  and I was even more disappointed because they did not even try to resolve the issue for you   when you find a reservation online for the days inn please call the checking reservation to make sure you're getting the same promotional deal that's  advertised on the website before you go to the actual hotel and is not given to you at the front desk.  Because they have a promotional deal for a manager special that has early check in at 1pm in late check out at 1pm.  Make sure it's noted with your reservation before you get to the hotel so call a days in advance;3
"Hotel was OK, but I am always offended by bottles of water being placed in the room with price tags on them. The room is over $200. a night - Hilton can spring for a few bottles of water! Concierge was very helpful; local restaurant (Prosecco) was excellent and reasonable.";3
Room was old and very small although we booked suit. Room doors made too much noise from neighbors. Service was not good and took in some cases more 40 minutes to arrive. Breakfast does not include eggs or ham , just bread and some butter, cream cheese. Too crowded.if you arrive late you are busted  They charge for each bag when you store it in their store room. Great location.;3
My husband and I stayed here on Valentine's Day because of it's close proximity to Lincoln Center.  We arrived about 1:30 pm and knew our room probably wouldn't be ready until the 3pm check-in time.  The man at the front desk asked for our cell # and said they'd call us when the room was ready.  We went out for a stroll through Central Park and around 3pm started to head back to the hotel.  We never received a call but assumed the staff didn't call because we knew check-in was at 3.  We planned to go back to the room, relax for 30+ minutes and then shower for our 5pm dinner reservation.  When we went to get our key from the front desk it was approximately 3:10.  We were told our room had a problem and we would have to wait 15 minutes more.  I was highly annoyed because the man;3
Great location and friendly staff. Liked the interior, but it was a little old. The air-condition was very nosy and the air in the room was bad. Old elevator.  The sundeck was nice, but the swimming-pool is very small. Nice for kids.;3
Really good if you want a cheap place to stay. It's pretty basic, but for the price it's fine. Fridge and crockery in the room was a plus. Bathrooms could be better, but they were fine. Don't understand all the doors in the hallways, I guess they're there to keep noise out? But they're so inconvenient when you have luggage. Be aware that there's no free wifi! Location is good for Heathrow, but it's about 25min to Piccadilly Circus.;3
The rooms were clean, the place was ok. The breakfast selection was a bit average, but the omelets were nice. I don't know about the fruit selection. a few black spoted bananas and some cut up in pieces sitting there for a long period of time. The carpet in the dinning area were rinkled and could give an old person a real nasty fall. The day staff were excellent. Very helpful and nice. The guy at night that organised me a taxi for the next morning ripped me off. Sounded like he knew the guy personally. $98 to go 36mile. Said that was the going price and there wasn't much cheaper. I find out the next day it was an express limo.  The area is a little dirty but felt safe there. Black spots of chewing gum remains all over the sidewalks around the area. The metro rail is close by;3
We stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for 3 nights in December.  I asked for an Empire State Building view, which was accommodated. We stayed in room 2222.  I believe it was a metro view double room.  It was very large for my family of 4.  Beds were comfy and bathrooms were of an OK size.  This hotel is extremely busy.  The staff was not friendly.  When we checked out, we had to wait an hour for our car to take us to the airport.  During this time, my 6 year old son had to use the restroom.  We waited for 25 minutes in line for security to give us a card to use the bathroom. You need a card to get to the bathrooms!  I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends or family.  The friendliest employees of this hotel were the housekeepers!;3
Beautiful classic hotel in a great location with great customer service. It was worth every penny we paid ($200 with a great Kayak deal). We even were allowed to check in early and were upgraded! The room needed some updates but the location and service made up for the lackluster interior of the room.;3
We booked the Ameritania due to it's close proximity to central park and the NY Marathon finish.  The hotel has some really glowing reviews on Tripadvisor & whilst we thought it was a good comfortable option for what we needed, I am not sure it was anything out of the ordinary in terms of look & feel or service.  I wouldn't particularly say it was great value for money given we paid cÂ£1,000 for 4 nights but I accept we would have been booking on a peak weekend given the marathon.  The hotel itself is very dark & nowhere near as bright as the pictures look on the website.    We had a Deluxe room and I certainly wouldn't recommend going for a standard, we saw our friends room & you could hardly walk round the bed (they had already asked to move once because their original room was;3
It used to be that booking a suite meant a spacious set of rooms on a high floor (38-40) and included a kitchenette, but whern I arrived this February I was given a small set of rooms, without kitchen facilities on the 7th floor, witjh no view at all and barely any natural daylight. I was moved once a better room became available but even then, I had to give up my current room before the new one was available and was told that I would have to move the luggage myself. The staff are generally helpful and the hotel had to cope with a revolving door and half the lifts being out of service. I had booked here for several years in succession prior to this, so overall I like staying there, but now I have to at least conisder alternatives;3
Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, its in a good location right opposite Universal Studios within easy walking distance. Although it was a little ridiculous of the hotel not to feature an actual pathway to the main road, instead you have to walk partly on the grass and partly in the road. When booking this hotel we were led to believe it was part of the Universal resort, certainly did not feel like it was. The room didn't feature a single leaflet about the parks opening times, etc. Although it did have a big hard back book all about upgrading to a VIP experience at Universal!!!  Room was a non-smoking alcove room that smelt of cigarettes. It was a nice size with a very large bathroom, bed and Air Con. Let down by no shower gel, awful water pressure and despite the price had no;3
"The bunkbed room was very small (as visible on the pictures). I think two suitcases don't fit, gladly we brougt one suitcase and one backpack. There're handy hooks and two drawers under the bed, but we could only use one of the two drawers because of our suitcase on the floor. The room was clean (no bedbugs!) and the (shared) bathroom as well. The shared bathroom was comfortable and sharing was no problem at all (there're many bathrooms on every floor). The staff working in the Jane was very nice and very helpful. We felt very welcome. There's good wifi internet. The Jane is well located; close to the High Line (3 minutes), the subway (10 minutes) and the hotel is located next to the Hudson. With the free bicycles of the hotel we cycled the ""waterfront greenway"" along the river.";3
We stayed at this hotel first week of february for four nights .  Our room was one of the courtyard room which was quite.                                                     Hotel is in a strange locatÄ±on on a very busy road.Nowhere pleasent or interesting to walk. Upon check-in the reception staff was rude.even didn't made an effort to greet us. We had to load up our luggages to the troley and push it to our room.Same as check out. Room was clean and size was ok,beds were cofortable.Cleaning service was the best. Bathroom was very basic.Nice toÄ±letteries. Free Wi Fi in room worked well. Complimentery breakfast was good. Parking was secure paid 18 dolar for a night. Hollywood Hotel was a good budget hotel.;3
We stayed for a couple of nights given we spent a day at Universal Studios and basically were disappointed.  We felt there were a number of negatives as follows:-  The response to requests for further room items (shower gel, make up pads) was poor to such an extent that on more than one occasion we did not get what we asked for! Sound proofing between rooms was poor. The ambiance within the current  temporary bar was non existent. The restaurant is set up in school dinner style. OK for breakfast but too sterile for enjoying an evening meal. Surprised no complimentary water supplied.  There were positives but well outnumbered by the negatives. The positives were:- Good location for visiting Universal  Studios and park. The room was comfortable but should be for the price charged!;3
"I was looking for a cheap place to stay in the centre of NYC, that was convenient for seeing all the sites, going clubbing, and in a safe location. This hotel ticked all three boxes.   Although the place was moving with bugs, there were cigarette burns in the duvet cover, the walls were filthy, slander was scrawled over the ""Do not disturb"" door hanger, scorch marks on the walls, the radiator didn't work, and the fan in the window was held in with duct tape. But I liked it. We shared a bathroom with the whole floor and the window (that looked out on to an alley) didn't close. So everyone could see you. But still I liked it!  It was in a great location, five minutes walk from Times Square - the neighbourhood was really nice and there was a great little eatery just down the road.";3
The location is ideal, the subway is 2mins across the road and 5min walk to Central Park. $52 fare from JFK in a cab plus extras and tip so expect up to $70 in total.  If you are sight seeing I'd recommend the Green Bus company being the easiest to get around and the fabulous concierge Chris (I think) got us a great deal at $45 each for 3 days hop on hop off!  UK visitors don't be intimidated by the subway either as it's much easier than the London tubes.   We were on honeymoon and the lovely staff sent up a bottle of champers for us, nice touch. We had an express queen room which I wouldn't recommend unless your travelling solo for one night. The desk did tell us when they checked us in they don't normally sell it and I can see why! You have no floor space and we had 2 large;3
Booked via Travel Rupublic for 5 nights- it does state on web site that there is a resort fee to be paid at the hotel but after researching this and reading previous reviews this seemed to be optional based on services used. This fee is NOT optional. The services you are paying $31 a night for are Wifi- which is advertised as âfree internetâ on trip advisor and other booking sites- so it is not free, use of the gym- who the hell comes to NYC for a few days to waste their time in the gym?, use of the business centre- again why on earth would I want to do that unless I was here on business- which I was not and for making international calls from the room telephone- well being organised I have a bundle on my mobile for that so again did not use. My husband confronted management;3
no upgrade offered, asked for univeral view but got hill view. Restaurant full of people, waited half an hour for my drink but got the wrong one.;3
The first night of our stay we were on the second floor facing the street. It was so noisy outside that none of us slept well. We asked to be moved to a quieter room the next night and ended up in a smaller, interior room and it was perfectly quiet. Boy, did we wish we had been there the first night too. Great location. Clean, with the exception of the lobby bathroom which was in rough shape. Helpful staff.;3
Let me preface this by saying that I've stayed at the New Yorker before and had a great experience. This time, however, I was disappointed. I had two separate reservations, one booked using reward points, that I subsequently upgraded to ensure that my room included a view and some of the other perks that were offered. My second reservation was booked through Club Wyndham, four days and three nights in the City. When I checked in, the desk clerk mentioned that I did have two reservations, but she was going to work backward. What I ended up with, was a shoebox of a room without a view, coffee maker or refrigerator - so my upgrade was null and void.   I did appreciate the security at the hotel and that guests are required to show a room key before heading to the elevators. Bell;3
Got a family suite based off of pictures on hotels website. Great location, excellent staff, the room on the other hand was severely lacking.  Half the size of what was pictured on the intenet and the bathroom was pretty busted and could use a refresh.;3
Although the public areas are nice the standard bedrooms (at least the one we were allocated) are poor.  The AC unit in ours(807) was incredibly noisy and the view from our window was of a brick wall, not something you want to pay 4* prices for! After complaining we were moved to room 1018 which was much nicer. Good location if you want to be at the Lincoln centre but otherwise a bit too far out.  Better to choose a hotel in the 30's to 40's, especially if you want to walk to everything .......Empire is on 63rd.;3
I had high hopes of this hotel as we had paid for a superior room. Unfortunately the only superior thing was the view of Lincoln Square which gave us a real sense of being in NY. The location is excellent: very close to the subway & 1 block away from fabulous Central Park. The Upper West side area has a really nice ambience. Right on Broadway we could walk to many key areas - Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, 5th Avenue etc. The hotel feels 'tired' even though it has obviously had a contemporary make-over....but so dark and gloomy.... not attractive in my opinion. As stated the bathrooms are tiny and badly designed. Beds were very comfortable and sleep quality was excellent. This was a special 60th birthday trip and the receptionist mentioned this as we checked in so I thought;3
Location, location, location! we stayed here only because of that as I think the rooms and hotel in general is overpriced, the rooms and building could use some updating, our room was super tiny but is just what we needed since we were out most of the day. We also went during xmas time which meant high prices.The staff were friendly upon check in, it was fast and easy. This hotel is super close to some main attractions, the Empire State Building is maybe a 10 min walk away, the subway and MSG is right across from it and if you don't mind walking you can make it all the way down to Times Square (we did that a couple of times), all in all I would stay here again if it were the only budget choice close to attractions and subway.;3
I stayed here in August in one of the standard cabins on the 5th floor (room 534). I had read reviews online after I had already booked and was very worried about bed bugs. I requested a room that was bed bug free and was told that the 5th floor generally was not yet infested.   The room was VERY small, smelled of cigarette smoke and wasn't stylish at all. Dirty carpets, bathrobes with holes and worst of all in the august heat no aircon and only a very basic fan.   I had hoped for a pocket sized boutique hotel, but got a bog standard hostel instead.   The location is great if you want to get a feel for the real west village life away from the tourist sites. Great restaurants and cool bars within walking distance. A very safe area.   I didn't see the captains rooms, so cannot;3
We stayed here for 3 nights...the first night we changed rooms as the carpet was saturated and smelt bad also there was a motor of some kind right at our window and the noise was pretty bad. That night my friend and i had to share a bed as there were no other rooms. We finally got a decent room with 2 beds but it was small. Water cost $8 a bottle and coffee was $3 a pod. Bathroom was the size of a closet. It was in a great location and we recieved 2 free breakfasts each and did not have to pay for the first night. Staff were helpful and nice. I would stay again if for a short stay.;3
The lower floors are not quiet. Also, if you happen to get hurt, do not expect compassion. The hotel earns brownie points by being so close to universal studios, but the Sheraton is also close. I would rather have spent more at the Sheraton next door and received a quiet nights sleep than paid a little less and receive a poor stay.;3
I booked without reading the reviews, these were very negative. I was a bit scared to be honest, especially about the bedbugs... When we checked in I was positively surprised. The rooms were basic, but very clean. Also the facilities were regularly cleaned. Apparently they made improvements after the feedback. The only downside was the hallway, the fire escapes were open all the time. Which made it very cold and easy accessible for people outside! Location is very nice, the center is easily accessible and there are a lot of little restaurant and pubs in the neighborhood. I recommend this for (young) couples of groups of friends.;3
Directly across from Lincoln Center, this is a nice hotel with good rates, albeit with a very dark, loungy sort of atmosphere.  Everything everywhere, is dark: dark wood, dark lighting, dark carpeting, dark dark dark.  It's a little disorienting, frankly.  The rooms are attractive (and dark), but my mattress was much too soft.  Also the in-room desk was totally covered by the coffee machine and a huge tray of for-purchase snacks, making the desk totally unusable until I went through the trouble of moving everything onto the floor or into the wardrobe.  (As in most Manhattan hotels, the rooms are small, so this in turn made things even more cluttered.)  And so much as I can remember, this the only hotel I've ever stayed in that charges you for the in-room coffee.  Three dollars a;3
Great location , very basic hotel , clean and warm , a little tired looking but as we were there to explore the city we didn't spend too much time in the room , would have liked tea and coffee making making facilities though!   Very difficult to get hold of once you've departed , we have lost our camera and have tried several ways to contact , but still waiting !!;3
Loved the location of this hotel.   The lobby is pretty, the rooms were small but doable and very typical for new york city.   Oveall the staff was incredibly unfriendly.  The only exception was the bellman on our last day who assisted with our bags and getting a taxi.  Front door, desk clerks, and bar servers all need customer service training.;3
First, to be clear, I am a fan of the Empire Hotel and this was a return stay. I plan to return in the future too. But I do want to mention several challenges this stay.  I made a reservation for the Empire through Booking.com for 4 adults in a 2 bed room back in September,   I called a few days prior to the stay and spoke specifically to the front desk ... I confirmed that two members of my party would be arriving ahead of me. I wanted to confirm we would be able to split the amount owed as listed on my booking.com reservation. She said that would be fine -- that $150 would be put on hold, then everyone could settle up at the end of our stay.  My fellow traveler was told that she would have to put the entire amount on her card at checkin. She said she spoke to three different;3
The hotel seems ok to me: it is rather well located, close to times sq., many deli shops and right next to penn station and the moynihan train hall, just a small walk away from the 5th ave. and very close also to hudson yards and the high line. The lobby is good looking in a nyc art deco style. Once inside the elevators seem a bit old and not very well kept but they have many cars to serve the whole place. The floors look a bit odd with large aisles with no atmosphere. The rooms are rather small but good enough. They are simple with just a few spaces for stuff and a decent bathroom with a gas station-like wc but clean enough. (The shower had an amazing pressure I haven't seen before). They charge you for keeping your lugagge either at check in or check out but, with me, they;3
The pictures are a bit deceiving as this is not as posh as it might appear. Our room looked a bit run down and the toilet didn't flush well, however it was quiet and comfortable enough. We stayed on the first floor. Outside our sliding door was a tiny patio, however outside that was a courtyard that had a fountain, candles and  chairs, tables and couches. It was a nice area, except there was what looked to be a bar that was being worked on by a worker.   They have a very nice free breakfast with an omelet bar and a nice dining area. It appears they have a comedy club and bar, but I didn't see it open. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but it is Hollywood. I felt safe in the hotel.   My brother and sister-in-law stayed in the jacuzzi suite and it was very nice for the price. The;3
The rooms were clean, the staff was very nice, and it's a very close walk to Universal Studios.  Drinks and meals are very expensive here ($30/pp for breakfast)($20 for 1 beer and 1 Kahlua coffee).  You have to pay for wifi, which is commonly provided now at no-cost to guests at even lower end hotels, and you have to go stand in line for checkout - no bill under the door.  I recommend making the short walk to Universal City Walk for meals.;3
Kept me for nearly two hours saying that they have not received the credit card payment . I couldnât do my Big Bus tour because of that . Was staying only one night in NY. Hence it was big time lost for me. Guest service and facilities you canât even compare for what you get in my city ...Dubai;3
This bar on the top floor of the hotel has some wonderful views. The issues are very inattentive service and appetizers of poor quality.  They do have happy hour pricing but getting service is clearly an issue. I would return except for the very careless manner in n which it runs. I am frankly surprised that this place functions at all. The personal  here  are hired  firvtge it looks snd certainly not fir brains. Very disappointing;3
Plus : (1) Excellent buffet breakfast, (2) Excellent relaxed friendliness of staff, (3) Nice view, (4) Bed O.K. Minus : (1) Difficult location towards city because of position on hill - coming back upwards to hotel is not that easy and taxis are difficult to find/not willing to do the short distance (only Universal Studio is very easy to each), (2) Bedroom a bit worn out, (3) Basic bathroom with minimal luxury and lack of basic soap products;3
Cons:  A little old and definitely a little tired.  Rooms are small and thereâs no minibar.    Pros: Reasonably priced for NYC.  Clean, excellent service, excellent location for us taking the Amtrak and arriving at Penn Station.  Rooms are small but serviceable, and thereâs certainly enough room.   Bottom line is the next time I come back on the train, Iâll stay here again.;3
For a weekend at Lincoln Center, we couldn't have had a better location.  We were able to walk to everything, including Central Park.  The bed was comfortable and the staff could not have been more gracious.  The price was reasonable enough that if we are back in the area again we'd probably consider returning.  But.... 1.  Those bathrooms?  What were they thinking?  I understand small, but why isn't there a door over the entire shower stall, or, if there's only going to be a half door, why isn't there a way to put the shower head up so it doesn't throw water over the whole floor of the bathroom?  The hotel must be spending a fortune laundering the towels needed to sop up the water so we can use the bathroom and replacing the soggy toilet paper rolls.  In addition, because there;3
The view was the best part of the room, which was a huge part of us staying there. Next time I Visit Universal Studios I will look at other hotels. Breakfast was expensive and you must make up your own room. Maybe this is the norm for hotels in the area? First for me.;3
This hotel is in a great location. It's within walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk. For that it can't be beat. The lobby is very clean and spacious and the staff are very friendly. All the things I would expect from a Hilton Property.   The dinner buffet (though a bit pricey) is fantastic and offers a wide variety of food choices. Though a bit spread out and somewhat disorganized. There are entree items although share the same location as the desserts an pastries. It just seemed a bit awkward.   The pool, located on the 1st floor (lobby on 3rd floor) is a good size for a quick dip and was never really crowded. It was clean and quiet.  Two things were a little disconcerting. The carpet on the room was beyond horrible. It looked like it was about 20 years old and;3
Very short ride from airport.  We had one day lay over to Bora Bora and took the oppurtunity to take a lyft to Manhattan beach. Nice half day walk on the beach. Shopping just typical. nice bar near the volley ball courts called the Shellback.;3
Great location near Central Park, Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, etc. However, the hotel itself looks tired and needs a refresh. Rooms are small, bathrooms even smaller. Our smoke detector was dead, but the problem was resolved promptly. Long wait for bellhops to store luggage and hotel was not that busy, which was a bit annoying. Overall nothing remarkable, but good location depending on what you're doing...;3
needed a place close to Lincoln Center, Empire is located right across the street. Pasquale at the front desk was wonderfull. Answered all our questions and help us with our needs.Lots of restuarants in the neighborhood.;3
The hotel foyer is very grand - but our room for three people was tiny - not enough space for cases let alone walking from the beds to the bathroom - very disappointed.  On two days the room was not cleaned - I emailed the hotel with pictures of the dust on the TV screen and units but had no acknowledgement.    Room keys had to redone by reception several times - this was infuriating as the reception staff was not very helpful and rather unpleasant.   Door men were very pleasant!  Internet charge was a scandal and really unreliable - made to pay for a service which never worked !!!!  The only good thing about the hotel was the location - great for getting round New York;3
"For a budget-priced property with a near-Hollywood location, it's a pretty good deal. Rooms are smallish but well-equipped, with a few glitches like a broken hair dryer and missing bathroom hooks. My main complaint was that we were not informed that the ""complimentary hot American breakfast buffet, featuring everything from cereal to omelets to coffee"" heralded on the website and reaffirmed in my reservation confirmation was unavailable due to COVID until after we had checked in. Instead, we were given a map to area restaurants, none very close.";3
From arrival you are in opulent surrounding from the entrance through reception and the lobby and bar. Step out of the lift and you wonder where all the opulence went. It is clear to see where the priorities lie with the Empire and it is in it's image not the substance.  Shabby tired corridors and rooms, our shower was a bit tempramental to set but once done it was quite good although the extraction was pityfully inadequate.  The room itself was clean and resonably fitted out BUT no cupoard, only a curtained off space. Everything is extra in the room and wildly overpriced.  The lobby bar was a great place to hang out after 10pm, and the cocktail service is superb. I liked the way the service charge was added to your bill as it saves trying to work it out for yourself.  Location;3
Nice property. The first room that I checked into was not only very small, but very old.  Although it seemed clean, it was very worn down and it had the feel of a cheap motel.  The front desk clerk changed my room and was very apologetic.  The new room that I received was still small, but it had a much better feel and smelled 10 times better.;3
Stayed here as part of a sports package for the New York marathon. Stayed in a room with a fellow runner who I had not met before. As such the room wasnât designed the best, with not much space and no lock on the bathroom door etc. Not the greatest idea for 2 strangers as such. Luckily we got on well. The hotel is nice and it is grand, but itâs a little outdated in terms of decor. The tick tock restaurant which is attached was where I had breakfast on Marathon morning, as this was allocated by the sports company. Very bad service in here. Rude waiters and we had to request to be served at least 3 times before it happened. Good location of the hotel though. Very central and can walk to most things or get the doorman to get you a cab. Amazing views though from my window;3
The location of the hotel cannot be beat.  It is opposite Lincoln Center, near Central Park, and is surrounded by shopping and restaurants, including everything that the Time Warner Center has to offer.  Broadway theaters are a very short taxi or bus ride away, and can be reached on foot in about 30 minutes.  The hotel has a nice big lobby with comfortable seats to rest or meet up.   My single room was tiny but very clean and pleasantly decorated.  The bathroom was updated since I last stayed here years ago.  There was a nice big desk but no desk light, so it was hard to get my work done.  The bed was firm and super-comfortable with good quality pillows.  One very good feature about this hotel is that the elevators are speedy - unlike many NYC hotels, there are 4 elevators and;3
The location is great, the bedding was fine, the towels and linens were clean and the wifi is easy to access and fast.  But clearly nothing has been renovated in quite some time (my daughter-in-law remembers the interiors from Gossip Girl which was ages ago).  Furniture is scuffed and scratched, wall-to-wall carpet is not particularly clean.  Even the buttons in the elevators look like they are worn down to nubs.  No coffee, tea or mini-bar in the room either.;3
I enjoyed my stay at the Empire as I attended a conference at Lincoln Center. It was so worth the $ to stay steps away from the campus.  However, the room was VERY small, the bathroom EXTREMELY small and the room just couldn't cool down for me in the middle of a cold spell during April.  Otherwise, the hotel is clean, pretty, cozy and VERY comfortable.  I stayed by myself and felt VERY safe too. The staff is exceptionally friendly.  They need to bring the price down on valet parking too. And one should not have to pay for coffee pods.  And I was given a password for wifi but not the name of the network.;3
Was here for a few nights for business, so not for Universal Studios which may have been the problem as it is clearly geared to that. I had asked for a high floor room away from the elevator - was given a low floor very close to the elevator. I asked if I could move and was told no - I am a Diamond member, so was disappointed. Room was clean, but looked tired - had an odd smell to it. Had all sorts of little thing - light bulbs burnt out that were never replaced, clock on wrong time and a really small TV for the room. I had the Diamond complimentary breakfast - which was mediocre at best - nothing seemed fresh. In general the staff didn't seem too interested either and not very friendly.;3
Stayed here 15th dec for 5 nights. Not a Christmas tree in sight, not festive at all glad that I hadn't booked to stay for Christmas. Staff who we saw were friendly but when we actually wanted some advise were told to wait for  the  concierge waited so long got better advise from the door man! We travelled with my daughter her room seemed to not be ready ie no curtains, no coffee making facilities no ipod dock as advertised, when spoke to reception told we don't have these facilities for every room , then why advertise that you do. Also you have to pay for the coffee etc. We have stayed in a lot lower rated hotel and had free drink making facilities across the globe would have expected better from here. The rooms where exceptionally hot although the outside  temp was about -5 it;3
Stayed at this hotel because there were no marriotts near by that were available. I figured hey this could be interesting new experience. The hotel was a bit pricey for the service but it was a nice place. Great food options. And the location is great for universal.;3
The New Yorker has a fabulous location in midtown close to the subway and a great number of the âmust seeâ NYC sights. Itâs architecturally stunning and the Trattoria Bianca bar and Tick Tock restaurant have great ambience and are reasonably priced.  However we had two real issues with our 4 night stay last week. First was that due to the hotel being full, the room I had booked and paid for was ânot availableâ. Despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all. The second was that the concierge tried to charge me $130 for tickets to a game at the Garden that I actually paid only $54 at MSG box office! So unfortunately I have to advise that if you choose to stay at the New Yorker, donât think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid;3
Hotel is ok.  Plan for long elevator waits, especially at busier/high traffic times.  We stayed above 20th floor and the wit was long. Room is dated and hallways are not appealing when you first step off.  The washrooms do not have space for toiletries. I guess it's due to the age of the hotel. However, location is close to a lot and close to subway stations, but is very busy.  It's good for staying if you have a short stay like we did to save on travel times.;3
I spent 3 nights here. There is no internet in the rooms so Im not sure what makes this a 4 star hotel. The giant sign was kinda tacky and gave a motel vibe. The lobby is the best part of our entire stay - free wife and looks updated. The rooms are small, pillows uncomfy and paint is peeling off the walls. The coffee and tea in the rooms is not free its $3 and you would think they would give you free water... wrong $8/ bottle. Ridiculous money grab.;3
Itâs a basic tidy hotel. Nice lobby, decent bar. Missing coffee stand in the morning, but Starbucks next door. Rooms ok, but the bathrooms are very pokey, the shower needs fiddling with. These are things that they should keep on top of. Staff are good always helpful. Location is very good next to the Lincoln Center and next to the One Train Subway. Central Park is 2mins and cool to walk around.;3
"This hotel is just across Columbus from Lincoln Center, which make the location very convenient.  The staff is very courteous and helpful.  We would not stay again because we were not comfortable in the room.  The room was small and cluttered with items that could be purchased, e.g., a laundry bag, slippers, snacks, etc.  Someone else commented about being ""nickel and dimed to death"".  I now understand what they mean.  You don't HAVE to buy the extras, but they are in the way. Our biggest problem was the uncomfortable bed. It was actually painful for my husband and interfered with his sleep.";3
This hotel is situated right in the heart of Ny and within walking distance to metro station and penn station. It offers pretty generously sized room (in regard to a NY standard) which could need a little update and conservation. But the views are beautiful the room was clean and offered everything you would expect to find. The staff is very friendly and the stay was overall very positiv and I would recommend it.;3
"I was excited for the opportunity to give the Hyatt Regency a visit - as I am a Hilton Diamond member and wanted to break my normal travel routine.    I should have just stuck with Hilton.  First the ""Best"" experience part of the review.  ROOMS:   Holy smoke!    Rooms were outstanding.    Latest tech - everything worked (except the small bedside lamp on the left side of the bed (as you are standing in front of the bed) - never could figure out how to turn that light on).    The TV (the TV itself...not the channels and engineering....see below for that), the bed, the sound-proofing, the USB plugs and outlets....the lighting, fast WiFi (and no ""sign in"" requirements).....all were remarkable.    The bathroom is amazing as well - especially the shower......great water pressure, hot";3
"We traveled as a married couple from Sydney Australia and stayed for 3 nights in Oct 2015. The Hilton delivered on amenities and the room was good however our first day we decided to sit by the pool and order drinks after a long flight. We understand that when ordering drinks we tip the bartender a few bucks but this guy decided to take whatever amount he wanted. I handed him cash and said "" take a $5 tip "" and he took $ 15 !!!..so on our next drink order i questioned the calculations and tax on their drinks and quickly worked out that Americans take o/s viisitors for a ride if they can, subsequently we didn't tip him again and he knew we were on to him. We found the front desk staff very rude and upon departure we were asked how our stay was...I started to explain what I was";3
We have just returned from this hotel, ok,  we had some minor problems, soon as reported they were fixed, staff on reception what can i say but FANTASTIC,  room and bathroom cleaned every day, absolutley spotless.I have no issues whatsoever with this hotel  you get what you pay for , lets face it yre in New York you dont want to spend all day in yre room, do you ???? Debs & margie x Chadderton England;3
First the good: The hotel in in a nice location with an easy walk to Universal Studios (we had a stroller and even with the hills, it was an easy 5-7 minute walk). The front desk staff was friendly and helpful! The pool was large and clean and they provide fresh clean towels.  The Bad: The elevator situation was brutal. They are undergoing upgrades to the elevators which caused a little bit of chaos..To be fair, they did have notices of the maintenance posted in the hotel and a staff member stationed at the elevator door in the lobby to assist guests. The concierge was not very helpful in finding transportation options for a family that requires car seats. In fact, it was suggested that we buy our own car seats to use with the services they can offer. Yeah, ok....  We ended up;3
If you stay here,book a room with a streetwiev. Be prepared that your minibar are very expensive. The staff in the reception seems  a little noninteressed but you gonna love the bellboys. The lobby is very nice. A very expensive WiFi in the rooms.;3
Everyone except the bell hop was unfriendly and very unhelpful. The location is the sole reason I would stay again. The hotel overall was not a good experience. The room was clean and the hotel was easily accessible but the staff was terrible. They told me shuttles were available but gave me conflicting information and I ended up paying for an Uber.;3
"This review is a little late-- my boyfriend and I stayed for two weekend nights back in mid- April. We read a lot of negative reviews and were, I admit, were starting to get a little worried. But here's the deal: it's fine. It's not great, it's not luxury, it's fine. It's a hotel. A Days Inn. In New York City. For less than $200/night (at least that's the rate we got). What do you expect? I've seen some of the pics posted by other reviewers; some of them are a little gross and off-putting. I am not denying that other travelers have had less pleasant experiences than we, but I can only comment on what we ourselves experienced: -Room was clean and and we felt safe-- and no, we weren't in one of the renovated rooms, either. It was dated, but as I said, it was clean and safe.The";3
The Empire is next to Lincoln Centre and near Central Park and Columbus Circle.  Thus a very good location for music and operalovers. The hotel is rated 4 stars but is in our view more towards 3 stars. Dark small rooms. Filthy dark corridors. Non functioning elevators. Expensive breakfast, $35, but definitely not worth it. So most guests went to Starbuck in the same house. No free wi-fi in the rooms,$12 per day. However, sometimes it was available free in the lobby and of course always perfect at StarbuckÂ´s. Hopeless reception which charged incidentials incorrectly to wrong rooms which caused a lot of anger and efforts for the guests. The bar was OK.;3
Stayed here for 1 night, 2 adults & 2 kids (big 15 & big 7yo) 2 small double beds. Also the toilet blocked & leaked all over the bathroom floor (it was only wee, luckily) one of those things, but not that good when its 3am & a guy plunging away @ your toilet. It didn't get fixed while we were there but we were out by 8am;3
We stayed for four nights (Nov 30 - Dec 3) while on a sightseeing/theatre trip to NYC.Got the room at a terrific price on a blind purchase discount site, and wondered if it might be too good to be true. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is old and worn, but kept clean, and the staff is very helpful and friendly. We loved the neighbourhood,and getting downtown via the Subway was easy. We were moved to a top floor larger room after the first day (they did the moving for us, so we didn't have to wait around) and really appreciated the extra space and the view.  Don't expect luxury,but it is very good value for the money.;3
The Hotel was in very good condition overall. But after we checked in on the first night, we found the room assigned to us smell auwful. We have to call front desk to ask to change to a new one. The late was perfectly fine. On the morning of second day, we went to have breakfast. According to the flyer in the room, the buffet breakfast serves newly introduced Chinese style dim sum, but I have to say they are tasteless. Other food in the buffet are just below average, and it costs us 30+ each.;3
Recently I attended UN meeting so had a chance to visit this hotel. The hotel is having just very average facilities and charges wise it is very very expensive. We had four days stay and paid almost US$1347.08. The hotel is not even included the breakfast in room rent, not even the water bottle. The towel in the bathroom were in a very pathetic conditions. The reception was just managing the show somehow. But facilities wise not much to facilitate.;3
Typical Hilton. Staff were cold and one was even irritated with me. I had booked this hotel 6 months in advance only to fine requested upgrades were not available. When I expressed concern I was given a cold stare and she began tapping her keyboard with force. Must have needed chocolate or a coffee. Anyway, the room was clean and comfy. Nice view of the highway with lots of background traffic noice 24 hours a day (and we were on the 16th floor!!!) The restaurant food was very expensive but good Great location for City Walk and the Studios;3
NO TEA OR COFFEE IN THE ROOM a basic item that is available in rooms all around the world! hotel has a great history as can be seen in the lobby of past guests we had a std room having came here from a big room in vegas this room and our friends room was not big enough to open 2 suitcases in at the same time! it was clean and tidy and the aircon worked but extractor fan in bathroom did not and where the room was so small its not very nice to be in after using the toilet especially if you have had a dodgy $1 hotdog off the street corner!;3
"We checked in after arriving from Washington DC .. at 5+pm The front desk went through the motions & was trying to clear us as fast as she could. It came across like she was ""behind"" in meeting her kpi in checking in guests. When I presented my credit card to prepay for my stay, the machine asked for a pin#. After asking her if she is able to bypass the pin# process for the electronic signing,  she said ""we need a pin#"". When I remarked that other hotels in the United States & retail outlets allowed pin# bypass, she curtly replied that our machines do not.  Later, when I asked the security staff fronting the lift systems about whether there was a water cooler in the hotel, he directed me to a staff st the Ingirnsyion Counter. The man at the Ingornation Counter was puzzled with";3
The hotel was beautiful and modern, the rooms were nice and updated. I thought the food prices were expensive. Just beware you do have to pay to park and if you park over 20 minutes to unload you get charged $13 and they will take your keys and time it.;3
We stayed at the Ameritania end of July. The doormen didca great job. They can take care of your questions. Jeff, Julian and our Morrican friend (name?) did tere very best. At the reception they also really wanted to help. Room was good, location is realy good!;3
Great hotel and friendly staff but if jet lagged brits who cannot party all night the disco from 12 midnight to 4 am is an ordeal .The staff could at least provide earplugs or put  you at the front of the hotel for the thursday /friday /saturday disco experience .Unless you are out there of course . However we would return but armed with ear defenders because it is a special place near to the Hudson River Park and the village .;3
The hotel is typical of many hotels - beautiful lobby, drab hallways and rooms. The room was of a reasonable size for a city centre. The room was clean but looked quite drab and dreary and in need of refurbishment. My main complaint was that the hotel decided to land an extra $22 per person plus tax for use of the wi-fi, phone calls, business centre and fitness centre. This is a hefty fee and one which I was not aware of when I booked the holiday through the travel agent. Clearly the travel agent knew nothing of it either. The location of the hotel is excellent being near Penn Station and MSG.;3
"this hotel is located in Chelsea. The room where I stayed was really tiny, looked like a boat room. Still it was confortable. Free WiFi. No breakfast. Luggage storage service. Shared bathrooms/showers were clean and ""unisex"". The price is good for New York standards, expansive if you think about what you get.";3
I had to wait a few hours to get another room, but it was worth the wait. The first one was literally over the front door with huge traffic noise. If I have a complaint, however, it is that there is no way to get coffee first thing in the morning - no in room maker or lobby offering.;3
Arrived at 12.30 room check in was 3. So went for a wonder. Could leave bags at hotel.  Was told get a text when room was ready...text never arrived.  So came back around 4.   Had previously asked for room with a view. Quieter floor . High up via email. .   Got 8th floor. Looking out on to buildings opposite noisy but it's new york I suppose and every one loves a horn!  Room.  Not the biggest.  Two adults and 1 9yr old.  Two  beds not doubles more like 3/4 beds - 4ft beds.   No where to put cases so they were left on walk way of room had keep stepping over them.   Asked about moving to other room but wanted extra few hundred dollars for sake couple extra foot.  Love to know how all these people get free upgrades....it it if the face fits?

"A very upscale hotel, with EXTREMELY nice, helpful staff at check-in and check-out, as well as the bellhop.  However, it is also an extremely expensive hotel that really ONLY is above any other hotel because of its LOCATION. Ask for rooms below the 10th floor and that was honored.  But be prepared to PAY for any little thing you might need to make the visit better i.e. parking (daily) and joining rooms (really); it cost you extra, every day, to have two rooms that are joined by a door!  We had very expensive, very salty meal in the bar.  Wouldn't waste your money for food that is too salty to finish when you can go around the corner to the Good Neighbor CafÃ© or N and Out Burger! Our daughter said her room service was fast.  The rooms were comfortable, but we continually had to";3
We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights for a weekend to Universal Studios. The best thing we liked about the property is the distance to Universal Studios. Itâs about a 5 minute walk to Universal Studios and City walk but a shuttle is offered. We never used the shuttle. The room was a corner room and was clean. We paid extra for a city view and got a pool view instead. When we asked the front desk about it we were told itâs a city/pool view. The irritating thing about the room was the lack of hot water for most of the stay. We had along drive in and just wanted to take a hot shower. The water for me only stayed lukewarm, and for my husband got hotter eventually. The next day we had the same issue and let the water run for about 10-15 min before calling the front desk. They sent up an;3
"We spent 14 nights at The New Yorker. Room was clean and bed very comfy. We had originally booked a Metro Double and were ""upgraded"" to a one bed shoebox with great views. I wonder if the room with 2 beds would have afforded us more space. The views weren't worth the size of the room. Room was sooo tiny. Walls paper thin. Barely any room to store our suitcases. Wardrobe so tiny, I think if we had coats to hang, the door wouldn't have closed. Bathroom tiny also. We found the staff, with the exception of housekeeping, to be very indifferent and made no effort to be friendly. The hotel is in a convenient location, but it's just not the nicest location. I would never stay here or in this part of the city again.";3
Don't mind the smoke in the hallways... Rooms are really small but clean. Share bathrooms are clean as well. About 7 blocks from the nearest subway. Not noisy at all and the neighbourhood is not bad at all. I won't mind staying here again if I am on a budget.;3
The neighborhood isn't that bad and I felt safe even after coming back to my hotel very late at night. The staff was friendly and helpful, cannot complain there. I was a little disappointed in my room, but the cost was very low so you get what you pay for. The room was very tiny and the bed not as comfortable. The decor is usual style, nothing fabulous and my balcony faced Vermont Street. Not very pretty, but I didn't care. If you just want a nice place to sleep and don't plan on spending all your time in your room, this isn't bad. If you plan on staying in your room a lot, make sure you get a room by the pool.;3
A legendary hotel in which all the equipment is really old and used. We have repeatedly received bad information from the hotel staff at the reception desk about the reward program and eventually did not send us all the points we were entitled to according to the staff regulations. There is one version of the reward program at the pay desk. Then, by email, this information does not apply and the money paid for the accommodation can not be accepted for credit points. There was odor in Tesla's basement. The best experience was with cleaning and concierge, which really helped us organize the program.;3
Hi all we have recently stayed at the New Yorker , The hotel has character and charm reminding you of a old 20s themed hotel from a movie , check in - was ok , Mohammed was very helpful as we arrived an hour before check in - BE WARNED AS IT IS A JOKE THE NICE MANDATORY FACILITY FEE! - Facility fee which includes- WIFI which is fine as yes is nice to have WiFi whilst away but this also covers USE OF THE GYM! Gym why do i want to go to the GYM whilst i am on holiday if i would like to use the gym there should be a fee for this service , i can also in my 31.75$ per day use the buisness centre to print and use the computers which I DID NOT AND DO NOT NEED TO USE whilst on holiday! So basically I paid 31.75$ to use the WIFI which is very expensive WiFi , Wyndham are laughing at all;3
Hotel was nice and good location to LAX. Not a good location to stay at if you are going sightseeing or trying to find something to eat. Nothing is close by. The biggest problem I had was they charged us $100.00 to check into our hotel room early. I thought that it was wrong considering the room was ready.;3
The Empire hotel's location is why we chose it. We had stayed there about six years ago and it had been newly refurbished. I don't believe they have done anything since then. Our first room had water damaged walls and was in sad shape. We called our booking agency to see what could be done,we were ready to find a different hotel. They called the front desk supervisor to see what could be done. Tatiana, the supervisor, switched us to a suite on the seventh floor overlooking Broadway. This room was in better shape so we decided to stay. (She saved the day!)  The hotel needs an update. So many small improvements could make a big difference, like change all the bad light bulbs, there were so many out in the lobby that I lost count. The drain stoppers in the sinks do not work and the;3
Nice hotel. Good pool. The breakfast is ok, but the chefs Hugo and Jose Are very kind and always smiling and make good omelets and waffles.  Only one thin: we had a extra guest eating breakfast with US. The hotel charged US 40$ wich i my opinion was 20$ to much !!;3
.the staff is average the hotel is in fair condition some rooms better than others! great location on the UWS of manhattan. Electrical outlets are few and the bathroom was clean, overall all an Average place nice size rooms for NYC;3
Great location right by Columbus Circle, but room was tiny and a bit run down.  Room sizes vary, even if prices don't but may have been due the time of year. Also poor noise insulation between rooms and the hallway.;3
Booked this hotel as it had a rooftop pool but were advised upon arrival that it was closed (& also the fitness centre) Not happy! Lock on hotel room was faulty and had to be looked at several times during our stay. Corridors smelt of cigarette smoke even though hotel has a no smoking policy. Beds and pillows not the most comfortable and bathroom was the smallest I'd ever seen! Staff were ok and doormen were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in hotel not great either for the USD$20 that it costs.;3
I stayed in a Queen room with a view and the room was reasonably sized however quite dated and the bathroom had aged and needed some attention.   Half way through the holiday I turned on the bath tub tap and brown water was coming out of it. I called reception and his response was to let it run for fifteen minutes and see what happens. Throughout the holiday the water was not totally clear but was not as bad as it was when it first happened. However I felt that the staff member was not approachable to solve the matter.   The maids were very good throughout the stay. And every staff member on our floor (29) would say morning to you and have a good day which was nice.   The elevators are very very very slow!! You could be waiting up to five minutes in reception and then when in;3
Can't describe just how hot the hotel was during our stay - the rooms were even hotter!  The air con is old and extremely noisy so very difficult to sleep.  If staying on the 11th floor you will undoubtedly be woken up by the dragging of furniture at approx. 4.30am once everyone has cleared out of the rooftop lounge.  For some unknown reason the staff felt that they had to rearrange furniture at this time of the morning, every morning, and we were there for 4 nights.  My friend and I were so sleep deprived during our trip, we were dizzy walking around during the day.  The rooms are nicely decorated and have a great powerful shower, but they are very small - you can just about walk around the double bed and no more!  The staff in general were friendly and courteous, although we;3
"The location is great- right by Central Park/Columbus circle/Lincoln center. The hotel itself is mediocre at best. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are especially cramped. We also had a rude encounter with the hotel staff. When we arrived there was coffee, sugar, etc. and a coffee maker. We would make coffee everyday. However we noticed that the housekeeping wouldn't replenish the sugar, bar, etc. when they cleaned the room everyday. We called down to housekeeping to ask them and the lady on the phone said ""it's not their job, if you want it replenished you have to call."" Ummm sorry ma'am I don't know which hotels you've worked at, but at any quality hotel, the housekeeping replenishes things in the room- usually everything from soap in the bathroom to coffee to snacks in";3
Overall hotel nice, staff nice, hotel room carpet was dirty, nightstand chipped/peeling, walls peeling paint, old.  Needs room renovation.  Air conditioning set to 68 but was still hot.  Didn't sleep well at all.  Typically I am comfortable in 72-74 degrees;3
"My partner and I stayed here during winter time on a 4 day trip to New York. Rooms are small but clean and the central heating is nice and warm. There is an air conditioning unit fitted at the window which I found a little noisy. The walls are thin also and we did ask to be moved at one point as our neighbours were loud - once moved, we didnt have noise problems. The views of Central Park are gorgeous, especially in the snow. Access to down town NYC & JFK were easy on the subway too. NYC remains one of my favourite places on the planet and I would consider staying here again; the price is good value and beats the crazy prices of other New York hotels!";3
Overall the hotel was clean with friendly staff. I was not pleased with the cleanliness of the bathroom however the rest of the guestroom was fine. I could hear when someone used the toilet and my toilet made a horrendous sound when flushed.;3
THE BAD--  Not a very safe neighborhood!!!! Very small and old room. $22 a day for parking!!!!  THE GOOD-- 10 min drive to universal & close to most tourist sites. Comfortable bed, good nights sleep. Breakfast was awesome!! Thanks to Sonia always smiling :) Cheaper than most hotels in the area.;3
We stayed on spring season so the room price was too high for what the hotel can offer in terms of service, bed quality and amenities. But the overall experience was good. Don't expect much proactive attitude from the front desk staff. Our feeling is that they are not very empowered and driven to solve customer issues by their own.;3
Recent stay in NYC for business and was put up at this property. Location, lobby, restaurants are fantastic. Rooms are sub-sub-optimal. First, extremely small and hard to navigate. Literally could not open my bathroom door more than 1/2 way due to towel rack behind it (who does that?) and hallways/room were in desperate need of refreshing. Sink did not drain properly and had to watch to avoid overflow (did alert staff). BUT...view of Times Square was awesome and the bed was very comfy allowing a few good hours of sleep following a very delayed flight/arrival. Staff are usual perfectionists expected for this area and quite helpful. If you just need a well located flop space, this will serve well. Could not imagine staying more than 1 day in the room.;3
"It was our second time staying here. The room is about the size of a small/single dorm room. But we donât go to NYC to stay in hotels, as we spend our time exploring the city. The staff is friendly and helpful. There was an issue with the heat and maintenance was at our door within 10 minutes of calling the front desk. It has all the basics; a clean room, a comfortable bed, a hot shower, and itâs reasonably priced -- as far as NYC hotels go (especially around the holidays)â¦. Also, itâs close to the subway and being near the park, itâs a quieter more residential neighborhood.";3
Everythings are nice except: Some staff issues that needed to be fixed.People cut in line at the cafe, room safe never work even after reported on my first day . Check out clack not paying attention, store staff not helpful.;3
"I became worried after reading some of the very negative reviews of EH, but I had no bad experiences.  Every staff member I had contact with--receptionist, engineer, doormen--was very pleasant and helpful.  My room was clean; it was not tiny (as it sounds like other rooms are), but it was long and narrow.  I couldn't work there because there was no desk or work space--only a narrow table covered with everything except a lamp.  I was there for business for one night, and it served my needs well enough. If you need a clean and safe place to stay after long days and night out, the EH would be a good option. A lot of Europeans were staying there.  The main reason why I wasn't crazy about it has to do with Aesthetics.  It is all done in dark, heavy colors (bronze, black) and drapes";3
Wyndham New Yorker did meet most of our expectations. Yes not large rooms but for 2 people ample space.  Small bathroom but sufficient for purpose, if a bit dated in the bathtub.  No iPod or MP3 facilities in our room but no matter we had kindles and I pad as well as phones.  Due to comments made by others I did pack an extension lead for recharging as well as a travel kettle as no in room facilities at all.  The sockets were actually easily located In our room but others not so lucky.     Decor is a bit dated but all in all ok for a 5 night stay. Check in was quick and easy, we had a small wait for our room but that was because we asked for room nearby our travelling companions, request sorted without issue.  The room was well serviced daily with plentiful supply of towels and;3
Nice historical building. Great location, right next to the subway. When we arrived to the room maintenance was unexpectedly there. The sink in our bathroom was always clogged, so that was most likely why. Reported it to reception a few times but the issue was never fixed. It didnât bother us much, as the pipes in the building are definitely not new, but itâs an inconvenience if you need to shave. Great views if you get a top floor room.;3
We stayed here for three nights. Was good enough with a clean room, and good service. Downsides were the old, slow elevators and intermittent WiFi. Is fine for a short stay to be very close to the 96th Street subway (just round the corner) which has a quick route up to 42nd Street/Times Square.;3
This is a great reasonable hotel in its price range. Location is its best point. The rooms are small but average for NY standards. There is limited storage space and a small bathroom with an average shower (note to all hotels - not everyone wants those rain shower heads that pelt down on you - some of us ladies do NOT want to get our hair wet!). They had a hand held shower piece, but it rarely functioned, would not stay on the wall and the upper shower head still dripped on your head. As usual, half the room is taken up with stuff you don't want but that takes up precious room - overpriced mini bar rubbish, 7 USD small bottles of water, a coffee machine you have to PAY for if you have a coffee. All pointless. The lobby bar is either freezing or boiling, there is rarely service;3
This place has an awesome location and this 30s feel to it. However, it has small rooms, mine facing into a wall and worh no fridge in it. There is also no breakfast and it would use a big refurb as well.;3
This is clearly a budget hotel and lives up to that expectation. The furniture and the space in the room was the barely necessary, not an inch more or less. The corridors, carpets, paper-thin walls, tiny elevator... you just recognize the budget constraints everywhere. The service at the reception, same thing. The kitchen is absolutely basic, so you will just warm up a pizza in the microwave, period. The wifi works in some parts of the hotel only. However, the prices correspond to what you get. This is a place to sleep that will be clean and correct. You will have maps and some basic touristic info at the reception. No extras, no fuss, no luxury... just basic comfort in a good residential location near to many shops and subway.;3
Great location close to Lincoln Center & Fordham University, The hotel is in need of updating, One thing I can't understand. Is that they which to paper cups in the room from very nice glass glasses! The have a mini bar stocked and bottles of wine, water. Does the hotel think that there customer with to share a cocktail in paper cups? When asked my concerns were addressed quickly.;3
We needed to find a nice hotel on the upper west side of Manhattan the didn't cost an arm, a leg and a foot as well - and this hotel definitely met our needs. Friendly staff and very convenient  location and all rooms had been recently renovated. My only issues were of the thin walls that echoed every noise from the hallways and parking was very difficult. On the plus side, they have some awesome restaurants close by, including Carmines, etc. I would highly recommend The Dive Bar around the corner - Awesome Burgers!;3
I've stayed there once before and I probably would again but I haven't slept that little for a long while! The room was just the right size and the bathroom was nice and clean but onceyou tried to sleep in the room (no.matter what time) you really couldn't because you'd hear everything from your neighbours in the next rooms over to the fire doors in the corridor slamming shut...  If it weren't for.these doors I would've loved my stay there!;3
"$250 for the night and the bathroom door didnât close all the way; there may as well have not been a bathroom door. No glassware in the room and paper thin walls. We only stayed here because of its close proximity to LAX but I will never stay here again; some of the other hotels were almost as close.";3
We stayed here after driving from Vegas for our Universal Studios visit the next day, rooms were comfortable, if not a little tired and would benefit from an update.  We had dinner in the bar/lounge area, very dated and dimly lit. Our server was very polite and efficient, however the food was pretty average and we didn't finish our meals.  Despite these few hiccups, this hotel is in a great location for a visit to Universal (2min drive) and we would stay here again for that reason.;3
The hotel had very friendly staff, but accommodations were not great.  You wouldn't walk on the floor barefoot. The bathroom was tiny without a shower curtain or door, so floor always wet. The inside of bathroom door had peeling paint and you couldn't open the blind because of the dirty air conditioner view. Would never go back;3
I could hear everything in the hallway and my neighbors entire conversation. And they werenât yelling.  The room was clean but all of the noise was not ideal for an early morning flight. Only plus was the quick shuttle ride to lax. Hats off to the driver who was attentive and quick with the bags.;3
"I was in NYC last week, at The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel. My credit card was asked for incidentals, which I had no intention of using the other hotel facilities it was fine. I was told the next day that a facility charge would come off my card, I had paid for this upfront via my travel agent, after speaking with two front desk staff it was confirmed that  no charge was made to the card. The issue was with the gentleman  at the front desk, he was dismissive and abrupt when I asked about this,  definately NOT good customer servise, he said on a few occations ""NEXT""  The room was generally clean but I did find hairs in the bath and sink which was disappointing. The cleaning staff were polite and  friendly. I stayed at the The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel previously and found it";3
Stayed at this hotel in July as part of a trip to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had chosen this hotel based on its location as it stands on the corner of 8th Avenue and West 34th Street so is close to Macy's and the Empire State Building. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are across the road and Times Square is about 10 minutes walk away. There are a number of subway stations nearby so the whole of Manhattan is accessible. The hotel was opened in the 1930s and in keeping with its style, the rooms are not massive - a bit of a squeeze for three adults but we managed. We had a lovely view of the Empire State Building. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The hotel could do with updating and the decor was looking a bit drab. There was a safe and we hired a;3
Hotel was generally clean but there were stains on some of the furnishings.  The shower was not always hot.  The heating was sporadic and one night the room was like a sauna - we asked reception to turn off but they sent up an employee who just looked at the radiator and said itself later!;3
"You have to keep in mind that this is a tourist hotel - nothing more, nothing less. It's about serving a mass of people in an ongoing fashion. I've stayed here several times in the last  3 years. My last stay baffled me. I originally reserved an alcove room (larger space, end room) and I was ""upgraded"" to the Executive Level and given a SMALLER room! The Executive Level is in name only since 1) they've discontinued the Executive Lounge and 2) the rooms are no different than those in the rest of the hotel. Take a pass on the Executive Level if want to save some money. The Executive Level is comprised of the top 2 floors, but unless you need to be on those floors with no additional amenities, what's the advantage? None. In any event, I moved back to an alcove room. I'm not sure";3
The staff were very helpful and accomodating.  The room, however, was average to below average.  Although the room appeared clean and tidy, there was a huge stain and dampness on the rug by the air conditiioner/heater.  The TV was also unavailable the night I stayed which was inconvenient given that I was traveling by myself.;3
Went to NY and stayed at the Empire.   Nice room but the air was barely coming out.  We were out most of the day and when we came back at night, it felt cool.  We roasted at night.  No air.  We opened the windows and because we were in the inside--no air flow.  We went to the desk after two nights of no air and they went someone to fix it.  it was nice and cool when we came back in the afternoon.  When we got home that night, still working and it died through the night.  We went to the desk and they called up a maintenance man.  (this is 12:30 at night) The breaker was out and they couldn't transfer us to another room because they were overbooked by two rooms (front desk words).   But he assured us he would keep checking the breaker and make sure it was on.  That lasted until;3
"It pains me not to give The Jane 5 out of 5 because there is so much to love about this hotel: the location near the bottom of the Highline and the many bars/restaurants of Meatpacking and Bleecker is great; the decor is truly fab with beautiful peacock fabric- lined rooms and brass ""hand"" wall lights; rooms are small but clean; the staff are friendly. But I have stayed in 4 captain's rooms (double rooms) now on 3 different trips and there are serious noise issues with them all: the hotel is located on an 8-lane motorway and rooms overlooking that highway suffer the roar of traffic constantly; rooms which don't overlook this on the 2nd floor are over the bar- the thumping noise was so loud on the Saturday night that I had to go down to reception and change rooms at 3am. Sadly";3
"The Empire Hotel was my ""Go to"" place to stay in the city in the late 80's and early 90's, right across the street from Lincoln Center and close to the Beacon Theater and Central Park South the location can't be beat!  When I decided to get tickets to see a show at Lincoln Center it was a ""no brainer"" to book a room at the Empire. I knew ahead of time that valet parking was $60 and I opted to utilize that service. The doorman and the front desk staff were pleasant and efficient.   The lobby looked fine, as did the bar, but the stair case to the left of the bar going to the Mezzanine level was under repair and what ever solvents they were using on the job had a very strong odor and was irritating to my throat.  We made our way to our Junior Suite on the 7th Floor and I was a";3
This is a hotel manned by friendly helpful staff in a great location but let down by rooms or at leaÃ my room,404. I was sharing it with my teenage daughter and soon realised it was a bit too small.no wardrobe, only a space above safe with space for maybe 4 short items hidden behind a dark curtain.The blinds was drawn in the day time so we opened it to discover our view was ox a brick wall and also looking straight into opposite rooms. we had one and a half drawer space to share. the room was clean and bed comfortable but air conditioning                                                    was huge and very noisy.The bathroom was lined with old fashioned wood effect and had no extraction fan so became very steamed.no where to hang clothes while showering and no waste bin. I did;3
I stayed at Morningside Inn during Christmas time. Of course the rates are higher in this season, but the manager (Patrick) was kind enough to make some arrangements for me to stay in a room with a bathroom for a slightly lower cost since I was travelling with my underage niece. He is a very nice person. Denise, the night-shift receptionist, is also nice, friendly and polite. Very different from one of the morning-shift receptionists, the brunette one, who is extremelly unfriendly and impolite. The cleaning girls are also nice. The hotel is average. Bad points: internet access only at the lobby - which gets pretty crowded when many guests want to go online... - no breakfast (but it seems they're starting having it soon), the heating system is not very efficient, the stove in the;3
No  Broadband in bedrooms i sa huge disadvantage. Some of the furniture in the bedroom was in extremely poor condition and was reported to staff but nothing was done. Noise levels outside by Garbage staff was ridiculous at 4am.;3
"We stayed in Abercorn for a week. The kitchens and showers were clean, the staff ok, the atmosphere is not what you expect of a ""youth hostel"" - loads of people seems to actually properly live there. Good location, close to amendities, tubes for the city etc.  Be careful though : in the space of a week we got two things that got stolen in the room (and it was a private room...).";3
Walking distance to train and Madison Square Garden. Request high level room for view. Room was ok. On site restaurants great. Lobby always mobbed, for some reason. Unsubscribe to their emails- otherwise you will be bombarded.;3
"Its a standard NYC hotel. It served its purpose, with a clean room (bed felt very low to ground) and a nice staff. For a $25 ""resort fee"" per day per room however I would expect a little more than basic hotel coffee in the lobby and hotel WiFi.";3
There are two great things about this hotel - proximity to Universal Studios and their abundance of good food at their buffet dinners and breakfast on Sunday!  The rooms look tired and need updated - including the tvs.   The shower had very little pressure and was disappointing.   The staff was luke warm with the worst being the check in desk.    Room service was actually good with good service and good food.    The free shuttle to Universal Studios was suppose to run every 15 min. but you can't depend on that.  We waited 40 min. each way.;3
The actual name of this hotel is confusing. On this website, it is called a Days Inn. But in actuality, it is just a Days Hotel, NYC. I am surprised that a Wyndam properties would have a hotel of this shoddy interior space. I read some reviews that mention some remodeling on the upper floors. Maybe the lobby is next. Old hotel, old smelly lobby, old room, small room. No curtains, just blinds, so street light seeped in. We had a double bed for two of us. But...room did have coffee maker, TV, WIFI, iron/ironing board. And the location cannot be beat - lots of restaurants/bakeries, close to subway. The reception staff was very patient and helpful and provided luggage storage. We stayed just one night and I guess I would stay again, if just for one night with the right price and if;3
"39th floor, nice view... but, the room's so small you can't swing a cat, and everything smells old and nasty. No refurbished rooms here.  Great location, though - very near to Penn Station - and Times Square. We only stayed one night, so I didn't get much ""service"" from the staff, but what interaction we had was very good.";3
Beautiful location overlooking Lincoln center...very nice comfortable and roomy rooftop bar. Rooms are small but good enough for what I needed. The air conditioning is a definite problem. I had to call at midnight because it was so hot. Other than that it was good enough for me coming in from Long Island and staying one night.  If I had plans near that hotel I'd stay again.;3
When we checked in there was a problem with the reservation. We had booked four nights, and they only had two in their system! Only after talking with them for a while, they changed our stay to what we had booked. I thought the receptionist was kind of difficult. At a certain point we thought we had to find another hotel for the other two nights... It's not professional to blame someone else (booking.com) for problems and to tell your guest it's not your fault. Professionally you should just have a look at the confirmation and solve the problem instead of waisting time on blaming another. Another guest checking in at the same time booked a special room through his travel agent and not being able to give him that room, it was the fault of the travel agent. Very unprofessional. We;3
The Jane is a historic hotel with a great vibe. Easy motorcycle parking nearby, a unique hotel bar worth checking out and hey, this is where survivors of the Titanic slept. Where else can you get a room in NYC for $80 a night? The real problem that prevents passable sleeps is how temperature is managed. The heating works on a building wide boiler system that can not be regulated by zone. In the winter rooms had the window open because it was just too hot to breath, at least in the Standard rooms. With the window open and the air conditioning on (!), you can maybe sleep with earplugs. Go ahead and book but beware. I hope hotel management will invest in fixing the problem by adding temperature zones.;3
For me, while the lobby was impressive, the common areas and the guest room (at least the one we had), did not impress me.   We opted for the standard view room with a queen size bed (125 sq feet). The condition of the room itself was o.k. but not great. I understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic Art Deco style. There is limited closet space, and dresser space. The room was about a 125 sq. feet which is what they list on their website. The bathroom was very small with very little space. They painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling. The shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature. There is no mini fridge, nor a microwave. The common areas on floor 21 were a;3
The hotel rooms and corridors are really tired and aged and could do with some updating.  The check in process was truely painful and inefficient.  There just arenât enough staff and it took 10 minutes to check in.  It wasnât terrible but there are so many better hotels around.;3
My family and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was an okay stay. We checked in and only one of our rooms were ready which was fine since it was an hour or so before checkin time. We were fine with going to the room that was ready and leaving all our bags there until we received the other room. We were able to get rooms right next to each other and they were connecting rooms which was a plus for us!   When we checked into our rooms, I can honestly say I was not impressed. The rooms were very outdated and the furniture as well. The view of the mountains was great.   My mother, aunt and kids did enjoy the outdoor pool a lot.   The best part of the hotel is that they have a complimentary shuttle that goes to Universal Studios Hollywood. We took this shuttle which was a 5 mins;3
The hotel was fine, as was the room (except for the lack of security on the adjoining door, which was remedied by housekeeping and engineering). But the wifi didn't work during my entire stay which made working extremely difficult. Also, I stayed on the second floor and the noise from next door, the hall, the street, and something clanging outside the window made it one of the noisiest hotels I've ever stayed at in NYC!;3
The location is amazing. The value is typical for NYC hotels, read poor! $180 to park my car for thee days!  $76 for a $25 Cabernet in the mini bar (glad I bought my own:). The hotel was clean, recently renovated in 80s cheesiness, very comfy King bed (opt for the King room) which is still very small compared to the poorly placed and minuscule Queen rooms.  Very polite staff from front desk, valets, to maids,  and very clean. The only negatives are the add ons (room was $300 a night, not bad for NYC in this hood) and the ridiculously designed cubby hole of a bathroom! Be sure to hit the roof bar. Starbucks downstairs for the free wifi ($13 a day at the hotel! Tsk tsk).;3
Stayed here in November for 5 nights, the location is brilliant for Central Park but a walk to Times Square and 5th avenue was at least a 40-50 minute walk, but there is a subway located on 103 street which is fantastic to take you to 42nd which is where the main attractions are! Only $2.75 (something like that) the hotel itself was very basic, friendly door staff, reception staff a little miserable but didn't bother us as it was literally a bed for us as we were out exploring the city all day and night! The bad thing is that there was no hot drinking facilities in the hotel which was an issue for us in the morning and before going to bed, the area near the hotel is quite quiet so wouldn't want to be walking round an unknown area at night looking for hot drinks! My advice would;3
The hotel location is absolutely excellent and very nice its rooftop with the bar and pool. But the rooms are quite old, with old pieces of furniture and not as clean as youncould expect. In a nutshell price / quality is acceptable.;3
I just stayed at the Empire Hotel for one evening to attend work functions being held accross the street at Lincoln Center. Aside from the very conveinent location and a decent lobby, this hotel is not worth the money. My 2nd floor room was a tiny cave that looked into an airshaft. Thankfully, I was there by myself b/c I can't imagine two adults trying to negotiate moving around that room at the same time without one of them walking over the bed. Other details (or lack thereof) in my room included a non-existent alarm clock, a wine bottle in the mini bar with a label that reflected the fact that it had been iced down at least once and the returned to a room tempature position on in the mini-bar basket and a shower that required me to call the front desk to learn how to operate.;3
If you are looking for a convenient location for your trip to Universal and nice rooms, this hotel is good and I guess these are thee reasons for the expensive price point as well. To be honest, I don't mind paying that as well but also expect some good service in return! Most of the check-in staff was running the desk in a chaotic manner, their concierge was mostly rude and always in a hurry to listen to any requests, on the day of our check-out they took 50 minutes just to respond to our request for a luggage trolley and finally never showed up with it. When I went down to grab one myself (our airport shuttle was waiting) they said they don't allow guests to use one - can you imagine that! My wife, sister, and brother-in-law dragged bags (imagine 3 families traveling with;3
Great location, very small room and bathroom. With two luggages inside the room, can hardly walk. And there's a incidental charge upon check in. Higher floors has better views. You can hear siren the whole night maybe it's near some hospital or fire station? Staffs were friendly and it's a great experience haha... never stayed in such small hotel before and so antique feel.;3
They only gave us glowsticks because there was no power. A lot of guests stayed in the lobby because of that. There are children playing and you would not be able to relax and enjoy the stay. The power came back only after a couple of hours;3
My wife and I went to the hotel for and over night trip.  The heater didn't work in the room and they had to bring in a portable one.  I requested a King seize bed and was put in a room with two full seize bed.;3
The location of the hotel is great, close to Central Park, 5th avenue and two subway stations. The rooms however are incredibly outdated, windows not closing, broken shower etc. Ok if you are not staying in the city longer than 2/3 nights.;3
We stayed here as part of our honeymoon last year and while the location was fantastic, there was not a lot else that was.  If you want a great location then this is a good place but the room we were given was very small and when we requested a change, it was not possible.  The rooftop bar was closed to guests as there was a private function on. The staff were fine but we would not be staying there again.;3
Our family stayed here two nights at a cost of $400 per night!  Both the front desk and valet/doormen were very efficient and friendly.  The room was a big disappointment....no safe and no mirror in the room, except in the bathroom.  The cleaning staff manager knocks on all the doors starting at 8:45, so don't plan on sleeping in! Some issues with the elevators, but on our second day, some poor employee was tasked with riding the elevators all day to make certain they were working properly. Walk to Universal because the hotel shuttle doesn't get you there that much faster.  This hotel is the closest one to the theme park and it appears they have taken advantage of this and have cut some corners.  Way overpriced for the quality of the room.;3
"Swift visit for work and stayed at the Hilton. Lovely stay. Rooms were clean and spacious; staff very helpful and food was a good standard.  Despite being on location at the park, it didnât feel overly full of holiday goers.";3
The New Yorker is a good hotel and is perfectly placed for exploring NY. The good points are staff very helpful and knowledgeable, the Italian restaurant was also good as was the Tic Tock diner and as I have said itâs a perfect location to explore all the major attractions on foot and transport links are also very conveniently to hotel. I would have given the hotel 4* but I think it could do will a touch up in most areas except the lobby. I know itâs an old beautiful  Art Deco building but I still believe it could keep all its decor but should be freshened up .;3
"I guess I shouldn't be surprised about the state of the hotel room since it is in New York.  But comparing it to other NYC hotels I have to give the hotel an average rating. The location was great but the rooms were extremely small.  They attempted to update the room with the decor but it really did not cover the aging hotel.  The air conditioner was extremely loud and smelled a little moldy.  They removed one shower door and the bathroom floor always got wet during a shower.  There was a bit of rust on the shower and a little mold in the corner.  The hotel lobby was very dim and all I could think was, ""what are they hiding?""  Although the doormen were friendly they didn't make any attempt to help us get a taxi.";3
Pro: 1. room was clean 2. close to Paramount Studios, where I had a meeting the following morning 3. average amount of restaurants nearby, although most were lower-quality chain places 4. excellent TV with a good variety of channels  Con: 1. obsolete bathroom with no real counter space 2. toilet lid wouldn't stay up properly - very awkward! 2. no quiet enough - some street noise and able to hear floor above me walking around 3. room decor was a hodge lodge of furniture styles and color - no real decorating plan 4. $22/day for parking - I guess it's cheaper than SF or NYC but it still bugs me when it's more than $10/day 5. slow WiFi 6. Dated decor with mismatched carpeting, doors and common area detailing.;3
We really liked the hotel. The staff were all fab, really polite and helpful. It has been so lovingly put back together again. The detailing stands out a mile. The room was really cute. The bellboy uniforms are amazing. The bar looks stunning, and on and on. It has a lovely feel about it, and having a Cafe Gitane there is fantastic, although the staff there are a bit shockingly slow.  I donât think we would come back in winter months again. We were in #305, and whatever we did, we could never get the temperature right in our room. Admittedly, New York was cold while we were there, but we ended up either being so cold we couldnât sleep, or so boiling hot and impossibly stuffy that we couldnât sleep. It was not a great combination.  It was a shame, because I think just about;3
We booked this for a 6 night break. Good location being central. Hotel room was bit dated and a little on the small side for 2 of us, to be expected. On the whole a nice hotel and staff were friendly. I was a bit disappointed that they charge $5 dollars an item to store luggage for 2 hours, they even charged $5 for a rolled up picture in a tube that was slightly to big to fit in bag. Shame my nice pleasant stay ended in this way. Apparently there is another hotel that does the same in NYC, didnât expect this from a Wyndham hotel.;3
Stayed at this hotel for a little NYC adventure on a shoe string budget, it was my first time staying at one for these âshared bathroomâ type hotels, after reading the reviews and going into this with the knowledge that my expectations should be non existent I donât have anything really bad to say about this hotel, yes the inside of the hotel has seen better days, the staff does not cater to you necessarily and having to share the bathroom does get annoying.  Having said that, the bed was comfortable, (although you could tell the sheets didnât get washed) towels were provided every day without asking, the shared bathroom even though small it was kept clean and stocked with toilet paper, the location is very convenient for getting from/to LaGuardia, easy access to the train/buses;3
"The location is great. The bed and the bathroom were clean; yet the floor was really dirty. Also our room was out on the stairway, which the receptionist didn't mention and we had to look for the room for awhile. It was really cold at night and we didn't have a blanket or a duvet. The problem was the windows through which a lot of cold got in.";3
Good location, walking distance to Universal Studios. They have a free shuttle. But be prepared to pay for everything else. No breakfast included, no happy hour. If you have Hilton Honors the wifi is free.;3
I really expected more from a Hilton. Rooms were a bit worn, like the whole hotel was. Service was great! Best thing in Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City is the location if you are going to go visit the Universal Studios. It's next to it!;3
The hotel is in a good location but thatâs about it. The decor is dated. The carpet on the lobby stairs is literally coming off the stairs. The bathroom is so small that even a petite women hits the sink while sitting on it. It took 3 minutes for he shower to heat up and thereâs no door on the shower so the whole bathroom is wet when youâre done. The rooms and overall interior of the rooms are darkly lit and all the finishes are reds and browns so itâs dark and busy inside....not exactly modern or worth what youâre charged per night. If you want to go to the âpoolâ be prepared to walk up two flights of stairs and be disappointed, itâs a very small, dated pool. Overall left me wanting to switch hotels or askfor a refund.;3
The Good - great service by the employees, especially front desk and valet.  Location is the best you can get for Universal, easy walk to Universal Studios and a shuttle service.  The Okay - room location was second floor, below the lobby. Standard room with an okay bed/lumpy bedding.  The Diamond/Gold line never had anyone working it no matter how busy it got, so being a frequent Hilton traveler isn't worth much at this hotel.  No room upgrade despite being offseason February.     The Bad - the food is just the worst now.  Overpriced even by resort hotel standards, every single meal was poor.  Bread was stale, oysters grainy, meat was chewy. They even managed to screw up pasta, which should be darn near impossible.  Avoid the slow, overpriced buffet. A few items are palatable;3
We arrived to friendly quick service after our 28 hrs of travel from Australia no lift but that's ok room is very small but very clean shower had hot water and it was a good shower after 28 hrs, the normal New York noise could be heard from outside, the room need a shelve below the mirror somewhere to put toiletries, if your staying for short period I'd stay hear again;3
The initial sight of the reception area, a window on the side of a long, narrow, tatty, hallway was a bit off putting.  I appreciate that having travelled from the UK and being rather tired did not help.   It is an amaturish sort of set up, the two nights we were there we never saw the same person twice in reception, they looked to be a series of students making some cash in the holidays. The room, unce we had exited the small and very slow lift, was long and narrow too.  So narrow that the door struck the end of the bed as we entered.  The room too was tatty but the bed was comfortable and the room quiet, probably because we overlooked a well between the buildings. Otherwise no real complaints, slept well, not many facilities but we survived.;3
This hotel is situated very close to the Empire State Building and everywhere is very accessible. The rooms are a reasonable size and if you want more space there is the option to upgrade. The staff were all helpful and friendly and everywhere was clean. Sometimes the lifts got very busy at peak times. I was sad that they donât cater for gluten free and as a coeliac it was like going back in time to how the UK used to be! We were given breakfast vouchers which were no use to myself or my daughter because there was no pastries that were gluten free. We tried the restaurant one day as my daughter is vegan and again we really struggled. She lived on salad and chips and the breakfast I had was slapped onto the plate! It cost about Â£25! The hotel has 80 floors and the view across the;3
My partner and I stayed in this hotel in Decâ17. Albeit we were both greeted by friendly faces and helpful staff on all levels, we was also greeted with the daily/nightly smell of weed on the 6th floor. Unable to comment on other floors but it was prominent where we were. Apparently the hotel has residents staying there, ones that couldnât be removed when the hotel was taken over so that was the reason for the smell....no wonder we was both hungry in the mornings!!!.....overall the hotel is located in a very nice part of Upper Manhattan, is convenient for most of the drug stores, shops, diners and in particular, the subway. The room was a little out dated, we stayed in 615 which didnât provide the greatest of views to the building adjacent but when you travel to New York you;3
Due to budget limitations and the expensive prices in London, this was the only place that was decently located, affordable and available for the times I needed. For a hostel, the place was relatively clean (although the common areas were a tad unkept). Room size (twin room) was average and included a mini fridge (very handy and rare in a hostel). I agree with some other reviewers, staff wasn't the most friendly, especially on check in. Location was handy, fairly close to central London on a major tube line, but further from the centre than I would have preferred. My major complaint, however, is the lack of single sex showers. All communal showers that I could find were open to both men and women. There should be at least one shower that is only for women. If there was, I was;3
I came to NYC with my mom, my sister, and my boyfriend. It was their Christmas present. I booked the hotel and everything without checking the reviews first. Once i saw the reviews my stomach turned into knots. All the reviews were terrible. I was so doubtful on going. I wanted to book somewhere else so badly. I was so nervous. It was raining and snowing so we had no where else to go but, the hotel. It was around 2 pm but, check in was 3pm.  Once we got there, they were friendly they let us check in early, gladly.  The hallways were narrow but, it was fine. We got a room on the first floor 2 double beds. I opened the door and got a wiff of clean air. I was surprised. I rushed to inspect the bed. I brought a can of lysol just in case. I found not even a stain. We had nice sheets,;3
We came to the Jane on a recommendation, but perhaps should have taken into consideration exactly how small the bedroom would be. We stayed in one of the bunk bed cabins -- which is actually smaller than a room in a sleeper car. With nowhere to put luggage, our suitcases were on the only available floorspace. The decor of the hotel is very nice and the staff were friendly, but as well as the size of the room we had a few other niggles -- for example the remote turned on both televisions (or sometimes, trying to turn off one TV would instead turn on the other), which was quite irritating. The water in the rooms was a plus, and the shared bathrooms were clean and usually available.;3
"I have been staying at The Empire since 1987; it was always a lovely hotel with a family feel, cosy and friendly. We returned this December to a refurbished (God knows when) hotel where the public spaces are good, if cold and impersonal, but the rooms are not great. We upgraded to a queen-sized room to enable us to get a bath (tub in US parlance); the room size was fine but the A/C didn't work. And this was a couple of weeks ago when the temperatures were 65! I would call several times a day, and the very nice maintenance man would reset the breakers, only for the A/C to trip out again. Why not address the problem properly and fix the unit's compressor? Internet at $12.95! Go to Starbucks round the corner where there is a better signal. And the bathroom! Not worthy of a 2* UK";3
This review would of been better but for bad service when checking in. Arrived about an 1 hour before check in time and was told our room wasn't ready which was fair enough, so we waited in the bar for them to contact us to say our room was ready. Over 2 hours later we still hadn't heard anything so went to reception only to be told our room still wasn't ready, even though they knew we were waiting. So we asked to see the manager who was extremely helpful and upgraded us to another room. The location is great for universal, some of the lobby areas need updating. But would still recommend even after the check in fiasco.;3
undoubtedly this hotel is located in an excellent position for central park, times sq and the shows etc, we easily walked and took the subway everywhere. We found the door men especially Jeff,room cleaners & maintenance staff were very friendly and helpful but there were 2 counter check in/out who had zero customer interpersonal skills ive ever encountered, so much so they really turned us off the place - i guess it could be because they dont get tips?Our beds were shockingly soft with little support so i felt like i was rolling out, we had a room with 2 x double beds (for x3 people) and it was very tight for space to stow luggage and move about - i wouldnât advise trying to get four in this room as it would be a nightmare. The breakfast is a communal self serve thing for $20 pp;3
I've stayed at many higher-end hotels throughout my career and for leisure. I felt for the value at this hotel, the amenities were older and not well kempt. For example the towel rack was starting to Teeter over. The extra square footage is a plus however I would have expected also a microwave from this caliber of hotel;3
Our stay at the Jane was part of a 5 month trip through the Americas - part of a sabbatical from work. The place is a novelty for sure. The rooms have a narrow spare to operate in so you need to be tidy if there are two of you. You will bump, bounce and scratch on the fixtures and fittings. But its ok and the location is great. Collecting water from the lift (elevator) is strange but ok. The place models itself on being quirky and cool. The latter is its downfall. Every night, bar the last night of our stay, I heard the music and felt the vibrations from the ballroom - where hte whos who of NYC seem to hang out. It is very cool, but when you're in NY for 5 days and want to be out and about in the morning you should consider the impact of this on your following day. Lets just say;3
Great location (literally right opposite Central Park) and the stars were really friendly and helpful. The room was clean which is the main thing. It was a pretty small room but absolutely fine if youâre just sleeping there. The bed was comfy and the shower was good. The downsides were, $22 per night fee for having water and WiFi, which isnât an option so you may aswell use them. There was no safe in the room, our blind was broken, the AC was constantly clicking and making noises and one afternoon when we came back to rest for a while there were builder right outside our room laying a new carpet. So all we heard for an hour was constant banging. Which you donât expect when you have paid to be there and werenât given a warning.;3
Hotel is in a good location but noisy if you like your window open at night. Small bathroom (cruise ship style) Walk across the street to Lincoln Center and Starbucks on the corner. The staff was pleasant and the availability to NY ambience was surrounding. Not sure if there are larger rooms but I would definitely ask next time around!;3
The hotel is in a great location but to be honest that is the only good thing I can say about it. I realise that the decor is Art Deco but it just looks drab. You exit the elevator to dark grotty hallways and once in the room it continues to look dull and grubby with brown carpets and tired funiture. I went to reception and said that I thought that my room was a little grotty to which I was told you have been upgraded to a room with a view. But my problem was the room was grotty i repeated. To be told yet again that I had a view !!!! on the day we checked out we needed to leave our bags as we were flying out in the evening, we were charged $20 to have our bags stored. Would not return or recommend this hotel .;3
I am currently staying at the Empire. The hotel is in a great location - close to Lincoln Center, restaurants, and subways. My room is an interior room, so very dark. I realize that this is a risk when staying in nyc hotels. I live in Connecticut so travel to nyc every couple of weeks. I think perhaps this is why the front desk clerk included free wifi upon my checking in to makeup for the lack of view/sunlight, and I am appreciate of that. My main gripe is that the desk in the room has no light, so virtually no work can be done at the desk. Also, there is no plug for the computer. The only plug below the desk has the refrigerator and tv plugged in to it. It renders the desk useless for any kind of work. I have to sit on the edge of the bed and plug the computer into the wall. I;3
Very good position close to the high way and the subway and very cheap Some of the stuff are very kind but not all internet doesn t work at all  And the room from the 1 to the 9th are old and all disgusting but are clean  Close to mc and drugs store bank and restaurant luquid store u can park ur car in the road close and leave it there all night free;3
The Wyndham New Yorker Hotel is in a great place to explore the surrounding area of Manhattan. It is very close to transport links and some good amenities close by. The hotel is old and ornate, however the room although small was kept clean and well maintained. Madison square garden is over the road and there are some good Irish bars down 8th Ave just past the magnificent post office building. Macy`s and other shopping outlets are only a ten minute walk away. Overall a good stay and i would stay there again.;3
Good  location for  a  first  time  in London.  The room  was  clean  and  tidy.  The welcoming  was  quiet  cold  and  unfriendly.  We enjoyed  our  stay  there even if we barely spent time  there apart  from  sleeping. ..;3
The Rooms in Astor on the Park are decidedly small, it was clean and the sheets were very soft.  It reminded me of my son's dorm plus a full bath.  The highlight is the wonderful location next to Central Park, the subway and wonderful restaurants.   Astor is also blocks away from the savvy West Harlem bars and entertainment.   The staff are really sweet. I would go back.;3
We booked a king room on an executive floor, wich gave us beautiful views, the room was clean well laid out and everthing was as promised.  Room rate we had came with continental breakfast, which you could upgrade to the buffet which was very good and for my wife who is a celiac could order from a gluten free menu which was far above the standard fare offerd for celiac.  I rate it average because it comes at a price and you get what you pay for, Hilton won't surprice you with something nice and unexpected (like a free bottle of water). We also stayed last year at this location and both time the staff (different both times) in the little shop where very unpleasant.;3
"I stayed at this property about six years ago in a suite provided by a vendor.  Overall I thought it was amazing.  On this trip, not so much.  As a Hilton Diamond member, I was upgraded to the executive floor.  As I rode up in the elevator I was excited about what might await me.  I was disappointed.  The ""executive floor"" room was no different from what you would find at a substantially less expensive property (think Holiday Inn Express).  It was a basic room with two full-sized (not queen) beds.  The bath was nice and spacious.  I entered the room to find a maintenance man standing on the desk spackling a ceiling hole that he said a previous guest had left.  He was polite, apologetic and quickly cleaned up the area and left.  The first thing that I noted was that that toilet";3
Abercorn house is conveniently located within the city center of London. It is proximal to the Hammersmith and City London undergound line as well as the Circle line. From the stations, the place is about a mere 3-5 minute walk away. There isnât much to be seen in that area by comparison to Soho or Lambeth but there are still some decent bars, pubs and restaurants within the vicinity.   The accommodation does not come with free wifi and one would need to pay a couple of Sterling or something to avail of the service. The room we stayed in is a Double bedroom with no bathroom inside however there are bathrooms that are gender specific which I would gladly say are clean and well kept.   I advise travelers to check-in in spite of being at the latter part of the city center.;3
This is a chic little hotel right across the street from Lincoln Center, perfect for visitors from out of town who are attending events there. We went to the opera as apparently did many other guests because when we got back to the hotel, there was a long wait for the elevators. Only two of the four were working, and they still were not working the next day. . For what we paid I expected better. Otherwise, the hotel is also near lots of great dining options including Moore Food and Drink where the breakfast buffet was a bargain!;3
Great place, great staff, great food and nice location. However, was kept up all night one night with club vibration and noise level. Don't stay on 10th floor. Food at Ed's Chowder house was really good.;3
I booked the Empire for a one-night stay because of its proximity to Lincoln Center. I arrived early after catching a red-eye from LA. I wasn't able to check in that early but the front desk arranged for security to store my computer and iPad and my other belongings, including a full-length gown with a train that needed a very high rack so it wouldn't wrinkle, to be stored properly. If only my room would have been as great as the service. I think Room 806 has mildew. The back of the bathroom door, visible when you sit on the toilet stool, looks like somebody pieced it together. The  directional handle in the shower did not work properly although someone from engineering showed me how to manipulate it. There were no wash cloths so I had to request them from housekeeping, which;3
This hotel was very clean and located in a nice area.  However, we did experience a lot of issues with our room's climate control and that was a bit of a problem.  I will say the front desk sent someone to repair it every time, but 7 times in a two night stay is a bit upsetting.  I would recommend it otherwise, but I'm not sure I would stay again unless I was assured the problems with the circuit breaker had been repaired.;3
Our stay was short but expensive as it was after Thanksgiving. Check in took ages. Their was no safe in the room & it took 1 day to put one in the room. Very small bathroom with 1 toilet roll which was not replaced when empty. We were also charged $5.44us extra after we had left the hotel & returned home. We never used the mini bar so cannot imagine what the charge was for! The upside of the hotel was its location, close to Central Park . Also the doormen & bellmen were friendly & welcoming.;3
This is in the ideal location for exploring NYC with Empire State, Madison Square and Broadway all a short walk.   Staff were friendly and helpful though it's a bit like being at Grand Central in the lobby!   Our room was more than acceptable but definitely a bit dated. That said, for city centre NY it didn't cost the world and was comfortable and clean.  There's a great diner - Tick Tock - attached which is perfect for breakfast and really popular. There's also a good Italian at the other side of the lobby which serves great food.   Given the price and location I'd stay again but it would be good to see the rooms being updated a little.;3
Welcoming staff, great beds, modern minimalist decor, bathrooms very clean. Rooms have complimentary water but no snack tray. Bar not open, both forgiven. Very comfortable! In the heart of Midtown. Recommend highly.;3
Location could not be better since the Lincoln Center is across the street, however I was not at all impressed with the rooms.  We paid $1400 for two rooms with king sized beds and, although the bed was quite comfy, the room was not at all impressive.  The bathroom was the size of a plane bathroom.  You could not sit on the toilet without the door being in your way.  It was not lavish at all and was not pleasant to use.  The lobby is nice, but that's the only thing impressive in this place.  The elevators are horrendous and get stuck every 10 minutes.  I'm assuming that is because the building is over 100 years old and I appreciate the fact that renovations cannot fix everything, but we literally waited 8 minutes for an elevator at one point.  And one was not working.  If you;3
Backround info: I visited the Astor during peak season (Early October) when most of the moderately priced hotels on Manhattan were already booked. I booked my room for 5 nights on www.lmtclub.com where all they had left was a 2 twin bed option for $155/night. Since I was traveling with my boyfriend, I asked lmtclub to put in a request for a single bed, preferably king or queen. I also made a point to call the hotel a week before my arrival to remind them of the arrangement. The staff sounded willing to put in the request but said that it wasn't a guarantee.   The Hotel: When we arrived the small hotel lobby was very busy with many international travelers. It definitely has a hostel-like feel though it is a hotel. When we checked in the woman at the front desk informed me that we;3
This huge hotel was very busy when I checked-in on December 31st in time for New Year's Eve 2016 Times Square ball drop on that same night. I paid a non-refundable standard queen room with guaranteed views of either Empire State Building, Manhattan skyline with Freedom Tower/One World Trade Center or Hudson River.  At the time I checked-in it was still early around noontime but front desk staff gave a room on the 26th floor and remind me that I can proceed around 3pm as this is the standard check-in time. Around 3pm I went to my room and found out that my room faced another huge building and has no view. I went down and told her the situation and annoyed me by asking what view I want as she is working with hotel for more than 20 years or so and she knows what she have given me.;3
The hostel was clean, Iâll give them that! It was also cheap and it was actually $100 cheaper than expected when we checked in which was great. It is however cheap for a reason, but to be honest I think you get what you pay for and we were happy enough. The bed collapsed every time we sat on one side and the shower had to run for literally 10 minutes to heat up - it was quite a comical experience! The ceiling fan didnât work either but they fixed it as soon as we notified them and they offered us another room after the bed saga. Staff were generally friendly too and it is in a good location. Good for a few daysâ cheap(ish) stay in New York.;3
Disappointed after all the good reviews on Trip Advisor.  Found staff at reception very unfriendly.  There is no double glazing at all which means you hear anything and everything at street level and we were 4 floors up!  Requested a room change and we got a quiet(ish) room facing onto a brick wall with the company of pigeons in the morning - no discount for the company! Make sure before booking you know about city tax, hotel tax and room tax .... it adds more than a few Â£'s onto the overall bill. Also on arrival, make sure the items placed in your room (ear phones, chargers etc) are unopened - we noticed both boxes had been opened when we arrived.  Any broken seals means you pay for the items.  All of which are cheaper at the department store one block away.  Beds were very;3
"We booked two rooms at this hotel since we were attending our daughter's graduation.  While it was very convenient to Universal if that's on your agenda, unfortunately, that's the only ""plus"" I can give the hotel.  I took advantage of the on-line check-in since I knew we would be very tired when we arrived at the hotel (due to the 3 hour time difference).  Upon check-in, I needed to change our check-out date (checking out one day early).  I had to state that I needed to change this date four times to the woman checking us in.  Additionally, it took us 15 mins. to check-in so I'm not sure what advantage the on-line check-in provides at this hotel.  Have not experienced this at other Hiltons.  The hotel food is very expensive and the parking is as well so be prepared!!!!  Bottom";3
We stayed for the meggit event but everyone who didnt stay at the hotel received their parking fee waived but we actually stayed at the hotel, paid more....and still had to pay for parking.We requested a king bed, but were told we could only book two queens. When I asked how much the price difference was they said there wasnt any. They were the same price but we could only book a queen based on the meggitt block.Lastly, the hotel was beautiful...and the staff at check in and during the stay was great......however for the price.....maybe a voucher for a free bar drink or 2....... or even to enjoy a bagel and a coffee in the morning would have been nice. Just expected a little more from the Hilton. The name is suppose to stand out from the rest.....but it was just ok.Thank;3
Rooms are very small for two double beds. The air conditioner did not work so it was warm at times in our room but they were great at constantly resetting the breaker to get it going again. Walls are thin!;3
The staff was a bit difficult, gave myself and my friend the run around based on our international credit cards and eventually told us that they weren't needed anyway. This whole process took about two hours as they assured we would need to go to a bank to get it sorted. In the end, the rooms were tight tight tight (as others have said) but the bathrooms, though shared, were nice, as was the location. Fun nightlife as said by others. Also the doors slamming, also previously mentioned.;3
Art deco hotel . but very tried from the 1st  floor upwards .colour scheme is very depressing . rooms small and pictures on website are misleading ,the photographer did a good job ,but u end up being disappointed. limited information in the rooms , large reception area but needs more seating  We had to change rooms as the suite was just to small However, the hotel receptionist was very helpful and sorted us out. Not much noise from within the hotel ,but the location is noisy even in the early hours if the morning .The city that never sleeps is a perfect description of this location;3
Location good. Next to train station. Front service desk always happy friendly service. Very small bed rooms. Need to update the Tv channels very old and outdated movies. Wifi is $10 a Day. Room cleaned everday.;3
My partner and I went to New York for the weekend to see the American Ballet Theater. As far as locations go, this hotel was excellent. We were literally across the street from the theater and very close to Central Park so that was ideal. I was disappointed in the room though. Regular sheets were used as the mattress sheet and duvet cover. Staff was friendly and helpful during our stay though.;3
"Firstly as many people here have written, Jeff the Doorman is the absolute star of the show. The day the Ameritania lose Jeff, will be a sad day indeed. He carries this joint! He goes beyond the call of duty and makes you feel very welcome. People buy people at the end of the day and this goes a long way in the success and failure of a business.  Now you are wondering why i have only given 3 stars? Well first the good; Obviously Jeff. He provided loads of local knowledge and recommended walking routes etc.. He took care of our shuttle bus back to airport. He was also friendly and always smiling which is nice. Hotel is a great location for Central Park, Broadway, Times Square and Hell's Kitchen. Nice Rooms. Lovely pan head shower. Free Wifi, but it did keep dropping out. Comfy";3
"As another reviewer noted: you get what you pay for.  And if you're flexible about things, you get a clean comfortable room in a great location at a very competitive price. But -   You've got to be willing to roll with inconveniences that get thrown your way. In our case, a woefully understaffed and poorly managed front desk that was overwhelmed with a large number of people trying to get their rooms, only to be told that they weren't ready yet (""another 10-15 minutes we were told). I water an hour and a half. (No kidding) Others from Germany waited two hours. Not fun.  When I finally got my room it was not what I reserved. I threw a bit of a fit and received an immediate and modest upgrade to a small room with a larger bed. The furniture appeared to be used upper west side faux";3
"I think this is a very good deal, considering how expensive most NYC hotels are. The location is good for public transport: its right next to a subway station for access to the West side, and only two short blocks away from a cross-town bus that will get you near to ""Museum mile"" on the upper East side. The room was comfortable, and the facilities were reasonable.";3
Fortunately we used Hilton points to cover the room cost as this hotel is vastly over priced. The rooms are fine but no better than previous economy hotels we stayed at it the LA area. This hotel charge for everything, $25 per day for parking, breakfast is an additional cost at appox $22 plus tax and tips per head. Even the bottle water in the room was $3.50! The only thing this hotel has going for it is the close location to universal studios. But on hindsight I would stay else where (Staybridge suites for example) and pay $15 to park at Universal. Please also note the porters claim you are not allowed to use the trolleys to move your bags (health and safety rubbish) and push for tips!;3
I came here for a work-related weekend trip and chose the hotel based on its 4-star rating.  I stayed in a single room (with no view) and was mostly satisfied with my stay.  The beds are comfortable, the look and ambience of the hotel are very chic, and the rooms have functioning amenities that made my stay problem-free.  However, the rooms clearly are due for a bit a maintenance.  For example, the ceiling shower head dripped cold water on me while I took a shower with the handheld shower head.  The wallpaper is peeling all over the walls, the cover of the box spring has a large disintegrating border, and the doors and walls have many visible marks and scratches.  I feel for the price I paid, I was paying more for the central location of the hotel.;3
Great location,  but not the best hotel. We had 2 rooms, 1 was cleaned once in 4 days , on day 3 , the other was not cleaned until we complained. Covid was used as an excuse for the lack of cleaning!  On a more positive note, , whenever we called the reception,  they were very prompt at delivering towells or toiletries or dealing with a faulty safe;3
The room was adequate. Nothing to get excited about. It was all about location for the event we were attending. If the electric in the bathroom and the air conditioner were working, and the price slightly lower, I could give it a higher rating.;3
Stayed for 4 nights at the hotel, great location, right across the street from 34th Street and Penn station, so ideal to travel around, plus in walking distance to a lot of attractions, such as The Empire State Building and Times Square.  The lobby is wonderful, this is an Art Deco hotel and the lobby is of a high standard, shame we couldn't say the same for our room, which was 'tired' and in need of refurbishment, having said that the bed was very comfy and the maid service very good.  Some people have said they only check if you have a hotel card dependent on the colour of your skin, this was not true, they check everybodies, and do so in a casual friendly manner.  All in all a good hotel, that is just in need of some TLC in some rooms.;3
The hotel was great. Bought theatre tickets from the Concierge and 2 as charged $70 US each over and above the box office price. That was $140 extra!!! My gosh highway robbery. Bloody big tip if you ask me. This actually soured some of my holiday in New York. Tip: no matter what do not purchase from the hotel.  Beds extremely comfortable,  rooms small but we knew that when we booked from research. Bathrooms very dated and need an overhaul. Rooms lovely and clean and the staff very courteous. Would recommend staying.;3
My partner and I booked this hotel through expedia. Only paid Â£500 for 6 nights, which at new York prices, this is an exceptional price. Ofcourse the pictures didnt really reflect the size or quality of the room, however it was a good base. The room didnt really have much natural light and it was very small, but the location really made it value for money and the rooms were clean! Bonus having a fridge. We used the location productively and visited a few bars nearby on Amsterdam avenue. Its also very close to central park (One of the best places on earth!) Also Sarabeths, which is a famous breakfast venue! Yummy ! If your all about the dinosaurs like me, then the natural history museum is closeby too. use the card machines for your tickets. I would recommend this place if you;3
"I used to stay here all of the time for many reasons but the most important one was for the lobby bar. I love the ambience, drinks, and your welcoming staff! Your lobby bar is a real gem and one that I absolutely favor over any in the city.    Recently I noticed a huge change in your hours, the bar opens up late in the day and closes early. Honestly, I find it difficult to enjoy drinks with limited hours especially when I'm entertaining clients because I feel rushed or on a timer. I'm rating you ""average"" due to the change in hours. Please bring back your normal hours.";3
Had 4 days in New York and couldnât fault the location of the hotel. As previous reviews have said, the extra Â£100 âservice chargeâ is just a stealth revenue uplift for the hotel- you get nothing for it, not even tea and coffee facilities in the room.  Check in team tried to sell and upgrade before weâd even seen our allocated room - definitely recommend you check your allocated room before agreeing to any upgrade (cost!)  Would advise against eating in tick tock - the food is over priced and poor. Forego the convenience factor and venture out a block or two.   Room was ok. Tired and bathroom âsweatedâ with ceiling dropping water after anyone had a shower.  The key selling point is the location!;3
I stayed here in December with family. The check in staff werenât very friendly. The room was nice and clean. No free wifi or hotspots, which is a little disappointing for such a well known hotel. Donât gets fooled into going to the sea food buffet. We were told it was $56 a head. Once we got the bill it turned out to be about $90 a head. That was with 3 soft drinks. The food wasnât that fantastic either.  There was a smoking are which was good. It was a seated area out of the way. There is a free shuttle bus that takes you from the hotel to universal city which is handy. Itâs a great hotel to stay at due to the location if you want to check out universal studios for a few days.;3
The hotel itself was in a really great local, and the decor was fantastic... However, the rooms (especially the singles) were very very small. Also, the wait staff at the restaurant could be at times very pretensious (i left without tipping once because i was absolutely horrified by the way the waiter was treating the man next to me) though the food was very good! Last note, they have a free cycle hire, which was an absolutely fabulous way of seeing Manhattan!;3
I've always loved staying at the Empire - the service and location can't be beat! I will say that the last couple times I've stayed, it feels pretty worn down.  The dark carpeting and rooms need a refresh.;3
We had stayed here ahead of an early morning flight a year ago and really enjoyed it. The decor is modern and the hotel was clean with great sound insulation from the airport.   So, we decided to stay here ahead of an international flight out of LAX. However, this time, the AC was extremely loud and rattly, and the room was showing some wear (stains on the couch, light switch being loose). For being one of the more expensive hotels near LAX, we would have expected more.   The one saving grace is frequent shuttles to and from the airport.;3
"My two teens and I stayed at this hotel last week.  I'll start by saying that the staff is friendly and helpful, there is security at the elevators (you must show a room key to get past them); the room itself (a double) was roomy considering rooms in New York are tiny, Penn Station is right across the street.  The beds are comfortable and clean.  Our first room was facing the front of the hotel which was a bit noisy. We were moved to a higher floor with a room facing the Hudson River, which was much quieter.  The upgrade was free since we were asked to move. The cons are that the bathrooms are tiny.  The bathtub was peeling and there is only a narrow shelf above the pedestal sink where you can put your stuff -- and if anything falls off the shelf, it could land in the toilet.";3
I was happy with the stay until we checked out. I paid $160 for a luxury suv to get to the airport and was sent a mini bus and was far from luxurious. Don't use this service and stick to The yellow cab;3
Although many find this hotel pricey for what you get, it's actually a nice little bargain if you don't want to stay in hostel type accommodation.  We stayed here for 7 nights from the 8th May. It was pleasant, reasonably clean, and quiet. Perfect after a long day in the big apple!   Our room was cleaned every day, bed made, bathroom extras replenished. The staff were helpful whenever we had questions, and stored our bags for us on our last day until we were ready to go to the airport.  Most of there issues seemed cosmetic. Nothing a lick of paint, some new curtains wouldn't improve greatly.   Our only disappointment really was no coffee in the reception area as expected, only tea. But the store next door sells white coffee for $1.   Location also perfect for the B&D lines that;3
We stayed with 2 small children to be near friends on Upper  West  Side - so location was perfect and as other reviews have noted, this is a great part of NYC for local shops, restaurants and proximity to midtown and transport options. The room on level 17 was basic but clean. There was a huge outdoor deck that we didn't really use and the single bathroom was very cramped - a generous sized person would find it difficult to use the toilet ! The most disappointing thing about the Woogo is that you feel that with just a little attention to detail this could be much better value for money. Sofa bed was uncomfortable and wouldn't suit adults. Sheets and pillows were very poor quality and the bathroom soap pinched from a competitor was a unique touch ! ?  Probably would try somewhere;3
The Empire Hotel is in a great location, close to Central Park, the Lincoln Center, great shops and the subway. The lobby area is stylish, the bar is nice. The breakfast which you get next door is ok but it's expensive and you're better off finding an old-fashioned NY deli to get bagels or pancakes at. Our room was very nice and the bed was incredibly comfortable. However unless you're used to high noise levels from the street, bring ear plugs. Made a huge difference. The biggest problem was our credit card being charged 3 times after we had left, even though our bill was agreed at only room costs on checkout. This is an ongoing problem and I know that several people in our party had the same problem, still not all refunded yet, over a month later.;3
Just back from the hotel last week, wasnt actually staying at this hotel but moved after the one I was staying in had bed bugs which we seen when moving the pillows.  This hotel but clean and average as expected..is every days hotel not more or less average but clean and comfortable. The room was small but was cleaned everyday. Seen no bed bugs/roaches!   The hotel was getting mantainence work so wasnt exactly tidy but I wasnt in very much! not sure if I would stay again as I would rather put more money for an expensive hotel.;3
The Morningside Inn was a good place for our family to stay while seeing the NY sights - near the metro, a grocery store, and enough room for us to get a good night's sleep.  Not a luxery suite, but very adquate for us.;3
I booked this hotel based on the reviews it received. However, when I checked in, I was quite surprised at the size of the room, which could barely have one queen size bed.  It is perhaps a good room for a business traveler but not for people who have come on a holiday.  The hotel staff was courteous and helpful, especially Jessica at the front desk was super helpful.  However, I had to check out the next morning because, for both myself and my daughter, the room seemed too small.    The hotel has lots of things going for it -  an old-world charm, lovely architecture, great location, beautiful restaurant cum a diner, and is probably value for money for people who would get a bigger room on higher floors.;3
The room had a very crammed bathroom. There were no glasses in the room for water. The comforter cover was torn. The room service didnât come in until 330. The end felt a little too hard and could be softer. The comforter was not warm enough and the rooms could benefit from more than one. Overall a number it misses.;3
We chose the Hilton Universal because it was the closest to Universal Studios on the map.  The map did not lie, we were so close, I have no idea why people used the shuttle.  We were at the park front gates with our 8 and 10 year olds within five minutes.  It is the location you are paying for.  The check-in process was great, the doormen were extremely friendly and helpful as were the ladies at the front desk.  The room was quiet, but the shower was the worst I have ever encountered in all my travels.  The water pressure was nonexistent, it did not matter how we adjusted the shower head.  This was one aspect that made the hotel not worth the price.;3
This hotel hosted a business conference that I attended. Rooms are small and not well appointed -- no coffee maker, small desk, no notepad or pen in room. No room service menu, had to have one sent up. Room service provided by Tick Tock Restaurant and was dreadful, everything arrived in paper bags with take-out plates and plastic cutlery -- including soup in a paper coffee cup! For that money, one expects at least a tray and real plates/cutlery. I love the history of the New Yorker Hotel but would not stay here by choice.;3
The staff were great. The room was tiny with a small window with an air conditioner in it making it feel like no windows at all and the blind was in bad shape. Clean bedding and good bathroom. No clock or any other amenities except a flat screen tv. Not a room I would want to stay for more than one night. kind of depressing. Safe neighborhood, close to subway. easy ride to times square and downtown.;3
Hotel was clean and beds were very good.  We had two rooms with children next to each other but no connecting doors. Arrived during a time where there was a large buffet in the lobby area next to the restaurant.  Lots of good looking food choices, but, really poor placement of the food. People wanting food fighting for space with people walking through arriving or leaving with luggage. It did not appear that there was an activity in the ballroom. Perhaps that would have been a better space to place the buffet.   Sleep was interrupted at 12:45 A.M. By inconsiderate neighbors. Had to call security at 1 A M as noise escalated. They did respond promptly. Noise stopped, but, we were awake for awhile.    There is a good fitness room, which I visited with my granddaughter. It is;3
This is my second time staying here.The location is great for visiting Universal studios.The room was nice.The bed was comfortable.The negatives was the the front desk supervisor came across as snobby and condescending.We had two rooms and parked one car.Charged for parking on both rooms.The room service was good, but again watch your charges! At check out there were many people at the desk with similiar charges issues ,as well as missing items.One guest complained of their credit card missing.We never had any problems with that.There is a safe to place valuables in.I probably would hesitate to stay here again based on the rudeness at the front desk.. I  cannot understand why service oriented businesses employee rude,snobby people in front desk, (first impression)  positions.;3
Nice rooms, especially those with view to the valley. At check in they gave us a room with heavy smell of cigarette smoking, we were immediately upgraded to a better room. Good value for money when booked through Expedia;3
We stayed for 4 nights in early December. Check in was easy but when we got to our room the bathroom sink was filled with dirty water, with a dirty glass next to the tap. We rang reception and it was quickly sorted, but it left us wondering how clean the room was given it has been left like that. The room was small but functional. It was hot though and we had the Aircon unit running constantly, which wasn't great for my skin. The location was fine, close to central park and sights like MoMA. We walked to most places we wanted to see. If we returned to New York we would stay in the village though I think. Overall a fine stay but nothing stood out and marred at the start by the cleaning issue.;3
The hotel is good for location and view and that is it. The hot water does not work and past reviews from a month ago validate this as an ongoing issue. They sent a handyman to look at the shower but the issue is the hot water heater so that was a joke. The front desk said they need enough people to complain before it can be fixed which is extremely tacky. The rooms are very basic and stuffy like a basement or attic smell. I was embarrassed that I booked this hotel for my family.;3
My wife and I stayed at Hilton Universal for a couple of nights in September 2012.  We found that it is a good value hotel ideally located for visiting Universal Studios (a short walk or via shuttle) and with convenient Metro train access to Hollywood (5 minutes).  We have stayed in Los Angeles a few times and found that this is one of the more convenient locations for seeing many attractions in Los Angeles.  The room was quite large and was clean and comfortable and the experience was mostly positive.  The biggest let down at this hotel is standard of service. When we checked in at a bit 4:00pm our room wasn't ready which is very inconvenient when arriving from a long haul flight with a function to attend shortly afterward.  Whilst this is not an uncommon issue, the delivery of;3
Helpful staff but the rooms were a bit dated. Great location to Universal Studios and city. We hired a car which you'll need to get anywhere else. One of our rooms had a bad smokey smell.  Pool and whirlpool was basic but ok. Pool bar closes around 6 - 6.30.;3
The front desk staff is a nightmare. Misinformed, rude, and argumentative (with each other) about policies. Rooms were nice and clean, but a bit expensive for what was essentially just a giant bed and side table.;3
The halls are scary looking (dirty and poorly maintained), the elevator feels like a tiny deathtrap, and the place appeared to be severely understaffed. But the room itself was fine, albeit small. But for the money (about 30% less than just about anything else) it was acceptable.;3
"We decided to stay here because of the famous name as well as its presence in the hit show Gossip girl. For what we paid.. the experience was not worth it. It was over priced, wifi was not included (what sort of luxury hotel doesn't provide this), as well as our reservation was mixed up and we were given a room smaller than all the other rooms (without the bed configuration we requested), with a blocked toilet and a barely working heating system.  Staff were polite and the location is perfect however the price we paid and the haste we went through was not worth it.  Would only stay here again if you paid me; in a city filled with other luxury hotels and apartments, there are many more places where you get your value for money.What sort of up market hotel doesn't offer wifi and";3
I stayed over 3 night at the Jane hotel, with the simple objective of a cheap place to sleep. New York being the city it is friends have limited possibility to put visitors up. For this objective the hotel works very well. Rooms are super tiny so you dont want to spend more time in there than for sleep. It is a dynamic and young hotel with a busy bar. I was however never disturbed by late noise but would wake up in the morning around 7-8 am from people in the corridor. Not being loud but the rooms are not very insulated. When I was there it was around 30C in temperatures and the room got really hot in the morning, and one couldnt open the window completely.  On the positive side the room and shared bathrooms were always extremely clean and there was never a need to wait for;3
Great gentrified location near the sunset strip,  Comfortable, if a little worn, rooms and clean.  Very nice breakfast. Very nice staff. Near some great funky shopping and restaurants and bars and coffee shops.;3
The New Yorker is one of those iconic hotels that you just have to experience. We did and we weren't too impressed. The hotel is showing its age. Wyndham has just taken over so it was still transitioning. Hopefully Wyndham can update the rooms to ensure many more years of business. It's just not going to get our business again for some time yet.;3
Tired hotel. Good location for Lincoln Center and Central Park activities. Noise from traffic is a bit much. Very difficult to use the pool and exercise room. Slow elevators. This hotel needs some tlc and remodeling.;3
We have stayed two nights in this hotel.First the positive things. Its very next to the metro station and good location (central park is few blocks away, nice restaurants takeaways near by).Its in Manhattan so can reach the main attractions very easily. Price is cheaper compare to the other Manhattan hotels. Bed was comfortable.  Now the negative reasons . Wifi never worked in the room (614). Notified few times to the front office staff. wrote it down in a book every time. but never sorted out until we checked out. I had to come to the lobby with my laptop to surf internet. Room door didn't shut properly. Complained about it. One maintenance guy came around and confirmed the door is safe and won't open without the card.But there was a big gap between and  I was worried about it;3
It has been our second visit to their establishment, as it has always been a correct stay within the average, the rooms begin to feel the passage of time, otherwise everything the same, the bathroom, perfect, and the location of the establishment its strong point . We had problems with the room keys (cards), of the 11 nights we stayed we had to go down to Reception 6 nights to reprogram the card, we were told it was by credit cards, but it was not true, we did not bring the keys Along with credit cards, was quite annoying. Thank you for taking action on this issue. We did not opt ââfor the hotel breakfast, since it was quite poor, plastic plates and glasses and very little choice. Thanks for everything.;3
Travelled with a group of friends. There was some confusion with our booking possibly due to our travel agent. The reception team were happy to assist. The hotel did seem to struggle with the volume of people queuing for reception and some requests took longer than expected to action.   The rooms were clean and comfortable. The decor is dated however and could do with some modernisation especially in the bathrooms.   The location was perfect considering we went to a a couple of sporting events at MSG.   During our stay there was a dog event happening at MSG. There were a large number of guests with dogs staying. As a result the lobby stunk pretty bad of dog.   A couple of the security guys in front of the lifts could also do with cheering up and take their jobs a little too;3
There is no doubt that the hotel is well situated - very close to the 96th St subway for easy access to downtown.   Around the hotel there are dome passable restaurants and we had a good breakfast around the corner with a 20% hotel discount.  The staff at the reception desk were courteous and helpful. That is about where the good news ends.  Our room on the 5th floor was not dirty as reported by some reviewers but it was dowdy.   It was definitely in need of updating and the bath had some bad stains.  Having said that, the shower was very good.  We had to ask for the complimentary toiletries but they arrived quickly. We were there for 3 nights.   The main problem was the thinness of the walls.   A couple next to us decided to have a loud argument at 2am which lasted for hours;3
"I'm currently staying at the Hilton Universal City (business travel), and although there is, so far, much to recommend it (spacious rooms, comfy beds), the lower floors (I am on one) should be avoided. Morning truck noise is terrible. I tried to get moved (I'm supposed to be here for ten days), but to no avail, and now am grappling with facing long week and a half of unpleasant mornings. DO ask for a high floor if you decide to stay here! (Other minor notes: the sofa in my suite was dirty when I arrived; wiped it down myself. No cell reception in room. Positives: comfy beds, super friendly room service.)";3
"While looking forward to our stay at the New Yorker Hotel, I received at least 1 email a day for 2 weeks upon confirming reservation on-line. Each email provided offers for upgrading my original booking.  Additional cost for upgraded room, additional cost for early check-in, additional cost for late checkout, and package additional cost for early check-in, late check-out.  This was concerning as I did not consider changing original booking for a 2 night stay. Turned out additional costs were billed regardless of my attempts to ignore as ""Facility Fees + Taxes"" were added for use of Wi-fi.  Room rate that I booked was for first night only, second night was significantly higher.  This information was not disclosed at check-in however, it appears if I paid attention to fine print,";3
This is an older property, but served my purpose.  Needed this area, and the location at Broadway and 73rd can't be beat.  Close to shops, food, and subway. I was with another couple so room became reasonably priced when we split the cost.  We were able to get a 1 bedroom rate on a two bedroom apartment. They only have a few of these (with no sitting area) which is better than taking a normal 1 bedroom with pullout couch in living area. The two bedrooms each had TV.  Kitchenette was helpful.  Couldn't check in till 3 which was annoying, but we could leave our bags.  On check out told them we need to leave our bags for about 2 hours, and they wanted $5 each...I complained and they let us just leave them.  Not luxury, but would likely stay there again.  Note that the name of the;3
From the websites pictures and itâs location donât be fooled. It is very average. It is in need of a major upgrade ie the decor, bathroom etc. However when we left it looked like it was getting a fresh lick of paint. The staff are amazing so helpful. However the rooms are where itâs let down. Due to the way the AC has been fitted to the windows, thereâs gaps which leaks in daylight therefore the room ends up freezing. Our shower had hairs in it when we arrived and the hot water for the shower was non existent. We had to preheat it by letting it run for a good ten-fifteen minutes before entering and it. The temperature was just about bareable. Also the windows I guess are cheap single glazing as the noise felt like the traffic was in the hotel room with us. But I guess itâs;3
A little bit disappointed with this hotel, not very clean and uncomfortably small bathrooms.  The rooms were big and quite ok. TIC TOC diner was good for breakfast. The location was also very good. What made us not want to stay here again is the resort fee that is charged for usage of fitness and business center.;3
This Hotel Yes Is very upscale for the San Fernando Valley/Hollywood.I did get a very good deal from Booking.Com. But when I arrived I had to pay $25 a day for parking AS A GUEST! REALLY! I stood in line behind a snobby lady that was telling her life story to the Bell Person , then finally they called out a Supervisor to help out other guest checking in.I should say he was an ok Man but not as Helpful as I would really think he should of been.The Hilton does not offer any Complimentry Anything it seems like.Everything is Costly in this Hotel Nothing is Free. I Guess you have to be at HILTONS Level to enjoy staying There.;3
Nice Hilton, best part is location to Universal Studies.  You can walk.  Clean Rooms. No Club Level for Diamond Members, nice work out facility.  Would go back.  Good Value.  They have a lot of places to get coffee and ice cream.  Nice gift shop, Parking overnight was not too costly for S. Cal.  I would go back.;3
Me and my mate stayed for 4 days.  I personally interacted with 9 staff members in this hotel. I'll start with the good ones! Sonia, Oravia, 1 more lady behind the omelette counter & an oriental waiter. They were really sweet! They gave a personal touch to my omelette and were polite. At the reception there was a russian girl who checked us in and was very sweet, chatty and helped us out in terms of directions to move around town. There was also a room maid who spoke no english but was very sweet and tried to help.  Now not very happy about mentioning this but I guess I have to if they want really want feedback to improve. There is a Latina on the reception desk with glasses and shoulder length hair who fails miserably in faking an American accent! She needs to understand she is;3
"On our trip to the big apple, we had more people show than expected and needed additional beds.   Our original hotel was out of rooms so we scrambled and called the Days Inn next door.   They had a room available and gave us a good rate, and then the desk attendent directed us to the web site for additional savings (20%).   When we checked in there was a nice lobby, but the upper floors and rooms were a bit dilapidated.  The carpets as other reviewers have mentioned we're in BAD shape.   We solved that problem by laying down all our towels and made a walkway around the room ;).  For what we paid ... it was worth the nuisance.  The staff was friendly, and the location is great.   The green line (1,2,3) metro is a stones throw away.   It was nice to pop up on 94th and be so close";3
Checked into the hotel on a Thursday for our wedding weekend. The lady who checked us in, Maggie was the most helpful worker at the hotel. She did everything that she could to accommodate us on our trip. But there were some problems with the hotel. Friday and Saturday we had NO hot water AT ALL! It took hours for it to get hot again. When we would call to get more towels and toiletries, they would take forever bringing it to our room. More than one occasion they didn't even bring everything that we asked for. At one point we went to the front desk to ask for a pen and paper and was denied it because they said they cannot give out anything like that and the man that said these things had an awful attitude and facial expressions like we were a disgusting bug. Upon checking out,;3
The hotel staff were very helpful, friendly and could not be faulted. The location of the Empire is great: very central and not too far from anywhere. My criticisms are: The rooms, described as deluxe, are very small and the bathroom was way too small to be a pleasant experience to use. The room was unhealthily hot with no way of controlling it. The wifi, priced at $13 per device per day was ridiculously overpriced. Maybe this NY for you. It my experience of other US hotels is its free.;3
Stayed in one of the single rooms which was really cute and despite the size of it, was really all you need. I like quirky hotels and this is one quirky hotel.  The bad stuff:  - The room was like a sauna because of the central heating and it felt weird having to sleep with the air con on in Dec just so I wasn't sweating - The FOH staff were very hot and cold. Depending on the day / time / person, I really couldn't tell if they wanted to help me or not - Bed was stiff and narrow, smaller than a single size  The good stuff: - Loved the uniqueness of this hotel - The bellboys were always friendly and helpful - Good quiet location away from the chaos that is NYC  Genuinely unsure if I would stay here again, I think I would more so for the price rather than the hotel itself;3
Our stay overall was all right.  We did not have the breakfast in the hotel--there is a place around the corner to get food items for a little less!  The room temperature was fine, and the lighting in the bathroom was good.  Any requests we made were handled quickly and accurately.  The only drawback was that we had to request housekeeping each day -- i.e., we would return to our room around 4:00 and it had still not been cleaned.  The only card we had for our doorknob was if we did NOT want our room to be serviced, so this confused us, and put us out a little when we wanted to relax after a day of walking around and had to leave when housekeeping came so late in the day.  Otherwise, everything was fine, the room was clean, etc.;3
Not the most comfortable room I have stayed the last few weeks in my latest travels ....the room was hot and couldn't open the one window I had in the room my shower was missing a door and when I called valet ahead of time and the front desk lady gave the valet the wrong ticket number and I waited almost an hour down stairs in the lobby for my car to be brought to me which delayed me for my appointment that day and for the $72 a night that you charge for valet this shouldn't happen .....;3
My husband and I decided to give this hotel a try during our weekend getaway to New York City and was disappointed with the quality of the hotel vs. the price we paid for the hotel room.  The room was very small - which wasn't as much of an issue, but the quality of the room was not great.  The radiator did not keep the room heated very well and during the first evening, I froze because the covers were very thin.  When I first went into the bathroom to shower, I could not get the water to turn warm but after about 10 minutes if playing around with the water handle, I was able to get it to warm up.  Then I couldn't figured out how to start the actual shower - which was a pain once I figured it out.  We would definitely NOT stay at this hotel again for the price they charge!;3
Lame room, no view, clanking heater, ugh.  Not many staff to help you in and out of the hotel, those front doors are heavy.  Front desk staff had me thinking Iâd get a great room and would enjoy my stay while I was checking in, but nope!  I didnât even bother complaining.  One positive, I do love the rooftop bar here, especially in the Summer.  Other than that I wonât be back!;3
We only stopped one night, Location is excellent right next to penn station and a 10-20min walk to most attractions and sights, the building interior is classic 20s style, staff were helpful, our room was on the 24th floor it was small and nothing special and the bathroom needed updating and a better shower. For the reputation and price we expected more.;3
"We chose this hotel because we got an exceptionally good deal and it came with recommendations from LA locals and this site.   Hollywood Hotel is a basic 2.5 to 3 star motel which feels very dated and is in need of renovation. The street it is located on is very busy but our biggest concern was safety. As two women we did not feel safe walking the streets in this area and while it isn't the hotel's fault it didn't help this rating. We were foolish and thought we would walk to the Hollywood walk of fame from the hotel. Bad mistake. Over an hour to walk there and we were followed by a group of males on two different occasions as we walked. Only when we got to the touristy area did we feel ""safe"". Having said that, we then discovered the trains and felt a bit more comfortable as we";3
Very big hotel Pleasant staff and very friendly and customer facing Queue at checkin always very busy   Rooms very small and no fridge or coffee / tea making facilities available  Also next door washroom flushing boises can be heard as walls very thin...  Bathroom very small Also Shelf in bathroom so small I struggled to find somewhere to balance my make up bag....   Bedroom door not weighted so you really need to pull on door to close as it won't close by its self which could be a problem !   Generally nice hotel just very small rooms;3
great location, close to subway station and Central Park. We walked every day to central park. Many restaurants around, a supermarket right by the corner. The hotel is a very old building, the staff is friendly. The place need a renovation.;3
Everything is small: the room, the bathroom. No place to store our clothes and other staff. The swimming pool is like a bath. DÃ©coration is nice and location is pretty good, near the main points of interest in NY.;3
the hotel has a great location, and holds 2 restaurants but the rooms were very small and it's an old building. There isn't much to explore if you're looking for historic New Yorker hotel stuff. The staff was great.;3
I arrived at Astor on the Park a couple of days after opening. The reception area was fine (as in the pictures) but when I got to my room, there was no duvet/cover on the bed, the carpet was full of paint marks and the wardrobe was placed right in front of the window! Strange I thought!- not that there was much of a view anyways. When I originally saw this hotel advertised. it was claimed as 'Home away from Home' - hmmm anything but! I asked to change rooms and the room I got was slightly better. Clean and comfortable, rooms were made up every day with fresh towels etc. If you are in NY you don't spend much time in your hotel room then this is was perfect, but if you are wanting a few more luxuaries away from home then I would not suggest it. There was no fridge, tea or coffee;3
You can't simply remove the shower door and call it a Roman Shower. There was extensive water damage in the bathroom.  The view of Lincoln Center was nice, but the noise from the outdoor events was a bit much.  Some heavier curtains would have helped dampen the noise (the noise being the only thing the shower didn't dampen!);3
Booked this hotel as the result of a bid on Hotwire. They have pretty small rooms as most other reviewers have noted.  Another comment:  if you bid on Hotwire or Priceline, etc expect to be upsold at the front desk.  This is a hotel that was built in 1932 and they have a variety of different room sizes and types.  There are no adjoining rooms if you have a family.  Very small bathroom counter space.  Hotel was updated in 2007 but windows were not.  TONS of street noise when on the lower floors.    REAL sketchy elevators.  At one point after arriving at chosen floor, the door only opened half way.  I had to physically push it open.  Hope those will be updated soon.  One display didn't work and one of the four guest elevators were not working at all.  During the stay two guys with;3
We decided to stay here as we bought early admission tickets to Universal.  When we arrived it was way to early to check in so instead of charging us the $45 early booking fee they let us check our bags and head over to the City Walk for lunch and a bit of shopping. After we came back and checked in they helped us up to the room. Room had an amazing view. We rested for a bit then headed to Hollywood Blvd. When we returned we went to the gift shop to get drinks. The girl behind the till couldn't be bothered to look up from her phone to help us. We went up to the room and learned there were no vending machines on the floor so back to the gift shop I went. She was still starring at her phone. I took a picture as she ignored me and then went to ask the bell desk (as front desk was;3
"We (adult family) stayed at the Hilton Los Angels / Universal City Last Summer.  We picked it as some relatives had stayed some months earlier.  It is a nice hotel near to Universal City and theme park, just a short walk away over a foot bridge.  The food was good, breakfast had all the variety you could want âbuffet styleâ; tea coffee is served.  We opted to pay each day, we were room only and it was no advantage to paying B&B for the few days we were staying; if fact the family deal was better value at the time. The Hotel itself is nice, we had adjoining rooms mid way up the tower and had nice views.  The hotel is located a short distance away from the Kodak and Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Blvd, just one stop of the âsubwayâ train.  The taxi from LAX is about 40+ minutes";3
A stay at the New Yorker is not a cheap experience even with a booking site. It was clean but limited.  No in room fridge,and the room while clean is small with paper thin walls. Ideal for staying in NYC because of location. The staff is friendly and considerate which made the stay bearable. If you are looking for a centrally located space with limited amenities.  This is your place.;3
I very much appreciated being close to the subway and close to all the theaters in midtown but the all-night noise due to the major construction work in front of the hotel was terrible. The rooms are small but clean.;3
"We stayed in New York for a total of 6 nights recently (27 May 2016).   The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and the bed was confortable.  But...  Tea and Coffee in the room was chargeable by the hotel - very poor attitude to charge for them! We stayed for 6 nights and had to rely on Starbucks for our morning caffeine kick!  The pool bar was overpriced and the cocktail drinks were rubbish! They appeared to come from syrup and the Mohito was made up of dried mint leaves (somewhat resembled a Sunday mint sauce!!! Don't go there; it was truly bad!) We only went there once, because of the bad experience - Very poor service!   The drinks at the hotel bar were fine.   The restaurant seemed OK but we never used it because it closed too early for us Brits!";3
The first room we were given on the 10th floor was run down, unclean and did not have a tub. We requested another room, the only difference was it had a tub. There were actual holes in the blanket and the tub had paint off and rust showing through at least 20% of surface. The room needed a good vacuum and cleaning. In order to see we had to turn on all the lights because all fixtures had in low wattage dull lights which did not help the experience, actually added to the dingy feel.;3
Having read the reveiws of the astor, I cant say I was looking forward to staying there, however we had no problems at all and actually enjoyed our stay. Yes our room was small, but it was clean with fresh towels every day, the bed was very comfortable and the tv had no spanish channels !!!. It was quiet apart from some grumbling from the radiator, no traffic noise or garbage collectors shouting at 3 in the morning as encountered on previous visits staying in mid-town. Staff were friendly, but we only found out on the last day that tea/coffee/refreshments were available along with computer access in the basement. The location of the astor suited us, but I think if it is your first trip then staying closer to the attractions would be better, it took us 1hr 30 mins to walk to;3
Firstly, I would like to say that the hotel for cleanliness, rooms and location are great.  The rooms were very clean and always well turned out. I have absolutely no complaints about that. Also the door and bell staff were very friendly and helpful. However, this is where the good parts end.  The reception and concierge staff look at you like you're something that they have stepped in, they also treat you this way.  The hotel allows dogs - not just service animals - but full blown spoilt pets.  One of my family has an allergy to dogs, and we were not made aware that animals were allowed in the rooms at the hotel.  This made our stay very uncomfortable.  Also, we had a spoilt poodle in the room next door to us for 4 of the 5 nights we stayed and every night it would not stop;3
Check in problems with no fee card. Had to use mastercard incurring conversion fee. Charges were confusing as they were charged, refunded and charged again. Hotel and service was fine but a little noisy even from floor 24. Overall ok;3
ok stay. location was great, but on the flip side, very noisy! always traffic/noise at all hours of the night. beds were not very comfortable, neither were the pillow. other places in nyc that are better for price.;3
"I had a room with two queen beds. The room was small, with little space to move or unpack; a desk and chair could hardly be used because they were too close to one of the beds. Requested and received a luggage stand so that I would not have to keep luggage on top of a bed. Bathroom was roomy and clean. Bathroom window did not close properly, which I reported to the desk, but nothing was done to fix it during my stay. Decor in lobby and room is dated, and there were signs of water leaks on room ceiling. Room was quiet (upper floor, facing away from street). Location very convenient to midtown and multiple subways. Staff very polite and helpful. Very decent accommodation for a short or medium-length stay (5 days). Convenient to a Starbucks and other dining options, though the area";3
Location was ok, we drove to Universal Studios and it was about 10mins away.  We walked to Walk of Fame but it was a long way, needed to get a bus back which was easy enough.  Room was clean and of a good size, had a fridge too which was great.  Breakfast was nice and plentiful but the menu never changed.  The staff were pleasant but did not go out of their way to assist or make things easier.  Didn't see the pool as it was too cold.   Hotel lift was often not working.  Overall it was adequate as we were out and about and hardly ever there.;3
Very dated hotel, which was surprising since it's on the Upper West Side.  The room was good and had a small desk, which was nice.  No blackout curtain, just cheap blinds so the room reflected a lot of street light and noise.  At least it was convenient.;3
Normally I love this hotel and the area.  I was disappointed this trip around.  Although the raw bar at the chowder house was very very good.  As was the bartending staff.  Very accomodating and friendly as well.;3
Being someone who has stopped at many hotels in new York including the Helmsley this was quite a downgrade however for the price it is good value and if you are willing to travel on the subway or taxi every morning in order to get into the life of the city then this might be for you . There is a very friendly cleaner that goes round everyday and cleans the rooms and they are very tidy but very small and the decor of course is of quite a low standard but is still modern and what you expect. The most terrible part about this hotel is the elevator it sucks and after a long hot summers day in the city the last thing you want to do is travel up this hotels slow and cramped elevator this really bugged me and these are the sort of luxuries you sacrifice when goin to a cheap hotel;3
The air-conditioning was great during the record-breaking heat wave and our room was quiet, cool and clean...perfect for recovering after a long day in the city. We didn't spend much time there, but the housekeeping and doormen were efficient and thorough. Right across the street from the Lincoln Center and Central Park. No in-room coffee service.;3
Good location rooms need refurb.  Roof top area a bonus in nice weather.  5 dollars fir squirt of coke in plastic cup with loads of ice a rip off if guest at hotel should not be expected to pay this rate with added 22% tip on top most expensive soda ever had come on empire we are paying for stay understand alcoholic drinks should be paid for but not soft drinks! No free WiFi in room but has it on rooftop again as paying customers we should have this available in rooms;3
We stayed at the Hilton for two nights towards the end of a trip to the US from Australia - the rooms are great and have everything that you'd need, including a chargers for every sort of phone or device ever invented, and I have to say that this is smartly and tidily managed at the main desk.  What lets the hotel down is low staffing levels at reception, the fact that the pool bar is only open one day a week, (a small gripe, but we stayed when the weather was hot and the hotel advertised a pool bar), and the buffet breakfast is average and incredibly expensive.  It was hard to flag down a passing waiter at breakfast to get hot tea and drinks for the kids, and then even harder to get someone to get the check signed.  On top of this I got a follow up call to say that I needed to;3
Good location,  Rooms a bit small, but decent.  Cleaning staff was not consistent.  One day I would have no bathmat, another I would have no face cloths, another day I would be down to 1 cup.  I had to write al list of stuff I needed on  my 3rd day.;3
A bit disappointed with the hotel this time, stayed 6 years ago with my husband and had a fantastic room, was really spacious and clean, unfortunately not so this time, we were on floor 20 and felt like we were in a converted storage room, 2 double beds with barely enough room to move around, extremely dated compared to last time,looked like the room hadnât been decorated in years. Pokey bathroom with a bath you couldnât possibly lay down in and a shower that if you were taller than 5ft had to bend over backwards to wash your hair, grubby skirting boards and paint peeling off the walls, floor never got hoovered in the time we were there. Overall canât say Iâd recommend this hotel and if we visit New York again think we will stay elsewhere;3
OK, this depends what you expect out of a hotel.  Firstly, when you arrive after travelling some distance (from the UK) at a hotel, and your room isn't ready and they don't know when it will be ready (fair enough, we've only had the room booked for some time) and you are told you will have to wait.  OK, that's kind of fine, but when you ask for somewhere to freshen up, get changed etc you are told there are toilets upstairs, hmmmm not exactly the warm welcome we were expecting.  So off we went, to the toilets, to freshen up and get changed.  Thankfully, Pasquale became available on reception who was far more helpful and managed to get us an idea of when our room will be available - thanks Pasquale  The reason for the 3 rating is this hotel is its location or it would have been;3
needs up grading ...brown carpet looked dirty and hard ,,when we first went into room the bed was made but the room had not been cleaned old receipts where lying on the table and there was used soap still in the bathroom I'm glad I ask my wife if she had opened the soap before I showered as we always take shower gel and soap;3
"While updated, this still bears the signs of being an older hotel. The rooms are small, with some awkward layouts. Halls twist with right turns at strange places. No options to do your own laundry. Lobby gets crowded when groups arrive or depart, with no good overflow space. Information desk was very helpful and friendly. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was small with black gunk in some corners and the ceilings were cracked. TP in an awkward location.  Housekeeping couldn't follow the ""green"" option and replaced towels and linen daily.";3
"Allocated room 3019 for a five night stay, this was an upgrade to a ""view"" up 34th Street towards the Empire State Building.  Booking in was simple and quick, I had managed to arrange an upgrade before arriving, the room was fine but not as palatial as room 2607 on my last visit, but then it was not as expensive.  Took several meals in the Tick Tock restaurant, all fine but not out of this world. Also had a meal in the Italian Restaurant, very nice meal.   Made full use of the Facility Fee with calls back to the UK, both landline and mobile numbers.  Everything was great APART from the building work opposite the front of the hotel which went on into the early hours of the morning. Pheumatic drills were being used up to 3am. The reception staff were uninterested with the comment,";3
"Not really, but apparently it could happen at the Empire Hotel. You see, they were filming Gossip Girl in the lobby and in front of the hotel today. I had called down early for a 1pm checkout (rather than noon), and Don told me that that would be fine -- 1pm was the latest I could check out without additional payment -- I thanked him. At 5 minutes after 12 noon, the housekeeper ignored my ""Do Not Disturb"" sign and knocked -- I told her I had a 1pm checkout. I was rushing now, having to go to the post office to mail a box, pause and be quiet on the first floor while filming was going on, then rush back to meet the 1pm deadline. At 12:30pm, my key would not let me back into my room. I hurried down to get a new key, paused outside the elevator again with others until we heard";3
For the price of the hotel don't expect Hilton. It is a nice budget hotel, rooms are small but OK. Rooms are clean, every day new clean towels. Location is good, between two subway stations.  If you travel from/to La Guardia Airport, there is a bus stop nearby, and the ticket price to the airport is only 2.75$.;3
"The room had been very reasonably priced. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. It 's a very large hotel, so long hallways and waits for elevators, but for the price it's fine except the morning of check out a bill stuffed under the door showed we had a balance of $35.00. We did not buy in-room movies,but used the ""free""internet. Turns out all rooms are charged this 35.00 charge at checkout regardless. So beware the internet is really not free, and even if you didn't use the ""free"" internet you will be charged. So room ended up being more expensive than I had chosen to pay. Very sneaky";3
I think the rooms need a lot of work to be at the level they charge for. There are lots of paint chips in the shower area and doesn't look well kept up. I couldn't get a steady water temperature for a shower. The first room we stayed in didn't have a shelf in the bathroom or a towel rack so no where to put anything you typically would put in a bathroom. The bathroom size was about the size of a European bathroom at a 2-3 star hotel (hardly much room to even turn around in). The line was long to check in and I saw this line very single day I was here. The same with checking out. I would not recommend this hotel in it's current state.;3
I stayed here twice last month, on business. The hotel decor is quite dated and dark, but for a New York hotel, the room space was not too bad. I enjoyed a great view from the 4th floor facing the New York Philharmonic, thanks to Patrick from the front desk. What I liked best was the hotel's close proximity to lots of interesting places including Columbus Circle, Central Park and the Lincon Center.;3
We stayed here for 4 days recently and although it has some positive qualities, overall it would be low on my list for future stays. First the good, we were upgraded to a junior suite and given free wifi for the stay. Having a roof terrace is very nice in New York during the summer as you aren't stuck in your room when not out - looking out with a beer at the end of a hot day was really nice. Its location isn't too bad, a quick walk to the park, not too far to 5th Ave and Times Square, Columbus Circle area has some decent clothes shops also. It was also surprisingly quiet. Check in and out was quick, courteous and easy.  The not so good. The decor is awful, like a bad 70s movie, leopard skin prints furniture, dark heavy fabrics on walls and everywhere, most rooms seem to have;3
Stayed here for one night. We used the free airport shuttle from and to LAX. Fast and convenient.   Our room was nice and spacious, but the windows were very dirty.   Breakfast was included in the room price ($230). At check in we were told to pick up breakfast vouchers the next morning. Why donât give them to us right away when breakfast was included?  The next morning we forgot about the vouchers. The waiter gave us a breakfast menu card and didnât even ask if we had vouchers. What a hopeless system. We noticed that several guests were in the same situation as we were. After breakfast the waiter came with the (insanely overpriced) bill, but after remembering and getting our vouchers the bill was annulled. Still, ridiculous system.    Wouldnât stay here again. There are a lot;3
It's interesting how there are rooms available online but claims are made in person that there are rooms available for months;3
Pros: â¢ Great location, a few minutes' walk between times square and central park. â¢ Cute decor and nice little rooms â just big enough â¢ Renovated, modern suite bathroom â¢ Nice staff  Cons â¢ Room smelled a little moldy and toilet smelled mildewy â¢ Tiny bathroom was extremely cramped â¢ Bedroom area of suite needed renovation âÂ notably, peeling/stained wallpaper was unsightly.;3
I stayed here four years ago and feel the Hotel has gone downhill. The air conditioning unit did not work and the bathroom door was hanging off the hinges. However the staff are very friendly and helpful. It is in a good location.;3
We were in NYC for the weekend and tried this place through Hotwire roulette. It's a great location and reasonably good value. Our quibble with the place is that we requested and paid for a non-smoking room with a queen-sized bed. That particular combination was unavailable and they tried to convince us that we had requested a smoking room, thus not offering a discount. The standard size non-smoking room was fine. It's just the principle if the thing.;3
I had a long lay over coming back from a Mexico vacation. The place is very convenient but if you're tired, this place is not the place to sleep, the walls are very thin and you can hear everything. Not sure I would stay here again.;3
I came to the Empire Hotel because of a conference nearby. The location is glorious. You're across the street from Lincoln Center, a block away from Central Park, and 3 blocks north of Columbus Circle. And that's about the best thing I can say about this hotel.  The Empire Hotel is a boutique hotel that, as far as I can tell, was built in a time before boutique hotels were trendy. The rooms are, as you would expect, tiny. But that's no big deal. The bed and bedding is attractive but not exceptionally comfortable. Surely that's a simple thing that can be changed to improve the room. There's a desk and chair, two nightstands, a wall mounted television, and a dresser with a padded top which can serve as seating. That's about all you can fit in the room.  One thing that often;3
The beds are only full not queens. It was very uncomfortable for our family of 3. The location and service was excellent.;3
This hotel was interesting, The staff were lovely and couldn't do enough for us, and the hotel was clean and very tidy however the actual hotel could do with having a little extra love put into it.  Our room was very small and again whilst it was immaculate and the beds were really comfortable the only plug socket we could use was in the bathroom as the massive, un movable wardrobe was blocking two, one was hanging from the wall and the plugs kept falling out of the only remaining one. The room had an alley view, and the blinds weren't overly practical as they didn't really work.   Whilst we had mixed opinions on this hotel, for price and location - right between two subways, on Central Park and in a relatively safe area for shops and some diners for the amount of time we;3
Very nice staff. Let us have late checkout. Room was warm could not get it to cool. Shower balanced that out by not getting hot. Small room a little noisy. I have no other hotels to compare it to. I would stay again. Seems to be a good deal.;3
"The only reason to stay here is its closeness to Lincoln Center.  We have stayed at 5 different hotels in NYC the last month and a myriad of hotels worldwide. This is the only hotel that charges you for making coffee in your room. Cannot be a big money maker for them with a Starbucks  in the same building on the street level. And Starbucks is cheAper!  The barhroom was barely big enough to turn around in, the sink did not drain and the door was dirty and in need of paint. Another unique feature was the ""intimacy"" package for purchase that  included condoms and other ""items"". Strange. Long line at  Checkout while employees chatted with guests. No reason to stay hete. Plenty of other nicer places for the same price.";3
The hotel was very nice however it was extremely overbooked which caused the elevators to be over crowded and frequently delayed. The restaurant buffet area spills into the lobby which is both strange and a pain to line up for food since the food lines are in the direct walk way of the lobby. I was treated well though for the brand and the price of the stay I would likely consider alternatives.;3
My wife and I were very much looking forward to staying at the hotel due to the big hype it gets everywhere. We were rather unimpressed.  The rooms are very small and the bathrooms even smaller. The staff, although fairly friendly, have a very rushed attitude. This helps in receiving assistance quickly, but you never feel calm and relaxed. There are always lines of people waiting for checkin, bag storage, drinks, everywhere. This is probably the reason the staff seem so rushed, but I like a relaxed feel when I get to my hotel. If you enjoy returning to a calm and soothing atmosphere after a long day of shopping or sightseeing, this is not the place for you.  The other thing you'll notice at the elevators, is a bunch of people waiting to take their own luggage to their rooms. I;3
The hotel was fine, the breakfast was just what you need to start the day, the only bad thing is that the maids stole from our suitcase the keychains we had bought for family and friends, we notice that, when we came back home from our vacation, so my recommendation is, keep all your souvenirs in the safe or lock your suitcases, of course  little souvenirs are easy to stole and fit in your packet. :-(;3
We go to this hotel every 2 months as is closed by our business in Upper West Side. There are hotel options available. Sometimes Empira is just too expensive for what its offers. Rooms are very well maintained, but the interior rooms (without view) are not for us. Elevators is a painful experience. Wait and wait and stpos in every floor even there is nobody waiting. The sunchronizing has to be improved. But the hotel is very nice, facilities, bar and employees are very friendly.;3
Just finished up a six night stay to take in the holiday season with my wife. My past stays here were very enjoyable, so it was disappointing to experience less than what we had come to expect.  We were without water for a few hours one day, but were understanding because they had the courtesy to warn us. Then, two days later we found ourselves without hot water - making it impossible for either of us to shower or wash up before leaving for a full day of activity.  On the morning of our last day, I went to the front desk to request a late (45 min) checkout. I received no apology for the inconveniences caused by the lack of water/hot water and an unfriendly response to my request. Although she did acquiesce, it was frustrating to interact with someone who exerted such little;3
Very good location and the staff are pleasant and friendly. The rooms are small, basic and a bit tired and our corridor was a little noisy as was unfortunately put in a room across from the ice dispenser machine. The tick tock diner downstairs was great for breakfast. WiFi was also very good. All in all, good stay but have stayed in better city break hotels in New York.;3
Very expensive for a very basic room, at least the week I was there.  Small room but not unbearably so. No refrigerator or coffee maker, had to request both and then had to pay for refrigerator which was put on the floor because there was nowhere else to put it although it was the typical size for a hotel room. Also had to keep suitcase on the bed because of lack of space. Only one electrical outlet accessible. I expected much more for the price of the room, and some renovation is needed throughout the hotel.  I have heard though that some rooms (the expensive ones) have been renovated.  Excellent location for sightseeing but noisy neighborhood.  Staff was very good and helpful, and you have to show room key to get to elevators which is good security.  Elevators were good.;3
I am so disappointed that this property charged to hold bags after our checkout and until our pickup for our departure from the city.Â  That $5 pushed me over the edge and I will be leaving negative reviews on Google and Trip Advisor.  I booked a queen view room.Â  There was no scenic view of NY as promised in your website. The view in 3340 was of the guests in the rooms across from us, we were in the armpit of the corner.Â  The room size is misrepresented in the pictures on the website, and the room was so cramped that i hit my knee on the heater every time i attempted to exit the bed and maneuver my way around the heat unit to the bathroom.   and of course, there were no amenities such as complimentary coffee in the room or lobby.  If i were staying for more than one night, i;3
"Nice place, great staff, cool restaurant/bar.....but i couldn't sleep. The constant noise of the heavy doors closing was too much. there is a door every eight feet, as it's a ""pod"" hotel. I am a heavy sleeper, but....";3
O.k letâs start with the positive`s a comfortable bed with good views from rooftop & friendly staff with locality reasonably close to the sights!..... Not so positive we arrived to be told upgraded, pleased yes!, but from early evening found out we were the room next to lift shaft (room 801 f.y.i) this was o.k days 1 & 2 as we were so tired slept through anything, but after that the lift shaft got really noisy, room was very small with no view except of other dirty rooms pidgeon dropped windowsills....air conditioning was great but dirty grates and old paint rest of the room was freshly decorated???, the hotel in professional photos looks classy/mood lit but in reality is dark and dinghy with stair carpets dirty and with a musky smell to them, obviously its an old hotel;3
The best thing about the Empire Hotel is its proximity to Lincoln Center. Catch a concert, visit Central Park, go the Time-Warner Center (grab lunch at Bouchon Bakery if you can't get reservations for Per Se!), in good weather, hang out at the hotel's rooftop pool and deck. Just don't plan on spending much time in your (tiny) room.  If you just need a clean, pleasant spot to sleep, shower and dress while taking in the sites of Midtown Manhattan, you've come to the right place. It's not cheap, but it represents a good value given this location.;3
If you need an airport hotel, I guess itâs ok, but the Hyatt place is far better, newer, more comfortable. This place is full service but dumpy. The management is nice but food yuck. You can definitely do better.;3
This Hilton hotel has definitely seen lots of action. The hotel is situated a few minutes fron Universal Studios, and there is a free shuttle to CityWalk...a must for new visitors. The rooms are big, clean and spacious. The pool area is nice. It's a regular hotel with a bit of dated glam. Could you some renos to the carpets and elevators.  Beware that you will be nickled and dimed to death, which is tough to swallow given that you're paying very high rates to start.. From charging for parking to wifi ($8 PER unit PER day...seriously!?!). The buffets are pricey, so I'd suggest eating at CityWalk where the prices are much more reasonable. Go during the week so you can avoid the congestion.  Not sure that I'd stay at this resort again.;3
I would say this hotel is fine if you get a reasonable rate (if I recall, the rate on their website was not great). If I'd paid full price I would have been disappointed.  The area is convenient. While I thought it was quite poor/sketchy when I arrived, it seems that's pretty well the outward appearance of most places in LA/Hollywood and after getting used to that, felt comfortable in the neighborhood.  The housekeeping was poor, and I don't think I have EVER said that. My issue wasn't with the cleanliness, but with the replacement (or lack thereof) of towels and other basic items. There were many little things that added up for me, but one bar of soap (there was no body wash, so this was both for showering and hand washing) was provided to me for my 4 night stay. I have no;3
The Empire Hotel is in a great location - walking distance to many restaurants and Central Park. However, the air conditioning system was very noisy and I didn't get a great nights sleep. Also, there were no coffee making facilities in my room. My colleague did have a Keurig in her room, but was told the hotel was out of k-cups.;3
This hotel is really centrally located for many major attractions in NYC such as Macy's and the Empire State Building. However, the hotel room needed major upgrades... First, another family we were there with found an empty beer can in their room which is obviously doesn't make you feel like the best cleaning job was done. Our room had chipped molding and dim lighting. The bed was not very comfortable. Also the room was not spacious but that is expected for NYC. The lobby was nice and the diner in the lobby was convenient and pretty good.;3
The picture shows the most desirable bit of the hotel. Its very beige standard fittings. Gross bed duvets. Helpful reception. Breakfast is good but walk outside and down the driveway than back in as the lift is very dodgy you begin to wonder whether you will be able to get out.  Breakfast had waffles, bagels, eggs, cereal, lemonade, coffee, toast, bacon etc. Hotel is quite far from hollywood thank fully a mtr station is close. Wendys burgers just across the road. Ok hotel for the price.  Actually stayed in april 2010;3
This hotel has two positives: first, the staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful. They let us check in early and that gave us several hours of touring, which we appreciated. Second, the location is excellent--within walking distance to the park, Times Square, the Theater District, subways that take you downtown etc. BUT, the room was a huge disappointment for a Four Star Hotel. First, the bathroom was minute. Standing room only. No hand towels, half a shower door, no counter for personal belongings, no hair dryer. Just a toilet and a shower and a pedal-style sink. Even the lining in the trash was missing. The room had very little extra space and the decor was odd: jungle-like. The beds were made up --but, no flat sheets--just fitted sheets and comforters lined with;3
Stayed here for a couple nights before we were due to fly home as was most handy to the airport. We had two rooms booked and on arrival both the rooms were dirty - litter on the floor in both rooms. The noise from the planes in the room closest to the airport was horrible and went all night long every 10 minutes. The other room on the other side however was fine. We requested a room with a bath as wanted a chance to relax before our flight. Bath was a waste of time, fills up to a point suitable to bathe a toddler. Was also covered in a layer of grunge on arrival (pictured). Disappointed. Beds were however comfortable and some of the staff were friendly.;3
I stayed here for one night on nov 17th after finishing up a week cruise.  This hotel was a last minute choice and it was an ok choice.    The location was easy to find and once I got into the lobby my reservation wasn't ready yet so they told me to park my car in the back. Once I parked my car I sat in the lobby til my reservation was ready (I had booked it from priceline an hour before).   There sitting I watched interesting guests blaming the hotel for their personal own shortcomings such as cell phone service and providing slippers.  My own opinion about the staff is decent but they will not put up with crazy requests.    I checked in a couple minutes later and went up to my room.  The room was decent with a queen size bed and a nice bathroom.  The decor was movie like and;3
We only needed a place to stay for a night.  This place was perfect.  It was in a good place, near subway and places to eat.  Easy to get to.  The price was extremely good for NYC.  It is an older place, but it was fine for us.  Not the Ritz, but it was a good stay for us.;3
Nice hotel. Good location and friendly staff. The wifi is terrible though. Free in lobby only and paid connection was so slow to even use! Also they said you could connect a second device but a code was not provided. Had to call and get one from the front desk and it never worked.;3
The architecture and design of the hotel is beautiful, however, the size of the rooms doesn't match the price.  I first booked a queen size room but when we checked into the room there wasn't enough room to put our luggage and walk around the bed at the same time.  The closet was just a space in the room blocked off by a curtain and you couldn't close the bathroom didn't have enough space for you to hardly turn around in a circle.  The assistant manager and front desk clerk was helpful in showing us a larger king size bedroom.  Nevertheless, the design of the bedroom is more on a boutique contemporary level with spa design bathrooms.  The major flaw about the bathroom is that the shower only has one door.  That's right, one door!  Therefore when you take a shower water will;3
The Empire has emotional meaning. I have a condo on W. 63rd I rent out. 10 years ago it was renovated and my mom, brother and I stayed at The Empire. You had been newly renovated. In 10 years, something has gone awry with the management. It has a terrific location and I dig the decor. It's funky kitsch and you have some really great people, like Sophie, working at the Front Desk. Minuses: Got stuck in the elevator w/2 other people Saturday night. The TV isn't operating correctly and a technician came up, said the problem was downstairs but was never resolved. I didn't need to watch special movies but if I did, I couldn't have. There were no robes when I got here as promised in your write up and the coffee maker sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. I will come back here as this;3
Hotel is nice. Not sold on the location though. Arrived early (approx. 3 hrs before check-in) after flying all the way from Perth, Australia. Woman at the check-in desk, wasn't too friendly or helpful. No rooms available early so left our bags there for a few hrs. Breakfast included, ok breakfast in nice environment. Good sized room. Close to metro. Perhaps next time I wont stay in Hollywood though. Burbank etc is nicer;3
First let me start off by saying the hotel as a whole us fine. You can't beat the location as Times Square and Central Park snd great shopping are all within walking distance. The hotel is old, of course, but clean.  We found the rooms are very New York small (you'd be hard pressed to get 2 adults and two large suitcases in one room and the room is very dark, the lighting is horrible Also, buy water somewhere else as they charge $5 for a small bottle if you drink the water in they supply in the room! You can buy it down the street for $1.  I probably wouldn't stay there again just as a personal preference. I think for the price you could probably find a little more upscale room, but like I said the location is great and you probably won't be in it much.;3
Needs updates and proper room maintenance. Bad experience trying to get things fixed. Would not stay at this location again and would not recommend vto families. Stay next door at the Radisson Hotel if possible;3
"This was my second time staying at the Astor (you can scroll down for my initial review). I won't rehash the same things that I wrote about it, as not much has changed. But this time, I was in a much less renovated room. This room was a little bigger (though not by much) but less ""fancier."" It clearly has not gone through their renovation process. It also had a DOOR leading to a rooftop! The door was locked from the inside as I wanted badly to climb out to the roof. If they could fix that roof (and the room), then they'd have one heck of a premiere room. I took photos of the door and the view.   This room was in need of new paint and the bathroom was moldy but it was still fine. It was definitely a little cleaner (I didn't find any hairs). They STILL don't have free WiFi! C'mon,";3
Classic NY 70s high fashion style in black and gold. Dark. If you like that kind of thing . Rooms are decent size for NY, bathrooms nicely updated. Bed comfortable. Closet is useless for hanging anything longer than a sport coat. That's ridiculous. Staff pretty attentive although one bartender a complete jerk, but another was great. Nightclub upstairs but served by separate elevator, so no interference with rooms. Location great for getting to Lincoln Ctr and Central Park, decent walk for Times Square , but far away from late night eats, restaurants , and bars.;3
"I would have given this place four stars, but for disappointing and frankly incorrect advice regarding a taxi booked by reception, which in any event failed to turn up. Be aware that, contrary to their advice, it is now fixed fare in a yellow cab for the return journey to JFK, as well as the inbound journey.  This place is fine for a solo traveller and I would probably choose to stay there again on my own; I definitely would not stay there if travelling with my wife. The compact room was fine for me and the communal bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean. Be sure to seek out the eccentric bar on the ground floor. If you ask politely, they do allow photographs.  The environs are great: ""up and coming"" might be how they would be described. Reminds me of, say, Shoreditch, in London. I";3
When I arrived I saw that the shower had no door. Did not bother to say anything since the rolls of towels on the floor told me they were aware of the condition. Also, they charge you for the coffee in the room and wifi which feels like being nickled and dimed, (charge a bit more and have that be covered). Decor was nice and staff friendly plus the location is very good. All said the good and the bad average out.;3
"Worst Hilton I've stay at so far. The breakfast buffet was disgusting and the food was old. The room was mediocre and I was charged for a microwave - which was pretty ridiculous. I would definitely not stay at this hotel again; I would choose the Sheraton Universal next time.";3
We could never get either the TV or the heat/air conditioning to work, despite having staff up to instruct us on both, and the beds have stands with legs like exposed square pipes that each of us accidentally kicked with our bare feet during the night. Ouch!;3
The Empire is very close to where I do business when I'm in NYC, but it would not be my first choice in places to stay.  The rooms are extremely small (particularly the bathrooms) and poorly lit.  Some of the amenities--the in-room safe, the umbrella--are very useful, but the hotel lacks other amenities typically found in less expensive hotels: glassware, a coffee maker.  Housekeeping is generally adequate, although on this most recent trip, I had to call the front desk nearly every day to request that wash cloths be brought to my room, since housekeeping failed to do it.;3
"After reading reviews here, I was a little iffy, but the price was great for Manhattan ($85 for a double, hall bath) and especially for the really wonderful location - pretty and convenient to subways, busses and Central Park. I checked prices online and called directly and asked them to give me the same price as an online site because their direct price was higher. They did. I also asked for the best room and apparently that worked because as I found out later they switched us to the ""newer"" section after my request. Newer is a relative term I guess. The good news is it was very clean - especially the shared bath/shower (we never had to wait since there were two bathrooms on the floor) - had a sink in the room (albeit chipped), a TV which worked enough for us to watch something";3
Check-in welcome was miserable & as flight got in late we couldn't have 2 rooms on same floor let alone next to each other! Think we had what is called a metro room for 3 people it was very small & totally outdated however, it was clean & beds comfy. Location was great for Penn Station Sub, Macy's & Empire State. It was pricey for what you got so I'd look to stay somewhere different if I go again!;3
Looks very impressive as you approach on the the street, inside it has some old world charm but not as much as you expect from the outside. We had a coffee and snack there from their snack bar and sat in the foyer. The light feature and ceiling are fantastic. It is in a great location but is probably noisy.;3
"Compare to other ""cheap"" hotels on the UWS this is by far the best choice. Located directly at the subway (express & local lines). Upper floors seems to be freshly renovated and offer a decent size for NY hotels in this price range.   The only down side is that there are only two elevators active, which could lead to significant waiting times during peak hours.";3
I went to New York on July 1,2016. Hotel checking went pretty good. Got the room right away.  The room was small but it was clean. Bathroom also very small but clean.  The housekeeping was good also. Security was very good, no outsider could get in. All guest had to show room key to get into the elevator.;3
"Four stars if not for elevator problems. Yeah, they're upgrading it, and that's like going through I-5 when construction is going on, and it's nobody's fault - BUT extremely annoying - sometimes the elevator stopped at every floor.  The logic for Elevator Request is currently not talking to each other, so when someone pushes a DOWN button (all on one floor) and takes the first one that stops, all elevators that happen to be by, will stop where there is no one (since they've already left).  Annoying at best when you're coming down from the 29th floor. Once that's fixed - fabulous location; excellent front desk; friendly and efficient valet; Peete's coffee excellent - house keeping very efficient and friendly; Concierge extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The beds were excellent";3
My first experience when I turned up was the man on reception trying to tell me that the room I had booked wasn't available so they'd pay for a taxi to take me to another hostel in a different part of London. It was only after explaining that I'd picked this one because it was near a convention (had to a spot on a map several times) and asking more than once if he could confirm that my room wasn't available did he give in and say that it was and give me my key (I had to ask a few times for the second one). Nobody explained the facilities to me just a general handwave and 'kitchen there' but I've heard others say there were kitchens on each floor? Never so much as  hinted at.  My room had its own bathroom. The bedroom itself was clean but bare. Which is fine, it's a hostel. The;3
I picked this hotel purely for location and for that it didn't disappoint. Essentially walking distance to most places and in between 1,2,3 and A,C,E lines on the subway.   I trawled booking.com until the rate dropped by 50% and then booked about 2-3 weeks before arrival.   The room was tiny and pretty crap but as we were on a high floor the view was great.   We only ate in the Tick Tock diner on the last morning for what was essentially brunch but the food was great and reasonable.   Once is enough for me. Won't be back.;3
"Went to NYC with my daughter in early March 2008.  Was a little worried about some of the reviews (e.g. rat in the garbage).  Personally, I don't believe that review was true.  The Woogo was fine.  Not spic and span but it passed my daughter's standards and she has a very low tolerance for anything she defines as ""grub"".  The ""apartment"" was bigger than hotel rooms I've booked in NY and had a really large closet.  It was nice to have the kitchen factilities.  Next time, I will request a room at the back of the building because the street noise is something I'm not used to coming from the 'burbs, but it wasn't that bad.  Walls were a bit thin, but that wasn't really a problem, although a bit embarrassing as we were packing to leave because the couple next door were having quite a";3
Art Deco style hotel in a great location right by penn station. I have no doubt that, in its day, this hotel was magnificent, sadly that day has passed and it is looking a bit tatty and unloved. On the plus side, the fitness centre is large and well equipped and staff seem friendly and helpful. My room was small but comfortable, fairly standard for manhattan. Unfortunately the bathroom was just filthy. Hairs around toilet and sink and a strong smell of urine, disgusting.  In summary, a shabby establishment trading on its location.;3
We payed a reasonable amount for a week's stay.But no amount could make up for the continuing banging through the night.As we went in February which is cold the heating was on which makes a noise like someone in the toliet hitting the pipes with a hammer.After four nights of none sleep we had to ask for a change of room,which they did with no complaints.After this our holiday began.There is clean towels every day the rooms are reasonably clean.BEDS ARE CLEAN.The subway is near,the staff are helpful,coffee and tea downstairs is free,you can ask for a heater if you are cold,there is plenty hot running water.I myself have read some of the other reviews and notice people saying there is no near shops but if some people are willing to explore two blocks behind the hotel has loads of;3
We stayed here for six nights with 2 adults and my ten year old. I will start by saying I give a 5 for the bellman and front desk staff. They are fantastic! With that said, on night one, everything felt dirty. We asked 3 times for the hair and corners of drawers to be wiped, there was dust in all corners and on all lamps. Nothing got cleaned our entire stay except fresh towels were added. They have a newly renovated bathroom but the room as a whole felt unclean. On top of that, we ended up having stained sheets on both our beds! Yikes.  They were nice enough to bring us new ones but some were frayed and just badly kept. I would rate the room a 2 but overall because of the nice bathroom and friendly front desk staff, I gave them a 3. I would recommend to pay more attention to the;3
Room first night did not have working AC. We were from east coast so had to get engineer up to get AC working for the night since no room to move us to.  Then toilet ran. Plumber had to come after AC was fixed to replace parts. After complaining about $350 room charge for room that was poor, was given complementary breakfast the next day.  Received upgraded new room but that was not the response I wanted.  Third day there my brother and his wife and 13 others were stuck in an elevator for almost an hour.  Hotel response was to call the elevator company.  Sister in law's response was to call the fire department which is how the group finally got out of the elevator.  Hotel is pretty, staff is nice just have management issues;3
I booked a queen room with a view. When I arrived I was given a room that can only be described as tatty. No view, a mattress that had me sink down to the box spring, and a gaping hole in the windows that let in freezing outside air. I went downstairs and received the room I think I paid for- a decent, but not amazing view, and a bed and room in better condition.   The hallways smell really bad.  Overall, the hotel has a feeling of being run down and catering to mass tourism.   I chose this hotel because of its Art Deco heritage but frankly, you can see lol there is to see from the outside. The interior does not offer much else.   Also, the rates they advertise are not the rates you pay. They add a $30 'facility fee' which is mandatory and really just a way to lure you in with a;3
My booking was for a double room, with a double bed.  At check-in I was being offered single bed, then 2 single beds, finally I got the double bed I had booked.   The corridors to the rooms are narrow, enough room for 1 person to walk, not enough room to pass people properly. Not good when they are painting the walls!!!  the doors in the corridor are a pain.   The room was basic, kind of clean. Bed is on the way out. The bathroom was good, rainfall shower.   Room wasn't cleaned properly, dust balls and dirt on the floor, dirty walls too.;3
"The New Yorker is 2 blocks away from Penn Station, which is extremely convenient if arriving/leaving NYC by Amtrak or other train.  However, the hotel is quite old.  The rooms and bathrooms are small and the furniture/carpet, etc, are a bit worn.  If you can upgrade to a suite, it is much better as many of the standard rooms are quite small.  The hotel is huge (40 floors) and so has a lot of traffic; but they are well set up with it with the lobby staff.  The workout room would be small, if this were a business hotel, but when we were there it was fine.  It had 3 ellipticals, one stepper. several bikes and treadmills, plus a full suite of weight machines.  There is a nice small coffee bar in the lobby for morning coffee and snacks.  The Trattoria restaurant is good, and the Tic";3
Great lobby bar, free wifi, good place to relax. Rooftop bar is ok, needs more shaded areas as it's so hot in the afternoon. Pool is tiny and they need more sun loungers.  Eds restaurant is excellent. The rooms are comfortable, comfy beds and fully equipped. Bathroom is a tiny box room but powerful shower and spacious. The internal rooms are noisy from the aircon/generators, external rooms are noisy (3rd floor) from the road inspite of double glazing. The lifts need servicing! Only two out of four were working. One got stuck with 14 people in for 1 hour and had to be rescued by the fire brigade! Was overloaded, but that was due to people having to wait too long for a lift. Staff are friendly but front desk seemed confused by the system which meant the service wasnt very;3
Checked in at 11:00pm.  Using the elevator was a scary experience, hallways were cramped, room had the faint odor of urine, and I dare not touch the ground in the room or bathroom with my bare feet.  In fact, I dare not touch anything in the room with any part of my body with the exception of the bedsheets.  Free WiFi ONLY in the hotel lobby.  Yet all these things are forgivable because this place had the best rate per night in Manhattan.  The bed was clean, king sized, and they had lots of fluffy pillows.  Sleep was excellent, shower was clean, was out the next day by 9:00am.  Call ahead of time for information on parking.;3
Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 5 nights in December/January, the purpose of the trip was to celebrate my 30th Birthday on New Years Eve.   We found the lady receptionist who checked us in to not be very friendly, barely spoke two words to us and did nothing in the way to welcome us to the hotel.  Our room was on the tenth floor and was so warm!  We had to leave the window open all day, and the air-con had to stay on at night which was a bit noisy.  The room was ok, the bathroom was small but manageable and fresh towels were provided each day.  There is a wide selection provided in the mini bar and food on the dressing table, all of which cost a fortune so we didn't touch it.  We had a few drinks in the lobby bar one night and found the prices to be similar to many other;3
I travel a lot. So I expect to always have the basics working like drains that don't back up, lights, hairdryer, coffee, sugar, bath gel, just the basics. She ncevthe hyatt rebranded to world if Hyatt last year, overall quality at the regencies and grand hotels has declined. Hyatt house and place are now better quality for the price. As a frequent business traveler, it's ok, just don't spend too many nights in a row because then these little things become aggravating like having to call the front desk for soap after a long day out at meetings.;3
I didn't hate the place. Staff was nice. Location is great.  The beds are AWFUL though.   And the lack of shower door is just weird. We had puddles on the floors constantly. Rusty chrome on stuff in the bathroom. Some peeling wallpaper.;3
"Maybe we caught the hotel on a bad week? Stayed 3 nights for business. No heat 1st two nights. Bathroom sink was sloooooow to drain.  Bug sightings in room & lobby. Other co-travelers did not have hot water for 2 days.  Fitness center consists of 3 aging treadmills; one broken, one malfunctioning & the other more suited for walking, not running.  Pros: Staff interactions were pleasant and very helpful, great location, contemporary decor, decent bar.  All said, if they can work out the obvious and correctable shortcomings, it would be a decent and recommendable NYC hotel.";3
Location wise this is a superb hotel, close to Macy's and only 7 streets along to 42nd Street/Broadway.  My room was on the 27th floor, the room was cold and draftie, I could putting the heating on but it was so noisy that it kept me up one night.  The room was basic but clean.  I spent a lot of my time out and about so if you're looking for a lush pad this is not it.  The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful.  I'd go back there because of the location but nothing else. Remember to watch out for the facility fee at the end of your stay, it was $25 + Tax so worked out around an extra $110 for a 4 night stay.;3
We was here for two day. The hotel is nice but it is to expensive when you think about what you get for the money. The only thing you get is location.   It was also disapointet that the pool on the toopfloor was closed. We dident get any information about this.;3
It's a Hilton.  It's nice.  But it's outrageous not to provide at least basic free wifi in the rooms.  We paid 2500 dollars for 2 rooms, 4 nights.  I think that entities us to free wifi.                        Great views over Universal Studios.;3
I think it has been taken over by hyatt recently hence the rooms have been redone etc. everything looks new. The service was very good and the location is excellent and right next to LAX. However it is just another average Hyatt.;3
Many rooms don't have a bathtub but rather only a shower stall. Perhaps fine for a lot of younger travelers but I want to soak in a tub before a long flight early in the morning. Another unfortunate event was that I have stayed here multiple times but the property doesn't keep notes on my preferences. The online check in was ineffective. None of my requests were noted nor responded to.;3
If you want to be very close to all things central then this is a good place to stay. Great location, very close to Times Square, The Empire State Building and the shops. Also very close to the Subway to get around further a field. This is however the only plus! You need to be out most the time as the hotel is very dated and the rooms need a big face lift! Wall paper coming away from the walls and the bathroom is just big enough to swing a cat! No drink facilities in the room which even the basic hotels have in these days.  Overall its an average hotel with a great location.;3
Firstly the positives. Beds comfy and pillowâs comfy. Good location for sights. Thatâs about it.   Room is tiny. Really not big enough for a family of 4. I slept in bed closest to the window and there was a cold draft. Noisy ( I know that I should expect noise from the streets as in central Manhattan) shouldnât really be subjected to hearing next door flush their toilet or turn their taps on and off.    For a family the room is just not big enough so if there are more than two people in your party donât consider this.  Homeless people loitering outside   With some investment it could be really lovely but itâs shabby and dated. My daughter said she felt like she was in the Hollywood Tower of Terror.;3
We have stayed at the Empire on several occassions and thought it would be the perfect hotel to stay in for our Wedding in Central Parc Oct 28th 2012,we had a party of 35 people and we highly recommended this hotel,on arrival none of our rooms were ready,some of our friends were still hanging around in the reception two hours later and still had'nt checked in,when we eventually went to our room the carpet floor was soaking from the air conditioning,our room was far from a bridal suite it was actually the smallest of all the rooms we had booked,several of our quests had to complain about their rooms as some doors werent secure,the list is actually endless and i was very dissapointed as this hotel is not cheap,i will definately consider staying elsewhere this year as i visit every;3
Ask for a room n the back side of the hotel -- mine was 6 floors up but the traffic noise was very audible all night (remember New York never sleeps.)  Lobby bar is great for a cocktail or two. Roof bar is fine, but rents out sections (or the whole thing) for private events, so don't set your heart on a drink with a view. $18-20 for a cocktail in a plastic glass is what you're missing.;3
Rooms are outdated and small, but what to expect from the old building.  Location was perfect for us since Penn train station is just one block away. Not too far from Times Square, and Broadway theaters.;3
"The Wyndham New Yorker is in a great location (essentially diagonally across from Penn Station, and the price (especially with the senior discount) was superb.  The rooms are a bit dated and basic, lacking in sufficient outlets at the desk to charge a computer and a phone simultaneously, though there were other outlets if you looked around.  My bathroom sink didn't drain properly and wasn't really fixed when I brought it to their attention (engineering tried, but didn't succeed).  And there was no information about the hotel and city in the room (I ask twice and was eventually told by the front desk that ""we don't do that anymore"").  Front desk staff were very welcoming and friendly.  All in all a good value in a fantastic location.  It's a 3-star hotel, which is what I paid";3
Beds are very small. Upon arrival, the doormen were extremely friendly. However, reception staff were a little cold. Paid for hotel well in advance and were left with a bill of over $100 dollars on the morning of us leaving. For âservices and feesâ. Not satisfied with the behavior of certain staff.;3

We booked superior room and requested higher floor.We were given aFirst floor room which was certainly not superior in any way.the window facehotel with machinery outside making the loudest noise imaginable.On opening the door to the room my Wife backed in pulling her suitcase,she stepped backwards into a large bottom drawer that was stuck all the way out because the drawers were uneven.She obviously yelped in pain as it did hurt her calf.A huge bruise appeared on her leg but she only noticed it after we had left the Hotel to travel on to Las Vegas.Pity she didn't notice it before we left the Empire.We were given another room on a higher floor but we we weren't impressed with the service from front desk.We were told that the 1st floor room was all they had but they magically;3
This is an older hotel across from Lincoln Center at 63rd Street, Broadway, and Ninth Ave., near Central Park and Columbus Circle.  You would stay here mostly for that location at more or less reasonable rates (relatively speaking).      My experience was fine, but I can see that others might disagree, depending on what they expect and value.  My single queen room was tiny, tiny, tiny with an interior view.  I was traveling alone.  Two people would stumble over each other in that space.  I am sure the hotel has larger rooms, but I'm guessing they are still small.  If space is important to you, ask detailed questions about room size.   That said, the room was not overly expensive by New York standards, so it's a trade-off.  And the room and hotel had been renovated somewhat;3
Bed was uncomfortable and the shower steamed up the windows in the bedroom, staying that way through the next morning.  Needs better ventilation  (no exhaust fan and windows didn't open).  The location near Universal Studios was great though.;3
All that was good about the hotel is the location. Constant waiting for elevators, no personal attention (well I understand a huge hotel), really small room. I have been to many other hotels with the same room type, but I have never been to such a small one. Room cleanliness is sufficient, but for two people one vial of shampoo and soap? A restaurant adjacent to the place, did not give priority to hotel guests, also brought in from the street as a regular. Luggage storage at extra charge also for hotel guests, it has always been part of the hotel's service, but probably not here. I chose this hotel because it is part of the history of New York but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations;3
My wife and I stayed here on a four day trip to New York. The location was great, just a short stroll from Penn Station, which was ideal for the Subway. Also close to Madison Square Gardens. We were greeted by very friendly reception staff who presented us with a complimentary bottle of wine as it was our honeymoon (thanks Mahamood). Our room was a little small and tired however that is my only criticism. The staff were all friendly, the bed comfortable and shower excellent. This hotel is ideal for those wanting a good location and just a bed to sleep in whilst over in NEw York!;3
Immaculate bed linen and bathroom cleanliness but carpets and seating very badly stained. Very off putting and really unacceptable to offer room in that state . Front desk informed on check out. Only one night stayed.;3
This is quite the interesting hotel in a fantastic location near the Hudson in the West Village. As some have mentioned, this hotel is not for everyone, but can be a great value and an interesting experience for the adventurous traveler. It is by far the best value in Manhattan, especially considering it is clean and safe. Here are the details of my review:  Location: The location for the hotel is amazing. Right near the Hudson in the West Village the location is fantastic. The hotel sits in a residential neighborhood just south of the Whitney Museum and just west of Hudson and Bleecker streets. The area is quiet despite being near the West Side Highway.  Rating: 4 Stars  Appearance: The hotel was built in 1907 and is a pretty amazing looking building. Itâs in good shape and the;3
Pictures on line not what  you find when you get there very deceiving  Everything needs updating from the lobby to the elevators Rooms were old but  Rooms were clean service was okay Price was right,and location was okay but my family wen came by poor parking available  I would not stay there again;3
I had a nice stay here, the staff are very helpful and welcoming, the building is pretty and extremely well located.  However, this is NOT a four star hotel by any normal standards. The room was small even for New York, the bathroom was tiny and completely basic and there were few amenities over the bare essentials.  Recommended if you will scarcely be there but other 4 star options offer more.  Free wifi though!!;3
Me and my mum stayed at the New Yorker for 3 nights. There was numerous problems with this hotel from check in to check out. We had issues with check in, regarding a pre arranged upgrade. This was dealt with to some extent by one of the guest service managers. As many others say on here, the rooms are small and the hotel is 1930s so a lot is still the original fittings, however the room was in need of a refurbish  especially the windows which let in a draft, and the curtains or drapes had to be closed to prevent the cold draft from getting into the room, and the heating turned up very high! We kept getting electric shocks of nearly every piece of furniture, from the towel rail in the bathroom, to the metal trim on the table. This was a real nuisance as you had to carefully tap;3
"Truly this hotel is great when it comes to its location and access to Central Park, subways and mid-town attractions and this was the primary factor in choosing the Empire Hotel. It is an older hotel so rooms are small and elevators are slow but a lot can be forgiven for convenience. We had three rooms reserved for a Girls Weekend including a suite and two deluxe rooms. The suite was great - spacious and perfect for a gathering spot - just don't try to use the pull out as a bed! WORST bed ever! A positive for the whole hotel were the personnel - from Nick at the front desk to all the doormen and staff - everyone was happy and positive and helpful.   Some of the ""negatives"" of the hotel. In room coffee was $3.50 for a Kurig cup. Completely disingenuous given the amount the rooms";3
The lobby looks great. The staff is terrific. The restaurant serves a great breakfast. The elevators are fast. The bed was comfy.... Only thing that surprised me was how small the room was. Not much space. Closet small. No problem for a weekend stay. I think it might be cramped if you had a week there.;3
Pros: Convenient to Lincoln Center, restaurants and cafes. Room 340 was close to the elevator, decorated in earth tones, Cons: the bathroom light switch is outside the bathroom behind the door when open. No hot water at 10 pm and only a little at 7 am. The shades seem opaque but at night the light shining in the room may make them see thru. Easy to get to the bathroom- just roll out of bed and you were nearly in the bathroom.;3
No wifi. Unless you pay. Disinterested front desk staff. One elevator broken all weekend. The baby bar in the lobby was never staffed when I was there. Location was convenient and bell staff was helpful.  Nothing terrible but certainly nothing great.;3
"I stayed for 2 days here..when we arrived at LA union station by train from San Diego, we called the concierge to send us a taxi to our location but instead, he advised us to take the metro to the hotel and then walk to the hotel..so we dragged our luggage to the metro station, purchased the ticket and went inside one of the worst places on earth ""the metro"" as you will have beggers asking you for money or strangers staring at us as foreigners, bad smell everywhere, zero security or police around although the place needs 24/7 security due to the number of beggers and drunks there..  Also, we booked for a room with a breakfast but suprise suprise, when you go to the breakfast serving resturant, you find that what you booked is continental breakfast not the buffet?? and the";3
My wife and I stayed for two nights in mid-January at the Empire Hotel. The check-in process took a while (as echoed by other reviews) and the staff was not particularly friendly, but not rude either. The room was small, but what I expected in NY. The bathroom, however, was impractical, especially the shower, with only half the enclosure. The heater was very noisy at night, prompting us to turn it off (in 19 degree weather) so we could get some sleep. Tried to call the concierge one evening probably a dozen times, and no one ever answered. On the plus side, awesome location and very comfortable beds.;3
We stayed here again in july and before we went we got an email saying they are changing to wydnham, we didn't like the hotel this time, it was different, grotty and not as nice smelling as usual :(..;3
Arrived with very friendly reception staff, went to room 2715 which was so small, no view, brown and dark decor dusty and mould in the bath. So disappointed! We got moved to 2818 which was better. Shame the furniture is brown and dated, really needs to be modernised. Still no view but apparently a metro queen view room is what I have (a wall). Bed comfy. The lifts are always slow, I don't think they all work at one time. One guy said he was waiting 20 min for the lift thd other day, when it did arrive we went from floor 28 to 1 to 30 then every floor down! It was so hot and busy. The hotel is very dated, the hall ways are old fashioned, very noisy outside which you can hear all night. Very surprised you don't even get tea or coffee facilities in the room. I personally won't stay;3
Ok, The Jane Hotel is for many aspects a little gem. Gorgeous lobby bar with young skinny upper class girls and boys who have fun until 4 am, well dressed and very good looking. But they are accompanied by drivers in rolls royce and even don't look at you, too rich for the hotel customers, they make you understand they have nothing to share with you, The rooms are provided with some comfortable facilities such as safe, hooks, tv. . I was at the fifth floor, no noise nor from the large street beneath river Hudson nor from the bar at the ground floor. Rooms are tidy with the bed done every day and towels changed every day. Toilets and showers always clean and not busy. Staff was enormously nice and helpful. The must are location in Meatpacking, the coolest quarter of NYC, full as;3
"Large impersonal hotel. Only booked because of the location near a flat and I thought that it had been modernised. I am sure they did loads but rooms are really quite small as is the bathroom. The decor is Art Deco, some nice items. Service requests are dealt with very quickly. Areas in the bathroom show age and neglect and corner dirt. Good shower and very good mattresses. Staff I guess under pressure from the volume of trade. Can be on the sharp side. I guess they get lots of requests. The one real grip is the hotel extra tax on arrival. Supposedly for wifi, pool and unlimited calls. It should be in the price as its ""compulsory "".  They fool you with a lower advertised headline price. Not good business but then difficult to argue when  the hotel was full. I won't return and";3
"Dark foyer with loud music. We immediately felt 'too old' for the clientele. The decor is entirely brown, incuding the corridors and the rooms so you feel as if you're in a 70s  B film. However, the bed was comfortable and the room offered everything we needed. You can't get a better position for outtings to the Kennedy Center; the hotel is on the doorstep. There is a nightclub downstairs with lineups down the street in the evening; a little off-putting for non-clubbers like ourselves.I try hard to find somewhere else when we go up to New York.";3
The best thing about this hotel is the location. On the border of Chinatown and 2 min walk from the subway, it is perfect for one to get to any aprt of New York in Minutes. If you like chinese or Italian food then lots and lots of restaurants within 10 minutes walk. The room was ok. no fridge or tea making facilities so you have to go out to find a coffee shop or bakery  if you want one. if you want to use the hotel as a base for your excursions in New York  and a place to sleep and wash then this hotel will do just fine. Anymore then look elsewhere as this is a basic hotel.;3
The room was small.  Put out the do not disturb sign and hung up our towels.  When we got back sheets and towels were changed.  Why bother to post signs about being eco friendly when your staff doesnât bother to pay attention?;3
In terms of positives, the hotel is in a great location right in the heart of Columbus Circle, very close to Central Park. The lobby area is nice with many places to sit. The drinks at the bar were good and the service there was accommodating. The hotel is very clean and staff were pleasant.   The downsides are the rooms are very small (I realize this is NYC, but I've had much larger hotel rooms in the city). The elevators took forever. The rooftop bar seems to be a draw for locals, but it was a total scene. Definitely do not wait in line if you are a hotel guest. Just ask the bouncer to let you up. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you need to be in that neighborhood, but if you are not locked in to upper west side, I would suggest checking out your options.;3
We have been going to the New Yorker regularly over the past 15 years at the same time of year--Westminster Dog Show/Valentine's Day. We booked through a shady site--otel.com--and were a little worried something would go wrong with the reservation after reading their reviews. [I believe] since i called the hotel directly a week in advance of the reservation to confirm, all went well. Mohammed, who checked us in, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got the room type we reserved and it was nice. However, this time, there was NO refrigerator or coffee maker. Very inconvenient but available at a surcharge of, from what I'm told, was around $40/stay. There were major problems with the entrance doors, being worked on. HUGE wind tunnel going in and out. Don't bother doing your hair;3
The Empire was perfectly adequate but by no means the best hotel we've stayed at in New York. Both the On the Avenue and the Alex were better. although the Empire's location near Columbus Circle and Central Park gave it the edge in that regard. We had persistent problems with the room key cards - trivial perhaps but a PITA when trekking up and down several floors every day laden with shopping and bags after finding you can't get into your room. The hotels' decor wasn't too our taste. It could easily have been based on Bet Lynch's bedroom. The decor was so dark - a mix of browns, and the room lights so dim that it quickly became annoying. Drinks at the bar were very expensive - but then most hotels are of course. On the plus side there is a Starbucks right next door that opens as;3
An old hotel, with pleasant helpful staff, but in room facilities need better maintenance.  Bellboy/ doormen did not get taxis but left me to find them for myself even when asked. The heating system in rooms is very noisy and there is no working facility to keep heat at reasonable level, that is not too hot.;3
This is a hard one for me.  We stayed 2 nights here last week.  The room was fine and clean so it worked for us but I'm a bit concerned about the electric system.  Our TV wouldn't work so someone came up to try to fix which ended up just re-plugging into another outlet as the one it was plugged into was dead.  This was concerning because there was an extension cord with several things plugged into it, including a space heater which we never used.  The floor had a weird slope to it and the rug had some bare patches.  The management was extremely nice but the electric issue would keep me from returning.;3
We just returned from a one night stay at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City. This was our second stay at this property.  I had my trepidations since out last stay was not so great.  This time it wasnât as bad.  Check in was the same as our last stay â SLOW.  I am Hilton Diamond level and the wait in the Honors Check-in was just too dang slow.  There was only one attendant at the Honors check-in desk and the regular check-in desk had three hosts.  There were two groups ahead of us in line, they finally added a second host at the Honors desk but now the Honors line was 20 people deep.   We had Room 2357 a corner King Suite.  The room is exactly like it was last time and a tad dated.  I honestly feel the entire property is dated.  Nothing special just a larger room with a view;3
The room was cold and a little dilapidated (veneer coming off desk) but adequate. Good safe for leaving valuables. No wardrobe, just a bar for hanging suits etc. and 2 drawers for everything else. Only just big enough for everything I had brought for 8 days. Internet generally reliable. The selection at breakfast was limited, but the quality was excellent.;3
As hotel rooms are generally very expensive in NY this seems to be a good alternative. It is cheap but do not expect a categorized hotel.  Pros: - very good location, just 3 min walk to Metro station line 1, 110th street from there in 12min at times square - clean bath - bed was made every day - no cockroaches, no bedbugs  Cons: - towel was within one week never changed (but I also did not asked);3
The lobby and hallways are in desperate need of a facelift, and finding your room through the winding maze of corridors can be a bit challenging, but the room was decent and had cable TV, a mini fridge and a sink. An added bonus was that because this hotel is located on the end of a street, it was pretty quiet for New York. Not a lot of street traffic going by at 4 in the morning. The shared bathroom was ok, but I'd bring shower shoes next time.;3
My daughter and I have just returned from a short, sight seeing break to New York, this hotel met all our needs, we had a twin room on the 5th floor, yes hotel could do with some TLC, room comfortable, had tea/coffee maker (paper cups but this was fine) bath filled quickly with hot water (didn't use the shower) old style radiator heated room quickly once turned on, but hissed a bit so didn't leave it on overnight. Great base only 2/5 mins away from Subway, quick route to NY centre, great value and staff pleasant enough.;3
I spent 3 nights in Morningside Inn, and I'd recommend this place for those who would like to explore Manhattan and are looking for a simple but clean&tidy place that provides the basic needs for a traveller.   It was easy to arrive in the hotel from La Guardia Airport. As I'd never been in Manhattan before this trip, I just followed some Google Maps instructions, and could reach the hotel because it is located between 110th St( Cathedral. Pkwy) and 103th St. Metro Stations.   The only thing I didn't like was the shared restroom. As I had my reservation done via Agoda.com, I had no idea about this, however, this was not a big deal.   Wifi is free, but needs to improve, sometimes it was really difficult to connect.   In a few words, a good, affordable, well located place to spend;3
Celebrated birthday with friends and family.  Thought the rooms were small.  Had to call to get ice brought to the room.  Elevators got stuck.  Prices were high for drinks and food.  Could have been cleaner,;3
Check in was very quick and easy when we arrived and we had Queen rooms booked which were small but enough room for 2 people. The room had a massive flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, iron and ironing board and the alarm clock had USB charging points in it which I used to charge my smart watch and phone each night. The small clothes hanging area is in beside the safe and fridge and was ok for shirts etc but no good for long maxi dresses which had to hang over the edge as they were too long for the space - no great inconvenience.     The bed was comfortable and everything worked as it should but the noise from the AC system was deafening at times. My husband had to wear ear plugs but I was so tired from the walking I managed just fine.  The bathroom was very small but the shower;3
Small room cleaned, but dirty towels in the closet & food in fridge from others, tv  not working, towels were so old, there were teared on the sides   bathroom on the level should at least provide paper      towels;3
The property was very nice. However, the charges for incidentals were higher than average and the charge for the bottled water that comes in the room just seems like a bit much. Other than that, everything else was fine;3
Very convenient to Metropolitan opera and generally got fine hotel. Would stay again, but appreciate more friendly, caring staff. What happened to the apples that were at the front desk before? Would appreciate more consideration on early checkin.;3
I booked this hotel with less the 24 hours notice for a quick getaway. They do not offer the breakfast option like other Hyatt's they have a restaurant on the inside that provides breakfast and lunch. If you have a rental car it is $55 dollars a day. They have their windows locked and no balconies for extra circulation. The city view rooms literally face the airport. There is no pool at this location.;3
Great location, reasonably priced. Customer service basically doesn't exist. They don't even have a telephone in the room so there is no way to communicate with the front desk. . . if they had one. The room was clean and modern, but very small, and no, that's right, NO! place to unpack our clothes except for a small closet with a few hangers. No dresser or drawers anywhere.;3
The staff here were very helpful provider numerous directions and advice about Los Angeles, and were happy to print our tickets and documents from emails. Buffet breakfast was included however you only receive one serving of eggs maximum.  The rooms were average but decent for the cost however it was quite far away from everything  but close to the metro.  If you're happy to stay a bit further out then this is good;3
The rooms are small, itâs functional, ok for touring NY, but not somewhere youâd want to stay beyond sleeping and not to  relax or chill. Given where it is the $ is fair. The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful which is a real saving grace. Itâs a bit worn out and knackered, but it suffices. Certainly clean enough. Depends how fussy you are?;3
We enjoyed our stay here. Hotel is clean, affordable and close to a subway terminal. Neighborhood was not the best and is the only reason why we gave three stars vice four. Included breakfast is very good and a great way to save a little on a trip. Would probably stay here again dependent on pricing.;3
A reasonable budget hotel, we arrived about 11am and unfortunately couldn't get in our room till 3pm. They were happy to store our luggage so we went to acquaint ourselves with the area. The subway is on 103 st and 110st which we used most mornings but unfortunately our metro cards kept getting eaten up. We always had a taxi back at night â¬13 approx. The hotel staff were very friendly but unfortunately could not sort out the problem of our room overheating due to a steam pipe in our bathroom hissing and banging all night. Even in Nov. we had to have the window open a/c didn't appear to work. Apart from this our room was ok for our 4 day stay with great views of Central Park. Disappointing that there was no coffee available except from a takeaway at the end of the block. However;3
"First impressions set the tone when I checked in early in the day (not expecting my room yet) and the registration clerk tried to up-sell me early access to ""a great room"" for $50 cash only. I declined and checked my bags as I had a day of work meetings and didn't need the room until later.   Little did I know that I'd be downgraded for having declined.  When I finally returned to claim my room key, I was surprised to find I'd been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home.  It had a lovely view, high on the 35th floor which I appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold, very cold, even though the thermostat was set at 72.  I could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the un-insulated, painted over bathroom windows. The bed";3
Reserved for one night in order to catch an early flight the next morning.  Upon check-in the room reserved was not ready but three alternative rooms which were ready were offered and we accepted one of those.  The room had a view of LAX and the soundproofing was excellent.  The only available drinking cups were the paper ones provided for the in-room coffee maker.  At 3:00AM the next morning there was little hot water in the sink although the supply in the bathtub was better but slow in arriving (8th floor room).  Ate in the hotel restaurant which offered a limited sit-down menu. Service was prompt and the food tasty.  Easy to catch the provided airport shuttle early in the Am as it runs every 10- 15 minutes 24 hours per day  Overall hotel is adequate except for the exceptions;3
closet is a cupboard with no room for long items. Towels are in the shower on a high shelf my husband had to reach for me and no place to hang them outside the shower. Key cards didn't work well. Don't touch the minibar or food items........must be made of gold! And $7.50 for a bottle of water??!!;3
After arriving very late in the evening, our experience turnt sour rather quickly with the staff member that greeted. They were extremely rude and unhelpful. We were also given a room which did not match any room advertised on the hotel website.   The next morning, we raised our grievances with Gisel who I have to say, if it wasn't for her I would probably never go back to this hotel. She empathised and apologised for our experience so far and relocated us to another room.   Throughout our stay Gisel and her other colleagues were the most helpful and in fact I could not ask for a better service so thank you very much, they definitely went above and beyond!  Breakfast is also available. The chefs were brilliant -  Nothing was too much and they were very friendly. Be sure to have;3
"My family and I stayed here on a weekend visit to Universal Studios. The hotel staff was very nice. The location was convenient. The room was okay. Nothing fancy, very basic and clean. I don't recommend eating there for breakfast or getting room service, both are over priced and there weren't very many options especially in the ""full"" breakfast buffet.  I recommend eating at City Walk. There are tons of different types restaurants (Bubba Gumps, Rainforest Cafe, Tony Roma, and more). Overall it was a nice stay and we liked the location.";3
I always stay in this hotel when i am in LA, but this time, it was my worst stay. Unfriendly staff, a little rude at checkin.  I did not really feel welcomed this time......just a tourist...(and in fact i was one, but good hotels should make you feel home...). Rooms large, very comfortable beds. Just beware of the rooms facing south, noise from street was very loud. Excellent buffet on fridays and saturdays evenings.  For the rets, Hilton as usual.....;3
The hotel itself is gorgeous, the 1920âs decor is beautiful, the staff are all friendly and helpful, and some of the floors appear to be updated.... but not ours.  The 20th floor looks tired, the carpets worn, the paintwork chipped and grubby.  Our room was clean, had a comfortable bed, tv, alarm clock that you can plug your phones into. Which was just as well as I was too scared to use the sockets in the wall- all loose and felt a bit dangerous to use. The plumbing is definitely 1920âs, the shower was poor and the bathroom dated.  There was no coffee/tea making facilities, it was only on checkout I learned I could have had them for an extra charge. However, plenty of places nearby to get a coffee, including the excellent though expensive tick tick diner.  My sons were given a;3
Located in a great sport in midtown NY. The hotel is very close to major attractions and transport facilities.  It is walking distance to Emire state building and Times Square.  However, the rooms are very basic and no coffee and tea facilities (unless you ask room service, then they give you a coffee machine). Very busy hotel at all times of the day. The security staff were very alert even at 2.00 am in the morning.;3
I wanted somewhere clean and comfy for a short sightseeing break, and that's exactly what I got.  The staff on the desk were polite, the bed was fine, no issues with the Wi-Fi, it was incredibly quiet, and ideal for getting to the subway, but also not that far from Central Park. I liked being away from the hustle of downtown, and since it's slightly off the beaten track that made it all the more interesting. There is a good jazz bar close by and some decent restaurants too. I could also leave my suitcase in their storage area before I got my flight home, very convenient.   Only drawback is the shared bathrooms, yes they are in need of updating, but they are all clean, serviceable. A/C could have been a little bit better too as it got a bit warm at night, but you can live with;3
I had a few days of business very close to times square and ended up booking The New Yorker simply as it was cheaper than other options. On paper this hotel is really cool - it's a landmark building with significant history, it has impressive architecture, and its super central location is perfect for tourists visiting NYC for the first time.  However, for me as someone who's already sick and tired of New York coming on business and wanting to get out as soon as possible, this wasn't ideal, though I'm not sure any other hotels in this area would be.  The good: cool historical landmark building. Pleasant staff that stays patient despite pretty tough working conditions. Rooms are clean and reasonably well kept, and of acceptable size (for New York). Wifi was OK. Location ideal for;3
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 10/13-10/15, and we found both good and bad things about the hotel.  The hotel apparently is an old pre-war apartment house that was converted into a hotel.  First, the good: 1) the hotel is well-located.  It's on the upper west side and right near a subway station that goes downtown to the theatre district, etc.;  2) for Manhattan, the prices are relatively reasonable; and 3) our room was fairly large  (again by Manhattan standards) and clean and the bed was comfortable.  Now for the bad: 1) it was hard to get hot water.  The staff stated that this was because the pipes were old; and 2) for some reason there was no chest of drawers or anything in which we could store non-hanging clothes.  Well, that's it.";3
"Firstly, the hotel is really quite good, it provides something in which you get what you pay for. The entrance is really quite grand and exotic and i was hoping the rest of the hotel would follow suit. However, I was shortly let down as the lifts were just so slow and very unreliable when using them. The croaky set of stairs soon provided a slow and painful walk up. The rooms were not too bad, reasonably cramped but with good facilities. A reliable alarm and air conditioning provided not the worst ever night sleep. The beds weren't too bad. The next point is the location, although the hotel itself does not serve breakfast, there are planty of other bakeries and take-aways nearby. It also within walking distance of the ""T"" (American Subway) and the main street of Broadway.";3
"We arrived after a really long day out to finalise check-in, and they wouldn't accept my credit card because it still has my maiden name on it. I was left in tears waiting in the Lobby for 4.5 hrs until we could transfer funds from another account in an overseas account. The porter Rod was lovely and gave us some bottled water, and apologised for the delay.  We understand why we weren't allowed to check-in, however every other hotel we have stayed at (6) in the last fortnight had no problem accepting my card, as it matches the reservation. This seems to be a rule kept stricly by this Hilton, from their manager - who has them following this rule to the letter. We were made to feel like criminals, as ""you are only blue members and there is a lot of fraud with online check-ins. If";3
An ok hotel, it was disappointing there was no room service. Although the location was good - not too far from the main attractions. I wouldn't recommend the metro but found Uber a great way to travel.;3
My spouse and I recently stayed at the Empire hotel overnight during a snowstorm.  The location, near Lincoln Center was great, but check-in and out were poorly managed.  We were told our room would be ready in 10 minutes, so we went for something to eat.  We returned only to be told that it would be another hour.  Caesar was the desk clerk.  We were told we could use the hotels free Wi-Fi, but every time we tried it connected then disconnected quickly or we could not use it at all.  The hotel is pricey and they offer NOTHING in the room for free.  Even the Kerig k-cups offered free in other hotels had a fee attached.  Three dollars for a single k-cup?  Starbucks around the corner is better.;3
The restaurant is 24 hours and that is terrific. However it isn't very good. And the wait staff aren't great either. However it does mean you can get dinner if you get in very late and tired without having to go walking around the city. The concierge is fabulous. He was so helpful and kind when I needed a taxi at 4 am. It's a classic hotel and that's nice but I thought the halls were grubby and the room was very small. However the location for me was unbeatable and I have booked to stay there again. The convenience of the 24 hour restaurant and the location trumps the room size and food quality for my purposes.;3
In comparatio with New York Hotels and Hostel This is quite cheap and not bad, is close to the metro station which let you be in the city center in 15 minutes,  The are is relax and quiet, with some bars and restaurant aroun. Is a good option if you donÂ´t wanna spend a lot of money for accomodation and you want a decent place;3
The Positives: Excellent location  - 2 mins from tube station, clean & tidy room, nice Courtyard to sit out in. Value for money, as in cheap & (kind of) cheerful...!  The NEGETATIVES: The room was NOT as pictured, there was no small table & chairs to sit at. The room was tiny, just enough room for the beds, fridge & cupboard! Our room (no.7) was literally next door to Reception, and was a  nightmare! The luggage room was opposite so was a constant stream of people coming/going all night! Therefore, almost NO sleep for 2 nights. We heard every conversation, in fact at times felt like we were in the same room!!! So, if offered either No. 7 or 8 room keys - just say NO!!! Maybe higher floors would be better?;3
Overall, the Wyndam New Yorker was OK.  The staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating and the location was great for us on this particular trip.  Our room was clean, but I have to say that I travel a lot for work and family and, suffice it to say that, I have never, ever, stayed in a smaller room in any hotel. The room was small, but clean and the bathroom was old and small.  The shower on all 3 days for both of us ran in a continuous flow from scalding to comfortable to ice. We had no view.  It was fine for a quick 2-night stay.;3
I want to like this hotel.  It's beautiful inside, and so close to Penn Station.  But the service is not up to par.  A very nice gentleman checked me in, then called me to make sure my room was OK.  I said it was.  In the morning, I found that all of the bath towels were hanging on the door's hook.  I naÃ¯vely thought they must be clean, and served there by the maid.  When I put one in my face, it was immediately apparent that they were dirty.  I dried off with a face towel and hoped I wouldn't get sick.  (I did not.)  I also found a room key on a pedestal.  Though I reported it to two managers, it never disappeared from that pedestal in four days.    I went to the reception desk and spoke to a manager.  He printed a sheet and said an investigation would ensue, and that I'd;3
The hotel has 4 stars and I was disappointed with the room. A Superior double room with double beds sounds like a big room. The real room and bathroom are modern but very small. There was only one outlet in the bedroom that you could use. The outlet in the bathroom did not work. Wallpaper is coming off in the room and bathroom door need painting.;3
It's hard to get a Manhattan Hotel, but at $200 per night, I guess we were fortunate. Being close to the subway was convenient. We had a renovated room which, although small, was comfortable. No restaurant on the premises but they have a deal with the Europan Cafe (just across the road) for breakfast and the Manhattan Diner (just around the corner) had an extensive menu. Professional staff were helpful. I would try Brooklyn next time.;3
"Stayed here for a week in August. We are a young couple who went to go and see the sights. First thing is that the location is fantastic - about 5/10 minute walk to Times Square; 20 minutes to Central Park and about an hours walk to south Manhattan.   The hotel itself is very back dated. The lobby is lovely - big open space. The room is small but not tiny. The bathroom is possibly the worst part. Shower would spray upwards as well as downwards! The bin men at 4am every day wasnât ideal - Iâd take ear plugs!   All in all, a dated hotel in a good location.";3
Although I did find The Jane quite interesting and in the heart of everything, the ship-cabin-like rooms were a bit small for my liking.  It is great for an overnight with not too many suitcases and if you don't mind sharing a shower and a bathroom with other guests. We had a room with 2 bun-beds and that was it.  Ai-rconditioned, thank goodness and each bed had their own lighting and TV. If you coming to NYC to stay in the room, then pick a different hotel, but if you are here to get out and enjoy, then perfect.  The hotel is right in the heart of Chelsea's Meat Packing district.  Places to eat, activities, history surround this quaint hotel.  The hotel has a great rooftop bar and a really cool bar downstairs. They do have free bicycles to use, which is a huge plus. It does;3
While the hotel is very clean and nicely decorated, the room was only fine for a night or two.  The best part is it is across from Penn Station.  The front desk staff is not very friendly either in check in or check out.  The bathroom has no counter space, at least in the room that have not been renovated recently.  Again, clean but nothing special.;3
This  was a nice hotel but a bit dark and the decor was dated and a bit worn,  The staff were helpful and friendly but the elevators (lifts) seem to be either not working or broken altogether, the hotel was not far from Central park which made up for it, We went with my daughter but we were on different floors miles away from each other, Not a bad hotel but would consider trying somewhere else next time, just to try somewhere different and prehaps a bit more brighter,;3
Being a long standing Hyatt Regency Gold member I had been offered a late check out at 2PM. When the day of my departure eventually arrived, however, I received a phone call around 1.30PM asking me 'kindly' to vacant my room!   The first day I tried to reach out to the concierge desk, only to be asked to show up  later since the concierge would be on a lunch break right now. But, when I did so in the early afternoon I was informed the concierge had already left work at all. Really!? If you pretend to be a 4 star hotel you should certainly provide the assistance of a concierge, especially if your property is literally next door to a mayor International airport!  Having been referred to the bell desk as the 'substitute' concierge I raised the simple question where I could buy a;3
This is a decent hotel with a great location across the street from the Los Angeles International Airport, so you can literally walk to the hotel, which is nice. They also have a great shuttle service. The staff is very friendly, though we were at first put into a room that either had not been made up, or was currently occupied. They did take care of the issue and put us in a different room.;3
If you are not in NY just to look at the four walls of your hotel room and rather prefer to spend your money in shops and restaurants, this is a good alternative. The hotel is a simple, worn-down complex of connected old buildings, implying endless twisting corridors and an ecclectic collection of more or less permanent residents amongst backpackers, families and other tourists. But it is safe, it is reasonably clean, and it is well located on Upper West Side. The neighborhood is not posh, but still expensive, inhabited by peaceful new yorkers who meet with their laptops at Starbucks in the morning before heading to their offices.  The hotel is peacefully located down 71st street, just some houses away from Hudson River, surrounded by high-rise condos and old brownstone town;3
The room was clean. The image shows 2 bedside lamps. There were none. The Room amenities boasts tea and coffee making facilitioes. There were none. You can heat your drink if you have a cup- in the microwave. There is a kitchen on every floor. There was no drain plug for basin or bath. Shower worked well. TV was great- HD channels.Fridge was useful. Plenty of closet/drawer storage. Bed was comfortable. NO AC. Overall it was ok. The area was pleasant residential- lots of local shops. Subway is 7-10 mins walk .;3
This hotel is close to many attractions, is clean and reasonable. and furnished adequately.  There are accessible units and parking.   coffee is furnished and there are many restaurants nearby.  I would definitely stay there again.;3
My mum and I arrived late after our flight and were checked into one of the old rooms which I walked straight back out of and down to reception. They were very helpful and quick to give me a complimentary upgrade to one of the renovated rooms with 2 double beds - what a difference!  Hotel is basic but has everything you need, definitely recommend getting a renovated room though!   Location is great and round the corner from the subway so we got a 7 day metro card for our 4 day stay.   Big daddy's diner and manhattan diner nearby are both great too.;3
We stayed here for 10 days.  I was disappointed at the lack of facilities available for guests.  No coffee/tea facilities, (they wanted $25 per day for a drip filter ð ) no kettle,  no laundry service,  it blew out our food budget tremendously as we couldn't prepare anything in our room.  Disappointed as a Wyndham Guest who is used to superior standards across the Wyndham spectrum.  I will say the location is good and we had a good view of the Empire State Building.  Not somewhere I would stay again.  Run down.;3
My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of May 16. The hotel is in a great location in a fancy neighbourhood and the lobby looks quaint and interesting. However, the room that we booked (twin cabin) was the smallest room I have ever seen. It was about the same size as a train cabin with two bunks and barely any floor space.  There were a few hooks alongside the mirror on which to hang jackets etc., but nowhere to hang up our creased travelling clothes.  It was very clostrophobic and extremely difficult to get changed/ready in for two people, as our bags occupied the only floor space.  The bathrooms were clean but there are very few showers for the number of rooms per floor.   Yes it was cheap compared to other hotels in New York, but it was a very frustrating;3
Rooms can be small but when I had a couple of minor issues they moved me to a nicer room right away. 24-hour diner isnât fancy and I would skip the âcoffeeâ but sure is quick & convenient right on site or McDonalds is literally across the street. Good location by Madison Square Gardens & Penn Station and would stay there again :);3
The location of this hotel is great, but there are lots of hotels in New York that are situated well. The lobby is nice, and there is a 24 hour diner on site. The manager I dealt with, Meghan, was sympathetic and helpful. Unfortunately, thatâs all the good points.  There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room( tough if youâve been travelling for 10 hours) and although there is water, this is chargeable at $5 per bottle. The lifts upto floor 20 are frequent, anything above that, you best be prepared for a wait. If you want to leave your luggage, perhaps because you have a later flight, itâs charged at $5 dollars per bag, per hour, first time Iâve come across that in Manhattan, perhaps we have been lucky.  Late checkout is charged at $50 ( I think that gives you 3 hours on;3
Overall hotel staff was very friendly and lobby was nice. The rooms are somewhat small and need some TLC. They were nice, but need a little improvements. The hotel is in a great area, close to attractions, restaurants etc. Also has bar/nightclub on roof that is very nice.;3
Dated, Dirty, Dark, and Dead Roach. Shower totally open so water all over the bathroom. AC didnât work. No closet, couple of small drawers so had to work out of the luggage on the floor. Better choices would be Watson or the Hudson near by for comparable rates. Would not stay here again if l can avoid it. The only plus is itâs across the street from Lincoln Center and Fordham U.;3
"If you want to be very close to things in NYC, this is a very good choice of place to stay. What we liked:  location; friendliness of the staff; quietness inside the hotel (our hotel room faced the river); nice sheets and comfortable bed; great shower with nice hot water; free, non-glitchy internet; proximity to good restaurants and other stores (Macy's is a block away; CVS is on the corner); Penn Station is across the street (we took the train to NYC). There is a diner attached to the hotel that offers all kinds of good breakfasts. You are minutes from the high line. Many things to appreciate here! What could have been better:  room was a little tight but ok; paint was peeling in bathroom. That said, these were not big enough issues to really fret about. Enjoy yourself!";3
Stayed here for 6 nights in October and chose this hotel due to its proximity to the Javits centre and the NYCC that we were visiting. But possibly wouldnt stay here again if returning to NY for a holiday. The pros:  Its Ideal for Madison square gardens and Hammerstein theatre which is next door. Javits centre only a 10 minute walk away Subway station practically outside and great shopping like Macy's 5 mins walk away, aswell as the Empire state building.  All night pharmacy opposite. The Tick Tock diner connected to the hotel is one of the best diners in NYC and open all hours.  Theres a steak and cocktail bar in the basement and  another italian bar/restaurant  which is very popular and reasonable. We stayed in a Deluxe Queen room, which is basically a double. The room was;3
"While traveling alone on a budget for a quick weekend trip to NYC, this hotel did the trick.  The place has definitely seen its better years; during my stay the hotel was being renovated so the rooms were hit or miss.  The first room I was offered was dark and musty, in a back corner of the hotel with a window that looked into a dark alley.  The staff was very helpful when I turned down that room, and were able to give me a recently renovated room that overlooked Broadway.  They also honored my request for a late check-out.  The room was small but quiet and everything worked.  You can't beat the location - lots of shops around, close to Central Park, and just a couple blocks from the subway and the bus to LaGuardia Airport.   While I wouldn't take my family here, if traveling";3
Brilliant location, but after spending time here previously the customer service and room cleanliness has slipped. The room didnât have enough towels for 2 people and the room didnât get cleaned or checked on in the 3 days we were there. No fresh towels, coffee, toilet paper. We did ask reception if someone could just come in and replace towels but didnât happen.  However, canât fault the buffet breakfast all you can eat. Helps start the day the right way.;3
"Lobby is dark, restaurant (Ed's Chowder House) is bright, very good and hidden on the 2nd floor.  (20% off if you book after 8pm).   Rooftop bar open in season to the public. But if you look closely in the bathroom (and it's hard not too -- it's so tiny you need to step into the shower to close the door) the real clue is on the shelf on the wall:  little orange EAR PLUGS tucked in with Q-tips and cotton balls.   If you stay there - use them.  If you are there with another person, ask for a 2nd pair, especially if you are on the Columbus Ave side.  One Sunday night we had the worst NYC sleeps we've had in years; the deal we got on the price was not worth having such a miserable next day.";3
I  stayed  1  night here. it is on a  quiet road about 200 metres from Hammersmith Station. At  the  station is a huge mall with everything  you  would need plus  loads of restaurants and pubs  nearby.  I was  dissapointed that the wifi was not free. It was Â£1  per hour so I bought Â£5 and it lasted me  the  night although I had to keep dis abling my wifi  when not using it.  My  room was  a double but in fac turned out to be 2  single beds pushed  together  with 1 pillow and  1 duvet per bed. My windows were  clean and the floor was  stone  with no matting r  carpet. A double  wardrobe and a  side  table with drawers both dating  from the 70,s and not in the best of  condition were  supplied. There was  a small ld  fridge in my room for food storage. Cutlery and plates were;3
After travelling for 16 hours finally arrived at the hotel and lady at the reception (Maria) couldn't find my booking. It was all paid for and arranged through the holiday company and I had all the paperwork. Eventually she informed me that my booking has been cancelled as the company I used went into administration! She told me good news though - we've got rooms! And ask to phone the holiday company to find out what's happened and go to booking.com to make a booking again! I was shocked both by the situation and poor customer service. I managed to speak to the holiday company who assured me my booking has been confirmed however hotel was adamant they didn't have the money. I spoke to the manager (Michael) the next day who tried to rectify the situation by providing some free;3
I stayed in a one bed apt with my daughter for 6 nights this month.  I was worried after reading the reviews... but thankfully there was no need. Ok the building smelt a but musty like an old building but that was ok... i can deal with that.  We were checked in in five mins... OUr room was on the 5th floor... It was perfectly adequate. We had everything we needed, the bedroom was clean and the bed comfortable... the sofa in the living area was extremely comfy too... We had ironing board, extra pillows, blankets, toaster, microwave and fine tv and music centre.   There was no view, just a wall but that as fine because it was extremely quiet at night so we slept really well. It is a great area and the doormen helped us with where to get shopping etc... Subway and supermarket only;3
We had a private room for 5 nights. It was clean and comfortable, with a nice bathroom. The room was small and a bit hot in the summer. Friendly helpful staff and clean laundry area. We had a nice little fridge and crockery and cutlery in the room, which was very convenient. Very close to the tube and bus station.;3
cheap as you like, shared toilets and showers etc but i didn't care. room was very basic but was ok. cheap and central as you like cannot fault that! anyone looking fora  luxury apartment visit is barking up the wrong tree but this IS the real NYC as far as i am concerned. the reception reminds me of US police front desk and the various securities and antiquated booking system with its hand written chits etc is fascinating. i have nothing bad to say about the place. Probably hipster paradise.;3
Nice, clean hotel in a convenient location very close to Central Park. I will admit our room was a bit small and the bathroom was extremely small but overall I thought it to be a good value. Close to subway as well.;3
Requested double beds with a view of NY. Received 1 queen size with the view of a wall.  The view was fixed but no double beds available.  Got to the New room and the ac wasnt working.  Had to call 3 times and waited over 2 hours when they finally decided to replace the unit.  After about 20 minutes with the new unit, it turned off with the tv. Jumped a fuse.  Another hour to get fixed.  Very small rooms, won't be staying at this hotel again.;3
We stayed in April of 2015. My title pretty much sums it up, it was neither bad nor great. I will start with the positives. It is very close to Central Park. We stayed 2 nights and took multiple walks through the park simply because of how close it was. The room was small but clean. I liked the stand up shower.  The hotel also has a cool roof top bar.    I don't really have too many negatives to say about the hotel. As I mentioned, the rooms were small but that seems to be a common theme in NYC. The lobby/bar area is dark with a brown theme.  It may be fine in the winter, but we were there in the spring. It was a little depressing.   I will probably try another hotel next time.;3
Many of the rooms have connecting doors which let in a lot of noise from the next door room.  I asked to change rooms but could only get another room with a connecting door,  However I could also hear the people on the other side of me at times. Not my favorite. Obviously this is a hugely busy place and staff are always busy.  The concierge was enormously helpful and perfectly excellent and assisting with all my needs.  The front desk staff are efficient and less than friendly.  On arrival no one offered to assist with my suitcases.  In fact after a greeting they purposely leave you to manage your own suitcases.  This is not the friendliest of arrivals that I have encountered! You get the feeling that they are so busy that their clients are just another number.  On checking in I;3
We chose this hotel for our week in New York due to the fact that it looked trendy (so we expected very few children to be there) and because it has a rooftop (outdoor) pool - something which we find nearly impossible to get in Manhattan. The hotel was indeed very trendy, including the room, lobby and bar area. The rooftop area had a small swimming pool with nice enough views of the Upper West Side. They also had a small satellite bar on the rooftop as well (which seemed to be open all day). Staff were friendly and helpful. Our room & en suite were very, very small and had lots of minibar related things in which we could buy but no tea and coffee making facilities. I suppose though that this is not something you can expect in the US. The bed was comfortable. We didn't see a lot;3
This hotel is situated very close to the Empire State Building and everywhere is very accessible. The rooms are a reasonable size and if you want more space there is the option to upgrade. The staff were all helpful and friendly and everywhere was clean. Sometimes the lifts got very busy at peak times. I was sad that they donât cater for gluten free and as a coeliac it was like going back in time to how the UK used to be! We were given breakfast vouchers which were no use to myself or my daughter because there was no pastries that were gluten free. We tried the restaurant one day as my daughter is vegan and again we really struggled. She lived on salad and chips and the breakfast I had was slapped onto the plate! It cost about Â£25! The hotel has 80 floors and the view across the;3
The Kind bed was so nice and comfortable. Shower room has the rain shower and the regular hand shower. It is so usuful while most of the today's hote has only rain shower. The king room is large as that of at Grand Hyatt DFW. Breakfast buffet menu selection is good.;3
"Honestly, our room smelled like a dog. The carpets had been vacuumed but seemed to have taken a beating this summer.Having returned from an international vacation we found the cost and quality of the room service a limited selection and highly overpriced; none of our dishes tasted very good at dinner. Breakfast was better but $80 for a few sides is ridiculously out of range. The staff was freindly and professional.";3
Got this hotel as part of a package trip to New York. It was pretty awful. Our friend from Missouri joined us there and paid over $200 a night, which is extortionate. Small grubby rooms with little facilities, electrical sockets loose in the wall, mold around the bath and shower, this place wasn't really worth $20 a night. The only plus side was the staff were really nice. Oh well...New York was fabulous but if there's a next time, it won't be in this hotel.;3
Astor is a hotel very simple. No Breakfast. No lunch or dinner, but your location that is really important. Front of the Central Park, near by subway station. It really does, what it has created for. I recommend it for everyone who is looking for a simple hotel.;3
Lovely staff.  Tired accommodation.  Can't agree with other comments about the breakfast as I found it to be low quality mostly stodge.  That said, there was plenty of it and the price was right so no complaints.  The omelette cooker was relentless and implacable but I'm not convinced there were real eggs in his omelettes. What.....  NO KETTLE!?!  Only other place I've experienced that was Amsterdam.  Madness.  There was some weird looking coffee maker but it looked a bit grubby so we didn't chance it.  Major for me as I like to make a cup of tea in my room. Some eating places in walking distance but low quality. No safe in room and it felt necessary. Balcony but no chair to sit on it.  Comfortable bed. With a few titivations this could be a great place but maybe their business;3
Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights  The queue to check in at 1am after a transatlantic flight was a pain but not disastrous.  The room itself was absolutely fine - decor slightly dated but clean and workable albeit would have benefited from more power points. However the shower was awful. Low pressure, the wall mounted shower head was at a height designed for the smaller person and getting a temperature between freezing and boiling required movements of millimetres to get the right level. Because of this I wouldn't choose this hotel again  Should note the hotel gym is one of the best I've come across - it is a 'proper' gym suitable for a workout;3
Excellent location, the major reason (with price) for our selection. The staff were pleasant, if a little busy / flustered when we checked in. The room felt a little tired, and some areas of the floor we were on were bing refurbished. The room was nice enough, but felt as if the standard premier inn furniture had been plonked in a room that could have benefited from a more tailored approach. We would stay again, but will ask for a recently refurbished room.;3
"Visited NY for 2 nights in August. Reception staff were helpful as was the Concierge who deserves special mention for his advice, assistance and provision of free maps! The hotel is impressive but once you leave the luxurious reception, the rooms leave something to be desired. I booked two Superior Double rooms but although furnished to a high standard, are small and cramped. Other reviewers have commented on the bathroom and shower; I also found it impossible to shower without flooding the floor. I thought the shower door was missing, but no, it just has a gap. A terrible design flaw in any bathroom. If it was designed as a wet-room then fine but it clearly was not.   Never mind, a cup of tea or coffee always helps. Not in this hotel I'm sorry. Of all the hotels I have ever";3
The hotel is right in the heart of NYC.  Its rather large, but the rooms are never loud.  it took a bit for our room to be ready but they held our luggage.  The room (two doubles) was pretty sizable for a NY hotel room .  The bathroom was also pretty roomy.  Didn't spend a lot of time in the room.  Close to transportation.  Tick Tock Diner was good for breakfast.;3
The Tick Tock diner is excellent. Lots of lifts in the hotel so you never have to wait. Unlike most hotels.   Rooms are tired and the bathrooms could do with upgrading. The hairdryer was awful. Mirrors not placed in rooms to enable you to dry your hair next to a plug.   Charged a facilities fee to my credit card when I didnât use any facilities. Iâve already paid a fortune for the room and had to leave a tip, I donât expect to be charged for facilities I havenât used.;3
You can't get any closer to Lincoln Center than the Empire Hotel but what you gain in convenience is lost in the touches that make a hotel exceptional. The corner suite, although it has a view of the Lincoln Center campus and Fordham, is cramped and dark. The few light fixtures give off dim light and the windows aren't very large so you won't get ample daylight to compensate. The bathroom is minuscule -- barely enough room to turn around. The sink is only about 4 inches deep and there in no door on the shower. Of course, the water spills onto the bathroom floor. The bed has a hard mattress with a relatively thin pillow top.  The climate control only emits one temp and the air is extremely dry. Mini bar items were never replenished. Pluses: very clean, very quiet and the very;3
Great location but this place needs a shake up. The music in the lobby is too loud and not at all relaxing. I had to use the lounge a lot as wi-fi was free there but $12.99 per day in the room. This meant that anyone could walk in from the street and have access but paying customers, in my case several hundred dollars, had no more priveledge. It's time to re-new the Internet access policy people. It's 2014. Free wi-fi is a not a luxury.;3
The good:  Room 770, nice view, corner of the building. Room was nice, quiet, clean, huge bathroom.  This is the third time I've stayed at this hotel in the last 3 years.  I stay here on business because the hotel is close to my office.  Pool is nice but gets covered in shade around dinnertime, so you can't swim much after 7pm. (too chilly) Peet's Coffee shop on the property is nice.  Bar is nice, but out in the open lobby.  Self-parking garage is good.  Staff was nice. Walking distance to Universal Studios and CityWalk. Now for my COMPLAINTS.  The cost of food.  Breakfast buffet was $28!!  Ridiculous. Dinner was even higher. It was cheaper to walk to CityView and eat there.   And my biggest complaint... THE ELEVATORS!!!  Horribly slow.  I stood there with all the other guests;3
First things first: calling the thing on the roof a pool is so New York. I've seen bigger bathtubs. They'd have been better off being honest about this on the website. I'm sure I'm not the only one to be annoyed by their used car salesman tactics. Otherwise this is an okay hotel: cute rooms, great location just up from Columbus Circle and across the street from Lincoln Center. Staff were absolutely lovely.  The heating/air conditioning units are so old and dirty they make you feel you might get sick from using them. Finally -and this goes for pretty much any hotel Manhattan - make them put you on the outside of the building. Otherwise your window opens on a filthy airshaft filled with the amazingly noisy heart of the ancient air system and only a few feet from all the other;3
Booked through booking.com  We expected that we would probably pay alot seeing as we were staying over new years. When we arrived we were told that there was a $27 per day facility fee on top of what we had already paid which covered access to the gym (which we didn't use) and phone calls (what we didn't make). When we recieved the bill upon checking out it appears that they also added tax to that $27! So it was closer to $30 per night. For a 7 night stay that is crazy and increased the stay by alot of money. It never stated anywhere that there would be extra charges especially for things we didn't use! And they take $315 American off your credit card as security without telling you (not sure if that is just an American thing but I thought it was usually around $50 for security);3
We stayed one night. The room was clean and the hotel staff was very friendly. It was difficult to use the luggage dolly because the elevators are so small because of it being an older building.  That being said, it does show it's age.  But, if you are looking for a hotel that has great rates, and is clean then this one is for you.;3
Reading the reviews, I was REALLY not looking forward to staying, but it was fine!  The room, which to me was the most important, was a good sized twin room, crisp, clean bedding, no wildlife, a fridge, mugs, plates & cutlery if you wanted to use the basic  kitchen facilities. It used to be an old hospital & the layout & rooms haven't really changed - tiled corridors, which are a bit echo-y, and it really isn't a visually appealing place, but, if like us, you were spending your money on a gig & drinks, it was a more than adequate base. I think spending months there would be a bit depressing, but, where else in London could you AFFORD to stay for months!  There was work being done on our floor, so I am guessing they are upping the game a little -the gentleman at reception was;3
I stayed here for the convenience of proximity to Universal Studios Hollywood.  I was charged more to park per day at the hotel than if I'd parked at Universal Studios.  In addition, the shuttle to the park was not running during early entry hours to the park.  I'd recommend a cheaper hotel for anyone traveling with a family for the purposes of attending Universal Studios Hollywood.  You will not miss anything.;3
"If your objective in New York is to be near Lincoln Center, this location is perfect - right across the street! Obviously convenient to the neighborhood, and a perfectly reasonable walk to Central Park a block away and the theatre district just a few blocks down past Columbus Circle.  The room, while small, was surprisingly quiet. It was on the second floor, so not too far above the traffic, but it faced away from the street (no view, but we didn't care) and there was no noise to speak of, whether from the street or elsewhere in the hotel.  Given the premium price of the room and the image the hotel is trying to project, however, it's the little things that count. The ""closet"" consisted of several hooks behind the door and four hangers. Two paper cups in the bathroom (which the";3
The Empire will seem familiar for those who like European-style hotels and the color brown.  Translation: smallish rooms, understaffed fron desk, narrow corridors, dim lighting, and lost of brown decor (rugs, wallpaper, furnishing).  I was housed here while on a business visit to Fordham University and it's super convenient to both the campus and Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle.  My room was smallish, although not the micro-room (#1137) one sometimes sees in NYC.  However the odd trapezoid shape made it look larger than other rooms on the floor diagram.  It was perfectly comfortable for a short stay, but oddly configured.  The bathroom was long and narrow with aa very shallow sink.  athere was no desk, but rather an 18 inch by 4 foor table under the falt screen TV covered;3
"Metro 1,2 and 3 are a one minute walk away. Express takes you downtown in no time.  Duane Reade is just around the corner, as are Starbucks, Subway, some banks, churches, DVD rental and so on. Central Park is ten minutes away. The old building has new bathrooms and old AC. A big bed and small, slow elevators. You can book tours in the lobby or a transfer to the airport. Wifi is available in the lobby as wel. Our electronic door lock failed, so maintenance was quickly called in to replace the lock. This eastern guy was very friendly and professional.  This was one of the more decently priced hotels in NY; because prices are going through the roof compared to other states.";3
My boyfriend and I couldn't help but laugh when we opened the door to our bunk bed room. We expected it to be small, but not THAT small. We could hardly get our bags in and close the door behind us. I slept in the lower bed and it was VERY hard, I ended up having the extra pillow under my back to make it more soft. Good thing I was tired because of jetlag :) Having this said, -it was a smart, clean and cosy room. You even get a bathrobe and slippers.   - The shared showers and toilets are nice and clean. - The location is in Meatpacking district is perfect. Close to great restaurants, bars and other nice areas: West Village, Greenwitch, SoHo. - You get to borrow really cool bikes for free and we biked almost all of Manhattan which was a super nice experience. - Connected to the;3
I can't tell whether the hotel is open or not.  I tried calling and after going through the voicemail prompts, and saying make reservation it rings and then disconnects.  ALthough one can make reservations on numerous sites, it is impossible to tell what would happen when I show up.;3
I recently stayed 2 separate nights at the Hyatt Regency LAX.  The rooms are quite nice, good Wifi, pleasant staff.  I wish I could say the same for the food.  I ordered room service chips and salsa since the dish I wanted wasn't available.  The chips had been microwaved which made them taste like cardboard made of corn.  The salsa was a watery mess.  It was taken off the bill fortunately.  The next morning I ate breakfast in the restaurant and the pancakes were excellent.  The next night I stayed I went to the Market place and got the cold noodle salad.  It had some cucumbers and carrots and didn't taste like it had a speck of dressing so get this if you like plain boiled noodles.  Three bites and I left it there.  I expect hotel food to be overpriced but this was inedible.  I;3
I think it would be hard to beat the location of this hotel.  The subway is a 2 min walk from the hotel providing access to main tourist sites.  Itâs also not far from Times Square on foot.   The hotel seems to undergoing some upgrades.  I paid for a room upgrade and they offered a city view room on their âexecutive floorâ. Given the shape of the hotel, the view was actually a brick wall.  However, if you stood at the window and looked to the side you could see a few buildings.   The room and bathroom were small but housekeeping was efficient and the rooms were cleaned daily.;3
Nice and clean Hotel. No bedbugs in our room and the room was cleaned every day. It was close to the subway and it took only 10-15 min to walk to the shopping at Broadway. The staff was ok. One guy was really serviceminded, the others were nice and polite but nothing more. The area was ok, we felt pretty safe but I wouldnât like to go through the park too late in the night.  Although two problems, donât sleep on the groundfloor. You could hear everything at the front desk including the front door slamming, we changed room after one night. The second thing, the taxi drivers had difficulties to finding the hotel, even if we showed the hotel on map. Try to point out the biggest street nearby.;3
Good hotel right near to the Empire State Building. Only reason I scored so low is this - I paid a lot of money to stay here for a week - then upon arrival I had to pay a service/resort fee of nearly 250 dollars - all this got me was poor WiFi!     Apart from that the rooms were clean and today - great views and lobby area was tidy  Bed was comfy and bathroom has everything we needed;3
I selected The New Yorker because I had a Groupon for 2 for 1 nights and because it was very close to Penn Station.  Hotel is old but clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is great for walking to most places.  The restaurant on sight is good for breakfast.  I just wish it had been included in the price.  I would stay here again or recommend it to others.;3
Hotel has a beautiful lobby and great location across from Lincoln center. Two blocks from central Park. It has a rooftop bar with a tiny pool and outrageously priced drinks. The rooms are very small but its NYC and thats expected. The lobby bar (featured on Gossip Girl) is very cool looking and there is a constant stream of people traffic throughout. Overall my family and I were happy and had a great visit to NYC;3
We stayed here in October before a cruise so it was booked as part of a deal by our Travel agent.  It is located between Penn station and the Empire State Building and an easy walk to Times Square.  The lobby was very impressive.  Our room was a big disappointment, it was small and outdated and in need of a refurb.  There was no hospitality tray and not even a bottle of water.  The view from our window was a wall and sky.  Ok for 2 nights;3
Water in tub rusty,,,,otherwise okay        Would never drink that water...  Great location, near to Lincoln Center, and the dining room is very nice.  Comfortable beds...check in never before 3.  Wish they offered an apple or free coffee.;3
"We arrived at The Empire Hotel on the 25th Apri, I know that the hotel had been ""informed"" prior to us arriving that it was mine and my twin sisters 40th Birthday on the 26th, maybe on the hope that we ""might"" get an upgrade on the room (but those kinds of things dont happen to me), but there was nothing at all said, no complimentary drinks, nothing.  When we checked into our room I told my husband to not even unpack and requested a better room.  I was in NEW YORK, I dont want to look out of the window straight at a brick wall.  Fair enough it was changed prompty and although the rooms are very small (no wardrobes or space to put your cases) we were happier with it.    When my sister checked in she was in the same position but they did not have a new room for her, she was";3
This hotel whilst not outstanding ticks the respective boxes for somewhere to stay on a budget in New York. Its location is fine only a short ride on the subway to all the main attractions and the staff were helpful when required. Yes the rooms  maybe could do with alick of paint but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed my stay. However be careful when using the lift as it is an experience to behold.;3
Hotel is fabulously located.  However, even the in-room coffee is a ala-carte.  The HVAC unit in my room was old and noisy and with control buttons universally missing.  It took me two nights of fitful sleep in a room rendered way too warm before I ventured to putting my finger in to the slots which once housed the buttons to control the unit.  Furthermore, the unit clicked loudly every time that the heat stopped, waking me up from what was already a fitful sleep.  HVAC unit should be replaced at once.;3
This is a fantastic location if Universal Studios is in your plan. While we did not visit the park, is served as an easly location to navigate the rest of the city. The metro station is just down the hill, and for $7 a day, you can get pretty much anywhere. The hill is not for those out of shape or woth health issues, however, so I recommend taking the Universal trolley (free) to the top and then walking back to the hotel.;3
My main complaint is the âresort feeâ ($22US) which is being charged for very standard hotel inclusions such as tea and coffee, in room wifi and baggage minding. I found out about this at the time of check in! This is just a sneaky way of charging more per night for the hotel room. I realise that lots of hotels in NYC are doing this, but that does not make it acceptable!  The hotel location was excellent and otherwise the stay was comfortable.;3
You may ask why 3 stars if the staff and the location are fine.  Issue one, there is almost no WiFi.  No Internet in Manhattan ?  That's just daft.  There may be better options if you pay for it, but I looked at the number of bars of signal and, well, no.  Two, the lounge bar.  Is just not really trying.  Possibly because there's a roof top bar on floor twelve.  Ok, that's nice, I liked it, but it is a fuss to get to and is not really part of the hotel.  Other minor issues, they charge for in-room coffee and, as far as I could tell, there's no stairs.  Only lift (elevator).  I tried the stairs and they ended up somewhere odd, neither lounge, outside, lobby, err..I dunno.  Otherwise, yeah, its ok.  Not bad.  Only $2000 a week.  Oh, the concierge is genuinely helpful, so are the;3
This hotel was chosen by Titan Holidays not me.  Worn out look inside the entrance lobby.  Lifts with minds of their own.  Worn out room with dated equipment, good size and clean but as for the window, absolutely filthy, I doubt it has been cleaned in 2019. See sttached picture.  Bathroom weird, you need thbe strength of Hercules to turn on the shower, no bath and the toilet bowl set so low I felt I was a child.  Breakfast expensive.  This was my first experience of this chain of hotels and I was not impressed. Four stars! More like a UK Travelodge.  Long time since I have stayed in a hotel this poor.;3
"This Hotel is located in East Hollywood and is suitable for families visiting the area. We stayed one night here and it was just OK. The rooms were clean, however, there was an incident at the breakfast buffet that left a bad taste in my mouth. A young mother with several children sat at the table next to us. One of the children spilled juice while the mother was at the buffet station getting their food. I told someone working in the dining area about the spill, and he ignored it. Not only did he walk past the spill countless times, but even after having it brought to his attention he did nothing.  At least put up a ""caution, wet floor"" sign or something! Or better yet, clean it up! Anyone could have slipped on it, not to mention the children had to sit in that mess for their";3
Great hotel! Great location!  Bedroom was a good size. Bed was comfortable.   Room was clean.   close to all necessary amenities. Good restaurants in walking distance.  walking distance to the subway station;3
Honestly wouldn't be a 3 only for some staff! Not very welcoming at reception desk by a lady! Door man Jeff was so helpful and a great person! Bar staff Gina and javier made our holiday to New York a pleasure. Hotel rooms are nice but as for anything to do in the hotel, Rubbish! You cannot even relax after a fun day in the city, your basically room bound.. Not really much of a seating area! There is no restaurant within the hotel. All you get is what you see in the picture! Crap. If you need any help what so ever javier is the man to see! Such a lovely man and actually will be missed by all of my company I was with!;3
Not ideal for a traveling family for the price. No pull out couch means $35 for a rollaway. Breakfast buffet is not worth the price.  No changing tables in public restrooms for travleing infants/toddlers makes no sense as a family destination hotel.  But the location for Universal is unbeatable.;3
Great location. Right across the street from the Lincoln Centre. 1/2 block to the subway. Clean lobby and fairly nice design. Respectable lobby bar. The room was tiny but that's expected for NY. The bathroom though lacked any kind of ventilation so made the whole room muggy and dank feeling. There was some water damage on the bathroom - nothing major but rot on the baseboards. The shower was so small we kept banging our elbows into the walls and glass. Our room safe was not working (just needed a battery replaced) had 3 requests to fix all not attended to. It does not measure up to the quality of the photos on their site. Just a little sloppy all around. Not horrible but far from great.;3
Ok so itâs rated 4 stars on various websites.... this is not a 4 star hotel at best it would scrape 3 stars! Our room on the 7floor was tiny (ok I know NYC hotels rooms are small but this took the biscuit!) The a/c was so noisy we couldnât sleep and the engineer whilst friendly couldnât fix it The lobby bar is freezing cold - you may as well be upstairs on the roof bar which to be fair is quite cool although pimped our for corporate affairs and a distinct smell of weed coming from the outside space! Location is ok but wouldnât rush back to this place Itâs trying too hard and failing.;3
Before I begin this review I should say that having read through some of the reviews prior to my stay I was really concerned about my booking and whether the hotel would meet my (previously high) expectations.  I made my concerns known to the hotel via the power of social media and on arrival at the hotel (a Saturday night in June at around 9pm) we had been upgraded to a corner suite free of charge. I was really happy & surprised about this.  Our room was really big (by City standards) had a lounge area and a good sized bathroom.  Our room was on the 10th floor and yes the lifts are slow and a tad unreliable.  We weren't disturbed by the street noise or by the roof top bar. The bed was comfy but the wardrobe space left a lot to be desired. Considering that tourists do a lot of;3
It used to be that booking a suite meant a spacious set of rooms on a high floor (38-40) and included a kitchenette, but whern I arrived this February I was given a small set of rooms, without kitchen facilities on the 7th floor, witjh no view at all and barely any natural daylight. I was moved once a better room became available but even then, I had to give up my current room before the new one was available and was told that I would have to move the luggage myself. The staff are generally helpful and the hotel had to cope with a revolving door and half the lifts being out of service. I had booked here for several years in succession prior to this, so overall I like staying there, but now I have to at least conisder alternatives;3
"So if you are going to Lincoln Center and want to walk comfortably to your hotel, for now The Empire is still the only ""it."" Otherwise I'd give it two stars. ALL the staff are super friendly.  But the rooms are badly in need of attention. Plus the place is still dark and creepy. At least now there are more dining options than in the days of  he Vampire, both inside and outside the hotel. I'd go outside. The hotel's ""Chowder House"" is average in a City where average won't do. I had one cocktail, one glass of wine, a salad and an entree--for $87.00. You'll pay the same at most of the big name places nearby but you'll have a much better meal. And for less expensive, there is a PJ Clark's anchoring one corner of the Hotel. Check your room first if booking in summer and make sure the";3
Hotel is getting tired compared to other options in the City, we stayed in two different rooms and the door was worn and showing a lot of wear.  The staff at this hotel are rude, at times very rude. overrated and we will not return - we will return to the NYLO again for a far superior experience;3
I was pretty dissappointed with ym stay at the Empire Hotel. I could have stayed at a similar quality hotel for much cheaper, but I chose to stay here because of the rooftop pool. At check in, they informed me that they have not renewed their lisence or something, so it has not and will not be open for a while. This makes me pretty upset seeing as I spent the extra money on this specific imenity and they still advertise it. The room was extremely hot when I got in, which concerned me beacuse I had read some reviews about the AC being broken. Fortunately, mine worked just fine once I turned it on. Other than that, it was a decent stay. Not complaints really.;3
I have been to NYC many times. However, my husband and daughter had never visited so I chose Ameritania for our stay in July 2019. The hotel is very reasonably priced for the location. Itâs a 5min walk to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall and Central Park. Rooms are very small but theyâre clean and the beds are super comfy. I donât think I would stay here again but if youâre visiting NYC for the first time, spending a couple of nights here would be easy to do.;3
Staff behind the desk were not particularly friendly but not rude either. The music playing in the small reception area was perhaps a little loud but not too obtrusive. The interior was a little tatty in places, but as long as you're not expecting a luxury hotel nothing to worry about. Room appeared very clean and of ample size. Bathroom was spacious, clean and well stocked with towels. Had to pay $100 deposit on checking in but this was fully refunded. There was a small room downstairs, with coffee, cold drinks and snacks available from vending machines and computers which you can use to surf the net (for the rather pricey sum of $0.20/minute, so dollars go rather quickly when you're looking up times/places/subway stations etc).            The walk into the centre of town took;3
Disappointed  they never come to clean my room during my stay. The food at the restaurant of the hotel is horrible and wind also. First time I had this experience ! There is no pool and the gym is basic.;3
There are a lot of good things about this hotel - the staff is helpful, the location is good and the rooms and beds are comfortable. But there is one huge IF - the bathrooms. The firs room I was given had a totally dysfunctional shower. The huge shower head was right in the center of the cubicle. There was a glass wall that covered less than half the opening - and nothing else. When you turned on the shower, the bathroom flooded within seconds. When I called to complain, I was told this was true of most of the rooms - and I was offered additional bath mats to soak up the water!. BUT- when I said this was unacceptable, I was quickly given another - much larger- room with a tub/shower unit with a full curtain.  Everything else about the hotel was good. But i would never take a;3
Good resort type hotel situated right next to Universal Studios. The rooms are big, comfortable and clean with large bathrooms and some great views. The amenities include a bar area, a restaurant, a coffee shop, discount entry to Universal and a great pool / lounge area outside. The staff are also really pleasant and helpful, definitely add something to the stay, which was offered at a great rate. There is a major downside which has knocked at least one mark off the rating - the elevators / lifts. I've travelled extensively all over the world and stayed in all kinds of establishments and I've never experienced elevators that are this slow. This is a 30 floor hotel so they are very much needed but they're so incredibly slowthat there would always be queues in the lobby area;3
Honestly I'm torn on this hotel. For the location the price was great. The hotel staff was all super friendly and accommodating, and our room was clean and nice. The view from the window was of dirty windows from the building next door but that's not their fault. However the elevator took 5-10 minutes to reach you from any level and when I tried to use the stairs they ended at the second level. That doesn't seem to safe. It seems like the entire building is falling apart with walls that are bowed out and one of the hall closets was open revealing a collapsed ceiling. Our room also had a outlet in the restroom that didn't work and when I went to unplug my curling iron the entire front of the outlet fell off! Our deadbolt also did not lock.  I honestly loved my stay but was left;3
The facility fee really annoyed me.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't use much wifi in the room on holiday because I'm rarely in the room.  I also wouldn't waste my time in New York in the gym or on the computers etc. So for us it was just $248 extra for nothing.  Apparently it's very clear and all the hotels do it, but I didn't see it in the small print so be aware.  The room was very small and basic so we really wanted to be out of it most of the time too (which was ok because the aim of the holiday was sight seeing). The main plus is the location, which is excellent (right in the middle of everything) and I've got to say it was clean and housekeeping was good.;3
the aperance of this hotel isnât lovely and the bar area is beautiful, however there isnât enough seating area for the amount of guest in the hotel. If you go down to the bar and there are no seats available then no one will serve you, you just get ignored. The main focus is the bar area. I felt that the rooms are slightly more neglected, the room we stayed in was average and freezing!.. there was a draft coming through the window. We had no heating control over the room. We went in winter expected it to be cold but we couldnât even warm up in the room. I wouldnât recommend this hotel just because of the temperature in the room. You shouldnât have to wear your coat on the bedroom just to stay warm.;3
Having read previous reviews which I take seriously, I looked forward to getting to this hotel after nearly a 3 year wait and was celebrating my birthday whilst there and my wife was belatedly celebrating her 60th and the hotel knew this as it was mentioned on the booking, Previous users have extollled the virtues of the check in staff and their willingness to offer free upgrades NO such luck for us We were then allocated a room on the 21st floor which we didn't realise at that time would mean a terrible wait most of the time for elevators. The elevators on the right serve floors 20 to 40 and are so busy. whereas floors up to 20 use elevators on the left which seemed to hardly be used. The rooms were old and dated and did not seem to reflect the glossy look on the website. Also;3
You don't expect a lot for the price per night in Manhattan and you don't get a lot. The word adequate was invented for this establishment, although the TV didn't work and the shower wasn't great but it did the job.;3
A former New Yorker and a seasoned visitor - have tried many NYC hotels over the years (east side, west side, mid-town, boutique, high-end, bargain, etc.) ... this hotel is a GREAT location for NYC and we had a room with a fabulous view of Lincoln Center and up Broadway ... would MAYBE consider staying here again for those two reasons ... but otherwise it is an expensive hotel for being outdated and cheap. Too bad - such a classic hotel - it could be so nice. Room with a view (albeit very small), beds very comfortable with great linens/pillows (thank goodness) - but the bathroom left much to be desired (standing room only) ... dumpy shower with cheap shower heads (broke while using), sink off the base, toilet barely worked. Did not appreciate the $7.50 for water and $3.50 for;3
Check in very nice.  Pleasant staff.  Room and bathroom was clean but carpet needs to be replaced.  Elevators weren't as slow as I previously read.  Our room was on the 20th floor and we never experienced a slow elevator or any kind of wait.  Starbucks on site is a plus but bagels were stale.  I'd stick to the blueberry muffins.  Food in dining room was really good.  This hotel is Convenient to Universal Studios.  Metro at bottom of hill very convenient too.  One stop to Hollywood Blvd.  Overall, great stay!;3
I booked this hotel as an overnight stop prior to an early internal flight.  However, my husband and I were both arriving on international flights at different times of the day.  On the day of check-in my husband arrived at 6am from Sydney.  So I contacted the hotel to enquire about any early check-in options.  This was hard work (email options non-existent and phoning needed to allow for 19 hours time difference).  When I eventually spoke to reception, they told me they couldn't help because I'd booked through an online agent (booking.com/lastminute.com).  Back to the online agent and I eventually received email confirmation, that although it was unlikely my husband could check-in much earlier than the nominated time, he was at least recognised as being a partner on the;3
The Ameritania staff was very welcoming among before arrival and during check in. I was celebrating my 40th birthday with a friend and they provided champagne in our room to help start my celebrations. They were also readily available to answer any questions or concerns during out stay. We were even given a great recommendation for a dinner at a local restaurant (ElCentro)!  Rooms were small, but well appointed. If you are a light sleeper I would suggest requesting an inside room. We had a 10th floor room with street view and had to use the hotel provided ear buds (which was a nice accommodation) in order to sleep.  I had two complaints regarding the room... 1 The housekeepers could use better vacuums. There was blond hair all over the carper when we arrived. The housekeeper;3
The location is very good, it's walking distance to Universal Studios and City Walk (wide selection of restaurants) and located right off the 101. The hotel is fairly updated. The beds are very comfortable, and have high quality (high thread count and crisp) sheets. The bathroom is modern and clean. ON the negative side and the reason I rated this hotel as only average is that the room could use a good dusting, and the carpets were quite dirty. It's actually quite surprising that the management does not hire a firm to come in and steam clean them - seems like a simple fix to greatly improve the guest experience.;3
My roomies small but comfortable...the ironing board is like the EZBake Oven of boards... It is meant to sit on the bed on little feet , very tough to use and actually press a blouse.  There has to be a better solution!  But my staff angel today was Pasquale who printed out documents I needed for a meeting in the morning, just an immediate Yes to my asking him....provided an email for me to send the documents to and voila, my problem was solved!  Not every place helps like this. Not every staff smiles like Pasquale who got me out of a real jam!  Thanks for being gracious and helpful!;3
This place has just what you need, nothing else. A bed that was clean, you had to climb down to get in it, it was very low to the ground. Wash cloth, towel, trash can, TV without cable, radiators with steam that comes out to heat the room, tiny elevator enough for 2 people and 1 piece of luggage or 1 person and 2 pieces of small luggage. the room doors have real keys but only 1 per room, they said it was for security reasons. I was not prepared for this experience at all. We were celebrating our Anniversary and just stayed over in NY for the night. We just chalked it up to you get what you pay for. I would not go back again.;3
Great location and close proximity to Universal Studio and also Hollywood. One of the best customer service during check in & check out which make you feel valued. The let down is the hotel restaurant Cafe Sierra, for the price you pay the food is absolutely terrible in taste, & the service is slow.;3
My husband and I stayed at The Empire to have early morning access to the city for a 100 mile bike ride called Escape from Manhattan.  We got there around 5pm with a car and a roadbike.  The Valets were one of the best experiences at the hotel.  When I balked at the $60 valet fee, and asked if the self parking at Lincoln Center was overnight, they were helpful and cheery.  One suggested we leave the vehicle right where it was (directly in front of the Hotel) as in 30 minutes it would be free overnight parking on the street.  He assured me it would be safe as the valets are there 24/7 and that they would keep and eye on it.  They offered to put a valet tag on it for the half hour till 6pm so it would not get ticketed and helped get the road bike out of the car cheerily. I wasn't;3
we stayed on the second floor, you take the elevator one floor down. The room was big but dark and no view. it rained and the rain came from the window, they put a towel on the floor to collect the rain. very poor for a high end hotel. nice bathroom. The food was ok. nothing special, I would not stay there again, unless you are visiting Universal;3
We stay here because it's across the street from Lincoln Center.  But I'm increasing annoyed each time we come.  Our room on the 11th floor is so hot that we have the windows wide open during a snowstorm--apparently a feature of many 10th and 11th floor rooms, from discussion with other guests in the elevator!  And while the hotel is not overpriced, they charge you extras at every turn:  $12/day for WiFi, with separate charge for each device--ie, you need two subscriptions if you have laptop and tablet.  In-room coffeemaker, but you get charged $3.50 for each K-cup!  The shower requires an engineering degree and if you use the handheld, you still get a constant cold drip from the overhead, which you can't avoid because only half the stall is glassed in, with no shower curtain.;3
Well, the hotel was cheap considering that it was NYC. Very small room and bathroom, the noise isolation between rooms was poor, and there was no view to the outside.  Nevertheless my overall experience was OK and for that price I would go there again. If you enjoy running the central park is so close that it gives you the chance to make a superb walk in the morning.;3
We stayed at the Empire Hotel this last week. I have stayed there before, when it was first refurbished and was generally cleaner and more comfortable. This stay was less than optimal, as there were so many crowds and the weather was hot, the environment quite frankly was not pleasant or fresh. The dark brown wall paper makes the rooms dreary and confining in feeling, while the tiny bathrooms are almost impossible to use as a couple. The location is fantastic, the beds fairly comfortable, and the rooftop bar nice, when not overly crowded, but other than that, this hotel is in dire need of improvements.;3
"The hotel has a fantastic ubication in midtown Manhattan, 5 minute walk to Penn Station and 2 minutes from the nearest subway. It has very comfortable beds, we slept very well.  What I hated is that they charged 15$ per night for having wifi, and it was ""mandatory"", as the receptionist told me at our arrival.  I didn't like either the fact that the hotel is advertised with one price and then they add so many different things that in the end becomes the double you thought. They should give total amount before the booking.  The receptionists  are unfriendly.";3
I stayed at woogo central park apartments, I was checked right in, my room was great, I thought I would have to sleep in the same room as my colleagues but there was a seperate room for me. I felt safe knowing there was 24hr security. The location was great too, the 2 train was right out of the hotel, it was a great experience!!!;3
The hotel is in a great position near Madison square garden and it's easy to get uptown or downtown very quickly by subway. The hotel has a history which makes it interesting, built in the 1920's. Our room was small and functional. Price was reasonable but had to pay extra $22 a day. This can be included in booking price. Shower was unreliable because the temperature varied. Just adequate although the bathroom was fine otherwise. Good storage space. Thin walls so a bit thin and we could hear people outside and in the next rooms. We didn't mind because the rooms next to us were quite quiet.  Probably fair value for money considering its situation.;3
We recently stayed 4 nights in this hotel. It's by no means a 4 star hotel but neither is the price. It is dated and in need of a refurbishment, but in general it is ok. The best part is that its a 2 minute walk maximum to the subway which serves lines1,2 and 3 and only 2 stops from Times Square, if you take one of the express trains (2 or 3). Train 1 is a local train and stops at every station.The cost is 3 dollars for a single journey. The hotel doesn't have a bar or a restaurant. It only has vending machines on certain floors. This isn't an issue as there's a few restaurants close by that do great breakfasts and evening meals. There are a couple of bars directly opposite the hotel which are nice. If you turn left when leaving the hotel and walk up to the next road (Amsterdam);3
This hotel was very easy to find, and close access to the subway. It was just the two of us staying, and I booked the hotel through Expedia after reading a good mix of reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised. The room is on the smaller side, and it was fine for us as we had minimal luggage, but the bathroom didn't have a counter. There was just a small glass shelf, so it was a little difficult to do the morning hair and makeup routine without juggling a little. I also had to crack the door open while showering, because the steam had no outlet and would gather dew on the ceilings and drip on you after. Otherwise, our bed was comfortable, heat and a/c worked great, and our room was away from the elevators so it was pretty silent. Views all depend on the room you get, we were on;3
Overall I chose premier inn because of its price and location. It was on the cheaper side of hotels I could find that were around popular landmarks. I also liked that it had a restaurant onsite for nights that you didnât want to leave your hotel to eat.;3
"The staff here are superb, very helpful and very friendly, the room was clean and spacious, the beds are very comfortable, the view from our room was stunning,  the only down side was the ""facilities"" charge, (about $30) a day. for the gym, business center and Internet,   you have to pay the whole lot upfront,  WEATHER YOU USE THE SERVICES OR NOT!!!!..... this was however the only downside,,  but to be honest it is enough to stop me rooming here ever again, iv been to NYC many times and never had to pay this,   its money grabbing and nothing else!!!!! No doubt they will try to justify it.... But you can't,   don't see why I should have to pay upfront for services I don't want!!!!!";3
"We got this place through Priceline for $250 a night but when we arrived they talked us into ""upgrading"" to one with 2 beds at a extra $50. The room was nice enough but extremely small . Absolutely no drawers to put your stuff in . Tiny bathroom with nowhere to put things . But on the positive side , the beds were very very comfortable . The shower was quite nice . Housekeeping was reliable and thorough . They charge you $12.95 per day per device ( even cellphones or ereaders ) for WIFI . This is inexcusable in 2015 and I always take one star away when a hotel does this .. The location is great being right across the street from Lincoln Centre . Near the subway with several trains . Excellent restaurants nearby . Close to the Park . The doormen were helpful .";3
We arrived around 10 AM on Friday May 20th.   Pros: - We got an early check in at the desk for just a $25 fee (if your room wasn't ready, they did let you check the baggage with them) - Everything was clean - They make sure you have a room key before you enter the elevator area - They have a little museum downstairs from the lobby about the hotel (we didnt visit this as we didn't have time) - They let us have a late check out for no additional fee at 1:00 PM - View was pretty decent from 35th floor  Cons: - Our hairdryer did not work (we plugged it in and it made a burning smell) - we called downstairs and it took about twenty minutes to get a new one, which, didnt work well because we had a show we had to be at in ten minutes. - The room was a lot smaller than the picture. -;3
What I liked: Big round table great to have meals, nice couch to chill at. Fridge works really well, chill enough that my drink formed little ice crystals.   What I didnât like: Masks were said to be compulsory on premises but many were walking around without theirs on and there was no one enforcing this regulation. Room was apparently soundproof from external plane noises but not sure why there was so much noise coming from the corridor outside. Random banging noises and housekeeping talking/cleaning loudly. Not sure whatâs going on. Another puzzling experience was that I had requested for a tea kettle for my room (its not provided as basic amenity lol) but they didnât send it. Asked 2nd time again and nothing. It was only at my third try when I sounded more annoyed that it;3
I stayed on the empire on December 2011, the week before christmas. I was really excited to stay there and got a amazing deal on their for the Deluxe King room (USD 179 per night!!!). I had googled the hotel before getting there so my expectations were high and also because it is feature on the show Gossip Girl i was wondering it i would spot any celebrities on the lounge. What i can say is that this hotel does not live up to the hype. It's a bit worn out, the lobby specially. The room was ok (can't complain about the amazing king bed), amenities were great (L'Occitane!), ok wireless internet. But what made my experience so bad was that upon the time i made the reservation it was not mentioned that i need to make a security deposit. When i was checking in i was informed about;3
I was very surprised to find a 60 dollar hotel rate in Manhattan, and feared the worst, but found the hotel to be perfectly fine during an October 2002 visit.  The location, on the Upper West Side near the Hudson River, is a safe, quiet residential area (though there's some major construction underway nearby--a new Trump building).   The hotel is a converted residency hotel, which sounded a little creepy, but I was told most rooms have been converted to overnight status. It was full of young foreign travellers when I stayed there.   The room was fine--clean and simple, and it was perfectly quiet in the hallways.  The room had a large color TV with remote, comfortable bed and reading lamp--certainly much less oppulent then most hotel rooms but not at all uncomfortable.   Of;3
We chose the hotel due to the amazing location and indeed the hotel is in central Manhattan, close to all the main attractions. However, we were quite disappointed by the facilities and the room as well as the service. It seems that the hotel is acting as a low cost hotel, to store your luggage on your last day you have to pay 5dollars per item. The bathroom wasnât very clean and not modern at all, very disappointing. The beds were good and the size of the room okay. This hotel doesnât even feel like one but more like a room that you rent with no additional benefits or service.;3
I stayed one night at the Hilton Los Angeles. I ordered the ADA room. When I arrived, the day of... the hotel front desk said that the room would be ready after four. This means that I didn't actually get a full day in my $400-plus room. But I understand that the room needed to be cleaned. Once, I got to the room, I noticed that the bathroom was not wheelchair accessible. No way to access the shower and no grab bars on the toilet. When reserving an ADA room, make sure you get what you ordered. Nice room... but not ADA accessible.;3
Pros:  Right next to Universal so it was easy to walk and be there before the park opened.  A shuttle runs every 15 minutes and was reliable (although it didnât start until when the park opens so you have to walk if you want to be early).  Shuttle runs until 10 which allows you to eat at Citywalk easily.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Pool is open late which is nice after a day at the park.   Cons:  Everything to eat is extremely overpriced.  The shop is not affiliated with the hotel so you canât charge items to the room.  Hot tub was too cold.    Probably would stay again if I was going to the park but might try the Sheraton which shares the shuttle.;3
Our room was clean and spacious for two adults with 2  full sized double beds. Front staff are very helpful and friendly. Breakfast- eggs to order are good. (This is why my rating is 3/5 )All other breakfast offerings are basic and scarce, amount on offer does not accommodate the guest size.Every morning we would be waiting for replenishment of fruit, breakfast pastries, tea bags - not good enough. I was questioned why I require 2 tea bags - actually I like a strong tea. I liked the size off the hotel, proximity to metro and bus, but the area has a large population of homeless and mentally ill citizens, which we found confronting and weary of our surrounds . Its a shame because the hotel is cute;3
This is a no frills hotel.  The rooms were very clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful with directions, etc.  The shared bathroom was OK, Not as clean as I would of liked.  The location was great. Close to several atractions such as Central Park, Museum of National History, or Museum of Modern Art, plus close to the subway.   I loved the neighborhood.  It not like a regular hotel, more like a hostel, such as shared bathroom where you had to bring the toilet paper (which is provide) with you each visit.  Didn't have any bed bugs.  Did have a small refigerator which helped with expenses.  Was close to Trader Joes so we got groceries and had some meals in our toom.  No micorwave though.;3
"First impression of this hotel is good, great location and nice reception/Lobby and bar area. However regardless of  if you managed a good price or paid premium you may find yourself I a mini-room (and I mean mini) or a smaller but nicer room. The smaller but nicer room you would expect for the price but this is considered a ""upgrade"" which I was lucky enough to get, nobody would be happy with the single small room. Everything is charged after that, being internet connection, coffee in the room or a bottle of water. Despite the fantastic weather during my stay, no roof-top terrace was open because it was not yet Memorial Day, which was a real letdown. Only cold water for two days and constant problems with elevators was a understandable annoyance. Hotel bar is ok but with very";3
I recently stayed here for two nights.  The hotel is modern, but the rooms are small and the staff is so so.  AC was broken and needed tone fixed, and the room was never made up during the day.  We were compensated in no way, but thankfully the AC was fixed.;3
Staff is friendly...hotel is large, the bar is the coolest thing about this hotel. Its dark, red velvet, wooden ceilings and walls which are darkly stained, tiny sconces on the wooden pillars... It's an old world style and the ballroom is quite large and dark...dark..dark..  I was surprised to see how many people were streaming in at 1am on a Tuesday. This place gets hopping.  I'd stay here again but it's very basic but is situated in a good area.;3
The room and bathroom was clean. The only thing is that the bathroom times around the tub needed new caulking.;3
We enjoyed our stay at The Empire Hotel.  The location was great - within moments of checking in, we were strolling in Central Park, and it wasn't too far to walk 16 blocks down Broadway to get to the theater.  The decor is chic with a tiger print arm chair in the room and lovely down comforter.  The room itself was teeny tiny.  Just enough space for 2 double beds but really it was the bathroom that was ridiculous - the door is just shy of touching the toilet, the sink faucet is so low it practically touches the sink basin making it tough to wash your hands, and there is no counter space to put any toiletries, which makes it ridiculously tough to get ready in the morning without risking your belongings falling in the toilet.  The shower lacks a door, so you are bound to get;3
overall a good stay but disappointed in our rooms not what we imagined size and bathroom could do with updating . maybe a kettle in the room and proper cups not paper. location good not too noisy. walking distance to time square. roof bar very nice .;3
"Based on 4 Stays in the past 4 Years (averaging 1 to 4 nights):   * Great Location - especially for visiting the Universal Studio;   * Comfortable Rooms - especially the Alcove Room;   * Dining - slightly on the expensive side but excellent dinner buffet (Friday & Saturday);   * Staff Service - Housekeeping, Parking, Restaurant, are all 5 Stars (except Front-Desk);   * Front-Desk Service (0 Star) - due to one rude, unprofessional lady working evenings/nights;   * Special Care for HH Diamond/Gold Guests - non-existent and cost $$s unlike other Hiltons; Marketing Fact = You will need 6 new customers to make up for 1 lost customer. Good Bye, Hilton Los Angeles Universal Studio!";3
For a four-star reasonably expensive hotel this place offers no frills. It's in a great location, room and bed were clean and comfortable, staff were friendly. But note that the swimming pool is tiny, even by hotel standards. The Wi-fi, bottled water and hot drinks in your room are subject to expensive surcharges. I would recommend asking for a room above the 2nd floor as the streets were pretty noisy.;3
Let's begin with positives - location, location, location. Lincoln Center is literally across the street. We were going to the Met. Opera in the raging snow/rain storm and did not even get wet. Negatives:our superior king room for just under $500 (with taxes) per night was very small  with tiny bathroom.   The minimal furniture shows its age/use. It is adequate for two people, but luxury this is not.  Now do not get me wrong: this is New York. Real luxury probably cost ten times that and if you need a place to stay while exploring the city, Empire is fine, just do not call it luxury. We have travelled the world quite a bit and stayed in different places. Empire hotel will not be on the top of my list of hotels.   Bring ear plugs, pretty useful if you are a light sleeper like me.;3
Having read some of the reviews I was a little anxious about this Hotel but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised.  You have to remember that this is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for and thats why I rate as average however this could very well be an above average budget hotel as my experience of this type of accomodation is limited.  I booked a three bed room with private bathroom.  After I booked through a third party I emailed the hotel and asked that they confirmed my booking and within 12 hours Patrick replied which was very reassuring. When I checked in the receptionist was very pleasant as were all the reception staff.  The room was clean with crisp bedding and clean white towels on arrival. For me, that was all I required as my intention was to see NYC and;3
The main reason that I am giving this hotel 3 stars instead of 4 is that the room and bed were very tiny.  It was barely big enough for 2 people.  The room itself was nice, but it was small.  The complimentary breakfast was very good, even though they are very strict about people not leaving the dining room with food.  The gift shop was so-so, it was also rather small.  This was my first time in California and I did not realize that Hollywood was quite as run-down as it is.  However, the hotel is very close to the Vermont and Santa Monica station as well as it is on several bus-lines. Since we were traveling without a car, this was extremely helpful.  We were able to go to Hollywood Blvd and see the sites within minutes and able to go all the way to Beverly Hills and Santa;3
Just returned from a fab trip to the big Apple. Booked the New Yorker hotel through a travel agent. They seemed  to be impressed with this hotel. The foyer of this hotel is very grand and appears quite upmarket.  But that's where the grandness ends. On route to our room the carpets were scruffy fraying on the edges. Marble borders appeared grubby. Room was small but adequate. The bed was very comfy and pristine clean. The shower was a nightmare. Difficult to get it to the right temperature. Either scalding hot or freezing cold. Wasting valuable time trying to  get ready in the morning. Unable to shower one morning and had to make do with a top and tail wash.  Reported to reception and an engineer sent to fix the problem. This was no amends to me as I just wanted to be able to;3
"after reading the reveiws on here i was wary of what i might find ect. but i was pleasently surprised. the hotel was clean, loved the location as it was near little italy and the famous ""katz deli"" (where harry met sally"" the most fantastic food i have ever eaten and the subway was pretty much opposite. the staff were lovely. bit of 70's decor but was absolutly fine. people are far to picky for a budget hotel, will be coming back xx";3
We were in LA to see a concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre and this was perfect for that. The room was clean and had a great view, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great stay, but there were some issues:  - The hotel restaurant has a large buffet, most of which is left out in the open constantly. We were always walking past it, and I found it mildly disturbing that they left out shucked oysters and other seafood (covered in plastic wrap) when the buffet wasn't even open.   - We had an issue with taking a cab from the hotel. I know that this isn't the hotel's fault, but I feel like I should point it out because it was a cab that the hotel arranged (and we tipped them for!). The cab driver tried to pull the tourist scam on us by basically taking the;3
I'm not sure why TA still categorizes this establishment as a B&B/Inn ... You'd think someone would have awakened them to the discrepancy. Anyway, don't buy the hotel's hype about being recently remodeled. It still looks the same as when I stayed there almost a decade ago. Still, that makes me a repeat customer, so that's a vote of confidence. Best aspects: price and location, quiet rooms. Lousy aspect: no WiFi in rooms, which explains why the lobby teems with young, budget-conscious social networkers in the wee hours. You also cannot make toll-free calls from your room, but if you yell at them long enough they will unblock the phone or at least call the number for you and transfer it.;3
Good location in NYC (especially if you plan activities at Lincoln Center). Hotel a bit worn down. Breakfast average. Staff at the desk helpful.  Nice lobby and bar with late opening hours. Unfortunately rooftop only open summertime.;3
"Lili is a disgusting woman! I  dont know how she still works there. She's very unprofessional and feels very entitled. Unnecessarily aggressive even before I even walked up to her and when I checked her and put her in her place to show her you can't talk to me anyhow, she played the ""Karen"" card. Keep a close eye on her. She's not a good representation of The New Yorker AT ALL!";3
Stayed in Hollywood hotel for a few nights in late Jan/early Feb 14.  Rooms are clean and tidy however very basic.  Hotel itself needs a lick of paint however fir a cheap few nights it's ok.   Ideal for a short walk to the subway to get into Hollywood itself and do all the tourist stuff.  Be aware however the comedy club which is held downstairs is average and your probably better to stay in your room for an extra hour an tell knock knock jokes to the mirror.;3
I still don t know where they have the pictures from their room. The hotel is very simple and they DON'T offer breakfast!!  It is closed to Broadway and is quiet. Don t take the room next to the bathroom ..otherwise the guests may wake you up by shivering. The rooms and the beds are very old.;3
Last week (May'08) we visited NY City and stayed at the WooGo Hotel - Tempo Apartments.  Location was just great, half block away from Subway station, three blocks away from Central Park (south).  Overall our room (studio) was ok, but most say that we booked for a Studio with Queen bed and had gotten a Double one which made our staying harder when trying to get some rest after walking all day long. The room size was ok for us, it included a kitchenette and DVD/CD Stereo.  The bathroom was also ok but cleanliness not enough.  The floor has some marks on it that you could assume were from some time ago not been cleaned properly, same as in the room so, better not to be shoeless. Noise was a bad point too.  Some guests were having a dog into their room so they left it alone on it;3
This hotel is located in the heart of the Upper West Side, which is great. Unlike most Midtown hotels, you really get a chance to see what life is like for Manhattanites. The rooms are surprisingly spacious, but do not include private bathrooms (at least not the one I stayed in). This means you will be sharing with lots of other people, and by the end of the morning, it can be downright disgusting to go in there. I would definitely recommend shower sandles. Still, the price is right and the neighborhood is great, so if this is the only way you can afford it, it's still better than most hostels.;3
Well when we checked in for some reason our reservation was cancelled, we had to speak with a manager and it took hours before it was resolved, but it was only resolved because I had to forward them a copy of my confirmation. My room was super small and outdated. I just wan't happy with my stay at all.;3
"Clean, in a great location. Small room with a ""Queen size bed"", much smaller than typical, closet sized bathroom.  Having stayed at other  NYC hotels, will not be coming back to this one. I was here for a conference.";3
This hotel is in a perfect spot, near to time Square, and all the great landmarks.. The hotel is lovely inside and felt very safe,you have to show your room pass to get into a lift.. Very disappointed with the size of the room,not enough storage space,no chest of drawers to put underwear/t shirts, sink was tiny and useless if you use a flannel to wash..we were on 7th floor and didn't hear any traffic... Don't think I would stay here again,unless I had a bigger room with better storage..tick tock dinner was nice,but expensive..breakfast for 2was nearly Â£30!!!;3
"The one thing that the New Yorker Hotel has going for it is location. A subway stop right around the corner was ideal for us. Within walking distance of Times Square.  The issues: - Room size - which I believe is typical for most downtown NY City hotels - it is small. My spouse commented that we could fit the entire room, including closet and bathroom - into our master bedroom at home. Neutral rating.  - Expensive! With a 20% AAA discount - the room still ended up costing @ $400 a night after associated taxes and fees.  - Something that I complained about via the hotel's survey was the Wi-Fi capability. You will have a mandatory ""Facilities"" fee, which I believe covers the fitness center (we did not use), Wi-Fi coverage and possibly something else. I work in an IT shop at a";3
My stay at the Empire was o.k.  It's a nice quaint hotel with a boutiquish feel.  The rooms are small and the bathroom even smaller.  However the rooms are clean and comfortable.  I would stay here again for a one or two night stay.  It's convenient to Central Park and  a nice 10 to 15 minute walk to Times Square.   I enjoyed my stay.  It was no frills but nice.;3
My fiancÃ© and I stayed here for the night to spend the day in the city. Nothing fancy. There was a hole in my pillowcase, ceiling was broken, and there was a bit of dust on the furniture. However, it was the  perfect location, and the price was great considering it's in Manhattan. Nice size room as well,although we upgraded to a king room. Very difficult to find a size room like the one here, in the city. Definitely a perk. Staff was friendly, and helpful. A side note:  The roof top lounge hasn't been open since last year. So no roof top access. We were so disappointed, since it states they had s lounge up top. Overall it was a decent stay, just nothing special, but excellent price.;3
We had received a free two night stay after sitting through a 3 hour time share presentation on a previous stay.  We had to pay 60 a day for valet parking and taxes and fees for the two nights.  We had to use valet as my son was staying there as a NY arts study program student and we had to take a full car load back home.  They gave us a better room with a view of the Empire State Building and of Madison Square Garden.  This hotel is old and still had a lot of its old style attributes.  It's rooms are small.  The paint in the bath tub was peeling.  The windows were dirty and obstructed the views.  Everything was small and tight, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable for sleeping.  The tv had a bad connection.  I wish they offered a free breakfast.  I guess this is good;3
Decided on Days Hotel Broadway because it was cheaper than most other hotels being a bit away from the downtown area in ËNYC. But that wasn't a problem as the hotel is right at a subway station which is less than 5 minutes walk away. The convenience was a huge plus.  The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood in the Upper West Side with quite a few eating options and some stores where you can grab a few snacks and provisions. The hotel has definitely seen better days though and needs to spruce itself up a bit. The double room we got was comfortable and adequately sized with all the usual amenities and working Wi-Fi. The biggest issue with the room was that the water drained incredibly slowly in the bathtub.  Staff aren't particularly friendly but they did their jobs. The bigger;3
So, I have to stay where my company puts me and usually it's E55th, so tres tres excited I'm staying somewhere different...   Let me start by area.... it's so different and quite busy with tourists and locals alike, a couple of pharmacies and the bright lights of madison square gardens make for a welcome change.... there's an open air bar across the road, and a fantastic pizzeria exactly opposite! (Buffalo chicken pizza after a couple of beers... mmmmmm!)  But those were the positives... being a touristy hotel come the parties... my next door was loud - not just because they were, but because the walls were paper thin!!!!!!  Ok... ok... you can't change an historical building blah de blah de blah... but at least put some sort of soft door closing mechanism on each guest room!;3
Location was outstanding located in walking distance to central park. The staff (pasquale) were great. Rooms are small, air conditioning bad and hot water took long. The pool is a small lap pool fits 7 grown adults closes at 8pm because of the rooftop bar. The hotel amenities I give a 6, staff a 10, and location a 12.;3
small and old room. Bed to small. Cleaning Personal very friendly at the Reception not so. And altimes Controll when you entering the Hotel for the elevator 36th was great nice fiew direction freedom Tower.;3
Decent hotel, good location (though 8th Ave is a hub for homeless people constantly asking you for money). The room was pretty small and basic but itâs all we really needed given it was just a place to sleep at night. The only downside was that the duvet was insanely thin and the TV was quite blurry.   Check in was quick, they took my debit card and immediately took $300 ($100 for the facility fee which they keep and $200 for the security deposit which Iâm waiting to get back) which was a bit jarring but it is what it is - what i felt wasnât fair is that despite paying this facility fee it costed $30 PER DAY to use the coffee machine in the room which was just a basic machine with some plain coffee pods. It was also another $30 I think per day to have a mini fridge in your room,;3
Itâs not easy to find a reasonable priced decent room with en-suite bathroom in Manhattan. Therefore I felt happy when I found this place which I think itâs a good option if your wish is to sleep in the Big Apple.  The location is good and the area is safe. Subway line 1 has one stop at 103rd Street and another one at 110th Street, so both stations on Broadway are very close to 107th Street -a nice street by the way- where the hotel is. This area in the Upper West Side contains also many small businesses, cafes and restaurants (we tried, f.ex., âTropical Sensationâ, in Amsterdam Av. between 106th Street and 107th Street, âMamaâs Pizzeriaâ on the corner between Amsterdam Av. and 106th Street, and we heard good reports of âThe Manchester Dinerâ, on the corner between Broadway and;3
We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Astor on the Park as we were very satisfied.  After reading other reviews before travelling I was slightly nervous about staying here but soon realised that there was nothing to worry about.  We arrived at the hotel from Newark Airport at about 4.30pm.  We were greeted by a member of staff who took our luggage.   The reception area is not huge but then you do not spend your time sitting about in this area so its perfect for its use.  The polite reception staff asked if we would like to have 2 rooms next to each other and also asked if we would like to stay on a high floor.  This was great as we had asked the travel agent to request a Park view and we were not disappointed.  As others have stated the rooms are on the small side but;3
The rooms are perfectly pleasant but the WiFi cuts off constantly so if you're going there to work, forget it. There's no coffee maker in the room and very few other amenities-- it's pretty bare bones.;3
Thanks a lot to Mohamed on customer service we managed to upgrade our room to the suite, which what we wanted. The suite had two bathrooms as well as two rooms. The downside was the bedroom was a corner room and had windows overlooking two sides of the street hence this maximised amount of noise from the sirens at night (but i suppose it being NY this is expected). ALso, the bathroom had a bit droughty window and the sink did not drain very well. The air conditioner was working ok until one night it stopped and became very cold in the room (we managed to switch it back on alright). Otherwise, the beds were extremelly comfortable - the best beds i've ever slept in. ALso, the hotel is located in the centre of what we wanted to do as it was very close to the undeground station and;3
Hotel is in a great location.  Our room was 4 hours late, and then the room we got had broken air conditioner.  Staff was nice and moved us to another room, but it smelled like mildew because the ventilation in the bathroom seems to be non-existent.  Air conditioner super old in that room too.  Paint in the bathroom is beginning to peel, likely due to the humidity.    Otherwise, bed was comfortable and staff was generally nice, but we would have expected them to be more proactive in resolving the issues which required no less than 4 visits/phone calls to the front desk.  We did get breakfast comped one day (after we asked for it), but even that took a long time to get approved by the back office.;3
The hotell has the location and nice staff but what brings it down is the sofa bed (it is supposed to have a mattress but it can not be called a mattress) and the other negative part is the rip off on the break fast. The breakfast is nice but charging you 30 dollars for a buffet is hefty and on top of that putting the age limit at 10! The hotell should change the bed sofas and put at least 12 as age limit (or 14 in my eyes).   From the hotel to Universal it is only 7-8 minutes walk, an ok pool to relax in after a day at Universal was nice, the staff is really friendly and nice, 28 dollars for self parking is understandable due to demand but still hits you.;3
Excellent location for me. Comfortable bed and de luxe room. The regular room was really bad! Clean nice bathrooms, room well serviced. Elevators, only one out of 4 went to my floor!!!;3
This is a basic three star hotel (towards the lower end of the 3 star range).  I personally do not know how people would give it 4 or 5 stars.  The hotel is a renovated Ramada Inn, located in an older area of Hollywood, that has seen better days.  The area is not the prettiest, but is far from dangerous.  It is the commercial strip of a working class/immigrant section.  There are some homeless people, but that has been an unfortunate trend all over Los Angeles (and the country) as of late.    The hotel is pretty centrally located, basically within 30 minutes of anywhere you would want to go as a tourist (except Disneyland, which is actually in Anaheim in Orange County, about an hour away).  The Walk of Fame in Hollywood, Rodeo Drive Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Malibu, Melrose;3
Donât get placed next to the gym If you want decent sleep. Had loud banging past 11pm and starting at 6am. Breakfast was good, the room service dinner was ok for the price. Was expecting better for how much we spent. Shuttle was very nice.;3
Hotel is very 'interesting' with it's past history and previous guests,but the daily extras are a bit steep compared to others in the vicinity. Location is excellent and staff friendly. Our room was a bit small and the view wasn't exactly anything to write home about, but I guess what you pay for.;3
We spent 11 days here in September and It was a nice stay.  Overall, the room was huge and more than enough for a family of five, but the rooms (and rest of the hotel for that matter) is tired and needs a massive renovation.  The staff seemed quite rude most of the time and only seemed interested in helping if you were going to tip them, plus I heard a lot of people complaining at the front desk.  The location is right in the middle of midtown and right next to Penn station so this saved a lot on taxis.;3
Yes, its not the best area, but really where is in this area? Its close and convenient to the Hollywood sites, and offers decent nightly rates compared to other hotels in the area. The hotel is clean and quiet for the most part. Nothing fancy, noticeable areas of improvement, but comfortable. They charge almost $20 for parking in their gated lot, which was a bit disappointing, but the complimentary breakfast made up for it. A lot of items to choose from, including an made to order omelet bar. They said they have a bar but it didn't open until 6pm so we weren't able to check it out.;3
Stayed one night for business.  Good location near by business site (and Fordham law school).  The hotel has been under construction, so the entrance wasn't impressive.   The room is small (at least  by general standard. Maybe average for NYC).  There is a small gym in the basement. No restaurant on site so you have to go out to find food which is a negative for me.  Staff is generally very friendly though.  Overall, not much complaint.  Not wowed by it either.;3
The Jane's location can not be beat.  The front staff is friendly and helpful.  There is lots of character in both the guests and the hotel.  A trendy club is in the same building along with a french style cafe.  The room's were to be expected, all i was looking for was a rack to crash on and a shower to freshen up.  The room I had did have an interesting smell, this was fixed by opening the window (yes it was winter time, but i did not know how to control the heat so it all worked out well).  Overall if you are looking for a cheap place to crash in a trendy area, this cannot be beat. Points off for the smell and that this is not a place for luxury.;3
Concierge was the best. Check out the tick rock restaurant in lobby for 24 hour breakfast and bagels. Felt safe with security at elevator. Room was smaller than most And basically had room to walk around the bed and get into bathroom. Bathroom old and paint on woodwork was peeling. For the location it was ok and it does have the Art Deco feel.;3
If you know the pool will not be in service, you should let reservation holders know and help rebook if desired, this did not happen. Shame on Hyatt! I was traveling with a teen and this would have changed out desire to stay.;3
I had a one night stay this week at the Empire Hotel, and the room was sweltering at Noon when I checked in.  I closed the shade thinking the room may cool off before the evening, but not so.  The AC is OLD and rusty, barely blowing at all. They really need to update this.  You get what you pay for, I guess!  The front desk folks were great.;3
Although this hotel is clean and tidy the facilities are much to be desired. The swimming pool is tiny and there are very few sun loungers, I ended up having to lie on the grass. It is close to a few underground station which is good as there is nothing to do anywere near the hotel.;3
Kept me for nearly two hours saying that they have not received the credit card payment . I couldnât do my Big Bus tour because of that . Was staying only one night in NY. Hence it was big time lost for me. Guest service and facilities you canât even compare for what you get in my city ...Dubai;3
Room was comfortable but in need of upgrade.  Location near Lincoln Center can't be beat.  Don't get breakfast in the restaurant, though.  Hot buffet was cold and overpriced.  Appears the improvements to physical plant are in progress.;3
Good side:  Staff at reception desk are very helpful and responsive! Though they don't look warmly all the time!  Location is very convenient for us to walk through to the Lincoln centre(just across the street)!  Room is not very spacious as what we've been told, but very cosy and clean! Got upgraded for one of the rooms that we booked, which is good, but the room is still not very spacious, can't imagine how small the room is if not upgraded  Bad side: Bathroom is super small, with toilet tied up next to the wall, you can imagine how uncomfortable it is! Shower area is only equipped with a shower curtain, which is not very convenient! Got charged for USD244/night (taxes included) but don't offer free wifi and breakfast is a bit expensive, not good value for money if you compare;3
"Itâs generally ok as a hotel. The staff are friendly, quite efficient and the location is great.   Rooms are quite small, and there is no hanging space. I had to swop rooms as the first room they offered the window didnât open and there was a fridge in the middle of the doorway. Very odd.   The biggest issue at this place is noise. Not from the street, from the 500 air con units that blast all day and all night. You have two options; sleep with your window open and hear the noise, or boil as the hotel air con doesnât work all that well.   Showers are ok, housekeeping is fine and the place is clean enough. I guess my issue is that this cost Â£300 a night and just wasnât good value at all.";3
It the standard you would expect from a Hilton hotel. Rooms were a good size, quiet, and we slept very well. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great location of visiting Universal Studios, only a short walk away. There is a takeaway coffee and pastry counter located past the main breakfast counters if you want a lighter, and less expensive, breakfast.;3
The Empire is a good hotel in a great location, with helpful staff. Close to the Lincoln Centre and Columbus Circle, plus easy access to all of Manhattan and its delights BUT they charge $12.95 per day per item for inroom wifi. You can use free wifi in reception, but who wants to teapse back diwn to reception everytime you need to check and address, or email family or book tickets. In the room they charge you for water, coffee etc, etc.   After two weeks travelling to Toronto, Cleveland, Pholidelphia and Vermont, where all the hotels provided free in-room wifi and water, this really annoyed me. I have stayed in New York before and NEVER had to pay for wifi before. Come on , Empire Hotel, join the 21st century and give geusts free wifi. Then i would give you five stars.;3
a little late revewing but after reading a couple of recent reports i wanted to agree and post a note on my experience in December 2011. We were amongst the unlucky guests to be put on a high floor looking out at a brick wall and other guests in their rooms opposite.  You can see everything so you have to keep the curtains shut? Roasting alive each night whilst listening to the roaring noise from the air con outside our windows.  Nothing wrong wtih the hotel in particular.  Just think i could have done a lot better for the money i paid and didnt like it at all?  Felt like a night club on entry to the hotel with the dark dingy decor.  Struggled to see in my room whilst getting ready each day.  Travelled with my 2 teenage sons who developed a rash from their beds? Have stayed in;3
Bed was good, room was quiet and small, bathroom was clean, location was good.  We had a room looking at Central Park and the dirtiest window I have ever seen in my life!  The hotel has seen better days.;3
You can't beat the location and the price is attractive as well.  The lobby is trendy but could use a little updating.  The beds are terrific but the heating system in the room is so NOISY it was hard to sleep.  It would cycle on and off every 10 min and it was annoying in both of the rooms we had.;3
Arrived after a horrendous experience with immigration at JFK ,4 hours in a queue to get through,had room on the 19th floor looking down to 35th Street ,room very small ( expected for NY) and very dated,bathroom also tired,no storage,toilet flush very loud,talking about noise it honestly sounded like the window was open the amount of outside noise you got in the room from car horns and sirens.one last gripe was the bag storage,we had a late flight and had to store our bags,were charged $5 a bag,I have NEVER been charged at a hotel before and we travel regularly,a final insult !! On the plus side and why it got a 3,location good ,next to Penn station ,Hudson yard and time Square a short walk,staff nice and maid did a good job. On last observation on new York as a whole was the;3
Despite some of the negative reviews on here, we decided to stay at the Ramada Hollywood/Universal. We arrived before check in time, and the very efficient desk clerk had someone check to see if our room was ready, and it was.    The room was what we expected, nothing special, but it was clean, serviceable, and perfect for our needs, as we only intended to sleep and shower there. It would be nice if guests could better regulate the HVAC system, but it wasn't a huge inconvenience.  The room showed signs of having been recently painted/wallpapered, and the bathroom was clean, and there were always extra towels.  Our second day we arrived back to find a new microwave and refrigerator in our room!  The desk clerk informed us they were putting them in every room.  We had a nice view;3
Just returned from a 4 night stay. As everyone mentions, Location is fantastic, close to Time square, and Penn Subway Station on 34th. Also less than 5 min walk to Port Authority Bus Station on 8th Ave. Room (on floor 27) was dated, as was every area we were in (corridors etc, and our friends floor on 24). However it was clean. The housekeeping staff do a good job. Rooms a small, but this was to be expected. One issue we had was the temperature of the shower, it was extremely hot. On the first two mornings we tried everything to control this, on the 3rd day we reported it as it was actually too hot to stand under....and by this stage we were only turning on the COLD tap. We reported this issue. Reception staff assured us they would send an engineer. On our final morning,;3
I like this hotel. Nice room design. Very comfortable. Interesting lobby/bar area. A great, attentive doorman.   That said, I will probably never go again. The design of the bathrooms is probably the worst I have seen in an NYC hotel. The is NO FAN! The sink is shallow and the faucet so low, you can barely fit hands under to wash.   And, pet peeve of almost every American hotel... the Heat/AC system. You cannot close the curtains without completely covering it! How useless is that!!  Sigh.;3
"First off, I don't know what these people are talking about that think the staff is unfriendly or unhelpful. I feel like they did a pretty great job considering. Definitely didn't seem like a staff of people that completely didn't care, or shook down old ladies. That being said...   Pro's -   The area - One block from the 96th stop. That is a convenient stop to get anywhere further downtown. Also, there are some bars/restaurants/delis in the area. Some things closed a bit early for NYC but there was always an option.   The staff - I didn't see any problem with them at all. I thought they were quite friendly and helpful. The only thing that upset me off was the attempted up sell of a ""quiet room with things that worked (wifi)"" for an extra $60/night. I get that they are just";3
The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is walking distance to almost everything. We stayed 11 nights. The rooms are small, there is no space to open the suitcase and wardrobe is very, very small so you have to keep some of your clothes in the suitcase. The rooms are not very clean. When we came we found a hair in the bathtub. The worst thing about this hotel is staff in the lobby. They are so rude and not helpfull at all. In the lobby you can buy coffee and pastries. Coffee is 5 dollars.  So you can have breakfast in the lobby. On the ground floor there is a Tick Tock restaurant, donât go there. Across the street is Starbucks and McDonaldâs. The taxi from JFK to the hotel is flat rate 52 $ plus tip. Penn station is 1 minute from the hotel, so you can use public;3
I found this hotel after looking for a cheap place to stay in Manhattan.  It is rundown and has minimal services. The hallways and stairways are shabby and the elevator was more hassle than it was worth but our room was clean and roomy and our sheets were not dirty despite what other reviews report. The room had a fridge, air conditioner sink and TV, all relatively new and functional. The communal bathrooms are old but basically clean and functional, except for one of the toilets on our floor that was backed up for a day but the second one was still functioning and not at all busy. The laundry is in the dingy basement and requires lots of coins. Having said all that we barely did anything but sleep in the room as it is Manhattan after all.  It is a great neighbourhood with easy;3
I stayed in this Hyatt property for one night because of a transit in the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  Check-in is below-par.   No sign in checking I am a Globalist and do not tell me the benefit of a Gloablist even I told the Staff it is the first time I stayed in this hotel, till I asked what the benefits of a Globalist are in this hotel.  I also found that my card cannot access the Regency Club the next morning and I need to come to the front desk to request for it.   Also I only know I would have a complimentary bottle of water when I filled in the hotel survey after the stay.   Lastly, my preference on high floor is not honored.  I understand I check-in at 2:30am PT that maybe many floors were occupied, but why don't the Staff simply tell me that the high floor;3
Facility charges don't make sense, feels like a tricky way to up room price and not clear during shopping for a hotel room. Be prepared to pay more as you check in / out. Love the location yet the room didn't have much room to move very small it looked bigger online when I made the reservations.;3
Arrived late evening for a four night stay and was told the payment was cash only. Was directed to the closest atm which was the station a few mins walk ( where we'd just come from). Booked dbl private room w ensuite. Room is small but neat and looks clean. Own set of crockery n cutlery ontop of small fridge. Disapointed no kettle though.  Bathroom v small but shower hot and soap &towels supplied. Small cafe at reception if u want a snack or coffee. Pay for internet.;3
Stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip, but my wife & 1yr old son joined me for the trip:  > Location - good - being with a toddler, having Lincoln Center right across the street was a life-saver - had him running around the fountain - also close to Central Park.  Not a whole ton of restaurants / bars in the immediate vicinity but walk a few blocks north / south and you'll be able to find more options.  > Service - good - helpful & friendly staff  > Rooms - overall, a bit run down - furniture / bed was fine - but floor / bathroom / AC unit needs an upgrade.   Overall, good stay. Definitely swing by the roof top bar for a drink.;3
Arrived with very friendly reception staff, went to room 2715 which was so small, no view, brown and dark decor dusty and mould in the bath. So disappointed! We got moved to 2818 which was better. Shame the furniture is brown and dated, really needs to be modernised. Still no view but apparently a metro queen view room is what I have (a wall). Bed comfy. The lifts are always slow, I don't think they all work at one time. One guy said he was waiting 20 min for the lift thd other day, when it did arrive we went from floor 28 to 1 to 30 then every floor down! It was so hot and busy. The hotel is very dated, the hall ways are old fashioned, very noisy outside which you can hear all night. Very surprised you don't even get tea or coffee facilities in the room. I personally won't stay;3
Hotel was ok, needs some tlc refurbishment. Advertises free wifi but only in the lobby not privacy of ones room. Doormen were great other staff were satisfactory, it was ok, wouldn't rush back to stay;3
The location of the hotel is great but there is no elevator in the hotel and the rooms are extremely small. Recenthly renovated, nice bed and towels, clean, but in most rooms there are not even closets to put your clothes that makes it impossible to stay for longer than a weekend. The staff is very friendly and helped us with suitcases but didn't seem to know much about the area and ways to move around. However, they were willing to print out quides for the MET and MOMA when asked.;3
Wow! This place has no soundproofing! If you are a light sleeper or just like a peaceful atmosphere, I would not suggest staying here! You can hear every voice outside like they're right next to you and every flush of a toilet sounds like it should be physically in the room with you it's so loud! The benefit of this hotel is it's very centrally located - close to the train station and easily walkable to everywhere! Additionally, the lobby is gorgeous. Probably wouldn't stay here again!;3
Convenience is the biggest selling point if you're planning a visit to Universal Studios.  We got an exciting view of Hogwarts Castle.    The hotel's lobby is a little dated.  We didn't try the hotel's food but there are lots of options around the area.  There's a shuttle to take you to the park.    Pretty standard.  Clean.;3
"Small rooms, poor air conditioner  Great location and seems to be a popular hotel. The bathroom in my single queen size was cramped.  You can't close the door while seated on the toilet. The shelf where you had to put your toiletries was over the toilet so you had to be careful that nothing fell of the shelf.  The sink drainage was very poor so it was easy to overflow if you didn;t watch it.";3
The Astor on the Park was a basic hotel with minimal facilities (i.e. TV, Cd Player, fresh towels daily, pay per minute internet)  Out of all the receptionists we met during our 4 day stay, not one had a kind word or even a hint of a smile. They were rather unhelpful when we asked about money exchange and directed us incorrectly down the wrong street. The concierge was friendly but we soon realised he worked on commission based sales of trips so we ended up stalking, navy seal style through reception on a morning to avoid him.   Taxis to the hotel were a fortune so we ended up staying in at night with a bed picnic of beer and Reese's Cupakes. The bed was comfy but I think there may have been some health and safety issues regarding the heating. The on/off dial was ancient and red;3
We were two from Norway living there 5 nights for vacation. The location is good close to central park, Rockefeller center and two underground stations. Several resturants and shops near by. The style inside seems to be from the 1970's in mainly dark brown. The room was OK. Two large beds filled up the room making it a bit tight. The shower was dificult to use.;3
Booked 7 nights here to celebrate our wedding anniversary so booked a room with a view. On check in we were told the room had a fabulous view so imagine our disappointment on entering the room to find a view of an office opposite. The room was also quite small. Staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay as hotel is also very well located with easy access to metro and many areas on foot.;3
I loved the setting and the atmosphere in this historical building. The location is great and there is a nice bar in the hotel. However, you have to note that the rooms could be really really small - shoe box size.;3
Read all the reviews and thought it sounded cool.  The room was actually bigger than I expected--it is NYC after all.  But the goods news stopped there.  Heat was not controllable --its either on or off and the 'engineer' turned it off but we had to turn on the air conditioner to be able to sleep.  And the AC was a ferocious noise--not fixable.   The front desk staff was too into talking to each other to spend any time expeditiously helping guests--from help finding starbucks , to finding a gym off site (no work out facilities on site) to getting a taxi to late check out--it was all too much trouble.  Sigh  So although it was only (?) $350 for the night it was not worth it. A bright note the Cafe G is open all day and the food is quite nice--service good.;3
My teenage daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks over Xmas & New Year period. It was a basic hotel but was clean and comfortable. Our room was cleaned on a daily basis. The beds were OK.  We were up on the fourth floor  and away from the lifts (so it was pretty quiet) facing the street and had a view of the park across the road. The location was fantastic with only minutes walking to Soho and Little Italy. Subway was just across the road and it was so easy to get anywhere in Manhattan in a short time. The staff were always courteous and polite and ready to assist us when required. The only issue we had while staying here was the free wifi was non existant in our room for 4 days/ nights of our stay and staff were unable to fix the problem. No coffee maker, microwave or;3
Despite the surly receptionist this is a reasonable hostel. Heating on permanently even in 25 degree heat! The place is fairly clean, plenty of toilets and showers and reasonable communal areas. Bring ear plugs as walls are thin and if you're in a shared dorm you'll probably meet some... Interesting... People.;3
We originally booked a standard double queen room. The room was small and dark it was also on the 11th floor near the lift, which after the 1st night realised it was the floor to the rooftop bar. Lots of noise of people going back to rooms from the bar and had loud noise of fans or generator outside. We asked for a different room and with the wonderful assistance given by Danny at reception, decided to upgrade to a king size on 8th floor. Well worth the upgrade the room was very light and spacious (no comparison to the double queen box room). Great shower plenty of hot water and good WiFi. The room was at the side of the building with view of the Plaza. The only strange thing was that the cheaper room provided a coffee machine and free bottles of water which was not provided in;3
So I'll start by saying the hotel has tons of potential, but it feels held back because of the price you pay for the location, the bathrooms are very cramped and noticed odd smells, the beds are way more firm than expected, and overall it was a good experience with everything except the actual room.;3
This place was just what i expected from the reviews!! it was run down and old and just perfect for the money and what we needed.... We found the room was clean and did not smell. The bathroom was large and clean, we never had to wait for the bathroom.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe. An easy walk to the subway.  I would have no problem staying here again. HOLLY BRYAN FORT WORTH TEXAS;3
Great restaurants, teeny room, no view, excellent mattress, great location - this historic (old) hotel needs a renovation so this is a mixed review.  No 2 rooms are alike, many don't have a coffee maker.  It seemed clean & our chamber maids were attentive to our needs.  The location & hotel restaurants make this worth consideration.;3
I stayed at Astor on the Park for the Columbia University graduation ceremonies.  I used Expedia but where they show the stars and price but hid the name.  Graduation week also was the week before Memorial Day and all the hotel prices were charging a premium.  The location was the best amenity for this hotel.  It was walking distance to Columbia University, the subway, buses, and across from Central Park.  Nearby there were lots of restaurants and a small grocery store.  I was in Room 504 which had nothing wrong with it, though the room was small and cramped as one would expect in NYC.  The room, furniture and bathroom looked like it was recently renovated.  They provided a hair dryer, shampoo, soap and conditioner.  There was a large flat screen tv, but I didn't even turn it;3
Overall was good, bedding needs improvement.  No fitted sheets, everything is just tucked in â¦ comforter keeps coming apart. Shower water pressure is terrible.  Can not enjoy showering with that kind of water pressure.;3
The cabin rooms really are tiny but it's nicely designed so that it's not a problem. The staff are friendly and helpful. The problem with the compact layout is you can't help but overhear the other guests (at least on the sixth floor);3
For the money and the location, I felt the room was good.  It was clean, small but workable.  The shower door leaked causing water to get all over the bathroom floor, but was easy to clean up.  The city was surprisingly quiet late night.  My biggest problem was no elevator.  Not the hotel for you if climbing three flights of stairs with a suitcase is a problem.  The staff was nice, but couldn't make local food recommendations.  Parking across the street was reasonable as well.;3
The hotel is just across the street from Lincoln Center.  It's not luxurious, but it's been renovated in the past decade, and the rooms, while very small, are completely serviceable.;3
Spent 4 nights in the New Yorker with my small family and the reaction is mixed, to be honest. An old style art deco hotel in a run down area in the city. Reception was brusque and jot too welcoming, eventually our booking was found and  we got room key. Clearly there is a need for a lot of security due to surrounding area inhabited by a disturbingly large amount of homelessness. Room was small (as expected in NY) and needs updating. Beds were poor, bathroom very very small. Diner attached to hotel was welcoming, friendly and food & service was decent. Hallways and general areas of hotel needs a face-lift, but was still packed with people,mainly people going to gigs in MSG across the road. Don't think we would stay in this hotel or this area of NY again, which is a shame as its;3
The neighborhood is nice. It has pharmacies, supermarkets and cafes nearby. The metro is about five minutes walking. The staff is friendly . It has free wifi in the lobby area. The room was small and clean. My only complain is the mattress, it was noisy and felt like sleeping on a hammock;3
Positives:  Good location, close to central park, close to subway station, starbucks and mini mart close by.  Friendly staff, pleasant roof top bar for a relaxing drink.  Negatives: dark inside, torn carpets, hall stairs not particularly clean, small pool on roof with dirty water.  Bathrooms were incredibly small, very compact and a hazard as whilst opening the door to get out no where to manoeuvre, a trip hazard, hurt myself whilst getting out.  The cost of the water in the room is $5 per bottle, we bought 2 cold bottles from Starbucks below for $4.50.  They charge if you use a coffee pod in the room at $3 per pod, most hotels in America offering free coffee in room.    We booked a 2 night stay here in August, we booked a Superior room with 2 double beds, the room was not very;3
Full disclosure, this property wasn't a first choice for us, but the location to Universal and areas we wanted to visit were key to our decision to stay at this property. The rooms were surprisingly spacious and a good value, but there were several service and maintenance issues that should be addressed. We had to call Engineering twice- once to fix our shower due to lack of hot water and once to fix the safe which malfunctioned locking our belongings inside. Often we would call Room service or areas within the hotel with no answer at all, and would resort to calling the manager at the front desk to connect us. The service at the restaurant was really inattentive- we had to ask for coffee and water several times before the waiter would bring them. When we checked in we were;3
I was fine with the accoidations, but I would not like my wife to stay here.  If you are looking to stay for little money this place is great.  Not that many ammenities, but close to the subway to get anywhere in town. I felt very safe in the neighborhood.  Very upscale part of town.  I would stay here again anytime.;3
This hotel could be SO much better then it is.  The elevators don't work half the time for 2 years now.  The bar you have a drink is FREEZING!  they leave the doors open and all the need to do is close them.;3
problem for a family with children to eat at the hotel restaurant was a big problem, poor service - no refills, had to ask twice, forgot a item we ordered - didn't receive until we where finished with our meal  the rest of our stay was very good, clean rooms, nice staff;3
"I stayed in one of the single cabins and while this was perfect for what I needed (great value, great location and awesome service), it's still important to note that this is a budget option. Funky, quirky and full of charm but budget none-the-less.   Imagine a private dorm-room in a hostel -- that is your cabin. It was small but adequate; not the most modern in the world but not dirty like some reviews suggest. The air-con was rather noisy which was a little annoying as I needed it to sleep and the hallway had people coming and going but that could happen anywhere and it was a Friday and Saturday night.  The staff were ridiculously helpful at all times which was great.  The location on a cobbled street overlooking the Hudson is really beautiful and its really close to great";3
The best thing about this hotel was that we got a complimentary upgrade which was a very pleasant surprise! That made the price very appealing, but I think it was high $200's for one night for the original room I chose.  The bed was huge and comfy, the bathroom was nice...everything was clean.  The rooms are small- couldn't have imagined the other size of original room!  The rooftop was fun although if was a quiet night, but we were there on our own party so it was fine! The location is great! Minimal interaction with staff, but was pleasant.  Sadly, and I kind of found it hard to believe it was fully booked on a weekday, we couldn't add an additional night.... The lobby is fun, impressionable to walk into.  I didn't pay much attention to remember little details like wifi or if;3
The rooms were adequate and clean.  Hotel is old and in dire need of updating.  Elevators were dirty with trash inside them.  Doormen do not open doors. They just stand around.  Taxi called for us charge more than the metered cabs which we did not know ahead of time.  They also do not accept credit card cards--only cash..;3
The hotel is located perfectly for a stay in New York - 34th and 8th. Very easy to get to from the airport if you do the train - right next to Penn Station. The hotel lobby looks amazing. Check-in was fine. Hotels in New York have a very varied selection of 'additional' taxes that can come as a surprise. My room was on the 19th floor - small - a bit dated but clean and comfortable. No view! Housekeeping staff were very friendly. There is a 24hr diner attached to the hotel - Tick Tock - OK, what you expect from an American diner. Wi-Fi was ok - needed to log in each day. I had roaming on 4G so didn't really need Wi-Fi. Check-out was fine and the hotel will keep bags for a couple of dollars if your flight is late in the day.;3
We do not generally stay in Hostels, but I decided to book this place as a one night stop over to see a show at the Apollo which was in walking distance.  We had a private room and bathroom and I have to say, it was very clean and bright.  Unfortunately, there was no TV and they were single beds, but it was better than I have heard other Hostels to be.;3
The room was tiny, dated, smelled weird and there was LOTS of noise from outside which was obviously due to the fact that it was built a long time ago and didn't have much soundproofing. I got a great rate, though, so I guess it made up for it. When I say tiny, I mean there wasn't enough room in the bathroom for my toiletries and not really space to put them elsewhere in the room, either. You also couldn't open drawers in the mini dresser because the full sized bed was in the way. And there was barely even a place to put the ironing board! My entire floor had a musty smell to it that was clearly being attempted to be covered by air freshener. Note: You have to show your room key to get up to your room, so always be prepared to do so. The lobby is spectacular, which is quite;3
Great location in central Manhattan, walking distance to many sights and easy access to metro, Time Square, Broadway, Empire State, Macy's etc. Our room was very tired and lacked space. Shower was adequate but not up to expected standards of today's hotels. Tick Tock diner was good for a meal or breakfast.;3
"When I checked in I was told that my room was ""much bigger"" than I'd originally reserved and had an ""empire state"" view. Much bigger seems to be a little deceptive since the room was very cramped feeling, right down to the half sized desk where you could only pull the chair up to the end. There were narrow paths around the beds and that was the ONLY open space in the room. The dresser/desk combo was metal framed and looked pretty industrial (old not chic). The bathroom was also small and was tiled in 4 inch square tile like that used in the '60s. I wonder what color it originally was because it was PAINTED white. Very surprised to see that a hotel renovated the bathrooms by painting over the old ceramic tile.   Worse yet, NO COFFEE in the room. I suppose there wasn't much room";3
Older hotel in a good location right by Lincoln Center and a subway stop (Route 1 train).  There are some nice restaurants within a block, as well as a movie theatre across the street.  I booked via Priceline for 1 night and was alone, so the tiny room was adequate for me but certainly not for a couple.  The room was clean with updated decor and a good heating system, but I did have to get the low water pressure fixed, and lighting is not good if you need to work at a desk.  Lobby looked great but there was a bad odor around the elevator bank on the Sunday I checked in.  It was gone Monday when I checked out but I've not run into that issue before at a big hotel.   NET: I would not seek out this hotel but it's certainly adequate with a good price deal.;3
Well i was very excited about staying in this hotel as you may or may not know it was the main hotel in Gossip Girl!!  I stayed in the empire for 4 nights, i arrived late on check in and was giving an up grade which was a great start to my cheeky holiday, i got a king sized room with a front view window, overlooking the Lincoln center. Like i said in the title the location is quality, you are 2 mins (well in and around) walk from all the major tourist attractions, shops and bars!  The hotel itself is very costly!! you have to pay for everything. There is no such thing as free wifi! I had to pay for 3 days wifi in the hotel which cost me around 29$.  The room was great, it was spacious and well decorated, but i was afraid to touch anything in case i was charged! In the room was;3
Got a family suite based off of pictures on hotels website. Great location, excellent staff, the room on the other hand was severely lacking.  Half the size of what was pictured on the intenet and the bathroom was pretty busted and could use a refresh.;3
Other than the lovely women working the breakfast area, (EXCELLENT full service breakfast included) this staff needs retraining.   I actually had a busboy rudely and loudly (embarrassing me in front of a room full of people) try to stop me from taking my ill husband a small bowl of cereal, some fruit, and a juice, upstairs to him. His arrogance was unheard of in someone in such a position.   The maintenence worker who came to fix the lack of hot water in our room (which turned out to be a ten minute lag) rudely said 'what, this not hot enough for you?' When it was luke warm. I learned to run the sink and tub for ten minutes prior to getting in the shower.   The beds needs new mattress pads badly, and comfortors that don't weigh a ton.  The halls are very loud, and the hotel is;3
This hotel is in a great location right by Central Park.  The hotel looked vey nice with a lovely Mezzanine floor where you can sit quietly though it can get crowded.  There is WiFi but if you use it in your room it is charged!  The room was good and the bed comfy and very clean.  The bathroom was good too.  We didn't dine in the hotel but did drink in the bar and it was fine.  Disappointed that thee were no facilities for brewing in the room and the charge of $8 + for a small bottle of water was I thought extortionate.  But for this the score would have been higher.;3
Location is ideal for Lincoln Center performances.  But several things made it seem like less than a first class hotel.  Elevators stark and uninviting.  WiFi not available in room unless willing to pay $10 per day per device.  Kerig coffee machine in room but a charge of $3 per cup.  On the other hand, Housekeeping and engineering staff very prompt and courteous in addressing a request.  But the lack of amenities made it feel like a second class hotel and in that location, with a little effort, it could be the idea choice. But  I will look for an alternative next time I am in town.;3
Superb location. Lincoln Center, 66th St subway and Columbus nearby. Rooms are very small and heating is always on even when it is not required, had to regulate by opening window which is not ideal when outside temperatures were low.Very little storage inside the room, nowhere to put our cases, we had to rearrange the furniture to put them out of our way. Some nice restaurants close by, J Clarks & The Smith, Starbucks as well. Ed's Chowder house inside the hotel is good but a bit pricey, $90 for 2 breakfasts. Lunch menu is better for value. Staff are very nice and helpful, the hotel was really busy with it being New Year. Main areas are tired and dimly lit, lighting in the rooms is not great either.;3
"Beware for 'specials': they still total what the original price is. Location is great, the staff is wonderful. the hotel, past the entry, is very poorly decorated, run-down. Tiny room ($750/2 nights!), a bathroom too small to change your mind in and a 'view of the courtyard....' which doesn't exist. (Room 910) Temp set for 78Âº day which could not be changed. Enormous equipment noise with the window open for air, stifling when closed.  I was told, by phone, that parking, 'all in' was $55/24hrs no in/out. Understood. At check out we were told it was over $150 incl taxes. ""Do you remember the name of the person on the phone you spoke with (last week)?"". I thought I did, but that doesn't make it not true! A typical evasive way to deal with this. Yes, I travel a great deal globally";3
Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful. Our toilet plugged the very first day, and they fixed it very quickly. Our only complaint was the noise outside our door from the hallway at night. Voices seemed very loud, and someone was puking in the hallwaythe second night we were there.  However, the beds were pretty comfortable. We only lost a little sleep.;3
Arrived at hotel just before 10pm on a Thursday for a 2night stay. Luckily we were able to pull the car over in front of a fire hydrant to unload-otherwise there is nowhere to unload. My husband checked in and asked where to park as we had been told when we booked that there were several nearby garages. Staff told him garages were closed now and he would have to find a spot on the street. They did not suggest where to go to have the best chance of finding parking. Luckily my husband travels a lot and did ok driving around in the congestion to find a spot but I could see where this could be a very stressful situation for many if you thought you were going to park in a garage. Hotel is dated and rooms/elevators are very small. Room was clean. Room info said there was an ice;3
This is a lovely hotel our room was very clean and the Tick Tock Diner was perfect for eating and drinks at very reasonable prices. The only downside was the noise from outside there seemed to be building work going on all through the night drilling and machinery plus sirens from either ambulance or police cars blaring out even though roads were pretty empty. Paid extra for a room with a view which looked out over Penn station which was a waste of money but didnt spil our break;3
Our stay was quite OK here, no mouses in the room, and we got clean towels to the room everyday. We used the room to sleep, and agree with others that its nice that the subway is close. We got what we paid for and generally are happy about it.  However I have to be disappointed to the fact that I never got my keys back that I left to the room. A man told me over the phone that they were found, but didn't know how to arrange the delivery. I contacted the hotel manager as he suggested, and he seemed like he's going to take care of it, just asked me to email my address to him. They probably aren't anymore in the lost and found but in trash, and despite my call and two emails, I never got any response to them. Even a fact that it for some reason would not be possible to post them;3
I am a Hilton Gold member and stayed on a 2 night pleasure trip.  The rooms are nice, spectacular view on upper floors, great housekeeping, nice and quiet except for some distant freeway hum.  But charges for everything: internet, valet parking, even per minute charges if you use the computer at the business center.  Very poor service at the restaurant for breakfast.  Slow front desk service.  Strange short sheeting on the beds, you have to re-do them if you are tall.  Odd location up the hill, convenient for Universal Studios but that's about all.;3
Whilst sitting in a great location the hotel feels tired and not as good as expected.   The reception staff were functional rather than welcoming.   The concierge was very abrupt.   Most of the staff didnât live up to the usual American friendliness experienced elsewhere in New York.  Having mentioned we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and booked four rooms I was disappointed that even though guest relations had requested an upgrade of our room, when we checked in they decided to give the upgraded room to my son and not my wife and I.;3
My family enjoyed our stay at the Hollywood Hotel, We stayed for 4 nights while we explored the town. The staff was friendly, the breakfast was good, my girls loved the homemade waffles every morning but I wish they had a bigger variety of fruit. The location was great! Short driving distance to many tourist areas and super easy to get an Uber. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant (that was a little inconvenient), but they do have a variety of local restaurants  that deliver to the hotel. We order pizza and salad and the delivery was fast and the portions were huge. The reason I am giving an average rating to this hotel is because the bathroom really needs an updating, the paint was peeling off the wall, there is no storage area for your toiletries, the shower was small and by;3
We booked through a travel agent for 1 night prior to joining a cruise. I had specified twin beds at time of booking. On arrival we were given a tiny room on the 8th floor at the rear of the hotel. There was barely room to walk round the small double bed, and the bathroom was small and cramped. When I asked to change rooms I was told it was not possible as the hotel was full. I showed them my booking confirmation showing single rooms requested. The receptionist said requests could not be guaranteed. I always book single beds as I am a poor sleeper especially after a longhaul flight. We both had a restless night's sleep in the tiny double bed. There was no tea supplied with coffee maker.But we did have a decent hot power shower. We ate in the Tic Toc diner twice which was good;3
"Central Park West--73rd and Broadway, NYC: I read the reviews that mentioned the terrible sleeper sofa (not possible to sleep on), but since the review was published a while ago, we assumed the owners would have repaired or replaced it by the time we stayed here in late June. Not so!  My spouse and I, plus a teenaged son, stayed in this apartment for 4 nights and days, in the ""Executive Suite"" which indicates it accommodates 3 people.  NOTE: IT DOES NOT. The sofa is a two-seater, so you can't sleep on it without using the pull-out sleeper function. The mattress was torn (not to mention stained) with rusty springs sticking out of the fabric that would likely cut you on the legs and thighs. Although he'd had a tetanus shot recently, our son still could not sleep on it without";3
I stay at hotels over the weekend to get out of my neighborhood I try different hotel all the time the ones I like I return too so far I have 2 favorites sign Me and my wife. Until next weekend bye thk u;3
I was REALLY looking forward to my stay at the Empire and to be completely honest was more than a little disappointed.   Upon arrival, the valet tried to convince me to park on my own around the corner instead of paying more for Empire's valet. Maybe he was trying to be helpful, but since I had luggage and a pet, this was not very practical and he took more than 5 minutes trying to convince me before taking my car.  At check in, I was notified that in addition to the daily pet fee ($25), there was a $100 cleaning charge. I called in advance to notify the hotel I would be bringing a dog and was told about the $25 daily fee, NOT the $100 cleaning charge and it's convenient to not mention this until check in when it's too late to do anything about it.   As a whole, this is an older;3
The hotel is well situated, near the subway, the room is good as well as the beds. The batheroom is good except for the towels that are very small. Room and bathroom are very clean. The staff at the lobby is extremely unpolite. There is always just only one person there to attend everybody and answer phone calls at the same time. It was supposed to be cable tv in all rooms wich is not true. They didnt informed us when asked about  a computer at the hotel and sent us three blocks away, On the last day we found the a room with computers near the lobby. You have to pay to use it but it was the same on the place they sent us. We needed to print a voucher. If not, there is wi-fi. You can hear noise from other rooms, keys not always work and you have to go down to the lobby to reset;3
Stayed here with several friends on a girls weekend getaway. Hotel was recommended to us by someone who had stayed there on a few occasions.  Very good location - Central Park across the street and Lincoln Center on other side of building.  Easy access to subway.  Walkable distance to shops, restaurants.  Rooftop bar might be nice in summer but in April it was just a loud living episode of Jersey Shore...on second thought it probaly doesn't get any better in summer - just less clothes...as if that is even possible based on what I saw parading through the lobby every night!  The laughable thing is one of my friends was refused entry to the bar because she had flip flop style shoes on - they were not rubber flops but they did have a toe thong, but doorman was insistent.  Meanwhile;3
Firstly fly with virgin it was a great start to our trip! We have just returned from a four day stay at the newyorker hotel.  The location is perfect, the hotel is old but clean, we had the most comfortable bed, which trust me after a day in Newyork you will appreciate.  The only thing we would say is not a 4 star.  Nothing in the bathroom worked properly, we were charged $25 a day extra unknown facility fees?? So be prepared to have plenty of extra cash.  They said they had upgraded us, but we had already prepaid for a room with a view ,so very confused... The tick tock cafe attached to hotel has amazing food but be prepared for the 20% tip to add on your bill every time.  It's very expensive.. The resturant on the other side of the hotel is also expensive... In fact the whole;3
"Hotel Lobby is fantastic and very impressive!! We arrived at 2:15pm and asked kindly at the front desk, if there was a chance to check in already. The lady at the desk was very rude and just said: ""NO! Only at 3pm"". We dropped off our luggage and walked around the neighbourhood for a bit. When coming back another agent checked us in and upgraded us to a room with two queen size beds (we were happy again). The rooms: are fully equipped with toiletries, tv, AC a safe etc, though due to its dark colours and the weird brown of the bathroom tiles, it looks kind of dirty. BUT for a NYC hotel it was a huge room, and offered everything we needed for the time being. Rooftop bar: not my crowd of people there... a little scatchy, but other than that its nice to have a drink before going";3
"Stayed one night in the empire hotel.  It is what we expected - a hip atmosphere with a great bar and rooftop bar.  The cocktails were delicious - named for the gossip girl characters - I loved the ""S"" a mixture of vodka, champagne, and lemon juice - yum!    While the decor is hip, it is very dark and on closer look it is very apparent that this is an old hotel that has been updated superficially.  The rooms are very small, but nice.  The robes are Frete.  The bathroom was so tiny - I'm 5'2 and it still felt cramped.  No room for my toiletries bag - or a trashcan.  Great location - right next to Lincoln Center.    All in all, just fine for our one night stay and I was happy with our experience.";3
I booked this hotel for two nights as a treat for my husband, as he's a big fan of Art deco architecture. Unfortunately, the grandeur of the hotel exterior and reception area does not continue into the rooms. Ours was extremely small, considering the price tag! We couldn't even open both our small suitcases on the floor without being stuck...  The fixtures and fittings in the room were fairly pleasant to look at, and in keeping with the deco style, however, they felt very flimsy. We also had a very small TV, with a decent selection of channels. The bathroom felt like it hadn't been changed since the say it was built - which was stylistically nice, but not at all practical! The shower was diabolical. The toiletries provided felt very 'budget hotel'. The walls were also very thin,;3
Stayed at The New Yorker. On first impressions it looks dated but it is very retro. When you read about the history of the place you get why it looks like it does. Although the landing corridor and lifts section looked like a scene from the Twilight Zone or the Shining bit spooky. Our room was small but ok for us the bathroom again small and needed updating. We booked this in April 2018 and a month before coming we paid for my mum and son to join us. There room was on the front and was masive with a smaller room off the bedroom for storage. You had views of Madison Sq Garden and down the road the hudson river. It was a very busy hotel. There is a diner attached to it called Tick Tock and we loved it and did breakfast every morning there. The beauty of this hotel is its in;3
dear days inn The hotel staff was courteous especially in resolving my gaps, requests for directions and useful tips to move independently. I stayed at days inn new york for a few days, to visit the city and museums. I have visited several important museums.;3
The location is great as only 2-3 mins away from Hammersmith underground and therefore there are shops at Broadway and a good selection of restaurants near by. Upon arriving at the hostel approx 7pm there were a few people sitting outside that had obviously been drinking and could appear intimidating to some. I had booked a twin, private room for myself and niece as it had said on website that only over 18s could stay in the dormitory.  So was a bit surprised when I was questioned as to who my niece was, how old she was etc.  Upon telling them 16 my passport and money was thrown back at me and I was told I had to have her parents permission for her to stay there with me.  So after a delayed flight of 4 hours to get to London I had to phone her mum, get her to email the hostel;3
"We recently stayed for 3 nights with 2 boys ages 6 and 7. The rooms and property were nice but I was expecting a more ""resort"" feel. None of the staff were rude but they gave off a vibe where they were bothered by you. I had to call down for extra towels every single night. There were 4 of us and they left 3. At one point I got out the extra blanket and pillow from the closet and the blanket felt very rough and had a hole like it had melted in the dryer. I bought some things from the gift shop and thought it was odd to have to buy a bag for my things. Parking was a bit steep $28/day to self park. The main entrance was under construction. We purposely chose this hotel over the Sheraton that was right next door because they were having construction. It also does not include";3
Hotel positives:  - location  - comfy bed  -fresh linen and towels daily  -decent size double room  -air con good  -safe   Negatives:  - the hotel is majority student accommodation so the lifts are a nightmare so busy and loud noise  -busy lifts  - shower boiling or freezing no in between  -really old decor  -broken plug on bath  -300 dollar deposit for 7 day stay;3
The room was small but clean. Our room ,908 is dark ,due to limited natural light. The rates of using any of the snacks left in the room are expensive.  We would have apreciated a kettle I  the room to make ourselves a hot drink.There are hot drinks available for free in the dinning room of a morning, without purchasing breakfast but not at any other time . purchasing hot drinks several times whilst away is quite an aditional expense.  Geoff the doorman was particularly helpful and friendly.He clearly knows the city well and doesn't encourage customers to waste their money.;3
I've stayed here for business three times in 2012, usually two nights each..  My first stay of the year in February was one of the best hotel experiences I have had in some time.  Check in was smooth and efficient, I was given a nice ground floor room with a patio next to the pool.  As I was settling in to my room i received a fruit basket (which was just what I needed at the time), and breakfast the next am was great.  Fast forward to September.  I had tried to book that ground floor room again.  Got a message the night before asking if I really needed a accessible room.  I called back immediately saying I did not and wanted the same room as last time - but no one answered and I left a message.  When I arrived at the hotel the next day it was clear that no one had listened to;3
If you want a hotel with your own bath for under $200 a night in NYC this one is it.  A subway ride from the busy downtown area( remember to take the C during the day and the A local at night)  Clean, friendly, on the older side with a small but working elevator.  Rooms are very small, but workable.  Ours was quiet on the back of the hotel, great little place to eat and pick up snacks on 109th just a few end blocks down.;3
"We booked as part of a package, which was good value. We were staying 8 nights and were very disappointed at the first sight of our room, which was small (this seems to be what ""Queen"" means) and didn't evevn have a wardrobe. However, when we asked to change this was done with courtesy and no fuss. Indeed, all staff were excellent at all times. The new room was just as small and ugly but did at least have an adequate wardrobe. It is the only hotel really near to the Lincoln Centre and the Metropolitan Opera - just over the road - but the downstairs bar and upstairs restaurant suggest an entirely different clientele. We found these spaces unbearable in their brash noise and slightly sleazy edge. Fortunately New York has enough to offer not to need to stay around the hotel very";3
The locstiin of the hotel is great. The bedroom id ok withe new bathrooms, but bit the hairdryer (it was broken). The bar is also great and the cocktails od the bartender (julio) were great, if is too cold no need to go outside.;3
Problem with check in as computers where down, had to wait 20mins. Then the first room we had was old, dirty and tired. We thought about walking out but the hotel was full and really busy. So we asked to change, 2nd room was a lot better, they had clearly done some work on the room, but still not 4 star. B'fast was nice, whole hotel was very busy and everyone else likes it so it might have just been our standards. There are no restaurants or shops in walking distance, parking good but traveling places was a nightmare and then you have to pay to park, everywhere.  it's not really my sort of four star but I would give it 3, wish we had booked a hotel in studio city, more international.;3
"I read several reviews on the Empire to understand what I was getting.  A lot of the comments are true and accurate.  The Empire is a busy hotel and centrally located near Columbus Circle; access to the subways  is within one or two blocks.  Our room was on the 5th floor away from the elevators.  There is a nightclub on the roof so a room on or near the 11th floor could be noisy.  Didn't go to the nightclub.  Once inside the rooms are small, bathroom even smaller, no shower stall door - so water will splash inevitably.  The room was adequately clean, could have been vacuumed more thoroughly, it was a little dusty.  AC worked in our room; many posters complained about their broken AC - nothing to report but cool uninterrupted air, we could have been lucky.  HDTV with cable";3
It was a very small room in a very large hotel. The room had one small window that faces a brick wall. Everything in the room was old and needed to be updated. I felt like I was staying in an old closet;3
This hotel has a great location, common areas are very nice and clean. The rooms are clean but renovation was done on the cheap just to make them look good so the conditions of the rooms are not the best. The AC in the room didn't work, complained to the front desk everyday but was never fixed. In the June heat and after the 3 of us took a shower it was like a sauna in the room, no AC and no vent in the bathroom. It's NY so the rooms are very small but I was happy with the double room, the bathrooms are very small.;3
Hotel was book through Prime Sports for the Rose Bowl/Game package.   Good:  all the employees that you have contact with...wait staff, front desk, bellmen...were fabulous.....Bad:   maintenance and housekeeping. . . .we complained twice that the heat in our room was not working properly...temperature would not go above 70....did not have consistent housekeeping...one day did not even have service....when I complained, was told that we did not have service because we put out a do not disturb sign..WE NEVER Put OUT ANY SIGN...we were ignored by a front desk management when I called....I guess I would recommend the hotel .....but be wise....;3
So location is great- very close walking distance to lots of attractions and right next door to Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Station.  The hotel reception is very grand but once you get beyond the lifts the hotel is tired and in need of refurb. We had a queen terrace room on 22nd floor which was very spacious with double room with ensuite and lounge area with terrace and another bedroom off it. The terrace was huge but to be honest we didn't use it much. The air conditioning is good and quiet.   The downside of this hotel is its size and the lack of customer service. No staff (apart from housekeeping) were particularly friendly. Check in was very short and abrupt and i think its odd you have to pay for luggage hold ($5 per piece)- maybe if they do away from all the wasted;3
Upfront I'll say this review is from the perspective of the business traveler who has stayed at this property consistently over the last few months. I've stayed at both hotels located next to Universal.  Overall the rooms are consistently nice.  I can't say I've had an unacceptable room and they all seem to have plenty of room.  Every room has a mini fridge.  The TV has a decent channel selection.  The only issue I've had with the rooms is the air conditioning is inconsistent from room to room.  Sometimes so silent you don't know it's on, sometime a blowing fan and sometimes with annoying humming noises.  The elevators are a nightmare.  I believe they have 5 but I'm pretty sure all of them do not work at the same time.  When the hotel is busy they have a staff member stand at;3
As with a lot of reviewers, I was not expecting a high class hotel. I was thinking it would be like a travelodge (a decent one)- basic but clean and to a certain standard.   We were initially given a room on the eighth floor. The mirrored lift was dirty and the corridor to the room was gloomy with ripped paper so my expectations were already lowered. The room was dark when we walked in with just a blue light coming from a desk. It looked quite cool until we turned the light on. The room had a strange area behind the door, 1980's style wooden kitchen cupboards. I have no idea why it's there. I wouldn't have used it for food as it was dirty. The carpet was worn and the tiled area in front of the unnecessary kitchen was broken. The airconditioning unit on the window was taped on;3
...but very very average on the inside.  We stayed on the Exec floor for $200 and I thought it was overpriced.          Service very patchy, rooms dull, corridors and public areas are old.          Location - walking distance to Universal theme park.;3
My sister and I visited her son and needed a place to stay.  We chose this place because it was around the corner from his apt.  I was disappointed in the size of the room and I really shouldn't have been being it was in NYC.  The room was super small and not much room to even open a large suitcase. It was clean and the queen size bed slept pretty good and the bathroom was good sized. The deadbolt on our door was broken and we told the front desk so we told them and they were aware of it. There was peeling of paint and wood on the bathroom door along with cracks in the walls.  Only one elevator serves this 9 story hotel and not more than 4 people can comfortably fit in it with a couple pieces of luggage, so there will be a wait. One of the few good things I can say about it is;3
The beds were comfy, decent tv, decent Wi-fi and next to a metro station. What more could you want? Maybe rooms that didnât look like a 1960s Blackpool boarding house? Maybe air con that didnât sound like it was made by Boeing? Maybe a hotel where they knew what a paint brush was? Maybe bathrooms without cracked tiles and doors which close? A restaurant? A very tatty hotel but absolutely fine for someone just to sleep.;3
Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights between Christmas and the new year.  The main reason we stayed here as will no doubt be the same as most others, is the location to Universal and for this it is great.  However, with some small attention to detail it could be a lot better, i just got the feeling that the hotel knows the location will bring in guests and as such minor issues are left ignored.  The room itself was poorly cleaned, you could write a message on the dust on the TV. If someone had opened the cabinet door when cleaning the room they would have noticed. There were stains on the carpet, one one morning there was no hot water at approx 7.00 am, tried to use the transport to Universal twice but couldn't get on it so walked instead etc.  At the buffet breakfast (which isn't;3
The hotel and rooms are very clean. The front desk staff and bellmen were very nice and knomlegeable.   The security can use some serious work.  I was only asked once in passing  if I was staying at the hotel upon entering and was never asked to show a key.  Anyone can walk right into the hotel and get on the guestroom elevators.  The hallway lighting outside our particular room 415 was very dim, almost dark.  The rooftop bar service was terrible.  Had trouble getting a seat on the outside patio when the patio was near empty and our waitress had to ask us twice for our drink order.  She also neglected to place our appetizer order so we cancelled that.  We had planned to have dinner at the Hotel but after receiving terrible service in a near empty bar we went elsewhere.;3
"Well where do you begin, if you like Art Deco architecture it's fabulous. As a hotel it leaves a lot to be desired. Lobby etc.great,rooms are a lottery. Allegedly they are STILL in the process of upgrading rooms.I presume we were allocated a room awaiting an upgrade. The only description  is shabby. Staff again are a lottery, some great, others surly at best.The Tick Tock diner which is part of the establishment is reasonably priced for NYC is tragic, food and service wise.This hotel need to get their act together, not rest on their past laurels. Shame though it is. Go else where.P.S.When checking out no one asked""How was your stay?""If they had asked I would have voiced my concerns rather than this negative review.";3
I had read reviews on The Jane before I went to stay there, so I knew what to expect.   I was concerned about bed bugs after reading some reviews, but had no problems with that at all. The bathrooms were very clean, however we stayed there for 4 nights and nobody ever cleaned our room or replaced the bottle of water you are given upon arrival.  The noise from the bar downstairs (or rather the people leaving it) is pretty annoying, we actually turned on the airconditioner to drown out that noise.  We stayed in a bunk room and from the photos expected it to be small, but no photo can do it justice. Be prepared to perfect the dance of stepping out of the room so the other person can open their suitcase or walk past you.  I had the same problem as someone else- when giving a credit;3
Very big hotel and rooms are what you would expect in New York - small but functional. They've recently renovated and the new touches such as the iPod docking station are obvious. Well equipped gym but not very well maintained. Good security at hotel lobby as you need to show your key card before they let you into the lift lobby. Front desk was a little off- putting and did not make a good first impression. The young African American lady seems very reluctant to give me my key card when I returned for them after they telephoned me to say that my room was ready - sullen, unfriendly and totally unpleasant. Due to this experience, I checked out online in my room as I refused to deal with the front desk staff when it came time to leave. Housekeeping was good and efficient. Room;3
I was there overnight for business and only stayed at this hotel as it was close to Burbank airport.  First off, the staff was very friendly and helpful, good music at the bar and the food was good.   However, the rooms, hotel decor and just functionality of the hotel were poor.  As others have mentioned, the elevators were barely working.  This is an issue they are working on, but 20 minutes for an elevator and lines in the lobby for the ONE working elevator was not ok.  They did get a second one working but had to have a staff member stationed in that elevator to make it function properly.   The rooms are old and the hallways etc feel like a dormitory.  I did see one of the newly renovated rooms and once done this will be a pleasant hotel.    Until they fix the rooms and;3
This is a basic, no frills hotel situated opposite Central Park between 106th W and 107th W Street. (you need this precise address for the cab). It is some way from Times Square, but the pleasant and quiet neighbourhood ensured that we had a good night's sleep without the noise of traffic and wailing sirens all night long. We actually woke to the twittering of birds! The room was adequate, with two large beds (these would be 2 Double Beds in the UK) a small TV and a good size bathroom with a large bathtub and shower. The Air Conditioning is the typical American one, clamped to the window, and can be noisy if you need to keep it on all night.  We could not get the shower nor the wall sockets to work, but this was soon put right with a demonstration by the very helpful and;3
Stayed for a week at Days Inn in Feb. It is a Smart  hotel with individual rooms, bathrooms, wifi and great connectivity to subway- very economic price too!

The location was great, but my room was small, had less than 500 watts of light in the room (excluding the bathroom), and the closet was minute.  I was there on business, so I didn't spend much time in the room, but I will look for another hotel the next time I need to be in that area.;3
Pros: near trains, tubes,  taxes, landmarks, clean room that looked new Cons: breakfast buffet was dull and boring experience, no ham, cheese etc. scrambled eggs was not real, was made from egg powder! Staff in reception was polite-trained, but did not follow trough. On saturday morning I asked them to change the bed linens etc. not only make the bed. Come back saturday evening, was not changed! Best reception could do was giving me linens so I could change it myself! They promised to change it next day for sure. Next day I told the reception people what happend the night before just to make sure no more mistakes. Came back in the evening, and guess whatâ¦. They had just made the bed, not changed it. 1 fault i can accept, but 2 in a row of the same subject, sorry no Premier Inn,;3
Tried this hotel as I wanted to stay close to Central Park and The Met. Hotel was quite nice and elegant with a good atmosphere in the lobby and bar. I got a upgrade to a room with a king size bed which was nice, but it was also on lower level and the old window did not provide a lot barrier for the traffic noise from Columbus. I woke up a couple of times during the night because of sirens etc. I know it is NY but I have stayed in several hotels where you do not hear the traffic as much. Finally there was absolutely no fringe here. The self made coffee in the room was 2 $ and the water was 8 $ !!! I moved to another hotel after this with complimentary coffee and water in the room and I think the rate is the same.;3
My daughter & I went to New York for spring break 2017 and stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel on 8th Avenue. The actual hotel looks nothing like the picture. We shared a room with 2 queen beds, only it was 2 double The room was the size of a shoe box, my daughter & I had to turn side ways to pass each other in the room, seriously. That was the smallest hotel room I've ever witness. I will never never stay at this hotel again. Everything was old and out dated. The shower was clogged, but maintenance did come and fix that But NO I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. After my daughter and I return home, The hotel charge my daughter credit card $39.00/night for some ridiculas charge that they never told us about before hand. We specifically asked at check-in and check-out;3
Hotel in a vwrybstrategic position and overall good but frw things left me speechless if I compare the momey spent.  Windows with briken glasses keept inplace by tape....is it a safe environment for a customer paying to have an accptable service? The same window had damaged frame and once opened I have not been able to close it back....had to ask thenreception to send someone to repair it. Bed lining damaged (and not by me/us)...in 1 week I saw just once the shower gel refilled. I think these are minimal things which could be easily aieted out but that, on the other hand, can be very unpleasant for a customer. Hope Ameritania will put a small effort to offer an overall high level standard, to customers, as the rest of the steucture does. Lqst butnnot least, free wifi just in the;3
The location is top in terms of access to Amtrak, subways and Midtown.  The Hotel is priced right, which is why I stayed here for half a day while attending a conventional down the street.  At the end of the day, the staff is very nice, the room and furnishings are average for New York, but the hallways and overall rooms are just plain old.  I realize it's a very old building, but it served it's purpose well for my one day in the city.;3
Room was nice and clean, big TV and the bed was comfortable, hotel close to LAX. Restaurant and sncak shop were less than average, poor food choices, lackluster service. Parking was not free anywhere, very expensive worse if you wanted to leave the hotel by car. No amenities within walking distance.;3
"I do like trying new hotels in NYC.  This is one of the more ""quirky"" ones I've stayed, mainly in the decor but also in the ""vibe"".   The rooms are not big.  Bathrooms are smaller. If there wasn't a big mirror sitting on the floor (vs hanging up?) I would have been able to sit and work at the desk.    And - it was propped against the wall, not secured.  Thankfully it didn't fall over! See pictures.   It is in a good location - near my office on 56th and 6th and Times Square and that area for restaurants.  The shower was strong and hot. Towels were okay.  Bed comfortable.  I was able to sleep despite some noise from the outside.  I was facing a courtyard and the window was quite small.  The A/C made too much noise, so I left the window open and was fine (early June).   Bonus -";3
Checking in was nice & quick which was what we needed after 36hrs of traveling!! I found the room to be basic for a $200.00 per night stay & have defiantly stayed in better places for less. The room stank of smoke, but on arrival we thought maybe it was a damp smell & didn't think too much more of it due to being too tired& just wanted to unpack & settle in. As the days went by we realised the room smelt very strongly of smoke & even our clothes started to smell. We didn't bother mentioning it as to be honest we couldn't be bothered packing &moving room. It was nice to have an hour free wi-fi, but had to go to the lobby to access it initially. For the price we paid, I'd have thought free Wi-fi would have been nice, but hey ho!  We hired a car for two days & had to pay for;3
This Hotel offered a great location for the price. The staff were wonderful. The staff went out of there way to accommodate you. The Hotel is in need of updating, but also there are a lot of other hotels in New York that need updating. The bed was comfy and the room was clean. The Hotel was 1 block to the 1,2,3,9 red line and that was our main transportation to everywhere in Manhattan. There are many places to eat around the Hotel, which was great. There is a pharmacy at the corner of the Hotel if you forget anything for your trip. Central Park is just 3 blocks away. We were with 2 other couples touring and we all stayed at the same hotel.;3
Beds are super hard. Hot water took forever to come on-up to 10 minutes of running the water. Plug for fridge was attached to a light switch so I inadvertently turned off the fridge and ruined the allergy-friendly food I had brought. All wall sockets didnât work. Room only got serviced fully once? We had to empty our own trash and request fresh towels ourselves. Location, though, is great. Doormen were super kind and congenial. There is coffee/microwave/coffee downstairs but only found it on our last evening-even though we asked front desk where closest coffee was.;3
This review may be a bit scattered as I wrote it throughout our stay rather than retrospectively, and added to it each day.  We arrived early and went to drop our bags off, expecting to at least have a discussion about early check in, even if we would have to come back a bit later to get early check in, but it was not mentioned at all. They took all my details and ID etc so we thought we were being checked in right then, but at the very end of the conversation we heard simply âcome back at 4.â Couldâve been more polite about it. We also were told on arrival that thereâs construction so the water supply will be disrupted and low pressure for many hours of the day - why would a respectable hotel not at the very least email guests before they arrive to inform them of this! I would;3
We stayed for 3 nights and the end of a US trip. The location is great: on Broadway, so you can walk to Central Park and Times Sq, or take the subway to other areas. The A Train goes direct to and from Howard Beach for JFK - really handy.  The reception, lobby and mezzanine are really cool, and the staff friendly. It's also the place where people hang out as the wifi is free - everywhere else it is charged by the day.  We had two rooms: a street view and an interior. Ask for an exterior room, as the ones that overlook the service courtyard do not get much light and have noise from the service vents. The rooms are similar in decor, but the interior rooms are smaller and lack the coffee maker.  The aircon in both our rooms was noisy, but effective. The interior room suffered a;3
Stayed with my family for one week in Feb 16.  Location is everything for this place. Check in smooth and lowered the 27 dollar hotel fee to 15 dollars. 4 adults staying in the smallest room possible after being told at check in we had a spacious room with excellent views. Mmmm. Tic to diner is good value but there is a McDonald's and Starbucks literally across the road. We walked everywhere form this hotel and although the room was dated and cramped you only need the room to rest your head after a busy day sight seeing. Location made it worth it.;3
Worst cleaning experience in Premier Inn. You have to request a clean I consider this a basic of a hotel stay. 1st day bathroom not cleaned. 2nd day room not cleaned at all despite requests at 10.30 and reception did not resolve. Had to request clean towels. Stay was Comfortable and quiet Excellent location on Southbank beside London Eye. 4mins from Waterloo Tube and station. M&S food beside hotel. Good Restaurants on Southbank close to hotel.;3
My boyfriend and I stayed there for 12 nights.  Only downside is the size of the room, I have never seen anything so tiny, however as most of the other reviewers mentioned its only somewhere to put you head after a long day out.  The beds were extremely comfortable.   The location of the hotel is wonderful.  Its on the upper west side, subway only 5 mins walk away from the hotel,or you can take a bus M10 which will take you through Times Square and drop you off outside Macys.  Overall hotel is very good, however, size of rooms toooooooo small.;3
Noisy room due to the room being continuous with refrigeration equipment from other areas that constantly turned on and off during the whole stay, I could ask for a room change but I decided it was not worth it;3
The Hostel is far from the centre, but it has good options of public transport. The bedroom is ok, but they use a very stinking product to clean it! There are a hundred of kitchens in the hostel, but all useless because they expect that the guests will bring saucepans in the luggage! So there are stove, micro-wave, fridge, but NO utensils! The staff don't help with any turistic information and they charge you for wifi.;3
"I chose the Hilton at Universal City for one reason and one reason alone - Location, location, location.  OK, maybe two reasons: TripAdvisor gave this Hilton a slight edge over the Sheraton next door.  The Hilton was walking distance to Universal Studios, which meant we could skip the rental car entirely for our short stay. The other benefit was having a ""home base"" nearby, where we could relax in the middle of a hot afternoon; or use the pool.  As for the hotel interior and amenities, it was about what we expected for the 300+ price per night: Reasonably nice, but not super luxurious or trendy; a little run down and dated in a few areas, but clean.  The staff was very nice and we had no major issues, other than the free internet, which was slow enough to be un-usable.(I";3
I'm unsure if LA in general, or Universal City is crazy expensive, but we paid a lot for what we got. Breakfast isn't included and is an average buffet considering you pay $18 per person for it. Wifi is not complimentary - weird when most places have wifi as standard now. We switched rooms as our first was right above a generator and delivery bay, and no signal. The room was a bit bland, but the beds comfy and the bathrooms were nice.;3
Pros:  1. The location is perfect - only a block away from Central Park, short walk to the main sights of the city. But still in a quite area so you're away from the commotion of the city.  2. The staff is wonderful - the doormen and concierge are very helpful, polite and friendly. The front desk staff was friendly and very accommodating. The staff at the pool lounge were awesome. The cleaning staff always friendly when passing them in the hallways. 3. Even though they don't offer parking on premises, they do have a parking arrangement with Icon Parking on 64th/Broadway. You get your parking ticket validated while checking out and present it to the parking attendant at Icon. The only downside is you must pay by card only, no cash accepted.  4. The rooms are very out of date, but;3
stayed for two nights .. clean room and excellent services. If you do not have breakfast included, on the ground floor there is a very comfortable Starbucks. only downside the expensive parking..28 $ per day;3
We were treated well by the staff. They addressed any issues we had quickly and with courtesy. That being said, there were issues with our stay. Plumbing problems occurred more than once. Elevators were unreliable. The rooftop lounge was often reserved so guests could not enjoy this amenity. Even the lighted sign on top of the building has letters burned out. Needs some major upgrades.;3
I stayed with my grandson at this hotel for a trip to introduce him to Manhattan.   There are several pros for booking 1.  The price is certainly excellent for New York  2.  The location is central for using the subway or attending plays  3. The elevators are quick and are enough in numbers that you donât have to wait long ( one theater district hotel we booked in the past required almost 30 minutes to exit the hotel). 4. The security was visible. 5. The staff was pleasant, and check in was quick. 6. Housekeeping was conscientious, and rooms were clean.   The beds and linens were comfortable 7.  Our room on the 23rd floor had a fabulous view of the Empire State Building.  Cons: 1. There was no room service, and coffee machines must be requested for your room. There is no;3
I'm handling this review gingerly because I knew what I was signing up for. A place to sleep.   I was pleasantly surprised.   This room did it's job, the exterior is a bit intimidating but once inside this place is fine. I booked just a single twin. My room was clean, warm, and in satisfactory condition. The shower was hot with thick quality towels. The TV had plenty of channels and there was an ipod speaker, nice. Only thing I could have used was a full body mirror but the room was small and cozy enough for me to get some shut eye.   ***A fair warning. This is right by Penn Station, and this room is not sound proof...SUPER busy, so you will hear taxis/angry drivers outside, but after while I acclimated to the sounds.   Hey, it's New York! And the value was reasonable. (At least;3
I love the hotel, the location, but i did pay for two rooms with tv but nothing, the wifi was awful, impossible to connect, and the only nice people was VÃ­ctor, very kind and helpful, the Best one, the administrator was rude every time.;3
Hotel looks worn. Room was okay, but had a freezing cold shower every single morning which was totally unacceptable. Told the front desk and I got the impression it happens all the time. Iâd never stay here again- way too many other options in NYC.;3
"The building is excellent and traditional from the period. However, extra facilities and charges for extras like coffee that are standard in most hotels, let the hotel down. The lack of welcome pack was unusual; I received a key card and directions, there was no further contact until I checked out.";3
We stayed three nights in the Jane last week and chose the hotel for its location and price, as we hadn't realised how expensive accommodation is in New York. We wanted to be in Manhattan and to be fair the hotel is in a brilliant location, on the border of the Meatpacking District and West Village and within walking distance of loads of places to eat and drink. It was a good base for our stay. The history of the hotel is interesting and the decor is really original, so that made it fun.  However the price/quality ratio is very off. We chose the bunk bed room simply for the lower price and make no mistake, it is absolutely TINY. We could not open two suitcases at the same time in the room and had to have the (very loud) air conditioning on all night otherwise we would have;3
I've stayed here twice and both times found it good for the price. It is budget accommodation and doesn't have any particularly amazing features to it but it is spotlessly clean, the showers are good and it is very cheap. You get a fridge in your room which is excellent and it's cheap enough that if three of you are staying you can buy four beds to turn it into a private room. there are lots of kitchens although we never tried to cook in one of them so not sure how good they were. You are also practically on top of Hammersmith tube station (where there is an excellent and pretty cheap pizza place) and the Hammersmith Apollo, also only a short walk from Riverside studios. On the negative side both times we stayed it was far too hot and you're 3 mins walk from the bus station in;3
How come in 2016 a hotel in NYC charges for internet in the room, and for a internet that does not work properly? Reception staff were unpatient, rooms are ok, but matress are too soft, so the pilows, it is better to stay in the HIlton Gardens Inn across the street;3
I have stayed at this hotel twice, not because it is particularly good, but because it is across the street from Lincoln Center, so if you are an opera/ballet/symphony buff, it's very convenient.  The rooms are quirky and although some things are great, like the beds and linens, other things are so badly designed that they almost don't function-like the bathroom. We had a Junior suite and the bathroom was quite small and had no hooks or bars to hang a towel/robe except those inside the shower.  The shower had no door, just a half wall, so whenever either of us took a shower, the bathroom floor inevitably got water on it, no matter how careful we were.  The shelves in the bathroom were nice but a sink more than 4 inches deep would have been useful.  Also, the sink and fixtures;3
if you're a single person who won't be in the room much and you're a heavy sleeper then this hotel is for you.  It's clean, the rooms are tiny and the staff was very nice, however the walls seemed paper thin and you could hear every bump creak and step on the entire floor.;3
Hotel was comfortable amd met our needs. Self parking was secure and spacious. Breakfast buffet was har variety and tasted great! Didnt get to use patio but took a peek is very nice. Beds i do gotta warn are hard but i slep well in it. You get plenty of pillows.;3
We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is an old preserved building as the most buldings in New York city. The location is opposite the central park at the west side, a quiet and safe area. There are 2 subway stations near the hotel to go everywhere in New York. Station 96 and 103. I think 103 is closer. The room was renovated with modern decor but was very small and our 2 suitcases fit very difficult inside. I found a dead and burned cockroach inside the hairdryer!! I said nothing because we were walking all the day and we got back at night only for sleep. The location is perfect but the hotel is moderate.There were many maps and sightseeing tours in the reception. The staff was very polite, smiley and helpful.;3
I booked a bunk bed room, knowing it would be small but thinking the hotel's location and stylish decor would make up. I have to say - I am too old for this place!! And I am only (?!) 30!! The room was TINY as stated - and very hot. You could hear your neighbours every move/ word. And the worst part was you could hear the music from the bar - which went on each night till 4am. So I got no sleep what so ever.   This is a great hotel if you want to be out till 4am partying. The location was fantastic. But it is not for someone looking for a boutique hotel experience!;3
Pro's - walking distance from the Studios or the studio shuttle which picks you up from the front of the hotel.   Con's - Reception staff who cannot  follow clear instructions. Got charged on my credit card even though I had instructed the hotel that I was paying in cash. Even went twice to reception to make sure they understood this as I had already exchanged currency (I was willing to pay in cash at check in, but the receptionist said they have made note of my request and to pay on check out);3
Location and room were both great as were the staff. We found the pricing policy to be a let down though, would much rather they increased the up front price instead of charging for every little thing on top of the room fee. Wifi, parking, water and anything we they can squeeze out of you leaves something of a bad taste in the mouth and spoils what is an otherwise excellent experience.  Charging for wifi on top of an already expensive room and also charging per device is the sort of nickle and dime approach that should be below a chain like this but sums up their approach to value and service.;3
"This place is HUGE, TOO -HUGE.  And that's great if you're having a meeting with over 250 people.  Yet in a meeting I went to today, the hotel layout is exceedingly confusing, there was no signage for what meetings were being held and where (yes, the staff told me there were small screens highlighting that; however, you couldn't find them).  Remember how there used to be rosters around a hotel or a list in the elevator - not here.  They don't want you to find anything.  In the meeting room I was in on the 2nd floor, the room was ICE COLD from 8 am - 2 PM.  The hotel staff said they were changing the temperature; however, it was always ICE GOLD.   It's 2017: air conditioning should be fixable.    The hotel wait staff was very good; they knew what they were doing and the food was";3
The hotel is in a prime location, close to shopping areas, Pennsylvania station, Port Authority, and not far from Central station. I didn't need to deal with the staff much during my stay, but the reception lady was nice, cleaning staff was friendly as well. The room was very small, but quiet and clean. Decoration was a bit old, but basically not that a big deal to me.  What I wasn't happy about was, firstly there's no fridge in the room, which I wouldn't be happy about in summer. Secondly, there's a facility fee when you check in, which I didn't know when I made the booking. I did notice in the confirmation email, it said something about a resort fee when checking in. But prior to booking, nothing. I really hate that, because that would have voided all the comparisons in the;3
Ok, the bed and the bathroom were clean.  Very low voltage lighting Quaint foyer Overpriced for what it is. New York hotels are expensive but this was not worth the cost.  However with a makeover it could be a stunning boutique hotel.;3
Only stayed here as it was such a good olace location wise for the New York marathon. However although the hotel is well run, friendly and does the job it's supposed to location wise, I must have been given the worst room possible, location wise. It was like something out of a bad movie scene where the only thing missing was a train line running just outside the room causing it to shake every five minutes. There was NO sound proofing at all, it was like sleeping with the windows open all night, we could hear every shout, siren, engine and noise ALL through the night and also with the added bonus of a giant neon light illuminating the room up every few seconds ! I supposedly had one of the best rooms available too ??  Also the first hotel I've ever stayed in where you had to;3
For an older hotel it is what we expected from the reviews on average. A few minor problems but were sorted by staff. Yuri the concierge was excellent  Note coffee maker should be in room for complimentary drinks (Had to ask on finding one in family members room.;3
Comfy bed.  Good Lobby area and roof top bar useful to have open until 1 am. Rooms small need to get a queen bed, even then small.  Little room to hang clothes. Corner rooms seemed more spacious.  No complimentary water in room.;3
The lobby and rooms are clean, chic and lovely, and we found an attentive staff who promptly delivered extra pillows, ironing board and iron and gave us a free box of cashews when the ones we opened from the honor bar proved stale. Our only real objection was a very small room with no room for an ironing board to begin with, queen, not king size bed,  tiny closet  and no place to put your luggage so it has to be opened on the floor. Sound transference between rooms was also a problem along with door slamming in halls. On balance this was a good value b/c we paid under $200 on Hotwire, but I would have been bummed if I'd paid full freight.;3
Staff is was very nice and room service was great! It is also very convenient to Madison Square garden!  The hotel is very old and needs some major updating! Bathrooms were small and VERY outdated. Window in bathroom would not close but maintenance came and fixed it. Average hotel.;3
3 of us stayed in apartment 1315 which was a one bed apartment with a sofa bed in the lounge. It also had a kitchenette and 2 bathrooms, which we weren't expecting. Everything worked fine, including the TV, microwave, aircon etc. The rooms were clean and tidy and looked recently painted. The furniture was older and the sofa bed was in need of replacing or certainly repairs, but otherwise we were very happy with it and the location is perfect. A safe neighbourhood to go out in and right next to the express subway station at 72nd. The Woogo is run as serviced apartments and not as a hotel, so you shouldn't expect the same services as a hotel. There are shops just round the corner to buy things like loo roll and washing up liquid etc. (they provide hand soap and a couple of loo;3
Very nice older hotel building - modern bathroom typical size bedroom. The lobby bar offered 2 for 1 wine each evening. 3 :00  check in was OK with us. I saw other guests waiting for their rooms. I had to call for room service every day. This should never happen.;3
"I was in NYC last week, at The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel. My credit card was asked for incidentals, which I had no intention of using the other hotel facilities it was fine. I was told the next day that a facility charge would come off my card, I had paid for this upfront via my travel agent, after speaking with two front desk staff it was confirmed that  no charge was made to the card. The issue was with the gentleman  at the front desk, he was dismissive and abrupt when I asked about this,  definately NOT good customer servise, he said on a few occations ""NEXT""  The room was generally clean but I did find hairs in the bath and sink which was disappointing. The cleaning staff were polite and  friendly. I stayed at the The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel previously and found it";3
This is one of the most affordable hotels located adjacent to MSG and near Times Square and the Empire State Building. The single rooms are quite tiny, so if you're traveling as a family, I would upgrade to a double room. Given its location to tourist hot-spots, expect a lot of crowds. The lobby and restaurants are packed at all hours of the day. The service is average, but all things considered it is worth experiencing the historic hotel.;3
Despite reading all the negative reviews, I and 2 friends stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Contrary to previous reveiws, all the staff were pleasant and helpful. The concierges were especially good - recommending local restaurants and trips.  Rooms are small, as in most New York hotels, and we were given keys to two rooms to choose which was best. After two nights the manager gave us a larger room which had become available.  Rooms and bathrooms very clean and there was no traffic noise from outside. No problems with noisy pipes either.  Hotel is ideally located for Central Park - directly opposite. It is about five minutes walk from subway and then about six stops downtown.  If you're staying at this hotel, there are some great little cafes, bars and restaurants within 5-10;3
I like this hotel. Its old and well-worn, but clean, and everything seems to be working. Good old american style. The windows are far from soundproof though, and some constructionwork on the street kept me awake the whole night.   But I like the style of the hotel, and hope they will keep it that way.;3
"This is an APARTMENT!!! NOT a hotel. There is no ""service"" besides a doorman who makes sure people don't get in who arent supposed to, but pizza delivery does :) and they will order an airport transfer for you if needed.They have kitchen facilities and a grocery store close buy. Its one block from the 72nd street subway with access to the Main routes #1 and #2 express. There is an awsome restaurant for breaky less than 2 blocks away and a Loehmans for shopping the same distance. You feel like a resident for sure staying here. There is the cutest Tea Shop not far called Alice's Tea Cup (wicked scones, but no coffee). WARNING the Futons ARE NOT COMFY but are bearable....just sayin....";3
I spent three nights for both business and leisure during one of the most brutally hot stretch of days in all my many trips into New York City.  I only state this because the A/C unit in my room was FANTASTIC and kept the room VERY cool.  The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and the hotel is just around the corner from the 96th Street subway station which services the 1, 2, and 3 lines, giving you easy access to the entire city.  I was everywhere from down in Brooklyn to up in The Bronx, and the location of the hotel and proximity to the subway station served me quite well.  Also, as the hotel is set in the Upper West Side, there is far less noise and such that one will find around Times Square.  However, as has been stated in other reviews, there are many drawbacks to;3
The dark wood panelling, ghostly lighting, red carpets give this place an incredible atmosphere that makes it worth checking out. I felt like being in the Overlook hotel out of the Shining, so oppressive is the mood.  In the bar, the pretty actress about to star in a horror movie sitting next to me admitted she thought it was haunted, and the bar staff heartily agreed there were plenty of spooky tales. Needless to say, it is all fake: even the old wooden panelling was, or so one staff member told me, bought new when the hotel was done up.  Nevertheless, the illusion is very real, and the owners have done a sterling job in creating the Jane. That said, it is inconceivable why a recently renovated hotel should smell so bad. The room I slept in the  first evening smelled like an;3
Stayed here for 5 nights. Nice sized clean bedroom. No frills. If you want somewhere comfortable to stay at reasonable cost then this place is fine. The staff are helpful. Our fridge was not working and it would have been nice to have a kettle in the room.;3
Bad:  The place is very old and needs a serious facelift.  Parking garage was several blocks away.  Also, if you arrive right at check-in time, expect a long wait. Good:  No bugs and relatively clean. Low price.  Parking was reasonably priced for NYC.;3
Convenient to Lincoln CenterOur room was small but clean. Furnishings were somewhat haphazard, or full view of the Airshaft, and quite a bit of mechanical and other noises during the night. Staff was very friendly and helpful.;3
"We visited for five nights. The staff were helpful although the ever present problem of who and when and how much to tip is pervasive. The surroundings are quaint and there is history and original features a-plenty. The cabin rooms are very small and the shared bathroom issue is a problem when toilets and showers are out of order for the entire duration. The location is perfect ; very central and ideally placed for most destinations.";3
The hot water was tepid and I could not regulate the air conditioning.  I brought this to the attention of management and the problem was not resolved.  The location to Lincoln Center is excellent.  The bell and desk service is very helpful.  The room is comfortable, but a little dark and not well sound insulated.;3
Location is the best to Central Park & Lincoln Center.  About a20 min walk to Rock. Center.  Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.  Price was exorbitant---$1400 for 2 nights in December!! No amenities in room (no coffee, no room service) Rooftop bar is nice but costly.  Daughter in Fordham so great location---will not stay here once she graduates...;3
The Empire is in a great location but unfortunately has not been renovated properly or has that renovation been kept up.  The rooms are tired and well worn.  The staff is excellent and is very responsive to requests or complaints.  We stayed in a corner suite 719 which was very roomy, with good light and views of Broadway and Columbus Avenue.  The king bed was very comfortable, the housekeeping very diligent but the bathroom was small, poorly lit with shower stall basin stained and wall tiles cracked.  Not what you expect when you stay in a corner suite.;3
If you have an outing to Lincoln Center, this location cannot be beat.  That being said, our room was very small and noisy.   The bathroom was small and cramped.  We were constantly juggling our belongings throughout our stay due to the space constraints.  You know how most hotels have an in-room coffee maker?  This place actually charges for those little cups of coffee you make, so beware.  Wifi is an extra charge, and our small room had an awful lot of space taken up by the mini-bar, as well as an array of items by the coffee maker that we could buy.  I probably will not stay here again, as there are too many other hotels in New York City.;3
"This is the second time I've stayed at The Empire.  You can't beat the location.  It is in walking distance to theater, shopping and museums.   My stay this time was not nearly as nice as last year.  We had a room on the first floor that looked out over a ""condensing farm"" of air conditioning units.  It was also right next to the elevator.  We were unable to regulate the temperature in the room.  All night long it went from freezing to roasting.  The bathroom was drenched after my husband showered since there is only a partial enclosure to the shower.  The towels were well used and not very absorbent.  We were only staying one night so a clean place to stay in a great location was the priority.";3
We stayed here because we had tickets to Paul Taylor modern dance at Lincoln center.  This hotel is right across the street and down half a block. Our room had an amazing view of Lincoln center. We stayed for only one night. When we got in the room there was no heat (it was a cold day) the unit was blowing cold air. The sent a maintenance person right away to fix it. The room is very simple but you shouldnât expect so much more since the price is reasonable for the room and location is right next to Lincoln center and Central Park. We walked to mandarin oriental hotel and had dinner there at Asiate. So what you save on room you can spend somewhere else and enjoy the city!  The Lobby is nice and trendy and door men very courteous. We also visited rooftop lounge in the evening. It;3
It's easy to dismiss poor service in New York hotels because people think it's a 'New Yorker' way of saying or doing things. For a highly competitive hospitality market I find some things inexcusable. First, rode in for check in with luggage. The hotel bell captain stood next to us as I grabbed the luggage just to realize this hotel doesn't help anyone with their luggage. Asked bell captain for help with a taxi: he just said 'you can grab it from the street yourself'.  Last these guys have a 4:00pm check in time (very late I think) and even then the room wasn't ready until after 4:00pm!  So in short, I'll never stay here again. Look elsewhere. New Yorkers in hospitality are nice people but some exceptions here. A shame.;3
The Hotel is a 'surprise', a pleasant surprise, due in part to the area around it. First the hotel: It is nicely maintained. The rooms, while not overly large (and there's no closet) more than met our needs.  The hotel was quiet and there was a full breakfast complete with omelette station included with the room due, and the dining area is really nice.   But, be prepared, the area around the hotel, while not bad, is also not particularly glamorous. That great photo of the 'entrance' is not the street view of the hotel, but from the Parking Lot (or course, once you check in, you do enter via the parking lot.   We were taking in a show at the Pantages, and this was a convenient stay.  I guess, that's the key here, it's a great place to stay,  you will be driving to the areas you;3
Small room. Major construction going on outside of my window. Outdated interior room. Bar downstairs was the best part of the hotel. Good location across from Madison Square Garden. Close to trains. Front desk checkin was fair. Not very personal. Security was around and checked for room keys in evening. I won't be back.;3
The location is great. I found the staff at The Empire to be outstanding.  They were knowledge and extremely helpful.  That was the best part of the hotel.  Initially all looked good however the first indication that things were amiss was when only two of the four elevators were operating. We were repeatedly forced to squeeze 12 people into an elevator with an 8 person capacity.   The room and bathroom were clean but there were no areas in which to place anything in the bathroom, not even a toothbrush.    Showering caused the bathroom to flood because one of the two glass doors had been removed by management. I was told to use extra towels on the floor.  When I asked why the door was removed I was informed there had been an incident with a previous guest. The air condition had;3
You can walk the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Central Park, and take a train to the 9.11 Memorial. Perfect and would most definitely stay here again. Room was a bit tight and the bed was small granted I am only 6 feet even.;3
"The rooms with one bed are extremely small by any standard, including the bathroom and closet. The rooms with two double beds are small but provide more air space. It's a good thing the TV was mounted on the wall; there wan't room for it anywhere else. The room was very clean and the service was average. It took awhile to get used to the shower head mounted directly overhead and not adjustable. It is in a very convenient area adjacent to Lincoln Center.";3
Beds are very small. Upon arrival, the doormen were extremely friendly. However, reception staff were a little cold. Paid for hotel well in advance and were left with a bill of over $100 dollars on the morning of us leaving. For âservices and feesâ. Not satisfied with the behavior of certain staff.;3
Location is great, rooms are a bit dated, and my bathroom was hilariously tiny.  They still charge for wifi (seriously guys, it's 2014) and if you want to drink the Fiji water in your room, it's $7.50. I'm not joking, $7.50 for the little bottle of Fiji (not even the large one).  Every single time I left my room my key card became demagnetized. Every. Single. Time. As if that weren't frustrating enough, there was usually a 5-10 minute line at the front desk so I had to stand there and wait just to get my key working so I could return to my room. No, it wasn't next to my credit cards or my cellphone (I must've said that 100 times over 48 hours).  There is a great roof deck, but it was pretty much always closed for a private party.;3
It is very good that you can reach to Penn Station easily. Times Square is just a ten minutes walk. But hotel is old. I think it deserves its price. Its history is also interesting. It is a very crowded hotel. So, check-in, check out, concierge services take time.;3
Needed a 5 night stay in New York for me and my boyfriend, cheap, good location, the usual. We found the location was great, Central Park is on your doorstep and there is a subway about 2 minutes walk so very easy to get around. Room was cleaned every day without fail, facilities were all working perfectly fine, staff were very friendly and polite - my only comment was the air con, it wasn't really blowing cold air and was located behind a curtain/under a window so was pretty useless. Despite the -8c weather outside the room was verrrrry hot so we needed the aircon on as the window didn't open but the noise from the air con was too much (it kind of sounded like a car engine running outside your window) Saying that, we were barely ever in the room, only to sleep so it wasn't too;3
Well the hotel has a great location thatâs for sure ! Restaurants everywhere, Columbus circle â­ï¸ only a short walk. Central Park a few blocks away from and loads of people watching.  The hotel itself is a class âBâ hotel with smaller rooms no mini- bar or facilities to speak of. A small bar was visible in the lobby but ...;3
Pool was cold because the heater was broken. Staffs make us feeling like strangers than guests. They donât seem to like working there. Not to happy what I paid for 4 stars hotel. Disappointed! Hope I can have better experience next time.;3
I expected more from this hotel. We ended up with a room without a view which I didn't have a problem with until I saw it. The view was all of the air conditioning compressors for the hotel. To top it off the a/c in the room was mediocre which was surprising considering it was a very small room,  It appeared that the room had been recently re done however it was very evident that corners were cut.  The room was fairly clean as long as you didn't mind showering with hair belonging to some previous guest. We were afraid to use anything in the room because it all seems to cost extra.  $7 for a bottle of water, very small snack foods with $$ signs on them.  Going up to the pool was a little odd... take this old elevator, go up this grungy staircase, and then another grungy;3
CONS. This hotel really needs a renovation.  The lobby furniture was scuffed and ready to be replaced.  The corridors to the rooms are narrow and twisting.  The rooms are small and the carpets just don't seem clean.  The bathroom is okay but the handle on our bathroom door was defective and we kept getting locked in the room.  PROS The staff were very helpful and the check in was swift.  It is conveniently located and not expensive.;3
The good part about the hotel is it is On the Park. And they provide basic facilities (clean bedding, towels, hot water) for a low price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. That said, the room was too small for two people - we did not have any place to move around after putting our luggage. The carpet seemed like it had not been cleaned for quite some time. Don't try to put anything in the cupboard, it may come off.  Given that we were out most of the day, it did not bother us much and it was good enough to get some good sleep. It's not for experience. The Deli down the road is good with very friendly staff.;3
First time in the city,didn't want to spend alot for a room we wouldn't be in much.The room are bigger than most,very clean,good quiet area.Two blocks away from restuarants.You have to share bathrooms,wasn't ever a problem.You only have a sink in the room.It's not bad for the price you won't anything else in the city for that price.I would stay there again.;3
I have stayed at this hotel before and was very impressed with their customer service and quality of rooms.  They used to leave a fresh cut flower in the room and you would get a red apple upon check-in.  This trip, my experience of their customer service was not impressive.  I arrived late and needed help with my shower and the engineer took a long time to get to the room.  In addition, getting on the room's wifi was very difficult and it was too much of a hassle to log into the room's wifi even if you have to pay for it.  It was easier to go to the lobby and take advantage of the free wifi.  Totally inconvenient for a business traveler.  When calling the front desk, they took a long time to answer their phones to the point I had to place the phone on speaker and insist it keep;3
We stayed at The Jane this last October and it was awesome! It is not for everyone, I imagine, but if you ever traveled in Europe in your youth and embraced the youth hostel environment, this will bring back great memories. While there are nice captains room that offer their own private bathrooms, I prefer the bunkbed rooms. Are they small? Yes. Are they cramped? Yes. Do you need to walk down the hall to use the bathroom? Yes. However, the room is clean, efficient and a one of a kind experience. The front desk staff was gracious and accomodating. The cafe in the lobby has coffee to die for. All the beautiful cool people queue up in the lobby to enter the ballroom late at night.You can safely walk to the subway, meatpacking district and all the while feel like a local. This hotel;3
We stayed for 3 nights. The room was as I expected- ie not spacious and we had no view. But the AC worked, the bed was comfy, the water was hot and the water pressure good. The location is ideal, close to the park and Times Square and within easy reach of bus stops for the hop on - hop off tours. Eugene the doorman was exceptionally helpful with tips on where to eat, drink etc. We didnât spend a lot of time at the hotel - but why would you when there is so much to see and do outside?!;3
All in all the place is nice and we'll located. However the room was really small, which wouldn't have been a huge problem if we could open the closet properly. This wasn't possible because the door hit the bed and therefore we couldn't open it more than 1/3. Uncomfortable.  Other than that the bed was excellent.  We liked the hotel and its history and finally it doesn't deserve all the bad comments I read. But they really got to fix this closet issue!;3
Great bartender, quit rooms, decent gym, great housekeeping staff. The room service order taker ruined the experience. Very poor customer service and 0 apologies for their mistake that made me wait for a simple salad more than 1.5 hours. The wine I ordered with a couple of ice cubes on the side arrived with no ice cubes and the duck salad - without duck.;3
The hotel was good and the room was adequate for the purpose, although the shower was either too hot or too cold. The staff were friendly and helpful and we had room service every day. The room was small, but adequate although, overall, the hotel could do with some renovation. What really surprised us was that, after check out, on our final day, prior to going to the airport, we had five hours from check out until departure to Newark. We were charged $5 per bag to leave at the hotel. As the alternative was to carry the bags around the city, we opted to pay the $20 but, I must admit, this left a sour taste.;3
My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week long anniversary trip.  The beds were nice and comfortable and I loved the Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries.   The walk to Universal Studios is not bad.  I don't understand the comments in the past reviews about it being a long walk.  The only thing we found to be a little tiring was getting up the steep steps to the walk way that you have to cross to get there but the walk overall was fine.  We never took the shuttle once.    The weekdays went very smoothly but by the weekend we were wishing we had stayed at another hotel for those days.   The buffet they serve at Cafe Sierra comes out into the walk way that you have to go past to get to the elevators and it was packed with people, more so on the weekend then during the week.  We;3
Hotel was clean, shower worked (which in my experience is great for USA!) and the room size was decent. The air conditioning in the room was extremely loud even turned off it was noisy. From our room we could only see the back of the hotel which was pretty horrible. I feel the hotel was fairly overpriced but for New York price was fair. Hotel is very close to subway train and you can be in Times Square within 15min. Good diners and shops close-by to grab some breakfast or dinner.;3
Dislikes: the lack of hot water, the roach hanging out in my bathroom all morning, the paint peeling off the bathroom door, the over priced breakfast buffet that ran out of coffee, that said buffet handed me a receipt which reminded me tipping is not included and expected at between 15-20% (last time I checked if I seat myself, get my own drinks and food, there is no tip expected...particularly when they now make $15 an hr) Likes: Nice decor, large hallways, big rooms for NYC, otherwise fairly clean rooms, great bars, friendly staff. An added note, I got a good price on the room through Orbitz which I recognize doesn't buy me the best room. Perhaps if I had been willing to pay more, I would have had a better experience.;3
This was my first time in NYC & I was slightly disappointed when I saw the hotel. It was clean, we couldn't operate our heating on the 1st night & froze, the 2nd night was like a sauna, but the 3rd & last night was a good temperature. The heating system is noisy, the bathroom extractor is noisy & on one occassion we did hear other occupants using their shower.  If you're not planning on spending too much time in your hotel this is perfect & at a good price. Close transport links to downtown Manhattan & a FABULOUS cafe around the corner for breakfast.  The bed was extremely small, I slept closer to my friend than I would have liked.  The hotel just needs to be brightened up a little/modified & it will be an ideal spot.  Sadly we had a very poor view, just a brick wall & more;3
The Hyatt Regency LAX does not provide exceptional service. Breakfast is provided in the restaurant but NO lunch or dinner. Additionally, the electric socket in the bathroom did not work and had to dry my hair by desk table. The room furniture and decorations were blasÃ©. I know we can do better. I regret staying there.;3
PERFECT HOTEL â¥ï¸friendly receptionist huge warm room  Nice view well clean and decorated ,Lightings is good ,PRETTY GIOD HOTEL LOVELY STAFF FOOD IS GOOD LOTS OF GOOD DRINKS TO BE choose.weâll recommend for a couple trip .wifi is. Pretty good ð perfect for everyone;3
A very well located at the heart of midtown, clean, however very crowded and old. At one step you could reach to subway, time square is about a km. Needless to say that price benefit ratio is not stasifactory. A bar and a cafe is on either side of the lobby, haven't tried the bar I enjoyed the waffle fries at breakfast. You could reach to every spot very easily.;3
The best feature of this hotel is the location: neighbors to the beautiful Lincoln center, 2 blocks from Central Park and Columbus Circle. Grand entrance to the hotel. But the rooms are rather small and outdated. Wall paper and paint peeling off the wall, one worn out bath rope for a double room. Gym closed down. Free internet connection not working anywhere in the hotel. There is a pool on the roof for a dip, but not for a swim - it is small. Nice roof top bar (well isolated from rest of the hotel).;3
Room is nice in that itâs big and comfortable. The shower was great. Big issue was the internet didnât work in the room and I was told it probably just didnât reach my room specifically. Couldnât get any work done in there. Also, there was a dead bug in the coffee filter so that was gross. Rest of the room seemed really clean though. Iâd give it another go.;3
This hotel is in a great location. However the hotel is tired and in need of a renovation. The rooms, lobby and elevators are worn and tired. We were happy with the accessibility to all of our friends and family in the city and the proximity to the subway. The hotel staff was friendly and prices were not bad. However it is very dusty and scratched up inside. They need to renovate .;3
"We chose this hotel because (a) we got a great rate at a very busy time of year and (b) it was close to Universal, which we planned to go to for one of our days.  Although it has excellent proximity to Universal and City Walk, and was fairly central to other things we wanted to see, it was a bit of a disappointment in terms of facilities.  The pool was quite disappointing - we went once and left within minutes.  Water was cold and there was not a nice restaurant to sit and have a drink while the kids swam.  The ""restaurant"" was like a trailer.  The elevators (which I understand are being redone) were crazy slow.  The room was nice and fairly large for your basic two queen bed room.  Linens were nice, room was cleaned well.  If you are just looking for a spot to sleep while";3
Was minutes from lax and car rental place. View from our floor 12 room was looking out over the city. Planes landing and taking off was quite a spectacle and quiet with the sound proof glass in our room. Hotel is very modern and clean.. We stayed for a week. Convenient  because it is 20 minutes to Hollywood Beverly Hills and beaches and many other sites. Shuttle that runs 24/7 to and from the airport so we had no worries of transporting back to the airport at 5am. Nice pool access. Parking was a nightmare all over LA and pricey... Downsides to our stay was a reservation issue that was resolved immediately by the managers and you will have to pay for parking valet or otherwise every time you get in or out of your car..  No included breakfast or coffee even... Hotel restaurant is;3
"The room was quite large, but needed some sprucing up (paint, better furniture, ceiling cracks, etc.). Bathroom was definitely dated. The free breakfast was not ""full"" as it was advertised, but I'm not going to complain about a decent continental spread. Parking in the lot behind the property was simple, but of course not cheap. The front desk was not exceedingly helpful, though certainly not rude or unhelpful. The WiFi was pretty slow. The hotel itself is basically in the middle of Little Armenia and not Hollywood. It's not a dangerous neighborhood, but definitely not nice either. So if you're looking to be ""in the thick of things"" in either Hollywood proper or downtown LA, this is not the place for you. We got a deal off some website so it's not like we were paying $300 a";3
We stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to Universal Studios Hollywood.  It is one of two hotels within walking distance to Universal.  They offer a shuttle to the park that is shared with the Sheraton, however we walked most of the time versus taking the shuttle. The shuttle is scheduled to come every 15 minutes however more than not it was more than 15 minutes.  They only have one bus even during closing hours....faster to walk if you are not too tired.  Overall, the hotel was the quality expected from the Hilton brand.  The bathroom sink drained very slow and not much counter space in the bathroom.  Parking is very expensive $28/day for self park and $40/day for valet.  As a Hilton Honors member we received bottled water upon check in- very nice touch!  Rooms have;3
"I'm new to this website and love reading all the helpful insight...so I thought back to my short years of vacationing experience to think ""What insight can I give to 'give back' here.""   My ONLY thought was to write a warning about this hotel.  The pictures are very misleading in my opinion.   Very nasty hotel.  As I pulled up with my girlfriend at the time...I had a sinking feeling.   She (g.f.) even witnessed some homeless people get into a brutal fight as she was sitting in the car.    THe POSITIVE thing I can say about this place is that they let me CANCEL my reservation on the spot with no penalty and I promptly (and fortunately) stumbled upon the Hilton in Century City.  That hotel was great AND REALLY WAS right next to Universal Studios.  Hope this helps.";3
Overall, the experience was fine. The room could have been cleaner. My room had two beds, and both had sand in them.  The bathroom had quite a few left over strands of hair on the floor and in the shower stall. And the bathroom door had no lock whatsoever.  The hotel is not in the best part of town, I don't think I would feel comfortable walking around at night. The daily parking fee is $24,  which seems a bit excessive.  The breakfast options are terrific though, with a large assortment of pastries, drinks, cereals, and best of all an omelette station (with a chef ready to prepare you any variety of eggs). Overall, I think it is worth it if you can get it for somewhere around $100-$120/night;3
The Hotel has a perfect location specially if you are visiting universal studios, the place is clean, rooms are spacious, the staff are great. But, if you are an international traveler please not that the hotel room doesn't have a USB charger and if you asked for power plug to be compatible with the American/Canadian wall sockets they don't have it.;3
"Considering that it's now almost impossible to book a decent NYC hotel room for less than $250 US per night, I jumped at the $184 rate at a last minute travel website for a weekend stay. And the hotel is exactly what I expected for that price.  It's small and, despite photos to the contrary, not very chic. But it was very clean and the ""renovation"" I'd read about was done on the 5th floor where my room was. Sure it's a tiny room, but all amenities worked; the bed had a fine mattress and good linens; and the bathroom was above average.  The front desk staff was friendly. The hotel is just three blocks from a subway stop, and since it's on Central Park West, cabs are plentiful.  If you will be spending hours on end in your hotel room, this is not the place for you. But if you are";3
We stayed here for 9 nights in July 2013. I'm not sure if I would or wouldn't recommend this place. The rooms need a serious upgrade! The hallway carpet never looked clean (minor issue I know). The lady who is supposed to help with tour information was so unhelpful and acted like we were just a nuisance asking her questions. She told us a certain tour wasn't available so we called up ourselves and booked in for the exact day she had tried. The lifts were the biggest nightmare of all. So slow to move and open, and it took us a solid 10 minutes some days to even get an elevator. I would hope they actually get serviced. The best thing about this place was the location, right near a subway platform. Apart from that... Pretty average.;3
I spent one night at this hotel so I don't feel I can truly give a thorough review but I'm going to try.   We arrived a little early to check in but they pre-registered us and called us about 30 minutes later to tell us our room was ready. We reserved the room through Priceline and read that the hotel staff treated you different for using a third party to make the reservation. I fully disagree with that statement. Any staff member we dealt with was extremely nice, pleasant and accommodating.   When we got back to the hotel later in the evening we were given our room on the 7th floor. We had checked our bags and asked to have the Bell Man bring up our bags quick since we only had a few hours to sleep. They delivered our bags immediately! NYC rooms are generally smaller than other;3
Hotel was ok, our room was quite small, bathroom was clean though the taps and towel rails where poorly fitted nothing was level!! Due to covid our room was only serviced once in 5 nights! Doorman was great and got us a taxi to penn station to catch our flight from Newark , we used the commuter  train from jfk to Manhattan, quicker and cheaper than a taxi.;3
The hotel was clean, with good beds and quite reasonable, if basic, facilities.  It is lovely to see the beautiful Art Deco features still in place but it needs an upgrade - carpets, decor and so forth.  It did the job for four nights but it isn't really that quiet between rooms.  It is very well placed on eighth Avenue so it's popular.;3
Are you looking for a place to sleep in NY? This is your place!  The rooms are not very big, but they are very clean and confortable. Metro is just round the corner! The stuff is nice and helpful The area is very quiet, and there are a couple of restaurants near.;3
We were in New York for New Years eve so it was very pricey not matter where we went.  If you want to email them a question... DONt Bother.. they never got back to me.. There was a big muddle up with my booking and it was very frustrating.   There was a beautiful south African lady at reception. She upgraded us she was very approachable! as was the other lady! The men.. (im not sexist!) but dnt bother... they dont care about customers only about gtting a break to watch the telly!!   Rooms- Dont expect clean just expect basic. (perfect for what we needed)  Subway - Very close by.. Try get off on the 110th 1 line not the one further away... its a lil more dodgy.  Location: OK not super safe but stay on the main roads u will be fine  WALKING: It took us about 1 hr to wak into time;3
Hotel was nice for a short break but I wouldnât stay again due the âresort feeâ they add on when you leave. I know lots of hotels are doing it but it doesnât mean you have to. Leaves a bad taste just have clear pricing if you want an extra $30 a night then just put your price up!;3
I guess it's my own fault but this was the second time we tried this hotel. Last time, I thought it was terrible. This time, I booked a more expensive room, but it wasn't worth it. The room was small, dingy and the bathroom narrow. The public areas seemed dirty to me. The staff are great, which is a saving grace and the location handy, but if you can find another place that fits your budget: go there.;3
This property is better than the typical airport hotel - there are a few issues - but overall a decent option.  The airport shuttle is shared with the parking garage that is next to the hotel. The shuttles come by every 10 minutes or less - but - and it's a big but - they are not Hyatt people they are parking deck people. I tried to flag down the first three that went by but they didn't even slow down. They drove by terminal 2 at 30+ mph in the middle lanes, empty, and without looking for anyone at the pickup sign. My assumption is that they are paid to circle the airport and they knew another shuttle will be there in the next 5 to 10 minutes - and nobody going to a parking deck is likely to complain. But it's pathetic. Prepare to be frustrated. A lot of shuttles is great but;3
I stayed here twice before and had enjoyable experiences both times.  Night 1 included a standard cabin - very small & stylish, perfect size tv, ac/heat and a somewhat comfy twin size bed.  The shared bathrooms are just down the hall and are well maintained and I never had to wait for anything.  Night 2 I was upgraded to a captain's room, which had a real full size bed, more space/storage and it's own bathroom - it was a wonderful upgrade.  My only major complaint about the hotel is it can be sometimes loud in the hallway, with people slamming their doors to go back and forth to the bathroom with the dangling keys (which you use to turn on the electric in the room).  This is perfect for someone who doesn't plan to spend much time in the room at all.;3
Very close to Universal City Studios and ultra-convenient to visit the park and studios, but if you're in LA for other reasons, might want to find somewhere else.  Obviously a dated property with the age showing.  Elevators are old, rooms and fittings are old, and the upkeep is okay, but not much better than that.  Our carpet looked at best scary.  The bed was good, furniture appropriate, and the bathroom was good.  Hotel restaurants are good to better.  Hotel bar is okay, but seemed a bit short of staff.  Pool is quite nice, but the security detracts a bit from the pool and outdoor scene.  My son lives close by, which drove our choice.  If you are with your family going to Universal, not bad.;3
"Wouldn't it be nice to book a 5* hotel one day and find everything is as it should be and everything that you hoped for from a 5* hotel?   The positives: - The rooms are a great size and larger than one typically gets in New York hotels. They are as the photos show. - Great location close to 5th Avenue and convenient for theatres etc  The Negatives: - A 5* hotel that still charges for wifi? Really? Room prices are pricey enough so charging additionally just gives a  very poor impression. Very outdated and miserly to charge for wifi. - No free water in the rooms! Same sentiment as the wifi point. - Staff ; surly, and disinterested on both check in and check out. Ignored feedback on checkout. Wasn't my  own experience, but at times during my stay I saw some very long queues for";3
Woke up first day to no hot water, took several hours to fix. That night there was a fire in what we assume was elevator. Had to sit in Lobby with 300 other guests until after 1pm. Limited working elevator service with 24 floors. If you are looking for location this is the place. For value, I won't be going again. There was no compensation for the inconvenience. Paid for executive level, only received Continental breakfast for price, no executive space.;3
We were over the moon when we were able to book this hotel on Priceline for less than $300 a night during the holiday season.  The building is grand, directly across the street from Lincoln Center,and steps from the subway.  The decor is beautiful. The rooms are nice (and standard size for NYC). The staff is efficient and professional.  There is also a nice lobby level bar with seating on two floors and a very happening roof top club (lines around the corner well into the night).    I really wanted to love this hotel.  If only someone had paid as much attention to the sound proofing as they did the decor.     We checked in on a Thursday.  We were given a room on the first floor (one up from the lobby).  At 3:30 am Friday morning, I just couldn't stand it anymore.  The street;3
I stayed in The Empire hotel 7 nights during my business trip to NY. In general, I think it is a good hotel, centrally located, offering average quality for the price. It was much better, cleaner and fancy than other hotels that I stayed in NY.   The hotel is very well located, close to the Columbus Circle and Central Park, and just in front of the Lincoln Center. It was easy to reach metro and commute through entire Manhattan. The hotel is very busy, and there are lots of people coming and going. In the evenings lots of guests are coming to the top floor bar which sometimes makes it difficult to use the elevators or ask receptionist for help.   As for the rooms - mine was rather comfortable, with two large beds. It was clean, bathroom small but functional. Beds were comfortable;3
As well known as this hotel is, I found it to be old and run down.  I have stayed at better hotels for cheaper. The faucet in the shower was broken.  The room was old. The service was mediocre.  We asked for more towels and pillows and they didn't bring any.  Tried calling the front desk from our room and no one would answer the phones. The hotel is not close to Times Square.  It is 10 blocks away.  Not as advertised. The restaurant (Tick Tock) was horrible!!!  They got our order wrong (all 4 of us).  When we complained, they gave us a free bottle of water!!! Do yourself a favour and book another hotel.;3
I stayed here recently for three nights on business. I chose this hotel for the location and  was not disappointed. It's right next to Lincoln Center and  about a couple blocks from Central Park.  I travel to NY on business a couple times every year and know enough not to expect too much  from NY hotels and I would say that for this price range I'd say its a pretty decent hotel.  Its quiet and clean enough and not too crowded.  However the rooms are tiny and I stayed on the 8th floor with no view at all. I opened the window and  there was a direct view of the wall of the next building. The hotel itself lacks any kind of natural lighting and is generally very dark. The front desk staff were not very friendly and indifferent.  Also I am experiencing some problems with the payment;3
"excellent localization if you want a ""midtow off"" travel. My room had a great view from the river rooms are old fashion but large and clean. Bathroom is new i didnt get the breakfast  service was average  there is an interesting cafe on the lobby negative : noisy good price for NYC";3
Overall a good place to stay. Had all amenities. A little noisy(hammering & buzz saw) due to renovations. Friendly staff! Nice laundry room. Pool was absolutely amazing! Places to relax around hotel were very nice.;3
It's old, very old. But hey! We were there for the sightseeing so my room was only so I that I have a place to sleep, shower and change! Not to watch tv... Wi-Fi was working fine. The bathroom was clean and so was the bed. I didn't see any bugs and THAT's my main concern! You could see that there had been water infiltration but again, as long as it didn't rain in the room while I was there, I didn't really care. We stayed there 3 nights. Service could use some improvement. On our last day, we asked for a wake-up call that never came. That being said, this place is sooooo well-located!!! Right off Broadway Street, where you can flag a cab that will take you fairly quickly straight to Time Square (when there's not too much traffic... Think more of an hour (21$) to get to see a;3
"The room was small, but clean.  Staff was pleasant.  The bed pillows are extremely small; we asked for one more (the bed has 3); it never came despite our request.  We were awakened on our first night at around 2am by a very loud crash and sound like glass breaking.  Unsure what it was, but when we looked out our window in the morning our ""view"" was basically a ""graveyard"" of used sinks, AC units and chairs.  The location is wonderful, so that made up for a lot.  If you just want a place to sleep after your city fun, this hotel is good.";3
I had read on trip advisor to see what this hotel Was like..what I read wasnât good so wasnât really sure what to expect ð³when I arrived the staff where friendly an reception was very clean an tidy..the rooms are very dated but also very clean which was my main worry ..it could do with a total refurbishment in rooms but honestly I would go back as clean an I only needed somewhere to sleep ..only other problem I had before I went was ..thereâs no response to any calls, emails or txt messages at all before you go I tried for 4 months but no joy..;3
I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights.  The service provided was good. The only problem was that my room had a walk in shower, i preferred a bath instead. The room  was very nice  and well furnished with mod cons. The area is ok but the hotel is not near universal studios. The hotel taxis and the room phones are  overpriced. The staff was not helpful with the directions for the near by places, they always recommended the hotel taxis if you ask for directions to get to a certain place.  I liked the Waffles for breakfast.;3
Location was excellent. Noise from other tenants was disturbing at nights. Heating / AC of room could be problematic. Was unnecessary during our trip. Very good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep;3
First let me tell you that I am not very picky about hotels when they have reasonable rates, and this hotel does have very reasonable rates.   However, our experience there was mediocre, at best.  When we checked in, I had to sign documents promising that we would follow the rules.  They took a $100 deposit even though it was a regular credit card.  We had to pay almost $30 a night to park the car.  Everything was very persnickety.  The hotel is not in a nice area.  The subway is a block away, but there are homeless people living in tents on the sidewalk going to the subway.  The subway itself scared me.  We are from NY and often ride the subway without issue, but it is very clear that no one is patrolling these stations.  After that ride, we drove or took an Uber everywhere.;3
I based my trip on the review that I read here so maybe my expectations were too high?  The pros - close to the Citywalk, clean, great view.    The cons - No one told us there was a shuttle to get to the Citywalk.  When we finally figured it out, the music in it was so loud and obnoxious (every time) that you couldn't hear the person next to you (We're talking Axl Rose screaming Paradise City with the ride feeling more like the highway to hell - not what I would expect for families).  The towels and even tissue were so rough it reminded me of nursing homes that have to use the harsh detergent to kill all the bugs.  Lastly, it was my daughters birthday so I had flowers delivered to the hotel.  The hotel never brought them up or even thought to let me know they were downstairs.  I;3
All and all this is a good hotel for going to the Universal Studios. Location is excellent (walking distance from Universal Studios and thay also have a free shuttle going to the studios) and the pool area is very nice to relax after long day in Universal. The breakfast buffet is excellent but a bit pricy. Parking is easy to the garage but it costs USD 15 per night.   I would have given this hotel a 4 if it weren't for one thing: we had a non-smoking room but the room was smelly. You could notice that the hotel most likely has not been a non-smoking property for too long because I felt that the smell was all over the floor too. Hopefully they can get rid of the smell because what can I say, a smell in a hotel of this class is just probably the worst thing you can have!   Also,;3
Comfortable bed, clean room and tomb-like silence made this a perfectly acceptable place to sleep before an early morning meeting at Columbia.;3
If you want a spot in a great neighborhood and not ny pricey...this is probably okay for you. If you like lounging around your hotel room and property... It's not. Rooms too small and cramped. Seems very dated and gloomy, bad elevators and small social areas. Staff was nice but hotel is built for speed. Get in and get out to the city.;3
"As most reviews mention, the Empire is directly across the street from Lincoln Center; it  is also close to the subway stop at 66th, is surrounded  by good restaurants, and has pleasant staff. But if if weren't for these very positive attributes, my rating would be even lower than it is: our tiny, sweltering, unbelievably noisy ""deluxe"" room made good sleep impossible. Although we enjoyed the view of Lincoln Center, the street noise was an unpleasant counterpoint. And although the street noise was less than when we stayed here 2 years ago (this time we asked for a quiet room and were put on the 11th floor high above the street), the pounding and thumping from the roof-level bar bombarded us deep into the night. Other concerns were: the glitchy Wi-Fi in the room ($12.95 per day),";3
In town to attend an event at Lincoln Center, we chose The Empire because of itâs location, right across the street from LC. Our stay was uneventful. Our room was very small, but comfortable despite the noise from the HVAC equipment in the air shaft outside our window. The roomâs bathroom was the smallest Iâve ever seen, but modern and clean. Staff was pleasant enough. We really enjoyed the rooftop bar â gorgeous view.;3
When we checked in we received a nice gift from the hotel staff because it was our anniversary.  We also received an unknown  upgrade charge upon our exit.  we did not ask for an upgrade, nor were we told we were receiving an upgrade.  I did not report the additional charge as we had to leave to catch a train;3
when in NYC you want to be in the centre of town and this hotel has definitely got the location, 2min walk from Macy's and 8 blocks roughly from times square.   On a map it looks fairly close to central park, it took us about 40min to walk it!   The hotel has free wifi, and offered to hold our bags as we get there before check in, so was able to drop them and go off into the city to explore.   The room itself was really quite dated, we had wall view! the elevators are like something out of the 1920s big brass buttons and many floors! so getting from the top to the bottom took a while when we kept stopping at each floor to pick up people. We were on floor 27 so was quite quiet. Having said all that we didnt spend much time in the hotel as we were out all day and evening, so i;3
The doormen were all friendly and professional. The restaurant (Eds chowder) served us a bad dish of skate. The room was fine, but no free wifi unfortunately. The room service prices were also very high, with a breakfast for two people costing roughly $90. The rooftop (sign) is iconic and beautiful though.;3
"Great location for visiting Universal City. Although far from any airport, you won't need a car since its walking distance to the City Walk and Studio Tours.  As far as the Hotel;  Staff is friendly, polite and helpful.  But the food, drinks, and everything else that cost extra is EXPENSIVE!  Buffet is overpriced, drinks are extremely overpriced!";3
We stayed at the hotel on August 2 and 3, 2004. Not knowing what to expect after reading all the negative reviews, we were surprised. Yes, the place is old and the elevator holds only about 3 people. The beds were very comfortable, the room was clean and the shower had excellent water pressure. Just don't flush the toilet when someone is in the shower. You may be scalded! The blanket had a rip in it but we were able to request extra pillows...no extra blankets available. Hotel staff was friendly. Great location to the subway . This place is nothing special but if you're just going to sleep and shower the price ($116 is what we paid per night) was definitely right. We would stay there again.;3
"This Hilton has a great location if you are planning a day at Universal Studios, a five minute walk to the front gates.  The customer service, however is quite poor; a great deal of the staff seem to be under-trained or not knowledgeable enough to perform their jobs well.  The valet was great though and the rooms were clean and up to date.";3
Great location for folks who can navigate the subway system. Surrounded by restaurants and shops. For the price it is a good deal.  I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Will stay again.;3
"Amazing location, hotel itself not worth price. The lobby area was gorgeous and very nice, but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated. My room had a gorgeous view, but looked nothing like the rooms the hotel posts pictures of; it was much more outdated, the shower had dirt in between the tiles that could've been scrubbed away, and the bathroom also looks much older. It wasn't super dirty or anything, but definitely could've been cleaner, especially for the price. The TV was older and I had issues with it being so grainy at some points (not the whole time?) that I couldn't read the guide. The diner was nice. Facility fees (none of which I used -- it's basically the office and gym plus Wifi) for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing $100, which";3
November 2022. Hotel in great location right next to Penn Station with easy access to subway and walkable to many restaurants and Times Square area. Lobby and communal areas are well kept and spacious. However, we booked a single queen room and were really disappointed. The room was clean but both bathroom and bed area were worn and very outdated. Noisy overnight as well with loud  guests in nearby rooms. If you get a cheap price then this is fine but accommodation standards in the room we had was way below expectations for price we paid.;3
This hotel has a great location, Madison Square Garden is in front of it. Not in Times Square but you can walk 8 blocks . Plenty of restaurants around the hotel. A CVS is just across the street.  Although it needs some renovations , it is very clean. Rooms are a little small. We barely canât walk in it. Bathroom has a good size . Check in was quick and customer service was great. Will stay again , good hotel.;3
Can't beat the location.  Very convenient for every part of the city. My room was on the small size given the price and that it was a double.  There was a problem with the Wi-Fi which was a problem for me.;3
Stayed at the Empire hotel in NYC through a package with BA in July.  We were given a room on the 11th floor and told it was an upgrade from the room we had booked.  The room was very nice although quite narrow and long.  There were two queen sized beds in the room.  It was really warm in the room when we arrived at 7 pm.  The A/C was an outdated unit under the window in the center of the room.  We turned the temp down as low as it would go and left soon afterwards to go to dinner.  On our return several hours later, the room was still really warm and very uncomfortable.  We called the front desk and asked to be moved the next day.  We were told to leave all of our things packed in the room and they would be moved to another room by 5 pm the next day.  We barely slept all night;3
We had both negative and positive experience with this hotel, so IÂ´m a bit divided. This might be a bit long, so stay with me :)  First of all, the check-in was good, effective and professional. I asked for a room on a higher floor with a view a few weeks in advance, but we got none of this. But we did get a  refurbished room since I am a Expedia+ Gold-member, but in the 7th floor, and the view was right into the wall.   The room was cold when we came, but the heater worked fast, but there was no heat in the bathroom. I was looking forward to a warm shower since it was a cold day, but the shower had horrible water pressure, the temperature was impossible to fix (burning hot or freezing cold), and the tiles on the floor was so cold that event though I left the hot water running;3
I stayed here in October when on holiday with family, hotel was very expensive so was expecting a lot more from it. Had to go to lobby for wifi which was annoying. Rooms are very small also, there isn't much room when you have your suitcases. Staff were quite friendly although when we asked one of them could they book us a taxi they said that they couldn't?! Hotel very close to Times Square which was very convenient.;3
Had a room on the 14th floor.  View of the neighbors on the hill across the road, but that's fine.  Bit of road noise, even up that high.  Loved the fact that the curtains actually were light blocking or room darkening - whatever !!! The mattress was not one I would choose to sleep on at home and I tossed and turned looking for a comfortable spot. So did my husband.  Didn't find one!  Cleaning staff were perfection personified.  These ladies know how to make a room shine.  Anything you want, they will get for you.  Loved it.  Please leave them something when you go.  They work their collective butts off.  The staff at the front desk were ever so charming and polite.  A pleasure to be greeted by them every morning on the way to breakfast, which, by the way, was great.  Hostesses;3
Stayed here for 3 nights  and used it as a base for universal and an LA tour. The price was very reasonable. However the location was not great. 2 blocks up and would have been fine ( location, location ..) When I booked it was as a ramada hotel, not 100% sure if it is now. The staff were helpful and friendly. However the operation all seemed a bit strange. You could only access the basement ( where the OK breakfast was) via one lift which was a bit painful. There was a bar downstairs but that appeared to be a one man operation and when we tried to go and have a drink the lift had been locked for that floor as the barman hadn't turned up. You were only allowed 2 coffees in your room per day and as I used the creamers they wouldn't/didn't replace the coffee packs. There was also;3
Great rooftop pool, amazing location, poor room quality. Hotel clearly was having issues with the air conditions in the rooms which made sleeping uncomfortable. Room was extremely hot.  Love being so close to Central Park, Lincoln center and a short distance from theatre district.;3
There were a few positives about our stay. I originally booked 2 nights at a great rate, called to add a third night and the young man who assisted us was very helpful but could not offer the same rate due to the holiday season which I understand. We arrived early, they stored our bags until our room was ready.  When we got into our room, there were no hand towels or a bath mat. The second day after the room was made up, still no hand towels and now no wash cloths. Called housekeeping took close to an hour to get items. Third day no toilet paper or wash cloths prompted a trip to the front desk after phone calls went unanswered. Met with a manager who came across as being inconvenienced by our problem but did accommodate. Rooftop bar was very loud and catered to a younger crowd.;3
"When we first arrived, we were informed that the room we originally booked would not be available...instead, they down-graded us to a smaller, much more worn room.  They did take a large discount off of the bill, which we appreciated...we weren't going to spend a ton of time in our room, so it didn't seem like a big deal.  However, the room they gave us was not in good shape at all...the beds were incredibly small and uncomfortable (the dipped to the center, clearly far too worn out to be of any good use for sleeping); the furniture was very old and outdated, had terrible lighting, and one of my biggest pet peeves....NO extra outlets!  (We live in the 21st century...let's provide those outlets for paying customers so they can charge those electronic devices).  Once in the room,";3
We had this hotel booked for us trough Round the World Experts.  We paid around Â£350 for two nights and having looked at the prices in these other reviews, feel that we were ripped off.  Room 212 was quite large but in an L shape and although there was room for a bigger bed, it was a very small double and it was pressed up against a chest of drawers, on which I banged my elbow in the night.  The views were not good and the window blind slats were broken in places.  We left the blinds alone for fear of further breakage and therefore were not able to have daylight in the room.  The air conditioning worked well.  The hotel desk staff were polite and quite helpful.  The room next to ours was very noisy one night with a lot of comings and goings until at least 3am when we finally got;3
This Hilton is not exceptional, however it is in a good location.  We were here for four days and overall enjoyed our stay.  The positives were the location near Universal Studios and the breakfast buffet in the lobby was very good.  The negatives included the elevator which was terribly slow (we often took the stairs because it was only four floors up), the small awkward pool, and the parking garage being very far from the room.;3
Our room welcomed us with meticulous cleanliness and pristine bedspreads! Denise did an exceptional job in making sure our accommodations were pleasing. She even checked in to see our happy faces. The only disappointment was reporting that our a/c did not work and it was ignored. Our room temp was a stagnant 77-78 degrees. Extremely uncomfortable with no compensation.;3
check-in and check out and Digital KEY Was a nice feature to offer. However the only thing that worked was the ability to check in. There was no ability to check out and the digital key failed to work on 3 occasions. The gym was closed . And of course they were working on the entrance and interior the whole length of our stay. Very unsightly!;3
Location was great , about a 5 minute walk from Penn Station. Front desk clerk was very pleasant, told us we would be in a small room that night but would move us to a larger room for the remainder of our stay.  The hotel doesn't have an elevator ( which is stated on the website but we missed seeing) the desk clerk promptly helped getting our luggage up the stairs. The first room was very small, no closet, no room to put our luggage, had to store it in front of the door, our window faced 8th ave and heard NYC traffic all night.  After being moved to the larger room as promised, our stay was very pleasant, room was clean, bed was comfortable. Still a no frills hotel, but for a great location & friendly staff we'd consider staying again.;3
Nice quiet location right on Central Park, great proximity to Upper West Side, Harlem and Columbia campus. My room was basic but clean, modern bathroom, comfortable bed. Front desk staff helpful and courteous. Don't book this is you're looking for sleek luxury, but if you're looking for a good value for Manhattan, it's hard to beat.;3
The hotel is in the vicinity is of great shopping, the subway is one block away, plus moderate price restaurants and your favorite Duane Reade/Walgreens is next door. The hotel has friendly and courteous employees, but the overall of pricing should be flat rate across the board due to its 50/50 hotel/residential. Rate fluctuated too much. One of the elevators goes on the blink of an eye so you will be taking the stairs regularly. Before checking in specify that you want a new room. I stayed in an old room but was paying new upgraded room prices. They will request $50.00 for the upgrade. Right.....;3
It is a nice hotel. Affordable. Do not expect to be impressed by the room, it is standard for NYC, small, but very well maintained. Must visit the bar in the lobby and the roof top if you stay there. The ambiance at the roof top is perfect for date night and the bar in the lobby is perfect  pregame  for your night out in NYC;3
"It's difficult to give an overall rating as this is such a quirky hotel, with tiny, TINY, closet sized rooms with shared toilets and shared bathrooms; I stayed in this type room. How can I say it's: great, excellent or poor? So I said average. The room I was in was the tiniest room I've ever been in; a dog house of a room - just for a human! <SMILING> It was a quirky trippy room; I don't find fault at all with its size; it is what it is; you know this going there. HOWEVER, the walls between rooms are paper, paper thin; so much so that you can hear EVERY noise, breadth, sneeze, movement, word or wind of the person on the other side of the wall next to your bed --- AND you are RIGHT up next to / on the wall / when you are in your bed. AND the room on the other side of my wall had";3
I wanted to take an objective approach here and share the pro and cons we experienced.  Overall, if we came again we would stay somewhere else but primarily because the things missing are more important to us for our family then the things they have. Pros: Proximity to Universal Studios and City walk.  There is no hotel better - even the Sheraton is slightly further. In room refrigerator and comfortable beds.  If I still had younger kids I wouldn't question cost or stay. Free internet for HH members It's Hilton so if an HH member you earn points  Cons: Parking - we have a larger but standard size SUV (Nissan Armada (similar to Ford Expedition/Cadillac Escalade etc in size) doesn't fit in self parking yet fits in the lot for Valet using same lot but different entrance.  This;3
This hotel is  a really good base  for sightseeing in New York, easy walking distance from Times square, Macy's hop on hop off bus routes. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean with very comfortable beds and excellent showers downside they were very small. The hotel suited our.  needs perfectly but if you are looking for a quiet hotel with a degree of luxury then this wont be for you, it is an incredibly busy hotel. We would like to return to New York and would definitely consider this hotel again.;3
Stayed for a business trip. Nothing particularly wrong with the place, but lots that would have been disappointing if I had paid for the trip as a holiday. WiFi was very unreliable, only managed to connect once all trip (4 days) and even then it was super slow. Additional coffee in the room after day one was three dollars per sachet! Shower was a bit dodgy, kept going very hot then very cold.  Tv remote was also temperamental.  Generally, the rooms were clean but in urgent need of an upgrade to match the description on the website.;3
Room was clean, quiet and wifi great, so better than feared.   The hallways though could really do with a revamp, totally depressing, and for $100++ per night shared bathroom was a shocker, at least by Asia standards.  Walking distance to Columbia's campus.;3
The Universal Hilton is a convenient hotel if you are visiting Universal Studios in Hollywood, CA. Itâs about a 10-minute walk from Citywalk (restaurant row) and the actual theme park. Hilton is a trusted brand and the property doesnât disappoint.  However, I would rate it a middle of the road Hilton property that caters to vacationers (to Universal Studios) and business travelers alike but is in need of a major makeover.  Here are the pros and cons of this property:  PROS- â¢	Convenient to theme park and restaurant row â can walk or take complimentary shuttle to both locations â¢	Room is equipped with mini fridge,  coffee maker and has a nice view â¢	Centrally located so you are a short driving distance from major attractions nearby including Warner Brother and Disney studios,;3
As others have noted, location cannot get any better if you are visiting Universal Studios - its a 2 minute walk. Location is not bad even if you want to visit Glendale, Hollywood, W. Hollywood, etc. This hotel is also less than 20 minutes drive from Burbank (Bob Hope) airport so that is def. a bonus.  For me, I was here for a conference (which was at the hotel) and the conference facilities were nice. The lobby and the public areas seem fine too. The room itself was just average - I actually prefer the rooms at Embassy Suites at Glendale versus this Hilton. My bathroom was tired and showed its age. The bed is fine and was comfortable. In terms of soundproofing, its a good thing that I'm not sensitive to noise as it seems like the walls were pretty thin. More over, the noise;3
"We got a room for four people, and it was really big for a New York hotel bedroom. It had two bathrooms too, one in each side, right next to the beds (two). I was frustrated a little bit by the fact that there was not a mini fridge in the bedroom, nor a proper closet (just a place where you could put your luggage and hang some clothes, with a small vault). I hated the shower; I don't know if it was only in my room, but the water was very weak and, most of the time, mildly cold. The hairdryer they provide is a joke. But the room in itself was very good, very clean, very proper. The beds were very comfortable. The concierge service was a little bit frustrating; I needed cotton (to remove my makeup) and they didn't have it, and didn't make any efforts to help me find a place where";3
The location of this hotel is unbeatable. Very close to universal studios and downtown Hollywood. However, they donât over a shuttle to universal studios, self parking , and there is no valet. Place needs major remolding which they were working on during our stay. Rooms are very small, but the restroom is good size. The shower was broken in our room and leaking, they fixed it the next morning in way that it is usable, but still need change. Very friendly employees. They have a laundry room which come in handy during a vacation in case you didnât pack extra outfits. Breakfast was horrible, very untasted. We tried it the first day, but we skipped it then.;3
"Couples stay for three nights.  Loud neighbors that were complained about but nothing was done to fix that, it seemed; they stayed loud all three days of my stay.  Not sure if this is common in all NYC hotels but they will charge you an extra $150 for incidentals that may need to be paid for during your stay.  When they held my credit card I did not know that they would automatically charge you $150 even before you had done anything that would warrant any incidental charge.  Still waiting for that $150 to come back into my bank.";3
We stayed just one night. Toilet overflowed and we called the front desk. told them the situation. Water was all over the floor and we needed to shower and get to dinner . Called three more times before they sent someone. They actually hung up rather than answer. Very poor customer service. We were late to our dinner reservation;3
It appears that the LAX Hyatt has gotten into politics, they have what appears to have blocked MSNBC.  It is silly that hotels are making choices like this.  I could see if your the Trump Tower. But not the Hyatt.;3
Great location for easy walking access to MSG, Empire State Building, Broadway, and Central Park.  However the hotel itself has little to offer as it is outdated and badly in need of refurbishment, and the interest levels of some of the staff is particularly low.;3
On arrival we were told we had been up graded, unfortunately it didnât feel like an up grade. The room had pleasant decor & comfy bed & did feel clean, with a coffee machine - they the charged us $13 for extra coffee! Shower was a let down, temperature was tepid & flow poor for a drench shower, although it didnât soak all the floor at least. We reported the shower twice, along with the lose wardrobe door, neither were sorted during our stay, in fact the drench shower didnât work at all on the final day. No carpet on the grand staircase, not sure if they were waiting for one to be fitted or not. The inside doorman kept hiding behind the pillars looking at his phone so had to struggle opening the extremely heavy door ourselves. 2 doormen on the outside were very pleasant. The;3
The Art Deco hotel is in a great location but is somewhat tired.  Some of the staff were simply doing a job and struggled to extend the courtesy to guests that one would normally expect. The addition of a hefty resort fee of well over $30 per night was both unexpected and hard to justify given the quality of the hotel.  Rooms are understandably small given the location but they are also a little dirty and could do with a refresh and better daily servicing by the cleaning staff.;3
Located in the perfect location, just across the junction from station within 5 minutes walking distance. Room is tiny but clean. Share toilets and bathroom are also clean but bathroom should separate woman and man (i opened the door and saw one guy was getting dress!)    We need to pay for wifi and signal is quite poor.;3
When you get to the hotel it looks ok. However, step out of the elevator and you will start to get scared. The hallways looks very old they definitely need to be updated. Room size is OK but beds are very uncomfortable and even though hotel claim to be smoke free, you can detect smoke odor in the room. Some staff members are very nice and others well... Being this a Wyndham hotel I expected more;3
I stayed here first 20 years ago.  Location is great, a fine example of an art deco building in the city that does them best.  A stones throw from Madison square gardens and Penn station you are in the heart of midtown on the westside.  Lobby is busy, lovely examples of brass plaques, antiquated lifts and a huge art deco chandelier, however the lobby is the best thing about the hotel.  Your on 8th avenue, and I was on 29th floor and could hear the traffic and emergency vehicle sirens throughout the night, which tells me the windows are old and not very good at insulating.  The rooms do not seen to have changed in 20 years, dirty tiles in the cramped bathroom which remind you of your grandparents bathrooms back in the 1980's, rooms just as dated, no fridge or tea or coffee making;3
The room was small but clean and relatively quiet, given the location. Two attached restaurants were convenient.  The service was not great. I checked in, and when I had problems with my keys, I was required to lug my bags back down to wait in line at the check-in station again. They re-ran the keys, which worked fine the first time I tried them. But when I returned from running an errand, the keys did not work again. I had to wait on security (at least 10 minutes) to let me in. He confirmed my keys didn't work, and suggested I get an escort to my room every time I left. I ordered room service and stayed put.;3
My friend and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights recently, Metro View Double Room @ Â£159 (GBP) per night.  Please note there is a $27.22 (USD) per room per night non-optional resort fee payable upon checkin, even if you do not plan to use the other facilities.  Breakfast can be added on for $28 USD per person per night but we found that the 24/7 'Tick Tock' dinner in the hotel only ever came to a maximum of $15-18 USD per person (not including tip), we loved their chocolate chip pancakes.  The room was very very small, barely could accommodate the twin beds with enough room to walk around them without doing yourself an injury.  The bathroom was even smaller but it had the basics you might need. However after the 1st day and our use of the provided toiletries they were never;3
The location is a short walk to Universal, which is the main reason to choose this hotel. Finding the parking lot was ridiculous! Navigation systems will take you to the Universal parking lot with their address. The hotel was clean. Walls are very thin. You can hear talking and TV, which is a bummer. Don't pay the extra money for the executive level!!! There aren't any perks. The complimentary breakfast was very minimal. You will have to upgrade for $10 a person. Overall, the hotel serves its purpose.;3
The hotel is very close to Universal Studios and City Walk and provides shuttle transportation.  It's an ideal location for those planning on spending their time at Universal Studios.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel and guest rooms were in need of some updating.  Daily self parking fee seemed high.;3
We wasnt expecting a fridge in our room but it came in great handy for storing drinks and some breakfast foods. We would of liked a map of the hotel floor or some more information at check in regarding the amenities to use. We had to figure out where the toilets/shower/kitchen were by wondering around our floor. The hotel is in a great location, 2 minutes walk from Hammersmith tube. Plenty of food places near by and we having a tesco in the tube station was handy. We didnt have our room cleaned which we didnt expect on a 2 night stay. All in all we would stay here again.;3
Stayed here while attending a tradeshow at Piers 92/94. Great location...walking distance from Piers and a stone's throw to Central Park. Great reataurants on either side of the hotel. Unfortunately my reservation was somehow cancelled and I feel that I got a last resort room. It was on the first floor with the building's AC unit right outside the window. The view was of a wall. The room AC unit was MacGyver'd with an aftermarket control and sounded like a rock polisher if I tried to use it so I kept it turned off. The shower looked as though it once had a sliding glass door on it but no more!  The rain head was nice but I had to throw a towel on the floor to protect the door and trim from rotting even further. The ironing board in the room is good if you need to iron clothes;3
We were quite content with our stay at the Jane until we woke up with bed bug bites all over. I know this is something that could happen anywhere - but the response from management was disappointing but the staff who helped with our luggage were very friendly and helpful.   Rooms were clean and so were the shared bathrooms, and the location of the hotel was very good. Had we not had the bed bugs experience we would probably have recommended this place due to good value for money.;3
Beautiful lobby, great elevators and great location. Unfortunately I was on a floor with loud people who left their doors wide open until late at night. I got the impression that they live there. Bedroom was okay, but bathroom was circa 1962. Lots of grout missing and cracked tiles on walls. Not sure if Tick Tock diner is owned by hotel, but the people were not friendly or helpful. Customers were complaining.;3
We have stayed at this hotel March,21 through March, 25. The hotel is located near the Universal City that has nice City Walk area and next to the Universal Studios Hollywood Park.  Location of this hotel is really nice: close to 101 Highway and next to the metro station.  It provides good access to all LA landmarks and/or attractions, either by metro or car.      We had a great food selection and good quality food at the buffet ($48-$50 per person). It works only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.      I believe that the hotel and rooms are a little bit outdated (at least our room) and probably need some cosmetic updates to it. Carpet needs good cleaning, wallpaper fixing. Our shower did not work properly at all.  We stayed on Executive floor, which is on the high floor and had a;3
I booked a superior twin room here for me and my mother.  When we arrived Jerry said he would give us a great room with a view.  Well we got the view of Broadway, and the noise to go with it, but the room was so tiny there was nowhere to put our clothes, or suitcases.  And the bathroom was really a closet - hopeless for two people.  I complained immediately but as the hotel was full apparently, we could not be moved until the following day.  The next room was much larger with a closet for a wardrobe and a sofa.  However, it was also on the 2nd floor right above where the rubbish men come at midnight and 4am - Room 215 - do not go there if you want a good night's sleep. Also despite the L'Occitane toiletries, there is no kettle in the room so you have to use Starbucks or Duane's;3
If you are visiting Universal Studios and are just looking for somewhere close to rest your head then the location of this hotel is perfect. It's under a 10 minute walk to get to City Walk and the gates of the theme park. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are new however the decor is rather dated from the pale green textured wall paper, to the brown carpet. The rooms are a decent size but the bathroom is small. Rooms have an empty fridge which is great for storing snacks and water to take to Universal Studios.   The pool area is nice enough and the hot tub was good. The restaurant at the hotel was rather average but as we arrived late in the evening, it was good enough to fill the void. The lifts are very, very, very slow and you are often left waiting for 5 minutes to get;3
This was an average hotel.  Not to clean, not to dirty.  Rooms could use a makeover.  Noone one was overly accommodating, noone was rude.  Location was great for what we wanted to do.  Price was affordable.;3
This is a bargain for price in combination to subway proximity. Its clean enough to not bother me. No bugs or anything that would gross  anybody out. The surrounding area is a bit to be desired .Never the less , I felt safe and I was walking by myself.;3
Positives: Beautiful lobby Good location Staff very friendly Suites offer comfortable amount of space  Negatives: Rooms and bathrooms especially very much in need of remodeling very poor workout center under-staffed to answer calls from room (i.e. calling to get wake up call or ice for room took multiple attempts or were just never answered);3
This hotel has a great location, great attitude and great staff.  The rooms are old-school small and the hotel could use a remodel to freshen its experience, but its still a great place for the money.    Great place.;3
The location is great, literally across the street from the Lincoln Center, and many great restaurants.  We love being in that area, it is less congested than Times Square yet you are close enough to the shows.  It is easier to drive to since it is upper west side.  The hotel itself is in need of updates but with that probably comes price increase.  The beds and pillows are not really comfortable but the room is a good size and the bathroom is decent, great shower.  We love the lobby bar, lots of people watching and great drinks.  The staff throughout the hotel is excellent.  If you are ok with an older hotel this would work, but if you are looking for a Marriott this is not for you... We would stay again because the location outweighs anything we may dislike.  This was our;3
small but neat n clean rooms.  paying for a Hostel so no need to expect like a Hotel, good washrooms, and kitchen but NO AIRCON or FAN in room, friendly and helping staff, sometimes you may find bugs in the bed.;3
The hotel is nice.  Good location, in close proximity to the subways.   The bar was closed 4 of the 5 nights we were there because of private parties, so that was a bummer.  Our room was VERY SMALL.   We had a bunkbed room.  50 square feet!   We knew it would be small, but it was REALLY small.   The only TVs available were at the end of the beds, and the beds were so small we had to get in our own bed and watch them separately.  Not what I prefer on vacation.   Our room service was pretty bad.   The maid did not change our sheets until the night before we left.  We called the front desk and asked if they would do it and the said they would.  We told them we were leaving at noon.....we returned at 7:30 PM and she was cleaning the room next door.  She hadn't gotten to us yet....;3
"While the photos look great the rooms do not live up to the hype and are outdated. True it is in a good place not far from Times Square but this hotel and others have started to charge for anything they can get away with. Most hotels offer free wi-fi but this hotel not only charges for it the problems I had connecting to the internet in the room were frequent. There is a good security in place but I would recommend another hotel that doesnt feel the need to charge you for things that should be included in the room price. There is a ""resort fee"" per night of $10 then tax on top, they will argue you can use the gym/wi-fi and their business centre which is a small room with 3 computers.";3
wouldn't stay again  , ac/heat unit very old and didn't work properly, refridgerator didn't work good , paint was peeling om the ceiling in the bathroom , light fixture falling out of the ceiling , very large cockroach in bathroom 2 days in a row. elevators hardly worked;3
Positives first: Fairly clean, nice area.  Negatives: Didnât get any housekeeping for the duration of the stay (3 nights) which would have been nice during a heatwave. The staff was not exactly unfriendly but very uninterested. Walls are paperthin and when you live next to people from a certain Southern European country who are notoriously noisy, that is an issue.   Overall, Iâm satisfied, but will not choose this hotel again.;3
The hotel was clean enough and had adequate accommodations, but the price doesn't match what they provide. I expected a higher end hotel for what I paid. The cost of breakfast was $35 per person, which is way too high. I am used to having breakfast included in the price of a hotel, so this was a steep extra cost to an already expensive hotel. Also, there is nothing nearby to give you options for food. It is close to the airport, which is why I chose this hotel.;3
Excellent service, especially doorman. Decent location near Theatres and subway stop. Room size average. Able to easily park car a block away. Terrible bed-old, soft, lumpy. Cannot recommend sorely because of bad bed.;3
The rooms are nice, bathrooms terrific, beds very comfortable, and the location is very convenient if you're visiting Universal Studios (which is why we chose to stay here). But, in spite of our booking being made 3 months in advance, we didn't receive adjoining rooms as requested, there is no shuttle bus service from the airport, and the elevators were being repaired while we were there which was an inconvenience. For a supposedly 5 star hotel I was less than impressed...;3
This hotel has a fabulous location for Universal Studios and the rooms are fairly spacious. However, the dining experience for us at breakfast left alot to be desired. We were left waiting for a ridiculously long time for a simple and uncomplicated breakfast order. Even customers who arrived at the restaurant after us were served first. When the order eventually came half of it was missing or wrong. What was more disappointing was the fact that having complained about the poor service and being assured that a manager would contact us, no-one bothered.  The other slightly disappointing aspect of this hotel is it's small pool area. Although we eventually got a bed today, we spent sometime lying on the grass. The best thing about this hotel is its location.;3
We stayed at the Days Inn on Feb 15-17/14 in room # 515.  At $200 a night it was supposed to be a bargain in New York but I was surprised on how little you get for $200 in New York. The room was clean except for cob webs on the cieling. The room was dated, small and the AC didn't work. On the up side it was in a very good location.  I would stay there again only because it was the cheapest hotel in the area we wanted to be but I would not brag about this place.;3
It was a great find for a cheap stay. I had to spend 2 days in the city with my grandparents, so rather than spending so much money on the hotel we tought of using it for our meals instead. This was a good find in you plan not to be at the hotel and just go and sleep at night. It has decent rooms but nothing out of this world. The service at the main lobby was kind of slow I had to do a line while the service desk person had her lunch picked up, but surprisingly after that it was very efficient. I has no special features as of the hotel in general. It was clean and had not cause any problems for us in the stay. Hope you find it comfortable!   Ps. The location is great! Right in front of central park!;3
Iâve stayed here before and some rooms are good while others are not. Looking at the escape plan on the back of the door, itâs obvious that there are a lot of really small rooms like mine but also some good sized rooms. Donât just pay the cheapest price or you might be disappointed with the room. The lobby is nice but it feels like a budget hotel walking from the lifts to the guest rooms.  Itâs noisy, difficult for me to sleep. The bathroom was basic and although I needed to step into the bath for a shower, it wasnât possible to take a bath without a bath plug.  Would I stay here again? Yes but not in a small room.;3
It is the second time we come back to the Jane.  And we love it.  Even if the music of the bar does wake us up at night during the week ends !  The atmosphere is bohemian, the look superb and the service excellent. We choose a captain's room, a great choice. Great dining room with a retro look and a superb bar. We come back the first week of February, that tells it all !  Thank you;3
Location is a win! Around the corner to Penn Station Access. Front desk workers could be friendlier and welcoming. Walls are very thin. Could hear doors closing and conversations of people in the hall ways. I would assume if I can hear them they can hear me.  Need ventilation in bathroom. When finished with hot bath the walls and ceiling would be dripping water.;3
I want to start by apologizing to the employees of this hotel - if it were based on them only this rating will be a 5 plus.  Every employee that we encountered throughout this hotel were friendly, welcoming and seemed to enjoy their job.Three stars for the physical condition of the hotel & rooms.  I understand this is an older property but older doesn't have to mean run down and dirty.  Hallways had dirty in the corners, air vents in the room had tons of dust, the couch in our room was stained and filthy, crumbs in the drawers of the desk. etc. etc.  This property could use a major deep cleaning and replacement of furniture.  We had a suite room with a balcony which was awesome but the wind just blew through the balcony door.  That is an easy fix as well.  I am disappointed in;3
We stayed here for 4 nights, the hotel is in a lovely building in a great location - right near Madison Square Gardens and Penn station. We stayed at this hotel as we found a great deal on Love Holidays that we couldn't turn down and it did the job for what we needed it for. Check in was pleasant and the staff were lovely. We had to pay $180 deposit which was fine and we were assured we would get that money back once we left the room in good condition. We took the elevator up to the 28th floor and found our room. The room was quite small, smaller than expected. We had booked a queen room and the bed certainly was not queen sized but it was very comfy. There was general wear and tear to the room and could probably do with being fixed up a little, but who really cares, you're not;3
Very friendlily staff. Rooms are just ok - bathroom beautiful and very roomy...but very ill equipped. Was trapped in shower with only 1 tiny shampoo and 1 mouthwash (which I mistook for conditioner)  for a family of 4. Only after requesting more it took 1 hour to deliver it. Very amazing breakfast buffet and most helpful and kind wait staff. The seafood buffet in the evenings was unbelievably large and comprehensive and beautifully arranged, but at times confusing with additional stations and buffet tables in the hallways outside the restaurant. Super close to Universal City Walk. Free printer use for boarding passes was a nice feature. The really big problem arrived 1 month later when I was charged an additional $200 on my card and no one could tell me what it was for until a;3
We used this hotel for a few days to attend a family celebration.  The location is lovely - very close to Central Park, convenient for good restaurants and other amenities such as the shopping at Columbus Circle.  We were prepared for a small room (as others have said, this is New York!) but were disappointed to find it rather tired, especially the bathroom.  Here the paint on the door was blistered and peeling, and the shower screen on the bath was too small to keep the water off the floor.  Lovely toiletries went some way to compensate.  Curiously there did not appear to be an option to re-use towels in the interests of the environment.  We must have arrived at a bad time as the queue to check in was longer than that for security at the airport (and this within days of the;3
Arrived at penn station from niagara, 5 min walk to hotel. 30 min walk to circle line pier, 45 min walk to one world Observatory, 10 mins to empire state. Rooms okay, safe in room, good hot water, bed comfy but compact room.;3
Hotel has good location for Lincoln centre  but needs a lot of investment- rooms old and aspects that have been âupgradedâ feel like it has been done superficially/cheaply. Premium Internet is actually pretty rubbish- in my room it struggled to stream a movie (was better one night than another).  They donât even put the two âfreeâ  water bottles in your room each day - have to collect from reception - presumably to keep the number they actually give out down.  Overall pretty disappointing - can live with on a business trip if have no choice but definitely nothing special.;3
Stayed for a week with friend.  The room was big and clean, bed was comfortable. TV is big and with no noise, maybe the best TV I've ever seen in hotels I lived.  The place was quiet and didn't feel unsafe even at night.  The price here was quite reasonable, so instead, (maybe) the staffs were not very friendly as I expected. Especially in the restaurant. Never saw them smile at all.  So, if you want a good budget, choose this place. If you wanna have a happy trip, better find somewhere else.;3
It has so much to offer but really feels as though it's coasting on its location and faded glory and facilities. We were upgraded to a suite but only because our room wasn't ready and after going away for a few hours and coming back still wasn't ready.  The biggest disappointment was that the pool was closed and that was the specific reason we chose this over other hotels.  Don't get me wrong, there is much to like-location, general feel, roof top bar, pool (if open!) and Eds Chowder House but there seems to be a lack of pride.  A desultory apology about the pool being closed and a shrug of the shoulders 3 nights into our stay when we asked if was still closed is not really good enough when the hotel markets itself significantly on having one.  The staff we interacted with;3
A very well apointed property, but it has a very limited menu and the selections are grossly overpriced for the value. I hosted a national business meeting here over two days and was generally disapointed.;3
We booked this hotel last minute on Hotel Tonight. There werenât a lot of rooms left. Room is dated but dark which ensured a good nights rest. Bathroom is tiny. Hotel staff is very helpful even though they couldnât help us with a larger room to accommodate my children. We had never stayed here before but itâs not bad if our options arenât available.;3
This hotel is old, but fairly clean Ask for non smoking room, people on floor were smoking. Spoke with desk clerk (male) said if you see someone let me know. Nothing was ever done about it.  The four days we were guest we had the odor of smoke. Plus no TV for two days. Told us the first day everything was done the second day we were told the same. That night going out to dinner talk with another guest about the TV and they had TV. Spoke with clerk at desk and he told everything still down, when I told him that I just talked with another guest and they had TV. Told me that some did have it others did not. It was not until I said I need a credit on my bill did I get action. When we came back from dinner he stopped me and told me we had TV, went to our room and put on TV nothing.;3
I loved the location. Mass Transportation real close. Times Square just seven blocks away.   Now for the room...VERY disappointing. Too small. Two beds that are too big for the room. A closet that was too deep. I would say this room was bare bones. Just one painting on the walls. The television was too small. The Direct TV kept going out of service. The photos that are shown on this website are not representative of the room I stayed in.   The biggest downer was the construction across the street that was going on at all hours of the night.  There were nights I couldnât sleep. I acknowledge thatâs not the hotelâs fault, but still...  There are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area as well as a couple 7-11s and CVS. But I couldnât find a really nice restaurant nearby. The;3
Stayed here one night for a conference in the hotel.  Overall I found the location just average.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  However the closet door was off the track and fell out!   There is no minibar in the room.  If you are a quiet sleeper, watch out.  The walls are thin here and I could hear he conversations of my neighbor pretty clearly.  The bar is convenient.  Universal City is a 5 minute walk.    If you are a Verizon wireless customer, beware... This is nearly dark territory here.  Dropped calls and slow data speeds, which has been terribly inconvenient during a business conference.;3
This hotel is an older property that has been painted and  was clean. The lobby and courtyard was nice and the pool was quaint. The rooms are clean but small. Bathroom was dated and old. We had issues with the shower the water backed up in the tub. Towels are small. The parking is gated which is good as it's in an up and coming area. This is easily accessible to downtown and to universal studios. The staff was friendly and helpful. The bar closes early most nights, but  on the weekend there is a comedy show with up and coming comics which is fun.;3
This hotel is in a great location, but is in need of a freshening. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and paint chipped off the bathroom ceiling. The rooms are so tiny and dark. The lobby is lovely. When you exit the hotel the smell of smoke hits you since thatâs were everyone goes out to have a cigarette, terrible.;3
Ok so maybe I was unlucky but the hotel was just not very nice It was clean enough, and had most facilities, but no coffee machine... in USA! Come on quite ridiculous to be charged for one. Hotel fills itself with kids who board there The diner is nice enough, but staff are rude, but not sure if that is just New York;3
The Jane is not the worst place to be. You have to be aware, that the room is very small (barely twice the sice of a small bed) and if it get's hot it's pretty sultry. Personal was okay but my room didn't get a care over the day ( I left 11 o'clock and came back in the night). Unfotunatelly there were construction under way so it was very loud in the morning.  Locations is gread. I had a view on the Statue of Liberty (not very good, but I had) and you are in the middle of everything.  Next time I will book a bigger room pay more and hope for some luck.;3
Very expensive hotel and if want to leave your language at the hotel then you should pay 3 dollars which I find it bad and I believe it should be free of charge. The hotel it self is nice with helpful stuff;3
I stayed here because of the convenience to Universal Studios. Hotel was semi clean, except for the stains on the floor. The bathroom was big and clean. The valet could be a little nicer especially if you expect a tip. Tim was the nicest bell person. He gave us all the information we needed as soon as we arrived. I do like the fact that they have a shuttle service to Universal Studios.;3
Ok let's start with the good - location, location, location. the hotel is located very close to the subway for easy trips into the centre of the city. There is a pharmacy below the hotel that stocks everything you need, there are some good nearby food outlets that are cheap and nice....  Our room was 812 it was decent enough, better than was expected when looking at the reviews of other rooms.  The bad....  The elevators are slow and there is not enough of them, so the wait to get to and from your room is more than should be expected. The swipe cards to get into our rooms constantly did not work and this was very frustrating having to get them re-set every second day.  The service I thought was quite rude also. one particular male staff member who's name I cant remember was;3
The staff was amazing, both housekeeping & front desk. Security was great! Rooms need an upgrade. The bathroom is very small & old. Iâm not a fan of shower/tubs. I prefer walk in showers. The curtains tend to stick to skin.  AC kept shutting off & didnât seem to be the desired temperature I was aiming for. TV also kept losing connection several times. The floor carpet seemed worn & old. The beds were very comfortable with clean linen.;3
Nicely located but the hotel was dark and tired. The wall paper in the hallways dark and dated. The pillows were too hard and the lighting was very poor in the rooms. Small bathroom by New York standards.;3
Two friends and I agreed to meet here to attend concerts in LA..   My friend made the booking.   I was a little skeptical when I read some of the reviews.   So, here is my take: it was previously known as the Hollywood Hotel.   It is a fairly large property on Vermont Avenue, and looks like a typical hotel out of the 60's or 70's.    But, was it rundown?   No.  It was quite obvious that considerable effort has gone into the property to renovate the facilities and there wasn't much to fault, I am plead to say.   The rates are very reasonable, which explained why the place was quite busy, and could not accomodate me for additional nights.      While I would not call the place elegant , it was much better than I expected in appearance and comfort.    Breakfast was also more than;3
We had an unexpected night here as our plans had to be changed at short notice. We were upgraded, which was nice, to an enormous bedroom, but it did smell very odd - very musty. Very noisy air con. The bathroom wasn't anything special, and I wouldn't have wanted to be there for more than the one night, but the one saving grace is the location - right next to the Lincoln Centre and very close to Central Park.;3
The room had a lot to be desired. There were no areas designated to store clothes. There wasn't even a full closet for a dress. It was very dusty and the room had very poor lighting. I had to keep calling for towels, they would never replace them.;3
We were looking for someplace cheap for one night in Manhattan.  We found The Jane was everything they advertised,  cheap and very small rooms.  The rooms were no bigger than a sleeping car on a train.  We found the rooms and shared bathrooms to very clean,  hotel staff was wonderful and helpful.  I wouldn't stay here if I was going to be in Manhattan more than one night.  Very, very tight quarters.;3
Good location within walking distance of all major attractions with nearby Starbucks and convenience store. Nice clean room but lacked storage and bathroom was a little snug. Disappointed that pool wasnât open. Would stay again.;3
This hotel is good value for money. DO not expect a very luxurious hotel on the side of Central Park. Do expect good service, nice people. The rooms are small, but very clean. Quite near some subway stations. 110th on the blue or orange line is closest. Just a bit far out of the centre, but the price of the hotel is worth it.;3
4 nights here booked through Virgin. Room was upgraded as we were celebrating my husband's 40th. Not sure what the upgrade was supposed to include? In any hotel it's purely a base for us so can't comment on any of the facilities. Excellent location. The hotel is tired in places and our room one of the smallest I've stayed in.;3
"I stayed there for one reason and one reason only - Chuck Bass ""bought"" it. What a let down!! small room, tiny bathroom, narrow hallways, super slow elevators, lousy AC. Though the bed is nice.  DO NOT GO UNLESS U REALLY LIKE CHUCK BASS";3
I bid on Priceline for a hotel in NY, and was given the Empire. I was very hesitant with my stay here because the reviews are so mixed. I was traveling with my elder parents, and worried about the noise issue. I asked for a roll-away bed, but it is not available at this hotel. Therefore, I ended up paying an extra $50 for an upgrade to a room with 2 beds, since bidding on Priceline only gives you a standard room with just 1 bed. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, no free upgrades here!  We arrived late on Friday evening, so there was a line of young adults apparently there to go to some nightclub. The lobby was playing loud music, but I asked for a quiet room, and they gave us one on the 3rd floor that faced Broadway. While the view wasnât great, it was definitely quiet. Unless;3
Clean yes, amazing location yes, downfalls in places like noisy AC, old furniture, front desk staff with limited knowledge.  I wouldn't say don't stay here, I just think it could be improved. Price was good though.;3
Nice location and great employees buy property overall is in need of updating. Looks like shortcuts are taken to keep restrooms up but overall decor is dark and dated. Windows donât appear to be double paned as the noise level was extreme. I feel that money is better spent at a more up-to-date hotel.;3
We had a twin with private bathroom, it was small but did the job. The room was clean enough, bedding and towels were clean. It was a bit worn.  Staff were pleasant. The road was very quiet even though it's only a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith Tube & bus station and high street.  We had a fridge in our room, it was old but functional. We didn't use the shared areas much but they seemed clean and functional. I wouldn't come here for a holiday but it was good enough for what we needed, a cheap overnight stay for work. We were able to leave luggage in the luggage room after check out which was helpful when we were leaving.;3
This hotel is in a great location, very convenient to get to many places in the city. The lobby is beautiful! The room was a good size, had a jr. suite with two beds and a sitting area. The furnishings were a bit worn and some things broken, the bathroom wasn't very clean (especially the bathroom door which is a frosted glass that was filthy). The front desk staff was less than friendly and not very welcoming, just seemed bothered at any interaction. Not sure that I would stay again, with a little effort on customer service, cleanliness and updates to room furnishings.;3
We booked directly with the hotels website and obtained an excellent deal as we were visitors from outside the USA.  In fact we saved around 50% off the base rate for our stay of 5 nights. We had a spacious room with two king size beds.  Nice small pool.  Complimentary breakfast! The hotel is very close to the Metro system and also close to main bus routes too.  A day ticket for travel on any bus or metro was about $5.  Great value,  We too the metro into  LA town and also a bus from just around the corner to Santa Monica. The room was adequate, if a little dated.  But at the price we paid I would not complain.  Its 4 stops on the metro to Hollywood  walk of Fame.  We drove to the hotel from Las Vegas.  We parked in the grounds of the hotel.  We paid $22 a night to park which I;3
The rooms are clean but quite old and a bit rusty in the shower. No wifi, which was very unfortunate. The location is next to the park, but there's no real view to the park. The staff is really nice though and helpfull. I wouldn't go back.;3
It is not clear if this is a hotel (as adverstised) or a hostel (as it says the sign at the front of the building). But location is the best of this place: near Penn Station, close to everything. My room was tiny, but it has everything I needed: a comfortable bed, a big tv screen, good internet connection. Little space to keep things, only two hangers on the closet, and a small bathroom were sometimes it was difficult to move around (literally).;3
I canât say I was disappointed in this hotel, because I had read the comments on TripAdvisor before arrival (someone else booked for me) and was warned. But I can say that everything negative that has been written about this hotel is true â and more.  I was originally given a room with an air conditioner that did not function. But it was the middle of the summer! The temperature outside was 35 degrees celsius / 90 Fahrenheit. The room needed a functioning air conditioner desperately. The curtains were torn and the shades were broken. Not good for a room full of afternoon light. I complained, but was told there were no other rooms, I complained louder â and they relented, but only when someone went up to see if I was telling the truth. Go figure.  The rest of this review is about;3
Stayed here for a business meeting. While location is very convenient, I was disappointed in hotel. I just did not find the room comfortable. It was very hot in the room despite the fact that it was cold outside, I had the AC on and window open. It is European style bedding, so no flat sheet just fitted sheet and comforter. Could smell cigarette smoke coming from somewhere, possibly in through window despite being on the 10th floor. Bar staff, housekeeping and bellman were excellent though...;3
This hotel has potential, but they need to repair the broken spare elevators. The two that work are extremely small and are used by guests and staff. They also need to replace the carpeting on some (or all) floors in the halls and rooms. The queen suite I stayed in was better than average, but was costly. The regular rooms that I have stayed in before need renovation and this hotel could get a better than average rating should they accomplish this.;3
I stayed here for 3 nights. It was very close to the subway/metro and was great since I didn't rent a car. Free wifi was fast, the bed was very comfy, and the rooms were quiet. Good value for LA.;3
Convenient to the airport. We had a quiet dinner at the restaurant to unwind from the long flight. Service was appreciated and the menu was limited but the meal was not bad. Even got them to deliver a bowl of ramen noodles from the shop outside the restaurant. Frequent shuttle service and for an early departure with flight crews, having 4 buses first thing in the morning made a difference.;3
We booked an alcove room 221 on Oct 12 - 13 Pros  Excellent front staff Excellent location to universal studios (walking distance and free shuttle) Cons We discovered alcove room was BELOW the lobby I.e. When we took elevator we actually had to go down, not up  Hence no view at all in fact our view was of tree branches and what looked to be a back lane or some sort of receiving area The biggest turn off was in morning I went to make a coffee (machine was located in bathroom) before our early morning flight and discovered a number of ants crawling around the coffee maker (I assume the sugar packages that were beside it attracted them) some beside the bathtub too - this is probably why we won't return though maybe higher up the view would be worth the price and maybe no ants No;3
While there may be a little too much fresh paint here and there and our room did not have a bathroom fan, the staff is very pleasant and the sleep is restful.   The location is remarkable. Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, Central Park, The Smith for breakfast and Buloudâs bar, epicerie and restaurant. The Subway is also blocks away which is super convenient to get to Times Square and Penn Station.;3
I had read the many reviews of this Hotel and having booked through another booking service and not directly with the Hotel I heeded the advice of others and tried to email them at least twice to ensure they had my reservation even though I had the email to prove it and had paid a 10% reservation fee. No reply to email sent to the web site so just before leaving tried the other email on the Hotel site and received a confirmation notice. Just as well because when we arrived from the airport with printed out reservation in hand we were told that we were not on their system and the Hotel was full. It wasn't until I provided proof with the 'confirmation' email from the Hotel that they took us seriously. The receptionist was very nice and tried to sort it out by ringing the Manager;3
We spent a few days at Hilton to go to Universal Studios with the kids. The 5 minute walk from the hotel to the Universal Studio entrance is perfect for this. However, the attitude of the reception staff left much to be desired at the price we paid. Not only did they seem disengaged bordering rude but they seemed to be having trouble working with eachother. We experienced long waiting times more than once as only 1 or 2 were manning the reception and even though that person tried to call for colleagues to come out and assist notning happened and he was left apologizing that no one came to assist us. Waiting 15 minutes for a check-out as number 1 in line is just uacceptable. Furthermore, our key cards somehow canceled themselves and getting new ones took time as the only person;3
I have stayed here a few times and though it is not fancy, we found it to be clean, very safe and very convenient to broadway and some of our favorite food/beer places. I have never had a bad experience at this hotel and have never seen bugs or had a dirty room! My brother and his wife stay 5 minutes away and pay $400 a night...Like someone else said, when you go to the city, you dont sit around your room...;3
"I had to take an early train out of Penn Station so The New Yorker was the perfect place to stay and the rate was great for a Friday night during the summer. The front desk got a couple of my requests wrong. They forgot to put my sister on the reservation and they put me on the 38th floor despite asking for a room on a lower floor. But they had upgraded me to a larger room and the views were spectacular so I cannot complain! The room feels a bit old and worn but clean. I liked the security at the hotel -- they were vigilant when it came to checking to make sure everyone who approached the elevator had a key. The people who staffed the front desk were friendly, efficient and patient. So while the room was more on the ""just okay"" side, why would you go to Manhattan to spend a lot";3
If this hotel would be anywhere outside Manhattan it would probably not get even 2 stars from me.  The staff is the worst feature of this place. Most of them, not all, are rude,  New York style rude.  This is upsetting. Rooms are small and dark.  Bathroom is from the 60's if not earlier, and water temp. is not stable, one of the most annoying things that a hotel can have. The lobby is as hectic as the Penn station on a Friday afternoon, hundreds of people just walk in and out and around the lobby. certainly not a place to relax. They have about 1500 rooms, and it is not an intimate place, as one can imagine, and will not  give you any relaxation from the craziness and noise of midtown Manhattan outside the doors. Having said all that, the location is a winner, just a few blocks;3
"Good for a solo business traveller that gets a deal via priceline.  Otherwise, if you are paying full price, you'll probably be disappointed.  My room was small and had a strong chlorine smell.  The doormen are creepy, not made for the job.  My room was right next to elevator, but thankfully I didn't hear them; even when the very loud in-room A/C was off.";3
Great location and friendly staff, however the hotel itself and rooms are very dated, grubby in places and could do with an update. Rooms get a cursory once over but could do with a deep clean. Also no tea/coffee making facilities in rooms.;3
"The Hilton Los Angeles / Universal City is in a great location if you are going to Universal Studios and plan to eat all of your meals in the park or in Universal City Walk.  For that reason, the hotel commands an expensive per night rate.  However, if I am going to pay this rate, I would expect better upkeep.  The bathroom faucet squirted all over the sink area; the fold open doors to the TV cabinet kept closing while watching the TV; the coffee pot kept shutting off prematurely; and the most frustrating part of the experience is the elevators are extremely slow.  Many of the indicator lights are burnt out, so you do not know if the elevator is going up or down and you don't know what floor you're on unless you stick your head out and read the lettering on the side of the doors";3
The room was small and very dark, the internet was slow, TV remote was missing, bathroom wasn't totally clean, each day it seemed as if a different elevator was broken, the door men were less than friendly (barely said hello) and at checkout they weren't able to give me a copy of the bill (which I needed to submit since it was a business trip...). I was here on business and it was a very convenient location for meetings and overall the stay was fine but I wouldn't recommend staying here if you can find an alternative.;3
It is what it is, and that is a cheap (by NYC standards) place to stay in a great location. There are no frills here such as coffee, WASHCLOTHES, or cable tv. We stayed in room 710. It was tiny. Just enough room for the queen size bed and dresser. Don't plan to watch much tv if you speak only English, most channels are not in English. Interesting enough, they get Fox and the home shopping channels. As other reviews stated, the elevator is slow and small. Slow enough we took the stairs down from the seventh floor a few times and beat the people waiting. However, I didn't come to The Greatest City in the World to stay in my hotel. It was perfect for us. It was a place to shower and sleep. The bed was comfortable and the location was amazing. It is in a quite neighborhood and I;3
The Art Deco hotel is in a great location but is somewhat tired.  Some of the staff were simply doing a job and struggled to extend the courtesy to guests that one would normally expect. The addition of a hefty resort fee of well over $30 per night was both unexpected and hard to justify given the quality of the hotel.  Rooms are understandably small given the location but they are also a little dirty and could do with a refresh and better daily servicing by the cleaning staff.;3
Stayed for 4 nights this month (October 2011). Good price - booked through Expedia and got a great rate for fairly last minute. Upon check in the reception staff were extremely rude to the point where they did not even make an effort to greet you. Awful, awful service. They did, however, allow us to check in at 10am when check in isn't normally until 3pm so that was great. Breakfast was basic but good and was included in the price of the room. Decent size room and very comfortable beds. Bathroom amenities were fabulous (shampoo and conditioner). Very close to the nearest Metro station (about 3 minute walk). Strangely, the hotel didn't have a 'do not disturb' sign for the door so we had to tell housekeeping not to clean the room. They ignored the request and did it anyway which;3
We stayed here for 10 nights in december 2015 me my partner and our 2 year old.. the outcome.. it was OK. The location was great but the room was very small. We travelled to NY last year around the same time but stayed further out and wanted something a little more central this year.. In future we would stay further away for a better hotel. Our room had 2 double beds, so we thought it would be pretty spacious.. also from the pictures we seen on the hotel website we were confident we would have a comfortable stay. Not at all. The room was tiny with just enough space to move around the beds. The bathroom decor was poor. There was paint pealing off the bath and all in all the whole room needed updating. The draught from the windows was really cold! And with a 2 year old this is;3
"Some minor inconveniences; helpful, friendly staff although they were slow at some things.  Great location although they lacked some things (like ATM in lobby) because they were ânearbyâ.  No self-serve ice machines; had to wait a long time (an hour) and many calls to the front desk to have ice brought to room).  Quiet room; in my opinion, rather garish decor in hotel.";3
Having stayed here before, we re-visited the Ameritania but probably wouldn't a third time sadly! Location is excellent but this hotel is now very tired and not worthy of the 'Boutique Hotel' title it once was. Comfortable, clean bed  and a good shower - that apart the rest is showing its age and could do with an extreme make over. More of a hostel than a hotel. Service was reasonable and the staff pleasant.;3
I've stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during my visit to Universal Studio. Actually the location is the only sale point. Below are the pros and cons.  Pros: 1. Very close to Universal studio. 10 mins walk. 2. The hotel faciliy is modern and abundant. 3. Easy parking.  Cons: 1. Staff was not that friendly. 2. Actually it is a quite crowded hotel given so many tourists.  Anyway, if I go to Universal Studio again I will stay in this hotel.;3
We stayed one night, the price was low, location good, staff nice, elevator inconvenient, bed and bath OK. View of park really nice. Room too hot with no guest controls. If you want to be on upper west side, near Cathedral, Central Park, Riverside Park, Columbia U, this is a good bet.;3
Nice hotel Rooms compact but tastefully decoated.  Central park is close by, as is starbucks!  Cool roof top bar.  Lots of additional extra's available to use and buy in room eg crips's wine, travel plug. All prices are stated on the items. We purchased the travel plug as we forgot to bring one and when we looked in the pharmacy they where more expensive to buy.;3
Positives: The hotel is in a great location. The lift attendants and the staff at Tick Tock restaurant were fairly nice. The rooms are very clean  Cons: The room was very small and outdated. The reception staff were appalling.  Too little information given at check in. Questions that were asked were given curt responses that did not provide the correct information. Anything that stopped them rattling through their scripted check in or out speech at pace was frowned upon. They lacked the basic customer service skills. Awful.;3
Stayed here for three nights - great position In New York but rather dated and small. Stayed at Westin Grand Central two years ago and far better hotel. Bathroom very old not a great shower amazing view of Empire State Building. Security in hotel good and helpful staff;3
We stayed one night in August to take advantage of early park hours at Universal Studios.  The hotel is a four star but a well used 4 star.  Our tub was peeling which was odd ( must have been covered at some point) and the base boards were pretty kicked up.  Other than that, it was  good hotel. Nice views, clean lobby and efficient check in.    We found it was faster just to walk to Universal Studios then it was to wait for the shuttle.  It was close enough, the walk was about 7 minutes and there is an elevated walk way over the road so no busy streets to cross.  The proximity to the park made it worth the stay.  No drive in the morning so no traffic to deal with.  Overnight parking is expensive but you can leave your car in the lot until 6pm the next day  The restaurants were;3
My wife and I stayed here in June 2017. On arrival we were met by pleasant and friendly reception staff.  Our room was small, but we were aware that space can be a premium in New York.  We did have a few issues, albeit they were resolved by a friendly, and compassionate management team.  Because of the issues we had, we were given another room. A much larger room with a good view. So we were very satisfied.  The Hotel prides itself on its Art Deco style, and there are many details that show this.  The Tic Tic diner which is attached to the hotel was not for us, as we thought the service was not as responsive as we would have liked, or the food to our satisfaction. There are lots of other food establishments in the area.  There is a good sized lounge area with free wi-fi. There;3
The day we checked in the one of our party put a bottle of water on the reception counter whilst getting out her passport.  The girl behind the counter waved her hand in a gesture to remove the bottle.. no words spoken just a swiping hand gesture.  I found this extremely rude.  The same girl was totally unapproachable during our stay to a point where if she was on reception we would avoid going until someone else was there.  I have to point our here that the majority of reception staff were very pleasant and helpful.     The hotel itself is in a good location although it is very expensive to use their services which I guess is a NYC thing.  I personally would not return here simply due the fact that one member of the reception team is letting the whole hotel down with her bad;3
For a night at Lincoln Centre, this is the perfect place.  But be prepared for a late 60s sort of experience....Rooms are very small. bathroom is tiny.  Bed are on the very very firm side and air con sounds like a tank revving its engine ...... Very New York.  For a quick overnight. Not a long stay.;3
A friend and I shared a bunk room for a week at the Jane. Given we had lots of luggage (being a long holiday and winter), we had a great deal of trouble fitting our bags and ourselves in the room. This is not suitable for people who are even slightly claustrophobic. Often it was like a game of gridlock but we eventually we worked out a system. The person on the top bunk was always really hot and the room was pretty stuffy even with the window open. We liked the quirky decor in the room and big mirror. The location was great and we got to see a new side of NY that we hadn't experienced in Mahattan. The staff were friendly and helpful. They were very tolerant, understanding and helpful while we came to terms with the size of the room! Bathrooms are clean and spacious but shared.;3
Recently stayed at the Empire on a last minute whim trying to get into the city ahead of a snowstorm.  The last minute price was fantastic but I'm not sure I would want to pay much more.  I stayed here two years ago and didn't get much sleep because of issues with noise coming from the heat/ac system and we also had minimal hot water.  I had high hopes that in two years some of those things would be fixed and was excited to give the hotel another try, however, we were up most of the night because of noise from the heater.  That said, the staff is very friendly, the location can't be beat to spend time in the park or see Lincoln Center and there are great restaurants nearby.  Would love to try it again once some of the facilities are updated.;3
Great central location just a couple blocks from central park and walking distance to times square and Rockefeller center.  lots of great restaurants near, and a starbucks and little store right on the corner.  Beds were comfortable. Very small rooms which I hear is common for NYC, only complaint is bathroom is super small with no counterspace.  But, in nyc, don't spend much time there but to sleep so worked out okay.  wifi was not the best if your there for a work trip.   Overall, good experience for the price.;3
The shutter was cold and there was no way to make it even lukewarm. Otherwise the hotel was good.  Location is on a great spot close  to Columbus circle and easy to get to wherever you want. If it wasn't fur the cold water I would give it a great review.;3
I stayed here for a long weekend with a friend. It's in a great location off Columbus Circle, across from Lincoln Center, and just to the west of Central Park. Overall, the stay was very nice and the hotel is comfortable. There are no significant negatives, but it just wouldn't rank as better than average.   Entering the hotel, you are greeted by the oh-so-trendy NYC dark lobby. It made me think of that scene at the end from Great Expectations, where you just want to tear down the enormous drapes and let some sunshine in. Coming from the UK, we got in about 1 pm, but had to wait over two hours for our room - and it wasn't even ready at check-in time of 3 pm. And we had to nag the front desk to get a move on. Oh, well, we enjoyed a drink or two on the roof terrace. It's a big;3
This is the perfect hotel to stay in if you are going to be going to Lincoln Center, it's just across the street.  The lobby to the hotel is nice but the hallway to our room needed some updating and cleaning.  Our room was a junior suite and was spacious.  It has a fully stocked mini bar which is nice when so many hotels are doing away with them.  As always in NYC my number one complaint are the elevators.  It is impossible to get an elevator down near checkout time because all of them are always full and only 2 elevators were running.  We waited about 10 minutes and then just walked the 7 flights down.;3
We booked the New Yorker based on the location that it had, right on the 8th Avenue, next to Madison Square Garden. Perfect location and great area to be in. The Front Desk team was great and very helpful, same as the Concierge, that helped us with maps and booking an airport shuttle. We paid for a room with a view and we got one, but that is where the fun began. Corridors look a bit shabby, doors are still the old ones and just painted on top in a very cheap way. Room is extremely small, while in the pictures on the website it looked at least to say huge, so don't be deceived. The A/C was blowing right above the bed which made both me and my girlfriend extremely sick. It was extremely cold in the room so you had to keep the A/C on heating on. The windows were not taken care of;3
The main good thing about the Empire is its location.   The hotel is not the best decorated, serviced or maintaned but has everything you need for a great time in NYC.   As it's extremely cold in NY atm, the free use of wifi in the lobby is good as you can retreat there with a starbucks.   Nothing is complimentary in the hotel. No water, coffee or dressing gowms etc. This was my first visit to NY so im not sure whether this is standard but considering we paid a lot of money I did expect something.    We did have a leak in our room and they did deal with it very well. They upgraded us. The rooms are good. Our first bed was very comfortable and was appreciated after a lot of walking. Our room was cold but again I would rather it chilly than too stuffy.  Location! You are ten;3
Only location was perfect and rest was between poor and average , rooms are so narrow , no kettle or compimenetary water at rooms, no employee is wearing a name tag, doorman were perfect and helpful, I asked for key no size bed and I got two small beds;3
Great location, my room was tiny but very calm. Housekeeping staff very good. Concierges very very bad: actually I don't think there are any. Overall service quite poor at the front desk except one guy who was helpful.;3
Booked two nights at this hotel on Priceline.  I expected the room to be small but it was much smaller than I expected.  The bathroom was even smaller and outdated.  The shower went from hot to warm to cold to scolding and back every few seconds which wasn't really an enjoyable experience.  The bed was extremely uncomfortable.  The one great thing about this hotel was the location.  Absolutely in the centre of everything.  Quick 5-10 min walk almost anywhere and literally right next to the subway.  They also charge a rather large daily fee for Internet, business centre and gym.;3
Gorgeous Art Deco style and great location.   I booked a room with a city view, but when I arrived I was told there were none available. Not sure how this happened when the hotel had several weeks notice.;3
I have a mixed review for this hotel. On a surface level it was nice: clean, nice looking, amazing location. It is not kid friendly. The staff was very friendly and nice, but hotel service was spotty at best. We had someone come to our room 3 times to just change out a blanket. We reached out to the hotel front desk regarding babysitting services (listed in the room book) and never got a reply - nothing. There is no room service/food, no microwave, no room in the mini fridge for anything but the pay-per-drinks. The TV did not include any premium channels and you have to pay $13 for any on demand options. The TV picture was pixelated/spotty so it would have been a waste to purchase anything. There were also movies advertised that were not available to purchase. If you have;3
The hotel is OK, but the rooms are too small. Often the housekeeping service didn't leave any soap, shower gel or tissues in our room and when they start cleaning early in the morining they were too nosy in the hallways and they call me every single day asking about around what time they should come back to do the room.;3
We have just come back from New  York on the 9 Jan 2008 after spending 5 nights there.  This hotel  was fine! We had no problems, i was VERY apprehensive after reading the reviews, as we stayed neared the theatre district last time, but we were pleasently surprised. Ok so its not The Plaza, but it doesn't pretend to be. It is a bit out of the way , but we were grateful at night as it was very quiet and we had a room on the Central Park West side and slept with the window open.   The subway is a great way to get round, there is a station on 103rd street only 3 blocks away(approx 5mins to walk) We got a 7 day pass for $24. It took approx 25 mins to get to Battery park which is right at the other end  The room its self was fine too small but comfortable, it you are not expecting a;3
The room was nice and it was perfectly located next to the attraction. The easiest way to and from was to take the shuttle which we discovered on the way back. Room service food was mediocre . Getting out of the parking garage, my card didnât work.   Convenience is what you are paying but I think there are better hotels nearby for less , which I will use in the future.;3
Located in upper west side.Very close to subway, restaurants, cafes, etc. They have a nice bar in the rooftop which had local people queuing up everyday.  The room was very very small, you can't even open your luggage properly and the room was very very hot even on winter time when outside temperature was 7degrees. Overall, it was OK. will I go back to this hotel again? probably not.;3
This hotel has a lot of pros and cons. Pros: great location, three restaurants, subway entrance next to building, next to Penn Station (train station), next to Madison Square Garden, amazing view of Empire State Building, in some rooms, nice water pressure, each unit has own air and heat control (amazing for 1000 plus room hotel), good security, 24 hour diner (pre pandemic), for New York, the rooms are a decent size. Room service was offered but only for the diner. There are some major cons though. The walls are paper thin. You can hear a lot of noise outside. This is an old building (historic) and can give a creepy vibe. Only two elevators were working out of the ten they have, and service elevators (there are six of them) were not offered to guests. Long lines to get to rooms.;3
Totally average hotel, very well located near the subway. Concierge was nice. Rooms are small and not very clean. Front rooms have nice view of central park (though no overview).;3
It is a good Hotel in a good area but the room too noisy because of air conditioner machine of building. The bathroom is small and not comfortable and perhaps need a lot of  maintenance.The personal is very friendly,;3
It is an iconic hotel in a great area but in need of a refurbishment and a good deep clean.  The staff are good, but not great.  Wifi was sporadic and breakfast was just OK but for a continental breakfast I feel it was really lacking in choice.  Overall it was fine, but not as good as it could be.  This was a business trip so I wasn't too bothered but I would not have been happy to have paid out my own money for this experience.;3
I, unfortunately, had a family event and it was the UN General Assembly week and they had doubled the rates.  The room was about 12' by 11' and you had to go outside the room to change an idea.  The lamp on the desk had a plug but it would not hold the connection for the iPhone charger. The bathroom shower was the only good thing about the room if you did not mind the wait for hot water and you like strong showers.    The positive was the staff was very nice.  There are many cheaper places to eat in the area Food at the hotel was about average.;3
Door to room and door to bathroom both rattled ALL night due to wind drafts. Horrible sleeping from that noise, as sounded like people were trying to get in. Bathroom window doesn't stay shut, letting in wind and cold air. Internet so slow we gave up.  Property is tired, especially hallways.  Overpriced given all of that.;3
The hotel is in a great location and people are friendly. However, they put me in the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The place was clean and the bed was comfortable, but it was smaller than most cabins on ships.;3
When I checked in the front desk clerk advised me that I had somehow booked an accessible room when I booked my vacation through Southwest Airlines. He advised it was best to book directly. I advised I was ok with this but if he needed the room I would be ok with switching. He said that to switch would cost more. I said no thanks and kept the room I had paid for. He kept reiterating that I should always book with Hilton sort of sounding like I had done something wrong that I got an accessible room without needing it (which this was not done on purpose that was the one that was booked for me). The room was only different that it had handrails in bathroom and extra space.   As for the room, it was comfortable and clean. My only complaint was that there was no clock. I found it;3
November 2022. Hotel in great location right next to Penn Station with easy access to subway and walkable to many restaurants and Times Square area. Lobby and communal areas are well kept and spacious. However, we booked a single queen room and were really disappointed. The room was clean but both bathroom and bed area were worn and very outdated. Noisy overnight as well with loud  guests in nearby rooms. If you get a cheap price then this is fine but accommodation standards in the room we had was way below expectations for price we paid.;3
Standard Queen Room is extremely small. Details like dents on walls, holey sheets, poor furniture design to store guests' clothes that stay more than 2 nights, old carpet, old-noisy not working air conditioning system.;3
Great location, but rooms are poorly lit and furnishings seam weathered and outdated. I think it's time for a new look! Bed was very uncomfortable and my heater was not working well. I have stayed here many times, but it is mostly because of the location and not necessarily the accommodations.;3
To be completely honest, I was told the size of the room but was not told there were no shelves or places to organize my personal items.  Had to use the window sill to put my make up.  The shower was difficult to use and only has one half door. which meant that the 2 x 3 bathroom was fully wet when I finished showering.  I suggested to the hotel that they remove their Sell items and place some type of shelves to put your personal items.  We had fun on our trip in spite of the barely sufficient hotel.;3
"The public areas of this place are in disrepair and not clean.  There is trash in the hallways, holes in the walls, pieces of carpet duct taped together.  The lobby is filled with furniture that looks like it came from a garage sale. The rooms are clean, but furniture is old and shoddy.  Not even a flat screen TV, and the TV only had a small selection of channels. All that being said, it was surprisingly quiet and the bed was really comfortable.  I slept like a rock each night. The location is great; 1, 2 and 3 subways are 1 block away and there are restaurants and shops nearby + a drugstore on the corner. Biggest disappointment is that I left something in the room at checkout.  I realized it later in the day and have called 3 times, left 3 messages and still not heard back from";3
I booked through hotels.com and got a room for under $100 per night including breakfast, which I thought was a good deal, given LA hotels can be pricey.  The positives: room was clean, bed was comfy and shower was hot. The buffet breakfast was fine, a simple hearty (not healthy) breakfast of waffles, toast, cereal, juice, tea and coffee.  The negatives, its not in Hollywood. Its not near shops or fast food joints, its out of the way. The subway was a couple blocks away which was handy, however it wasn't really that safe late walking back late at night. Staff seemed uninterested, however I expected that, reading other traveller reviews, so was prepared for this.  In short, you get what you pay for, but if you are on a budget and don't mind being out of the way then this place is;3
Checking-in was a breeze for us which I truly appreciate.  We were also alloted a good size bedroom and the bed are really comfortable. Location is great as well, and the shuttle to & from Universal Studios is a big plus.   I think that the additional fee for parking and wifi connection is such a bummer. This two things are a common add on service given freely to checked in guests in almost all the different locations we've been to.   Also, a big turn off was that the room we were given, although has good size, is very near the gym. So the guests who uses the gym very early and late at night, when they drop the barbell (i think), the vibration and sound reaches our bedroom. I was woken up early in the morning by this and had to force myself to sleep in spite of this matter late;3
During my stay it was high season and the room costed +500$ a night, as metropole hotelroom prices yield. So in this case I must considerer price-value more conciously as ever before. LOCATION-LOCATION-LOCATION and well cleaned!  Furthermore: the hotel is poorly maintaned and service is very unpersonal;3
Clean, nice kingsize beds, lovely roof-terras and situated in a beautiful & safe surrunding close to everything. No closet for your clothes, had to stay in the suitcase the Whole week.  Not isolated, you heard the street, the guests next to you and in the hall...;3
I stayed here with 4 of my friends, basically you get what you pay for! very basic but friendly staff willing to help. it was nice to stay more in the real life part of New York. lovely friendly deli at the bottom of the road which was great for cups of tea and breakfast!!;3
We were very concerned after booking a room and then reading the reveiws.  Should we cancel??  Left it too late!! Anyway, arrived, tired and ready for sleep.  I was worried that I might find a cockroach in my bed but was told by my friend to be more positive.  So, how was it?  Lift and hallways seemed dirty and smelly which did not give a good first impression, but room was fine, OK, the carpets had seen better days but we had clean sheets and towels every day, bathroom clean with plenty of hot water.  Shower over bath very powerful.  Staff, great.  Subway conveniently close, breakfasted at the Key West Diner every morning.  Fast service and friendly staff.  I had never been to New York before and decided my money would be better spent in the cut price designer stores than using;3
Hotel itself was ok, owned by Ramada group.  The staff sucked, the lady at the front desk was kind of rude and did not even smile.  I was put at a quiet corner room, which was ok until I found out they were renovating the stairs and painting.  The maintenance guy had a key card and before knocking he just barged in to my room.  Thankfully I was just unpacking that time.  After that had happened I tried to call down to front desk which had a busy tone for 30 mins.  Finally I had to go out so I went downstairs to talk to front desk.  This is when I found out why there was busy tones. The people there were chatting and when the phone had rang, they just press the busy button.  I've asked to switch rooms but they said they had a full house.  I've also asked for nobody to do room;3
I settled on the Hyatt because of the glowing reviews. The fire alarm activated in our room. Because the phone in the room does not work, I am forced to take the elevator down to the lobby, to deal with this problem. My conversation with the clerk informs me that our room is the only active alarm, the clerk assures help would arrive soon.   Two staff members arrive, and after a quick inspection, the maintenance man begins work to diffuse the alarm. The staff member floats a veiled accusation of us smoking in the room.  Upsetting, to say the least, I informed the staff that we don't smoke. Do not appreciate being accused of violating hotel policy this is very unprofessional on staffers part. Maintenance diffused the situation with by saying the incident could have been activated;3
Service wasnât the best.  Room ok but not incredibly functional.  No water in room- for purchase or otherwise.  Pool service was horrible.  Iâd go elsewhere. Overall just a so so experience.  Pull out bed in room a twin- Iâve never even seen a twin pull out sofa bed before!  Didnât have hot water one day in entire building, one air conditioning unit went out in room.  Just not an overall great experience for the money.;3
"Big International Hotel but Five people left me messages - not one came to me. No continental Breakfast only a Big (expensive) Brunch upstairs on roof terrace When I complained I was told ""Try breakfast next door""";3
When we first arrived after 20 hours of travelling, we were greeted by a man on reception. Not a 'Hello how are you' it was just 'Next.' After this, it had appeared they had messed up our rooms, but blamed it on our travel agents and 'first come first serve.' Turns out it was the hotels fault and aside from this, we had booked over 10 months in advance so this is an unfair comment.  Prior to this, I had emailed 4 months before requesting a possible room on a higher floor with a view - unfortunately what we got was a level 1 view of a wall. Luckily, we asked to change and (miraculously) there was a room available on level 3 which was a lot better. Still the same spec, but it seemed a much nicer room. Depending what floor or position your room is, It seems to be the luck of the;3
"PRO * Very friendly and helpful staff - thanks a lot. * Safe neighborhood * Quite a reasonable price for NYC (we payed ~ USD 115,- per night - two beds, private bathroom) * In general, room was clean  CON * WiFi isnÂ´t included in the room rate - sorry, not acceptable from my perspective in 2016 when I have free internet even in several subway stations * Old hotel - looks like they wanna make some money from the old cash cow * Location is good and safe, but itÂ´s on the upper west end of central park, so definitely not central in terms of ""typical tourist life"" (depends how you define ""central"" in New York - but there isnÂ´t much to see besides Harlem and the Columbia University - too far to walk to Downtown, so you need the subway) * Dark room - just one window to a lightway,";3
Great location close to the Hudson River park, West village and downtown. Second visit not as good as first. This hotel is getting very tired and could do with some updates. The staff are not particularly friendly and in-fact ignore you where possible. Our first two nights were quiet but Friday and Saturday meant we were overwhelmed by the beats from local clubs and screeching cars - awful and sleepless;3
Hotel is average - very old, bed was comfortable. Rooms are small, perfect location though. Wouldn't rate it a 4*, but not sure if 4* English is the same as American. I would say it was a 3*.   Also we asked to keep the room for a couple more hours and they said it was going to be 320 dollars more - which is a joke!   Also when we checked in we were told there is a 25 dollar daily charge for the fitness centre, daily newspapers and for use of the telephones. I did not pay it, apparently it's in the terms and conditions. I didn't use any of the above so I didn't pay the charge, the lady was nice enough and said that's fine.;3
this hotel has good staff but lacks a good kitchen and rooms in good repair. there are newer hotels with better kitchens and updated rooms for about the same cost. It's worth the effort to compare. If, however, you intend to visit the Metropolitan Opera, you can't get closer than this hotel. Just make sure you find great restaurants in the area. The restaurant servicing the Empire is not worth the money you'll spend.;3
"I picked this hotel specifically for its location near a niece and nephew we were visiting.  It is a nicely kept very retro hotel with historic appeal.  The staff are very nice and accommodating.  There is secured gated parking and There is a very safe feeling at the hotel.  The rooms are very small and poorly lighted.  The beds are extremely firm and pillows are small.  Breakfast included in a basement ""restaurant"" (think embassy suites - type breakfast but a bit more limited selection).  I ended up not using the TV as it spent most of the time in a ""no signal"" mode.  It is convenient to Hollywood and the studios etc.  Close to Children's Hospital.   Overall, a decent place with historic value, in need of some painting in halls and maybe an upgrade of furniture. Glad I";3
Great location for opera-goers, especially on cold winter nights.  Room was quiet and average size for NYC, but sadly, only a view of the HVAC system.  Good access to subway at Columbus Circle.  Hotel staff in general was helpful.;3
Couldn't believe we found a hotel at this price. The room was clean and had the necessary supplies. If you want a Marriott experience go to the Marriott this won't be for you. For the money this was a bargain. I look forward to returning when we visit again.;3
When I arrived and checked-in I was told that I have to pay extra $ 27 per night for facilities, even if you are not using them.   If you have to pay for it why is it not incl. in the price? And the extra charged later at arrival?  So therefore I give a 3 and not 4.  Other disadvantage is that there is no refrigerator in the room.  Advantage: good location, beautiful view.;3
"We flew into Burbank to spend a day at Universal Studios for my husband's birthday. We didn't want to rent a car, so hired a private company to get us from and to the airport.  We stayed two nights here.  It was okay.  Our room had a King bed and was fair sized; bathroom was good sized; furniture a bit old.  The elevators and restaurant were under construction.  There is a heated pool, but we didn't use it.  The hotel's food was expensive ($13 for bagel and tea; $28 for breakfast buffet), but it was walking distance to Universal Studios.  If you have a car you can drive and get less expensive food, or go to Universal City (next to Universal Studios) where there are restaurants within walking/shuttle distance.  They also have a shuttle from the hotel to Universal City for those";3
An old hotel in east Hollywood. The price was good and the rooms were OK. Internet is free, but doesn't work reliably and is slow. The pool is nice and there is a, very small, fitness room. The patio looks good, but the bar there was closed all the time.;3
I understand the hotel is in the process of refurb'ing rooms, but we were unlucky enough to be allocated to an old style room. View from the 32nd floor was overlooking the Hudson river, and not spectacular (would have preferred to see more of the city), but acceptably nice.    The room itself is quite large in comparison to other NYC hotels, but disappointingly lacking in facilities. There is plenty of room for a fridge or coffee machine, or even a kettle, but none are present. This means the only options for hot drinks are the Starbucks across the road, or the TickTock restaurant in the lobby. On our first morning we visited the TickTock, but after being charged $5 per bowl of cereal we didn't come back.  Room was acceptably clean, though noticeably dusty around the edges of;3
I used to LOVE staying at the Empire but on this last trip I kept trying not to be disappointed by my experience but was at most every turn. I was in a celebratory mood when I checked in and told that to the front desk man who didn't care or comment on that. I reserved a room with a city view and was dispatched to a room with views of a brick wall. Really?? Within the first 5 minutes of my stay I felt not listened to and taken advantage of. The only way to get what I reserved and was told I already had was to upgrade to a room that was $100 a night more. Which I did so I wouldn't have to look at brick walls on my 4 night stay. Within 1 hour of checking into my room, the internet failed and I couldn't get online from my room for hours. For a hundred dollars a night more...Oh, and;3
stayed here for 4 nights.  The room was a good size for New York and the location was great.  The breakfasts here are horrible, most of the stuff was old and stale and there is not enough space for dining, when we complained to reception about the breakfast she just laughed.  The staff at reception were mostly rude when dealing with them and could learn to deal with complaints. The doorman however was great... basically this hotel is not worth what they are charging.. there is a trend with staff complaints in the reviews but it seems this is not being addressed, the staff are what really lets this hotel down;3
Spent one night prior to a tour. Hotel modern and clean but very close to airport, room overlooked an airport car park and pool area very noisy and smelly from aircraft fumes, If you want an airport stop over it is Ok but nothing nearby so stuck in hotel unless you have a car.;3
New York hotel rooms are unfortunately rather small although adequate.   The bed was king size and very comfortable. There was no coffee machine etc., but I always have my own travel kettle with me so am prepared.  We did not eat at all in the hotel as were only there for five nights and wanted to be out and about.  The hotel was only two blocks from the Empire State Building, and Time Square and Grand Central Station  were within walking distance, with Penn Railway Station only across the road.  This is very handy for getting to Newark Airport which is only 30 mins. away.  The staff were friendly and helpful.;3
Room was clean but 1 washcloth for 2 people in 4 days. We could not find ice machine or vending machines. It is only 3 blocks from subway which was nice.   Very quiet area but had a fellow guest playing the same song over and over until midnight.;3
Room was adequate for an overnight stay, however shower could not be adjusted, up or down, and to turn it on, required bashing the handle with my shoe. Not good enough for the price paid. Service at the cafe was below par. Shuttle service from airport was excellent, however from hotel to airport, perfunctory only. Guess it all depends upon the driver.;3
I, my wife and two children, were hosted for the sixth time in this hotel with a prime location, right near the central park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln enter, great restaurants besides the stores to shop like Gap, Apple Store, century 21, all them, less than 50 meters from Hotel.Although in high season times, hotel lose some quality in some services, as negative and sad a horrible internet, during these seasons.;3
"My husband and I recently stayed here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.  Upon check in, we were terribly disappointed to find the pool deck was ""closed indefinitely, but you will have access to the local YMCA.""  There is no indication on the hotel website to this effect, and we would have stayed elsewhere had we known about the pool. As Manhattanites who are beach/sun/pool lovers, we were excited to take advantage of a total staycation by sitting poolside in our fair city...  All of that said, the hotel is located right in the heart of Lincoln Center, with nearby access to both Central and Riverside Parks, The Shops at Columbus Circle, and several restaurants, so there is plenty to do outside the hotel.";3
The location of this hotel is great, especially if you want to attend a performance at the Lincoln Center which is a stone throw away.  Our room was clean but the bathroom was awfully small, no room to move around!  The room was an interior room, good size but quite dark with poor ventilation, a musky smell was noticeable. The lobby was tastefully decorated but quite dark and a bit run down..  although the hotel has been renovated, I think another more thorough remodeling is neede3d.;3
I liked the hotel. It is in a great location. However, it did feel old....like it needed a refurbishment....it's not very modern....my toilet in my room was designed for a child.  It is walking distance from most of the city tours and amenities.....Madison Square garden was around the corner.  No a bad option for centrally located hotel.;3
Our room welcomed us with meticulous cleanliness and pristine bedspreads! Denise did an exceptional job in making sure our accommodations were pleasing. She even checked in to see our happy faces. The only disappointment was reporting that our a/c did not work and it was ignored. Our room temp was a stagnant 77-78 degrees. Extremely uncomfortable with no compensation.;3
The hotel is a great location for subway travel or quick access (via cab) to Broadway's Theatre District (approximately 15 min).   The staff was friendly and accommodating upon check-in, which was prompt and hassle-free.   The is no garage parking but street parking (for us) was a snap! The bed was comfortable while the shower and sink were clean. The television and air-conditioner were both very outdated, but both worked fine. There was a drunken man passed out on the floor leading to our guestroom. He was alive so hotel security responded to our call to have him removed. (Strange!!!)  Check-out was prompt. USE PRICELINE.COM to book this hotel. The rate was cheaper (especially considering, I booked it the DAY OFF TRAVEL).;3
"Was really looking forward to staying here, but was a little disappointed. Our room got no natural light as it looked out over the vents for air conditioning/the restaurant which made a lot of noise. The room was tiny and we didn't touch the minibar as everything in it was a complete rip off. The ""pool"" is more like a plung pool, I'd challenge anyone over 7 to swim in it, though the views from up there are amazing. It was also annoying that there was no free wifi in the rooms - everywhere has free wifi... On the plus side, the bed was comfy and the location is great and the concierge gave a great recommendation for breakfast.";3
"I did see pilots and flight crew there, which is a good sign.    Rooms are clean and the overall hotel is perfectly fine.  The walls are a bit thin; you will hear the people talking in the next room.   I wouldn't bother with room service;  they bring up the pre-made sandwiches, etc. that you can buy the lobby.";3
This was our first visit to NY, and for location in our opinion we could not have picked a better hotel.  We had looked at the previous reviews and frankly where a little nervous of what to expect. On arrival the lobby looked clean with great dÃ©cor, and our booking in was friendly and efficient.  Our room was very small and had no view at all, however it was in line with previous comments and what we expected. It had a comfortable clean bed and was suitable for our needs as a base, but the bathroom was in desperate  need of a revamp and re decoration. Peeling paint job, old soap residues left on the side of the bath, rough and extremely worn bath bottom, which was uncomfortable under foot.  Had it not been for the location then I think we would feel really let down.   The staff;3
"Staying at the empire for a week, for the second year in a row in town on business. Love the location, frustrated with staff. During a thunderstorm, a group of 20 of us tried to catch cabs outside the hotel, 8am, trying to get to a meeting. When I asked the front desk for assistance, the response was ""that's not our job, you can ask out front.""  So I head out to ask the bellhop who responded ""I'm not getting all wet.""  Thought that's what they were there for, will be moving our 35 rooms for a week to another hotel next year.";3
The Astor on the Park is in a great location directly across the street from Central Park! The customer service is fabulous and everyone I came in contact with at the front desk was kind, friendly and helpful.  The rooms are standard with a bed and a tv. What more could you want? If that's all you need, this hotel is perfect for you!  However, if you're looking for a comfortable bed with upgraded amenities, do not stay at the Astor on the Park. The bed was extremely hard and the bathroom had a strong smell of bleach.   I do recommend staying on the first floor if you can. The first floor is within range of the hotel's Wi-Fi and it is complimentary. If you stay above the first floor there is an additional charge of $10.00 per day.  Overall the hotel is perfect for a reasonably;3
2nd time to stay here.  Previous stay was on club level, and room was fine.  Second, more recent stay, was on regular guest floor.  The condition of the room was terrible. There were multiple disgusting and large stains on the carpet, which looked extremely worn.  There was a random mini fridge sitting in the room all by itself.  The TV was small, and the furniture was outdated to say the least.    Common areas also needed updating.;3
No irons available and when asked a staff for help, was told âno Englishâ. A hotel in Central London employing staff who donât even speak basic English to be able to help a guest. Went to a work meeting with an un-ironed shirt.;3
We visited USA in July 2015, and booked 6 nights at Morningside Inn hotel, it is Bed only, it is clean and OK for travelers who wish to explore NY.  Hot showers and clean rooms, most of the bathrooms are for share! if you wish to cook for your self, the kitchen is there for you! restaurants are near by for breakfast ect...  I like it and will stay there again.;3
We asked to check in early and they asked for a fee of $70 then they reduced to $50.  If we donât want to pay for early check in then we have to pay for luggage storage.  The room does not have coffee machine or the refrigerator.  If we want to have those items, we have to pay additional for each item!  The location is a couple blocks from Penn station and 10-15 min walk to Koreantown or Timesquare which is convenient.  Overall, I wouldnât recommend unless you are willing to pay for those additional fees!;3
Spent one night at this hotel in a standard king room.  For NYC, the room was quite spacious. We were both able to do our stretches at the same time.  Room had a closet with enough hangers and there was room for our bags as well.  Bathroom was big enough for one person to fit comfortably.  The walls were thick, we didn't hear noise from corridor, and new windows kept out most street noise (we were on the 4th floor overlooking 94th street). Bed was comfortable and room was clean. TV worked well but was an old style.  Staff friendly and seemed eager to help.  Had one small issue in the room and engineering came quickly and we were offered another room but stayed put.  Coffee was good in AM.    The elevators were very small and very busy at times.  We didn't try the stairs because;3
We stayed at the Empire for 7 nights so got a really good feel for the hotel.  The location is great and the staff is friendly and helpful, but as a family of 4, we would not stay here again for the following reasons: - superior double room is extremely small and barely walkable once your bags are in the room (and we pack light) - we later upgraded to a junior suite which was about 50% bigger but had to deal with a pullout couch since this room has only one real bed - we paid for the Splash package which includes in-room wifi and continental breakfast, but the wifi connectivity was very choppy and would often drop or be completely unavailable.  The continental breakfast was a complete waste of money.  The offerings were minimal, and they were consistently out of food or napkins;3
The New Yorker is one of those hotels that we've all heard off- every city has them- and you probably ought to stay at once to tick it off the list.  It's in a fantastic location- right by Penn Station and MSG, 5 mins walk from Macy's Herald Sq and the Empire State, 10 mins (if that) from Times Square. Getting anywhere in Manhattan is easy from here. JFK/ EWR are easy to reach from Penn Station too.   There's 3 restaurants in the hotel- Tick Tock is an iconic NY Diner open long hours with a big menu although the food and service are average at best, Trattoria Bianca is a decent Italian with a nice bar and Butcher & Banker a fantastic upscale steak house in the basement.   Downstairs, you'll find a very good fitness centre, a 24hr business centre and a little archive documenting;3
"Ok...everything clean and tidy. The hostel is cheap and value for money. All my belongings were safe and I felt ok staying here. The hostel is close to everything you need and I found the area to be safe. My only problem was the staff...now this wasn't the manager but one young girl in particular...young lady...I pay your wages and I work hard. Just because I came to stay here doesn't mean I cannot afford to stay in a hotel somewhere a little up market. She was rude and didn't want to help.  My first time in nyc and I didn't feel comfortable asking her anything. The only words she muttered to me were ""what's your name"". That is it! Other than that...no worries.";3
we recently just come back from the New Yorker. We stayed for 5 nights. The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is good value for money, the rooms are a little old fashioned and could do with up dating but very clean. There are a few things that I would say about the hotel. We had to pay $5 dollars a bag to leave at the hotel before check in and after check out which I think is a little naughty, we should be able to leave our bags at the hotel free of charge for all the money we have paid. Also when we arrived at the hotel they ask for your debit card, this is incase of damages. Now we were not informed of this before hand and also the amount it would be $180 and it was taken out of our account and left us a little short and told it will take 5/6 days to go back into our;3
The location is very good, you can walk almost anywhere. The room was clean and nice enough, not shabby. The noise is worse than I expected - all night long you hear the traffic from the street. They even give you earplugs in the room ! The bathroom is really small and was not so clean.;3
The hotel is very modern and the front desk were very helpful at check in.  However we arrived on the 6am flight from Sydney and I had requested an early check in so we could freshen up after our flight, I requested it through hotels.com and rang the hotel direct and they did say they couldn't guarantee it but would try. Well we didn't have much luck with that, we were told the house keeping staff didn't arrive until 9am, I did ask if they had a shower anywhere in the hotel but apparently they didn't. We eventually checkin at 10.30am. Very disappointing considering the hotel is next door to a 24 hr international airport.  We then decided in the evening to order room service, well that was a disappointing experience, we rang room service three times, no answer. Rang reception,;3
Visited NYC & stayed at the New Yorker. Good location. Staff not keyed up on trips and not very helpful in general.   Tick Tock service was poor & all they seemed interested in was Tips.   Wi Fi is free whilst you are checked in but as soon as you check out this is cancelled despite having to wait all afternoon for your transport to the airport.;3
My wife and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights. We were disappointed with the size of the room (very small). The old airco was behind the curtain and very noisy. The fridge was small and locked for whatever reason. The location however was perfect, within walking distance of a lot of sites (Times Square), Central Park). The service was alright, with exception of Jeff the concierge, who was very helpful and friendly. The hotel could upgrade itself by offering a limited breakfast service.;3
We stayed one night while visiting Universal Studios. Very conveniently located for visiting the park. It was a 10 minute walk or they have a free shuttle that arrives every 15 minutes to the park.   The lobby was lovely. We checked our bags with the bellmen on arrival, who were polite and fast. It made it easy to spend our day at Universal Studios.  The front desk was helpful. On check in we activated a digital key and got 2 room keys. The digital key worked great. The 2 room keys did not. They didnât activate them and when my husband went down to get them activated they gave him a hard time. He had the manager come over, who gave him a couple water bottles for the trouble.  The room had a note in it saying they were in the process of remodeling and I hope the room we stayed at;3
The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful and it's in a good location near Columbus Circle. They have a validation agreement with Icon on 63rd that will shave about $20/day off your parking, if you're driving (unless you want to pay the hotel's $70/day valet fee.) The bed and pillows are comfortable. However, it's one of those hotels that looks nice at first glance, but upon closer look, it's a little shabby. The internet was unreliable enough for me to use on my phone's hotspot instead. The fridge was nowhere near 40 degrees. No coffee maker in the room. The bath needed a solid vacuuming (hair in the corners) and the grout needed a good scrubbing with bleach. The shower system in the bathroom was broken (but still usable): the controls were loose, the drain cover was not;3
We stayed for 3 nights in June in a group of six. Hotel is fairly outdated but the staff are helpful and the limo driver is amazing. It has free wifi (a huge draw for us) decent free breakfast and the rooms are huge. They helped us hire cars, get pedicures and rent a limo driver for the night and was all so cheap. It's not exactly within walking distance of a lot of places but it wasn't too hard to get around in a hire car. Overall it was exactly what we needed.;3
This is a great location across the street from the Lincoln Center. Lobby area and bar are very nice. But the room is very tight, no view.WiFi should be free, as in most hotels nowadays, and secured with a paassword. Bathroom has absolutely no counter space.;3
My husband and I stayed boutique hotel and loved the ambiance. However, the hotel manager should learn to speak to the his employees with a civil tongue. While I was at the front desk getting my room key, he was berating an employee in a tone that was very rude and unprofessional. Guests should not be exposed to this kind of behavior and it had a negative effect on my stay. I am not sure that I will be staying here again.;3
The room was clean though small. The hotel was fairly busy and this made it quite noisy at night. Although the hotel has obviously been renovated and updated, it feels basic rather than anything special, which is a real shame since it obviously has potential as a glimpse into a bygone age. The lobby is probably the most impressive feature. We did object strongly to the additional tax we were expected to pay, especially since our travel agent had assured us that there would be no 'extra' payment at checkout. We made such a fuss that they actually waived the payment - so perhaps if all travellers made the same objection this pernicious practice would end.  Overall, our experience was satisfactory, but nothing we could wax lyrical about. The hotel was rather impersonal and;3
I stayed here... Mainly because I am a huge Gossip girl fan...! The hotel is lovely, but very dark inside with the lighting. The rooms are lovely but not overly huge. I felt it was slightly overpriced for the room, no kettle facilities for a drink, small bathroom.  A nice experience but not the gossip Girl experiment I was expecting!;3
After reading these reviews on the hotel, I really was expecting the worst. I was on a school trip visiting New York, so I warned friends to take towels and bed sheets. They laughed at me, but I told them 'After the reviews I've read, I'll have the last laugh!' They were right though- I didn't need the anti bacterial wipes or pillowcases!  One room out of eight in our group did have problems with the toliets, but the staff sorted it out quickly, so it was not really a problem. The hotel wasn't wonderfully decorated, but it was clean and the showers were not a problem. It was in a great location, in my opinion, and wasn't too noisy. The room was big enough for four of us and the amazing amount of clothes that we bought and really didn't need!  I have very high expectations of;3
The Empire is perfectly located for those interested in the Lincold Center or the Juilliard school of music. You just have to cross the street and you are there. It is surrounded by good restaurants and it is relatively easy to reach. We stayed here several years ago and it wa a dark, old, aging and not very compfortable hotel. When our hosts reserved a room for us at this place, we were converned. THe place has improved since our last visit and the room we had, had been updated. It was somewhat lighter, spacious and the air conditioning worked reasonably well. The bathroom, while updated, was awkward: there was no counter space, the sink was tiny, and the swich to control water flow in the shower was out of reach, unless you were a basketball player. The closet was for short;3
This was my third stay at the New Yorker and not up to the first two. The room was very small, the rug damp, the safe broken and the bathroom not updated. The staff as always was very friendly.;3
This hotel is small and friendly in a great location for theater visits. Rooms are small and if you are used to a  queen or king bed you may want to check your booking as our bed was a double . Very comfortable though.;3
There was no hot water in the morning. The night before we went to the bar and it is not stocked as I thought it would be. No Zinfandel, No Reisling, No annisette, No zambuka. The rooms were OK, there was enough towels, rooms are very small, two people better know each other.;3
The room was nice and large and had a great view of the Empire State and the Chrysler Building but it was in need of a revamp. The headboard had a tear in it which was only small but could have been fixed easily enough. The main reason it got 3 stars was the bathroom. Tiles that had been painted over is not acceptable and fixtures and fittings were tarnished which only contributed to the overall tatty appearance. There is a charge of $22 per night for use of the facilities including wifi (even if you didn't use them). I did say I thought this was rather expensive as we would not be using the gym and so they charged us $11 per night;3
Stayed here for 2 nights to round up a family holiday in Orlando. The hotel entrance is beautiful  and reception well staffed. Check in was straight forward and quick and the staff were friendly.   We are a family of 4, with teenage boys. The room was reasonably sized with a bathroom at each end. We had booked a family room through Virgin so assumed that the beds would be suitable for our family. We had a room with two queen size beds. As a family with an average height of 6â but all slim build, we found the beds too small and also very soft so we didnât sleep particularly well. We had a view of a brick wall, I assume that could have been rectified if weâd requested an upgrade.   A safe is provided in the room free of charge.  There were plenty of plug sockets and a hairdryer;3
Room was very small, even for NYC. Air conditioner was noisy. Bathroom door was rusty and peeling paint in places. Hallways were kind of dark. The location is about the only thing going for this hotel. The lobby is pleasant enough, but the rooms are disappointing.;3
"My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and Father's day. We booked the Empire Hotel via United Rewards , so I expected certain downgrades for this reason. I had read prior to arrival that any bookings here in the reasonable prices had pitfalls.  When we checked in they tried to give us 2 double beds, though my reservation was listed as a superior queen. They tried to tell me this was an ""upgrade"" but I explained that we were on a romantic stay and 2 beds was not preferred , so they put us in a superior king.   We learned soon enough this was a handicapped room, with a horrid view of the interior of another building. The bathroom was bizarre, no shower curtain , no privacy and the water flooded the entire bathroom floor. The shower head leaked , so it was squirting water";3
Sum up: for the higher price tag I expect clear awareness on fees. Example: if Tax was included. Parking fees. Was expecting a full breakfast. Not limited to breads and fruits. Simple picture of a hot tub or mention of it online.;3
We had 2 rooms at the 7th floor. At night youâll hear a noise what will keep you out of sleep. Airco had to en turned of at night, also too noisy. The location of the hotel makes it all better. The other services are okay.;3
Rooms we were in very noisy. Outdated A/C units rusty, noisy and very big. Rooms and hotel very dark. Quoted swimming pool on roof was more like a large bath, very disappointing. Staff were helpful when changing rooms.;3
We were recently in NYC for our son's college graduation.  The Empire was on Columbia's list of suggested hotels, so when we found a decent rate, we booked here.  Located beside Lincoln Center, the location is wonderful, and very close to the subway.  The staff was very accommodating, allowing us to check in before 3:00, and upgrading us to a King room.  The room was nice, with a lovely view of Lincoln Center and on the 8th floor, so we avoided the street noises.  The bed was very comfortable, and there was a nice desk area.  We were given an access code for free WiFi.  But.... the room furnishings showed a lot of wear (chipped paint, etc.), and the bathroom was less than adequate.  Very small, no counter space, no shower door, and no fan. And I found it offensive that;3
The hotel is very big , not new but very confortable. Big rooms ! Breakfast is very American , lots of sweets , cakes, I don't like. Fruits and cheese was terrible. Good for kids, nice pool and very near Universal . They have Starbucks inside hotel for expresso coffe.;3
"I stayed at the Empire for a weekend, and while I was initially happy with the exotic decor and small-but-comfortable enough rooms.... but that was before I needed anything from there front desk.  One particularly striking incident was when Eugene, the lobby's bag handler, slammed the baggage-room's door in my face while chatting away on his cell phone.  (I had a few bags I needed to store).  When I spoke with the manager on duty at the front desk... his response was one of ""sorry that happened to you, we will be doing exactly nothing about it"". They care more about the money they're taking and when, than the service and hospitality they offer their guests.  RUDE, RUDE, RUDE.";3
We throughly enjoyed our trip to New York. Though the room was very small it was clean and comfortable. We were so busy seeing the sights we didn't spend much time in the room. We would stay here again.;3
I really enjoy staying here  and have done a few times when on a quick trip - they have cute clean and affordable rooms and the bar and restaurant are very cool and hip ,,Its pretty basic but for what you pay I think its a great place - check out the history of the building its very cool .;3
The hotel has basic ammenties and room very small but on the whole very clean, very helpful staff and bed and towels changed on daily basis.  It is a far distance from all the action that New York has to offer and using the cabs can be quite expensive. We instead invested in a 7 day unlimited rail pass for the subway and this proved to be much better, $29 for a week and we travelled up and down Manhatten easily, closest subway is 103rd street. Reception can provide a subway map.  Enjoyed our trip but next time may stay closer to main attractions;3
Absolutely enjoyed NYC Comic Con. Wyndham Hotel was very easily accessible from Penn Station, which was what we were looking for, given it was centrally located inthe city. Room sizes were definitely much smaller than the photos show on their website. If you are familiar with room sizes on commercial cruise ships, the room sizes will not surprise you. On the upside, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms were quite pricey but given the NYC Comic Con was being held that weekend, it does not surprise me. Next time we travel to NYC we will most likely look around for a better place to stay.;3
Travelled with my 8yr old on her first trip to London to this premier inn. It's a great location and we were fortunate to have a view of the London Eye from our room. Our room itself was ok, the bathroom needed a deep clean, loads of marks on the walls, lots of dust on the skirting and there was a continual foul smell in there which escaped to the bedroom when opening the door. We stayed in room 640 and was woken both mornings (5am) by the flushing of the next doors toilet - not the norm, I'm sure but the corridor was also noisy with guests returning (again 5am!) and doors slamming. The breakfast was great, as usual and we ate there 1 night, again fine but having stayed in the Blackfriars one in May, I think this is a better option, even though it's 1.2miles away.  This is the;3
When this was the Radison they had a fabulous restaurant and well attended bar. Now its barely worth looking at the menus. They also have a sort of cafe / take away bar which is OK, but not what you would expect from an up-market hotel.  So much about the LAX airport and local hotels seems to be resting on the faded laurals of the local movie industry.  A bit run down, old and characterless.  When you turn up on the shuttle bus there is no porter so you have to struggle the best you can to get in the door. When checking out and you ask for a trolley a porter emerges with it, obviously he lives in the cupboard with the trolley and only seems to want to bring luggage from your room, but no to it - weird.;3
Stayed here recently for a couple of nights. The first night (Thursday) was great, but on Friday night, the roof lounge/bar is a very popular nightspot. The crowds that it draws makes the hotel very noisy, and the staff seems more pre-occupied with dealing with the nightclub, than with being a nice hotel.;3
We stayed here a few years ago now, so things might have changed!! i have only just joined tripadviser so here goes. We thought these apartments where ideally situated, clean, and looked after, ive been in some real bad hotels in the US so this was a refreshing change. The apartment had everything you would need and it was clean, and well decorated, we never really bother about the rooms as we never stay in them long, only to sleep! one thing i found was the staff where not that helpfull, but apart from that it was ok. Location is why we booked this apartment and we where not dissapointed as there is a subway entry 2 mins down the road! also there are a lot of locals in this area so you dont feel like you are a tourist, we dined out in a few of the restaurants in the Central;3
A great location and huge rooms but the place needs a makeover desperately - furniture is worn and torn and lamps in room faulty. Reception staff, generally, need a lesson in friendliness and customer service.;3
"Very reasonable room prices and a good value for your money.  Driving through the neighborhood and pulling up may make you doubtful as the location is not in the greatest of areas. That being said, we felt safe walking around during the day and there is a metro station nearby you can take to hollywood blvd. Uber and lift cabs make traveling easy now as well. Daily breakfast had ample selection for a free meal.  Small fitness center. The pool is not heated. It was quiet despite being on a busy street but we faced away from the road on the top floor; other people on the bottom floor on the street level complained it was loud. They did charge us to check in early and will charge you if you check out late. Overall good value for the budget minded traveler.";3
Nice hotel and friendly staff, but beware of all the hidden extras in your room, $8 for water $3 for coffee in the room. Avoid these charges, I did, spoils what could be a 5 out of 5 *. Apart from that excellent location for the park and near the Subway.;3
"Everything about the hotel is small; from the lobby, to the elevators, to the hallways, to the room. That plus the tiredness of the carpets, the walls and the room (we were on the 8th floor) make you realize the age of the hotel. They do have signs posted about renovations, but to be honest, the place is just old! And while you can spruce a place up, you can't make it bigger. That said, if you can get past the smallness and tiredness, it is a decent location for a Manhattan visit. The 96th street subway is around the corner, as are several eateries, and  Central Park is a 10 minute walk.  Oh, one more thing - parking ... kind of important in NYC. The hotel does not provide parking, but has an ""arrangement"" (for $27/day) with the Hertz lot on 95th Street. As we discovered, this";3
Overall a nothing bad to say. desk went above and beyond. Used my points so room was free and cant speak on the value. The guards at the elevators was quite annoying having to drop everything everytime to show I have a room key before I could pass him.  Good security reason but still irritated me with a young daughter doing the pee pee dance;3
"Super close the Universal Studios; grab a quick snack/breakfast at the coffee shop and walk to the Studios in under 10-minutes -- we did with an 8 and 10-year-old in tow. Nice walk through the garden terrace and across a walking bridge. There is also a shuttle. (It is also close for drives down Sunset through Beverly Hills and up to Mulholland Drive, as well as The Griffith Observatory and Hollywood Boulevard including Chinese Theater and walk of fame.)  Rooms are spacious, clean and decorated/furnished adequately for the price, but require some updating. There are few plug-in to recharge devices and not a USB socket to be found. One receptacle already had 4 or 5 plugs in it.   Hot/Cold water is an issue in the shower only - likely not a plumbing issue, but a faucet issue. The";3
The property was clean and well maintained. Proximity to the airport was perfect. Shuttles to/from airport are frequent. Room service and stocking of basics like water and coffee pods was a major miss. Room service also doesn't fulfill requests for plates or silverware. This is something we have to go to the front desk and pay and what not. At least that is what I gathered when connected with room service.  In average hotels this may be reasonable but at Hyatt, at the price points, these are not joyful. It felt rigid and felt like I pay money and have to be told that some simple things are not doable.;3
Stay was just average with lot of niggles (air conditioning, bathroom condition, etc.).  Stayed only one night - so wasn't enough time to complain and get anything fixed.  But certainly not worth the price/night.;3
A pretty basic hotel for that kind of money. Bed was ok, bathroom was tiny, faucet wasn't easy to operate, room was all in all pretty small, there's a desk there with a chair, but you could hardly sit on it as you were so close to the bed. Room was very clean though!;3
Firstly, if you've already booked the Empire, don't worry, it's fine. However, if you haven't booked, I would probably look elsewhere. The hotel location is brilliant, but it's a little tired and the rooms are small. We were a family of 4 sharing a room with 2 double beds and were completely on top of one another. Perhaps with this occupancy the winged armchair wasn't necessary. We had a couple of small problems with housekeeping which took two attempts to sort out, but even then a full solution wasn't arrived at. The aircon was noisy at night and the lobby bar uncomfortably freezing cold. Having said this, the hotel is clean, the staff courteous and the rate reasonable.;3
"The worst par of our stay was trying to find self-parking.  There were NO handicapped spots and ALL the lower levels were predominately reserved for Valet.  We actually spent 25 minutes attempting to self park.  After much frustration, we gave up and did Valet; which the price was absolutely RIDICULOUS, $45 a day.....Simply Outrageous!!!  The rooms were okay.  It appeared TOO futuristic and not at all comfortable and homey.  Wished we would haved stayed at Embassy Suites (same area) as planned.  The rooms had too much light coming in even though it had a blind.  We will not stay here again!";3
The Americana Hotels is located near the Central Park, easily accessible via the Metro, and a short walk to many good restaurants and sights in New York!  We did not eat at the hotel, but the first evening we at at a neighboring Mexican restaurant called Iguana! Excellent choice!!;3
We stayed here for four nights.  The staff was very nice!  So friendly!  Room was clean and bed was comfortable! I just wish we had known about the construction before booking our stay.  I was tired and stressed the first day we arrived, and I really didn't appreciate having to hear pounding and vibrating drills. Ugh!!  Oh well, next time I'll make sure I ask!  My husband's complaint was that they did not make it easy to get coffee in the morning.  Had to wait until 6:00 AM, which was 8:00 AM our time.;3
Upon checking at midnight, having just got off a delayed internal from San Francisco, I was glad to see that there was no queue at reception. However, I was ignored by the reception staff and made to wait for a non-vital radio check to be completed.  Once I had been shown my room I was very disappoonted to find that a bottle of Evian cost $8 and that the in room coffee machine cost $3 a cup! They also charge for the Wifi!  The bathroom had loose plug points and loose fittings. To top this off the bath and shower screen were filthy!  I would not mind if this were a budget hotel but it is not (although I've stayed in budget hotels that are better value). I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay away.;3
You get what you pay for.  Location is fine - super close to red lines and several places to eat.  We saw rooms on floors 8-10 (several family members staying in different rooms) and all were fine.  Didn't see any curling carpet others complained of.  Clean bathroom, clean sheets, etc.  Halls are narrow and warm since AC is from window units in each room.  No big - we weren't there to hang out in the halls.  Key West was not that good - I'd recommend only for snacks and drinks, not for an actual meal.  Whatever you do, don't ask the hotel to call a cab for you.  They call a car service that charges more than double what the city taxis charge.  We were appalled.  And don't make any long distance phone calls - $22/minute.  Knowing all this, I'd stay there again if I couldn't find;3
It is located at very busy neighborhood, and so room was very noise during day and night. Staff was great, very friendly. Room was clean and tight. Small room but fair for low price. I would recommend to stay for a short period of time, but wouldn't stay longer than 4 nights.;3
Service is average - New York style, no fuss, no warm smiles, no small talk. Room is cramped. Elevators are tight/cramped and slow. One out of 4 elevator was not functioning when I was there. But the Bed sheets in the room are clean. I didn't get any allergies (as I am asthmatic). Toilet/washroom needs more cleaning though. The lobby cushion seats are ripped, and needs re-upholstering.  I don't like the smell of their air freshener which is too musky upon entering the room. Location - far from a lot of attractions since it's at the Upper West Side area, but subway is just 2 blocks away. So if you don't mind, walking or the subway should be fine. There is free wifi at the lobby, and free wifi in the rooms, which I enjoyed everyday. No breakfast, but cafes are just nearby.  No;3
"We stayed here for 3 nights in August 2009.  The hotel is not in the best part of hollywood but we were close to hollywood sign, the walk of fame, paramount studios, and universal studios.  We went to a super restaurant called Dresdens - the write-up given by the hotel was awful but the restaurant was brilliant.    Our room was clean, the air conditioning worked and Wi Fi was free as was tea and coffee.  The breakfast was adequate - was do you expect for free?  The ""view"" from the room was dreadful - but who cares, we were out all day and most of the evening.  The worst bit of this hotel is the appaling reception staff - they are totally uninterested in you and of no help whatsoever.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel, for a few nights close to many of the";3
Arrived at this hotel very tired after a very long flight to be told we didnât have a reservation! This was booked through a travel agent and thankfully I had my paperwork with me! Receptionist was very unprofessional and kept saying Iâm checking with our reservation team. We were losing patience with her so she gave us a voucher for a drink at the bar so they could find us a room, this was at 3.45pm we were still sitting in the bar at 6pm! My husband went to the same receptionist again at 6pm to be asked what his name was! she gave the excuse that there was delayed flights and they couldnât put people out of their rooms! We asked for a manager who was very nice and apologized he put $70 credit on our account for a meal. This was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in,;3
First off, I really want to give this hotel 5 stars because the staff was very friendly and helpful, but our room was not the cleanest.  It wasnât horrible, but there was a huge curl of hair left on the carpet. I donât just mean one hair, I mean someone cut a whole section of a curl off their head and left it on the floor. Maybe they had a hair cut in the hotel room? Apparently the cleaning service didnât notice and left it on the floor. It made me gag! Our bathroom didnât have working vents, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. It just takes forever for the steam to leave the bathroom! They bedding was very nice and comfortable, but the mattress itself, wasnât super comfortable.   Other then that I will say the staff was great, the pool was wonderful and the location to universal;3
I spend a lot of time in Hilton properties so I have a baseline that extend from the low end to the resorts. The Hilton Universal City is right at the cusp of needing renovation. Dated but not tawdry. It is close to the 101 (not much of an advantage if the 101 is at a stand still) and an easy walk from Universal Studio.   It is not a great location if you have business meetings downtown - or even in the Hollywood area. If you are renting a car expect to pay $30 self park a night. If you do not want to eat in the mall - the hotel restaurants are only so so and quite expensive (expect to pay at least $40 per person).   The biggest issue I have is the poor service at check-in and the billing fiasco. First, it took 30 minutes to check in and the front desk person was not well;3
Ok people, please read this review before you read any others, AND before you plan on booking the WooGo-Central Park apartments for your stay in New York.   Trust me, as a poor married college student, I understand that everyone is looking to get the absolute best deal possible when traveling--especially to expensive places like New York. So it makes sense to try and book the place that's only $195 a night, instead of say, the Marriot at $350 a night...But, if you want to save the money and stay at the WooGo apartments there are two things you must understand first!!  1. THESE ARE TEMPORARY APARTMENTS!!! This is not the suite at the Westin Times Square, this is a low-key, low-maintenence facility that is for people who do not care about having their rooms cleaned everyday;3
To be perfectly honest this was not a four star hotel  compared to a UK  Four-star hotel  it was very dark and dingy  and we were a little disappointed as this was our honeymoon  The only plus side where is the location it was only a  brisk 10 to 15 minute walk to times square;3
My wife and I stayed in this hotel while on holiday in California for a week. The service from the staff was good, they were very helpfull. The rooms were nice and spacious, nice size bed but the bed we had was very skweeky. The hotel was neat and tidy, the location was ok, but it would depend on where you would be sightseeing, we had a rented car and went all around LA, so the location was ok. There is public transport close if needed. Overall for the price we paid, it was value for money, we had free wireless internet access and it also included a nice full breakfast which is one less worry trying to find a breakfast place each morning.;3
"I've been to the rooftop bar of the Empire Hotel many times while visiting friends in NYC and always had a good time.  The layout is spacious and conducive to small or large groups and the view is fairly nice as well.  They have ample heating for the colder months to keep the rooftop open longer.  However, this review is not really about the rooftop but the hotel.  Rooftop 4.5 stars.  Hotel 3 stars.  Highlights - Despite being in between Midtown and the Upper West Side, the location is actually pretty good.  You are next to the Lincoln Center, near some nice restaurants and a block from the subway. - The staff was relatively nice and helpful on balance, especially the bell staff.  Drawbacks - The room was your typical small, not so clean NYC room; the kind you find in a wannabe";3
Rooms are really nice but a few let downs. Really creaky bed every time you turned over it was noisy. 2) not sure how it happened but house keeping missed cleaning our room when I called they were asking me why they would have missed it when it was marked as completed!!!! 3) house keeping them decided to knock on door at 8:30 even though we were checking out that day to clean room :( 4) husband was taking down bags over two trips and I had do not disturb sign on and house keeping still trying to get in and clean room. This may have been a one off staff were really apologetic and asked what they could do to make it up to us. This is close to universal there r always shuttles and metro is not far you can get to Hollywood blvd in one stop. I would recommend hotel as mentioned;3
"I stayed at this hotel with my daughter for 4 nights May 20th to the 23rd. This feels like a 3-4 star hotel. Reasons to stay here: you got the room for less than $250/night; you have to be at Lincoln Center for an event; you want to be close to Central Park; you want to be within striking distance of Times Square; you want to be closer to the Upper West Side where the activity level is more subdued. If all those things sound correct, you're in the right place. Walk a bit north of this hotel and you'll find some really charming shops on Broadway and Amsterdam (like in the 70s).  Speaking of the 70s, my daughter thought the room looked like something straight out of ""That 70's Show"", but I actually thought it was fine. We had two comfortable beds and it seemed like enough room";3
"Arrived after tiring journey about 3.45pm having booked two twin rooms and one double for a five night stay. One twin not ready and the double was the size of a rabbit hutch. Complained to staff who blamed the travel agent for booking an ""Express"" room. Upgraded to a larger size but cost $284 extra. We were given complimentary wifi in our rooms by way of apology. All rooms were way past there best. Decor was old and dated with pealing paint and chipped furniture. The wonky blind in our room was black down the edges. That said the rooms were clean and the beds and linen were fine. Don't make the mistake of thinking the water bottles by the bedside are complimentary. In small print it states its $8 a bottle. Purchase the same bottle next door at the drug store for $2. The roof top";3
I spent three nights here while in LA for a wedding.  This hotel has seen better days.  The rooms are tired.  The pool is small.  The public areas are very congested.     The best thing going for this hotel is the staff - very helpful and friendly and professional.      The location is obviously great if you are going to Universal City (we didn't) and not as expensive as hotels closer to downtown, so that is a plus.      Breakfast buffet is OK - nothing exceptional.  We had lunch in the bar one day - that was pretty good.      Self-parking is $28/day.  I thought that was a little high for so far from downtown.;3
Checked in today and booked to stay for 3 nights.  Disappointed as we are staying here due to a recommendation !  Will not stay here again - wish we have booked somewhere else and for how much we have paid to stay, a kettle is not even available.  We have been allocated to the 29th floor, and the room is so basic and tiny.  We have to make do and struggle with space!  Three stars because of the location.   Will not let this spoil our holiday.;3
We spent 1 night at this hotel so we could arrive at Universal Studios by 9am.  We arrived after supper.  It was difficult to locate the check in desk after coming up from the parking garage bcause of all the construction.  However the employees cheerfully directed us.  The next morning we had breakfast from the coffee corner.  We noticed in the daylight that we could see Universal Studios from our room. It was an easy walk to Univrsal Studios from the hotel.;3
Once you get past the very nice Art Deco, the hotel quality is very basic. Rooms were 'very small' and showing their age.  Unplanned extras on the bill for phone and internet services which we were told was manditory and we diid not use!   However, great location for a short trip to New York;3
Rooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Stayed here before, as its in our preferred neighborhood. Walls are thin and not all power plugs worked, but for the price it is  hard to find a better deal in Manhattan.;3
I have never stayed at a 4 star hotel without room service. And there was not a kids menu. The pool is tiny, only 2 meters wide, and not very long- its really just full of kids. But it was not that clean, I found black hair floating around and bits of plastic... The receptionist who dealt with us was not that friendly.  The door men are really nice. The rooms are nice, but old, they are in need of some love. The view from the roof terrace is awesome. Nice food Awesome location! 1 street away from Central park, and across the road from a awesome Italien restaurant and a small Century 21;3
I've stayed here several times. Each time I've been its the people I've travelled with that have made the holiday, rather than the hotel. The rooms are ok, apparently recently had a makeover, but our group of 3 were disappointed with the room allocated to us. We went to reception to ask if they had another room that would best suit our needs.  The staff were amazing. We ended up changing suites 3 times until we got what we were comfortable with. Special shout out to Driss on reception. He bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable after our complaints about our room. But an even bigger shout out to John in transportation. He started helping our party out weeks before we even got there, arranging things for our visit via email. Nothing was too much trouble for him or any of;3
We stayed here while in the city for a coffee show.  The rooms are very very small, but clean.  (Which seems to be the norm in NY).  The bathrooms are beyond tiny, and it only took us 3 days to figure out how to temper the shower and not get scalded.  And good luck finding an outlet to charge anything... They are few and far between.  You can tell there is history in this hotel though.  Our room had a lock on the inside of a closet door instead of the outside and our friends down the hall had 2 bathrooms. It was definitely a unique experience.  I would stay here again, but definitely going to ask for a corner room. They are twice as big.;3
Reading the other reviews on this site, I'm not entirely sure we stayed at the same hotel!  I found Hotel Riverside Studios to be excellent value for money.  Our room was clean, the bed was decent, I never heard any other guests, only once was the bathroom occupied when I wanted to use it (so I walked 12 paces down the hall to the other one), and we felt safe and secure!  Although the phone in the room doesn't dial out, people can leave messages for you on it, and there are payphones on the ground floor.  All in all, the hotel suited our needs - especially our budget - for our 1 week in NYC.  Pros:  Location (safe neighborhood, close to subway line, quiet dead-end street), cleanliness of room, fridge in room, inexpensive (for New York), secure room.  Cons:  The hallways smell;3
"This hotel gained fame from Gossip Girl, but it's age is catching up. While I was there 2 elevators were down which was bad since the hotel was full.  The lobby area is dark and while that can be charming, in this case it was not. Bathrooms are also awkward as the shower ""door"" does not cover the shower opening and one cannot shower without getting the whole bathroom wet. The bathroom was so small there was no place to put a makeup bag or shaving kit. However, staff was lovely and there is a happening bar/pool area on the roof.";3
We stayed at the New Yorker mid February being a family of 4. Ill give an honest review Im a UK travel agent so I'm used to reviewing and staying in many hotels. I had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when I booked  Firstly the good, the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere. Thats about it as far as the positive, the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update. i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room. This room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed. With another 47 dollars a night resort fees;3
This hotel was recommended to us by Virgin holidays. First impressions were okay, although I was worried about the area the hotel is located in.   I was staying here with my teenage children and had booked 2 rooms, when checking in we were given rooms 5 floors apart which wasn't ideal.  I have seen a lot of reviews about the lifts, however we didn't have a problem with this and only waited a short time, if at all.  The ticktock diner is very good, reasonably priced and so convenient.   Our rooms, located on the 21st and 26th floors, were small (even though they were both double, double rooms) and dated. The walls are paper thin and we could hear the people next door singing in the shower and using the toilet.   Overall outlook stay was satisfactory, but  we would not stay here;3
For me, while the lobby was impressive, the common areas and the guest room (at least the one we had), did not impress me.   We opted for the standard view room with a queen size bed (125 sq feet). The condition of the room itself was o.k. but not great. I understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic Art Deco style. There is limited closet space, and dresser space. The room was about a 125 sq. feet which is what they list on their website. The bathroom was very small with very little space. They painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling. The shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature. There is no mini fridge, nor a microwave. The common areas on floor 21 were a;3
If you don't have a lot of time, and want to enjoy Los Angeles and Universal Studios, this a good place to be. We were in the 23rd floor with a really nice view. The room was ok, need some renewal and I found bubble gum on the cover of our bed. What is not so hygienic.  The breakfast included was ok, but you should pay for the complete breakfast that is awesome!;3
We spent a few nights here. The promo photos are very deceiving. The hotel is very dated. It is in need of a serious makeover to bring it up to speed. The bed felt like a rock and pillows are flat. The power points were loose in the walls and sparked and one just stopped working.  The elevator is so so so slow. And the whole hotel had mothy/musty smells. Although it is a short walk to the metro and only 4 stops away from the Chinese Theater. And the 2 girls(Nicole was one) at the front desk were always cheerful and very happy to help.  You get what you pay for.;3
The hotel itself is very nice.  I had a large comfortable room, which although it faced some major freeway (I think 101, but I don't know the area) was quiet.  Comfortable bed, large well-equipped bathroom.  Meeting rooms were good, and I very much appreciated that the break areas were all naturally lit and have high ceilings - too many hotels have dark depressing break areas.  Nice outdoor seating area.  Comfortable pool area with hot tub.  WiFi worked well, and is free for members of HHonors.  Now the downsides: * The elevators were really really slow.  One of my colleagues who was on the 10th floor was walking the stairs, because he got tired of waiting. * Every square inch of the common areas (inside and outside) have cheesy music playing.  Since I was there in December, it;3
First of all the positives -- clean, great amenities, great location and only a 10 minute walk to Universal Studios. It is what you would come to expect at a Hilton Hotel. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. My disappointment was not so much with the hotel itself but with the Hilton company which refuses to honor my Hilton Honors membership because I made my reservation through Universal! I was surprised because the representative from Hilton Honors assured me that I would get credited, but when I arrived at the hotel they said that they are unable to due to company policy. While I do plan to file a formal complaint to Hilton, I was disappointed that the hotel itself did make any efforts to meet me halfway -- particularly since it was a miscommunication from their end.;3
was offered conciere service because we were members and staying for 8 nights, never happened!! several issues with elevators. would call for service/front desk and no one would ever pick up. air conditioning issues in room. staff not very knoledgable about area when we went down to ask . Overall we had a place to sleep and at least New York did not dissapoint!!!;3
I really do not mind paying for what I get, but the value of this property is just not there, the check-in desks was not adequately staff and of course no concierge desk to assist with issues. I only eat at the restaurant once and it was the breakfast and for a 4 star hotel it was just not up to par.  Judging from the area and the choice of hotels I would not stay here again. The first room was worn and had an odor and I had to move, the second room was very nice, however when the housekeeper would clean the room they would forget to restore things like coffee and towels, and yes we did tip. It was pleasant. Complementary Internet was good, parking terrible.;3
I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August with my wife and daughter. I was a little apprehensive when I first arrived, initial impression was not that favourable. I have to say that the Staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is clean and comfortable. The room was very basic and quite small. The Aircon was a little noisy but given the weather I can get over that. The TV reception was appalling, it looked like it was on a signal splitter that wasn't working. Given the UK airport security situations and my wife's inherent fear of flying, not being able to pick up all the news was not such a problem and anyway, who needs TV in New York!  Position was a little out from where we wanted to be but budget constraints limited flexibility anyway. The subway service into and;3
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency by LAX for an overnight before flying out the next day for a business trip.  The hotel is very modern and has ample places to sit and relax in the lobby area, as well as, a gift shop with incidentals and food area.  I did notice a very heavy perfume or room freshner spray in the lobby which was a little overwhelming.  The room dÃ©cor is very modern but the room was not super clean.  I was pretty exhausted with a later in the evening check in, and did not notice much as I went straight to bed.  In the morning I noticed a large grease/water stain or something on the cover for the box spring.  The chairs in the room had stains on the arm rests and the bathroom sink had a slight sewage/sulfur smell.  Staff were very nice and friendly but would;3
"Location is great, customer service so-so, lots of extra charges - in addition to the $25-ish dollar per day ""facility charge"" and local taxes, the hotel charges $2 per item for left luggage - not at all clear what the facility fee is actually for! Would I stay again? - yes - but purely for the location, and in spite of the pretty average facilities and staff. Watch out for elderly electronic door locks too - we had to be moved to a different room at 10pm when our door lock stopped working, not what you want at the end of a tiring day. However, were given a complimentary breakfast as an apology for the inconvenience.";3
Good for a short business trip......very small rooms not good for a lengthy stay Only reason I rated rooms poor was due to size and doorless showers (flood on floor after every shower)...otherwise clean and nice;3
"I was on a business trip; average hotel, good location. I fund the hotel quite expensive compared to other hotels I have been in the neighborhood. Quite poor the breakfast and small the common areas at the reception level.";3
Stayed here for 5 days at the beginning of November, I must say that it wasnt quite what I was expecting, Room very small, chair stained. no heating at all and it was freezing! Bathroom very nice and shower nice and hot, bed clean. room a bit shabby could do with a lick of paint and the ceiling/wall could do with repairing. every morning on leaving the hotel to take in all NYC had to offer, we could smell weed all up the corridors and stairs. Corridors and stairs very shabby especially carpet which didn't look like it had been hoovered in some months. All of the day staff were very pleasant and professional however the night porter (who looks like Apollo from the real housewives of Atlanta) did not seem interested in his job at all. when checking in to hotel he was very vague;3
Handy for subway and buses on the edge of Hollywood. Good breakfast. Lifys slow but being improved. Not many stairs in any event. Good reception staff and nice rooms. Avoid being need Coke and Ice machines.;3
We stayed at the New Yorker end August 2017 on our first visit to New York. The lobby was very modern and very busy, and in a great central location. We got checked in fairly quickly and upgraded to a view of the water ( which you could just see from the window if you squinted). The room and corridors look a bit tired and could def do with a lick of paint. The room itself had 2 small double beds and a small dated bathroom ( the hot water for shower was extremely hot, you had to turn it on slightly) . Would have benefited from a kettle, had we known they were not provided would have bought one with us. Saying that the room was clean and our beds made every day. We did have to ring down to reception one eve due to the swearing in the next room ( my 13 year old could hear every;3
Make sure the valet does not pre-charge you for the stay as you have the option for self-parking on a second lot not owned by Hyatt.Valet pre-charged me for 3 nights without my approval or knowledge.;3
The best part about the hotel is its location, walking distance for all the locations and near to A, C, E line on Penn station. But that's the only good part about the hotel.  The hotel is still looks very dated and inspite of all the makeovers there is still a lot of work to be done. The suite rooms are dated and not worth it, maybe the refurbished single rooms might be better. Considering the scale of hotel it's a pain to ask for anything be it fresh towels or coffee cups, they take ages to arrive. Wish they complete the renovation ASAP and regain there past glory;3
A great location and it looked promising.  But the service falls far short for a hotel in this price class.  Arrived at 3 PM, but my room wasn't ready.  It wasn't ready when they projected either.  So they took my phone number ... and never called to tell me it was ready.  Basically I had to keep checking.   My cell phone would not work in the lobby, and there is no phone they could let me use (speaking of phones, to use the landline phone in the room is absurdly expensive even for toll free calls).  So I missed a conference call.  Being out of my room also prevented me from practicing my upcoming evening speech.  When my room was finally ready, it took 10 minutes to get in an elevator.  There are not enough elevators in the building.  There was a similar problem when checking;3
A family of 2 adults were mistakenly given a 3-bed room on 1st night (booked for 3 nights for 2pax) and was informed to move at 11.45pm almost mid night due to their own Front Desk mistake and we refused till we can move out the next morning. We were not in the room when our room was opened and a written note was found on top of the fridge, scarring us both for Invasion of Privacy in our absence.   Couldn't sleep till after midnight as room and window faces main road, smokers chatting away below loudly and Doors banging slamming from any room doors, kitchen and bathroom. Kitchen well equipped (oven, hot stove & microwave) except for any cooking utensils.  Good location as bus ride away from Westfield shopping mall and Shepherd's Bush and walking distance to nearest subway;3
The room we stayed in was 2 queen beds. The floors were tiled and have never seen a mop a day in its life. Breakfast that was included was mediocre, and having frozen bread from the day before topped it off. However the front counter staff were very friendly and more than helpful. Very central to shops and public transport. The self parking was great but the pricing is very steep at $25 a day. I guess the hotel has to make money somehow.;3
"Confusing, this is listed as and the sign said Abercorn House. First impression is things are tight. They take cash only; WiFi 1 quid for an hour; the reception is behind glass only two small slots for taking cash, it communicates unfriendliness/unsafe area, key deposit 5 quids...The place is inhabited mostly by long-term workers.    The first two floors have just been remodeled, freshly painted and sparkling clean. When I was there for four nights there were no construction noise early in the morning, although works were still been done on the upper floors.    This is not the place to meet people. A few times I peeped into the TV/computer room, only a couple of unfriendly guys appeared to be workers were there: four of the six computers were broken, soda machine were broken. I";3
"We stayed here recently as a family of 4.We were greeted by the Bell Desk Staff , but not by reception. During my 3 day stay here , not once did I see the reception staff smile.The rooms are on the old side and felt a little bit cramped.Elevators were ""temperamental"" kept on jamming. I tried cashing an American Express Travellers check for US$100 early in the morning and was told to try later in the day as there was no cash available.

The Jane is a spectacular hotel. It looks amazing, from the entrance hall with the stuffed peacocks on the wall and the cubby hole style reception desk, to the upholstered bedroom walls and immaculate black and white bathrooms. They have taken great care to create a period feel and all the fixtures and fittings fit beautifully. It really is quite jaw dropping when you arrive.  So it is quite sad that overall I'd have to say our stay was average and that it would be hard to recommend. We stayed in one of the Captains Cabins. We had heard it had a popular bar or nightclub and so we asked for a high floor to avoid the noise. It only has 6 and we got the 5th. The club did not bother us at all. However, our incredible view across the water out towards the Statue of Liberty had a;3
Had been to the rooftop bar before but this was my first stay overnight. The location is accessible to trains and close to upper west side attractions as well as Central Park and Lincoln Center.   Check in was easy and I was upgraded to a street view. Could hear the refuse collection in the early am but otherwise I had no complaints. The room was clean and adequate sized. There were no glasses in the room, just the hotel branded paper cups and a Keurig machine with a $3 charge per K-cup.;3
Very central hotel with easy access to all the main sights however we had to pay for Internet acces ($12 per day), the pool deck was closed all week and no free tea and coffee in the rooms.  However the doormen and housekeeping staff were very friendly.;3
I found the staff wonderful from doormen to front desk to housekeeping. The rooftop bar was lovely. The room had many amenities, including an umbrella, blowdryer, and refrigerator. The location was perfect.  The bathroom had a fixed glass panel behind the shower head and water ran everywhere, so I really didn't want to use it more than once. The bathroom sink was slow to drain unless you removed the stopper entirely. The pillows were not comfortable. Would not stay there again as I have had better room experiences elsewhere.;3
The rooms are truly small but since you don't spend a lot of time at the hotel while in NY, that is not a problem.  Not all of the rooms have good views but if you are lucky to get a good view, it is bonus.  Hotel is a good value compared to most hotels in NYC.  It is close to Penn Station and you can walk to a lot of must see places.;3
The room was very small with no adequate room for our toiletries. The bar restaurant and the Tick Tock restaurant had an inadequate number of servers to consider eating at. Called the front desk about a bag the airline sent over and I was told I had to come for it without even asking to have it delivered. I felt that was rude and unprofessional. Otherwise everything else was good.;3
I stayed at the Hilton Universal for two nights in December 2021.  I knew the experience was going to be rough as soon as I pulled in.  I didn't see the sign for self park, so I went up to the front and asked where to go.  The person out front pointed to a ramp and said down there.  They pointed to the valet ramp.  We thought it was weird but whatever.  The valet came over and started screaming at us.  We explained we were told to come here, had no issues moving, but could someone show us where to go? They kept yelling at us to leave.  Great start.  Check in line was long and slow but they got us in.    The room was on the 4th floor, good size, mostly clean.  I saw some dirt in the bathroom and the phone was filthy.  You'd think they'd increase cleaning with COVID, but no.;3
"Good location, close to Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times Square. The staff is very friendly and serviceminded. The hotel needs an upgrade, the rooms were poor, bathroom worn down and no door in the shower. It was not possible to adjust the temperature on the AC, had to plug it out bedause it got too cold. The lobby and the lobby bare were very nice, so was also the roof top bar. Although the stairs up to the deck on the roof had not been cleaned for several years it seemed. The rooftop deck has also got a pool, very small, but still a pool in NYC; big plus!. Even though the rooms were not that nice I think that this hotel offers value for money in this area of NYC/Manhattan.";3
The location is absolutely PERFECT for the metropolitan opera.  Literally 10 minutes from final curtain to hotel room!  The west-side location is also very convenient to Central Park, and to the underground via Columbus Circle station.  The hotel seemed extremely expensive for what you get -- but I'll readily admit that I am not a regular New York traveler, and by the standards of that city it was probably very reasonable -- a little over $1000 for three nights.  The room was small, with only a shower and no tub, but quiet and comfortable enough.    The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly, and found me a room when, upon arrival, I realized that I had booked on the wrong night!  The booking error was mine, not theirs, but they went out of their way to help me.;3
"NYC hotels are hit but mostly miss. .new yorker is a miss..the renovation did little to make me like this place. Standard rooms are small. I was ""upgraded"" to a dark room that had no counter space in the bathroom. Walls are thin. Location is okay. Great for javitz center but so so to see the sights. Staff unengaged. Doorman reluctant to help..pass unless the price is right.";3

I stayed there over weekend in two bed room with my son. We came in on a red eye flight and the room was ready at 9am, what a gift! The hotel is old, cared for but basic. Room was large for the money in NYC, two double beds, comfortable. I like the neighborhood, easy access to two subway lines. Room was quiet. Help came quickly for lamp needing repair. I was well satisfied, it met our needs.;3
On arrival we were met with a building site on our floor, with restricted access to our room. On returning to the room after spending the evening out, we were unable to unlock the door, resulting in 30 minutes of trips to reception, failed attempts at resetting locks, and the delivery of a duvet that we didnât ask for. Luckily the bed was comfortable, and after a considerable period of calming down we fell asleep. This wasnât for long mind, as the delivery of beer barrels at 6:30 would have been the perfect alarm clock had I have been off to work. (we werenât). Iâve stayed at County hall several times before. Tjis time was the last.;3
After reviewing places to stay in NYC and looking for something different, fun for my boyfriend and I. We decided to book at The Empire for a weekend getaway. Upon the mediocre unwelcoming check-in at the front desk we decided to head up to the rooftop for drinks until our room was ready. Great rooftop and relaxing atmosphere! However, when trying to talk to bartender he seemed more attentive to his co-worker then actual guests!   Once, our room was ready we were disappointed from that point on...service was unfriendly, the room itself was disappointing and looked run down and overused. I took photos of mildew and chipping paint in the bathroom, peeling wallpaper and what looked like water stains on ceiling. I would definitely rate it below 3 stars and not worth the money...on;3
After arriving for a two night stay to a lovely greeting and nice room we were disappointed with how the end of our trip was ruined by a disorganised and rude employee who forget our late check out (which we paid a large sum of money for) and resulted in us having to leave a paid tour early to resolve the problem.  The response we got from the hotel when we returned was also less than acceptable.  So disappointed in this end to what had been a wonderful trip around the US.;3
The hotel is conveniently located in Times Square South and very easy to get to by train. Youâre walking distance to many attractions in midtown. Leaving the hotel, it took us only 10-15mins to walk from one side of Times Square to the next. The hotel itself was a bit worn. The windows in our room were covered in grim from the outside, making them opaque. There were loose tiles in the bathroom, rips in the wallpaper, and many of the installations like the towel racks kept falling off the walls. I also hate when a hotel uses a top sheet, instead of a fitted sheet for the mattress. This leaves parts of the mattress exposed. But, all of these issues were mostly aesthetic. The shower and bathroom were huge. The ceiling, super high. The rainfall shower head was so luxurious. The bed;3
We, shockingly for us, had to pay for parking ($15) this second time staying at a hotel in LA. The website does mention this actually, we learnt after it was too late. The Front desk just did what they had to do without a smile. Not rude but not welcoming either. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean with a nice shower. The room opened into a courtyard in the back which was nice. Nice location for Hollywood. Breakfast was included.;3
We arrived at 1 o clock to be told it would cost to check in early but that she would do it for free ( didnât really understand this as the room was ready).  All I can say about this hotel is that itâs very average. Good location, however our room was absolutely tiny, run down bathroom, and air con that didnât work very well.  On check out we had to pay to keep our bags in the hotel whilst we went out for the day- hadnt we paid enough? If I returned to New York would probably pay more to stay somewhere else.  No other issues apart from these;3
"Is it a 4 or 5 star hotel?....No, it is not; however, it is in a nice residential area and close to CVS, Duane Read Pharmacy, Cafe 71, Starbucks, Subway (restaurant and train), Grays Papaya, McDonald's, Riverside Park, and Broadway, and a few blocks away from Central Park. My family and I stayed for 5 nights, walked everywhere and never felt unsafe. It suited our needs perfectly and paid under $100 bucks a night! We were in the city to sightsee and not to stay at our hotel all day. We had an issue with our first room but the hotel clerk was friendly and courteous, they switched us to another room right away with no problem. The bathroom, towels, linens are clean and smell like bleach...(I like that). If you are looking for a hotel were you can be spoiled, go swimming, and to the";3
Stayed one night to attend an event at the Metropolitan Opera NY.    Positives: - Excellent location to Lincoln Center. It is directly across the way. Best part of our stay.  - Price very reasonable. Would have loved the check out the rooftop bar, heard it is amazing, but ran out of time.  - Room is well decorated (but dark and small, but, hey, itâs New York.)  - The Smith restaurant is nearby and is a great place to get drinks and eat.  Negatives: - The front desk girl tells us that two bottles of water in the room are complimentary. What she doesnât tell us is that two little bottles on each night stand are complimentary and the ever so slightly larger bottles that look identical to the small ones are $5. I walk in the room, start drinking a bottle of complimentary water and;3
Convenient to airport but not much else going for it.  Room service average at best and overpriced after added charges and tip.  Was charged for room water that was not used.  Got that corrected after a few phone calls but an unnecessary hassle.;3
Hotel is very Central everyone was very pleasant rooms were clean however a bit small and could do with being updated the rooms are very dated the best thing is the location as you could go shopping and sightseeing and go back to the hotel for a rest and a cup of tea or just to drop off the heavy shopping.;3
This hotel is in a great location for getting to all the sites. It has a carp ark which you will have to pay a daily charge. The breakfast included is amazing, fresh fruit, cereals, and a chef on hand to cook eggs any style and waffles.;3
Reservation and check in was great.  The Location was perfect, and I felt secure even coming in late in the night.  I unfortunately was over charged and a week later, I am still waiting on my account to be corrected. Looking forward to hearing from someone.;3
My friends and I booked a room here for a one night stay while visiting a friend in West Hollywood. It was about the closest we could get. Rooms were updated and breakfast was practically made to order which was awesome. Keep an eye on the small print when you book. We booked a double bed room not thinking we would have to specify four people. We figured this was common sense for two beds but ended up paying more for the mistake. The conceirege would not honor us anything for the practical mistake and we paid 30 extra per person, 60 more than expected! On top of that, we could not cancel our room based on the 100% no refund cancellation fee. Good Luck if you'd like to stay here!;3
The first room, supposedly a Superior King, was small and the bath was ridiculously small.  The AC was weak, but we went out to dinner and returned, hoping it would be cooler.  It wasn't.  I called the desk, they sent up an engineer, who said it was as good as it gets.  He recommended we be moved.  The Night Manager showed us another room, handicapped, but cool. We went to pack and then he called to say he was moving us to a suite since it was late and we had been inconvenienced.  The new room was very comfortable.  The bath was still small, but better.  Service by the Night Manager saved trip.  He hotel is in a great location.  Be sure to have the French Toast for breakfast!;3
The hotel is nice it's old school clean.  The customer service was great.  Except for the people that actually make sure you are a guest they don't remember you they always make sure you have a key and if you are carting food and your hands are full they do not even bother to help you not cool.  They don't even offer to help you with your luggage.  That part sucks there unfortunately.  The maids are great they help you more then the people downstairs friendly.  The conceair service sucked not friendly no discounts.  It seems like they are desperate to sell tix to shows, bus tours and boat tours,  We bought a boat tour that took us along to see the bridges and the Statue of Liberty it was awesome but the customer service said it was a couple blocks down the street nope it was;3
We arrived after a long road trip from Las Vegas to be told only one of our three room bookings had been paid for. This was incorrect and despite showing the credit card statement the male receptionist would not accept the rooms had been paid for. This resulted in a long call to the booking office who confirmed the rooms were paid for and eventually after speaking to accounts the check in clerk accepted all rooms were paid for and we booked in. No apology.  The beautiful picture of the 'Hollywood Hotel' is in fact in the car park at the rear of the hotel. The hotel is in a very seedy area which is surrounded by a large group of tented homeless people although they did not bother us. Just be careful, we didn't walk anywhere in the area but it was a good base for Hollywood,;3
Hotel was in a great location right on Broadway and only a few blocks from central park, lots of cafes and restaurants etc. Service was very average, the concierge barely smiled and just stared at people as they came and went.   The 4 elevators that service the building are extremely slow (1 was broken the 4 days we were there) we would wait on average 3-4 minutes every time we wanted to use them. there was an ice machine only on certain levels of which on level 5 there is no sign to show where it is, so when i went back to my room (again after waiting several mins for the lift) i rang reception to ask where it was and they told me it was next to a room number, so i wetn back to that level and then when i found it, it was out of order and to use the one on another level, so i;3
"I stayed here 1 night while in town for a business meeting. The location was very convenient and seemed to be right in the heart of everything (close to Penn Station and subway station, many restaurants/ food options, etc.). My hotel room was on the smaller side and a bit dated, but clean and no major issues. Minor complaint was the TV was pretty sub par in terms of very bad picture quality and minimal channels. I used the fitness room which I found to be pretty adequate for a hotel (decent amount of cardio options, some weight machines, dumbbells and enough room to spread out). I thought the resort fee was a bit high (31$) considering there didn't seem to be any real ""resort amenities"". Overall I was pleased with my stay and had no major issues.";3
Great location.Very classy hotel. BUT.. With way below freezing temps outside, we had to put room A/C on high. Ask for an extra sheet upon arrival. Only hot down comforter on bed to sleep under.  STRANGE!;3
Our room was terrible. I never complain about the room, but this was the first time that I couldn't stand the dirtiness. The hair was all around the bathroom. The towels were dirty and disgusting, looked like they were not washed. I didn't have space in the room to open my suitcase how small the room was (just space for a bed). I complained to the manager about this. They apologized and immediately gave us another room. The new room was much better, but still not very clean. This hotel should not be more than 3 stars. Elevators were very slow and congested. The hotel provided free printing, which was very good. However, we needed to pay $5 per baggage when we wanted to leave the baggage in the hotel in order to wait for our flight. This was the only hotel I stayed at that asked;3
The positive: fantastic location near Broadway, restaurants, and access to transportation. Staff very nice. Depending on who you ask, some staff knowledgeable others not so much. The room was small but clean enough. The bathroom was sufficient and nice. The not so positive:  we were on the second floor facing the street. The city noise was loud enough to interfere with sleep. The air conditioner is just SO LOUD. Annoyingly so. The tv had intermittent connection on many channels. The fridge - locked. I found this very odd.  The snacks were mini muffins daily-nothing great.   The lobby is very nice and the area safe. I wouldnât rule out staying again due to location and cost, but will likely check elsewhere.;3
Far too expensive. Room are small but ok for NYC as always difficult to find a great hotel there with good value for money. But here the service was so poor, staff (except the concierge..., so useful..and the doormen) was not friendly, one of the bar waitress was just so rude, I had no time to argue, otherwise i would have gone mad...very disappointed, will change hotel next business trip to NYC.;3
One of the cheapest hotels I found on a summer month in near the main manhattan NYC which usually has expensive hotels if you want a comfortable room, anything much cheaper could be a shared room or shared bathroom, or a backpacker type inn,so I settled for this one to have hotel like comfort and service. Rooms were quite spacious, clean bathrooms, we booked the premier rooms, I wasnt disappointed with them. The bad part of the hotel is the service, no concierge would help us store our luggage and we have to carry almost a dozen bags by ourselves to the storage room. Reception could be better and elevators are tiny and slow. Location is near the central park,subway, small cafes and fastfood joint.;3
Nothing really special here. The pool is MUCH smaller than it appears online, but at least they have a pool so no complaints here. First room smelled like mold/mildew and they promptly changed me to a new room. Concierge is VERY helpful. Overall for the price I just expected more, but like I said nothing really special just an average hotel with a pool. I would return again but only for the pool (NY doesn't have very many hotel pools).;3
Hotel was nice, I paid for a queen room and queen bed, but the room was very small and it was a double bed. Location was ok right by Central Park, bit of a walk down to Macy's etc. No wifi too which was a pain when trying to call family.;3
Room was on 23rd floor very cold and noisy, there was no view, room could do with up dating. also kitchen smells in the room. Staff very helpful and friendly and great location. Shame we were disappointed as this was our first visit to New York City.;3
We stayed for 2 nights at the Empire Hotel while visiting family whom live in the area in a superior king sized room. The hotel is in a great location at 63rd and Broadway in the UWS, with easy access to Lincoln Center, Central Park, and the rest of Manhattan via the close metro stop 4 blocks down at 59th and Columbus Circle. When we first checked in, we were given the wrong size room (a queen), which is very small (likely less than 100 sq ft) and contains no furniture to unpack clothes in. However, we walked down to the front desk and showed them our confirmation email from Orbitz and they corrected the problem politely and quickly (even provided free wifi for our trouble). The superior king room was large enough for the two of us but would be cramped with more people. While;3
The room was a great size, the beds were comfy. The hotel has received some great and some poor reviews.   To be clear, when we booked we were under the impression that breakfasts and a restaurant were available onsite, when viewing the online site. The reality is Covid closed this option, totally understandable, however the site and details of the hotel needs an urgent update. The details are how people decide whether to stay or not, so to be fair to your customer they need to be honest and up to date.  The mixed reviews are right, there are homeless people up the road, but they were not an issue at all, and certainly not the responsibility of the hotel.  Public transport is close by, bus and rail. Being without a car is no issue in getting around.  The room was a little tired;3
Stayed one night for business in May 2017.  The room was clean, the hotel was Deco palatial int he lobby, but the rooms are small, and the bathroom was the smallest one I've ever been in--including on a cruise ship.  No room for even a tissue box.  Could not use the toilet with the door open.  Towels a little ragged at the edges.  Toilets flush with industrial force--and you can hear the toilets from rooms above and below and to either side of you--also hear faucets running.  And the street noise is unfiltered--hear it all night long too.  Can't reach the curtains, so good luck trying to block the light.  Pillows smelt like essence of old man hair--they need some freshening badly.;3
The place and price point was great BUT the bed was super soft and so although I didn't get a great night sleep I would give it a second chance because it was clean, convenient, and service great. Be aware that we stayed in a room the size of a closet but that was no problem as we were hardly in it.;3
We booked this hotel as my birthday treat for our  last night on holiday after 2 weeks staying with relatives in the states.  Expectations were high, given the price and the photos, we didn't mind spending for a little bit of luxury and were very much looking forward to this.  We arrived in NYC at 7 am that morning and went straight to the hotel to, presumably, leave our bags with concierge and head out for the day.  Luckily there was a room available and we were able to check in early, this was so very much appreciated!   The check in staff were pleasant, but not really welcoming or friendly. I know it was early in the morning, but a smile would have been nice.   We were in room 1144 or 1141, so up to 11th floor, and into our closet.  Our room was down a little nook which gave;3
This hotel was nice, with particular reference to the breakfast facilities  and the shuttle bus worked well. I associate Hilton with high quality yet I feel this didn't measure up to other Hiltons I had attended.;3
Agree with previous posts where room is small and location is ideal for those who already know NY and just need a clean bed to rest at night. Rooms are newly refurbished. Sheets and towels are clean and nice.   Water temperature in the bathroom is rather erratic, ranging from freezing cold to scalding hot. Water in the tub takes a while to drain. Minor irritants, nothing major.  The heating however, was a pain. The radiator did not work on our first night here. After persistent requests, they brought in a portable heater for us. The main radiator seems to only turn on early in the morning, leaving us freezing at night if not for the portable heater. We were awaken at 5.30am on our last morning here by loud clanging of pipes. Sounded like an angry person just banging on pipes;3
+ve :- excellent location , near metro station 1 ,2,3 - nice restaurants and even supermarkets so nearby - good offer for queen suite  -ve :- WIFI was so bad and so slow - bed height was so high - no maintenance in 1st night for the heater but solved next morning - the water temp was not stable;3
"Ok. Well if you have read any of my reviews you will know that they are spot on. So lets take a quick look at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. This current hotel was built in 1930; and basically refurbed a bit in 1994. The Wyndham chained has owned since about 2014. With that said keep in mind the building is 85 years old. This hotel is a mid price range hotel on the backside of MSG (the garden). I stayed in room #2926 which has a great city view and basically a straight shot of THE EMPIRE STATE BLDG. The bathrooms are nice-ISH. For a 85 yr old building that only charges people/patrons a price point of mid range it is what you pay for. Water pressure is good in shower and occassionally you will get hit with ice cold water and then it will go back to hot. So piece of advice is dont";3
A standard Hilton with nice big rooms and a decent size pool. Parking is not free (this is LA!) and you walk or take a shuttle (free) to Universal Studios. Bar is nice although a little expensive. Rooms were comfortable and the large windows/views (of the freeway/hills) good. Elevators seemed to have a mind of their own and can take a while to stop at your floor.;3
A very good location, just a block from Highline, good value for money in an expensive city like New York and very friendly/ helpful staff. The Single room is the smallest I have ever seen in my life and you can't even move in the room.;3
The hotel is located very near universal studios and they have free shuttle to universal  It is an old hotel and the room is a bit dated but spacious. It would have received 4 star if it had not tried to overcharge me. Hilton had a weekender rate for my booking and I booked that. At check in they tried to charge me more and when I showed the confirmation from Hilton with the rates spelled out the guy at reception said oh sorry I can't honor that rate come speak to my manager. Which I thought was poor form.  Spoke to the manager or someone that night and thought issue was resolved. At checkout they tried to overcharge me again and I have to waste time sorting this out (the lady was helpful but it was still a waste of 15 mins and I had a flight to catch)  Also the perks for being;3
really disappointed for the money we paid, room was so small, we did not have room to place our two suitcases, complained to hotel we were then given a slightly larger room which was more acceptable, hotel is older and really  needs upgraded, and staff were not very  friendly.;3
Friendly staff, problems with check in (no reservation in system) problem with length of stay but staff made things ok really helpful at sorting things out.  Room hade funny smell and some mold in shower;3
Location is great. I love that the Tickety Tock diner in the hotel is open 24/7. The rooms are clean but very small. I've stayed here several times and the line to check in and leave or pick up luggage seems to always be long. No real complaints but I wouldn't rave about anything here other than the convenient location.;3
"If you can get a room ""cheap"" (around $100-$120), this place is a good value. Anything more and you'll be unhappy.  I've stayed at Days Hotel twice now. The reason I came back was because of my great experience the first time. Unfortunately, the second time was nowhere near as good but I would still recommend the Days Hotel and I would probably come back and stay here again.  First, the location is unbeatable. It is nestled in the Upper West Side, a nice neighborhood. I walked around by myself at 2am and felt perfectly safe. It is right next to the subway line and that is what makes it so good. You can get around the entire city just by taking one step out of your hotel door. There are plenty of other amenities around the corner, including a little grocery store, drug store,";3
A stay at the New Yorker is not a cheap experience even with a booking site. It was clean but limited.  No in room fridge,and the room while clean is small with paper thin walls. Ideal for staying in NYC because of location. The staff is friendly and considerate which made the stay bearable. If you are looking for a centrally located space with limited amenities.  This is your place.;3
Arrived after a horrendous experience with immigration at JFK ,4 hours in a queue to get through,had room on the 19th floor looking down to 35th Street ,room very small ( expected for NY) and very dated,bathroom also tired,no storage,toilet flush very loud,talking about noise it honestly sounded like the window was open the amount of outside noise you got in the room from car horns and sirens.one last gripe was the bag storage,we had a late flight and had to store our bags,were charged $5 a bag,I have NEVER been charged at a hotel before and we travel regularly,a final insult !! On the plus side and why it got a 3,location good ,next to Penn station ,Hudson yard and time Square a short walk,staff nice and maid did a good job. On last observation on new York as a whole was the;3
"Great services, average rooms, multiple problems experienced with room (tv didn't work; AC was unreliable so room temp was uncomfortable the whole stay; they ran out of coffee for the rooms--how is that possible in NYC? , Terrific bar tenders. Roof top bar was fabulous. Go to get drinks but can't recommend staying.";3
Given its location directly next to Universal Studios, it is not surprising that this hotel was rather touristy.  But it makes it less than ideal for a business stay.  It is nice enough, though, and quite clean and well maintained.;3
I typically stay at four to five star hotels primarily Hilton's etc. However my assistant made a mistake and I ended up at Hollywood Hotel. I have to be honest I was a little disappointed at first due to my assistants error however upon entry to the hotel I was greeted by the friendliest staff I have ever meet! It did not stop at check in. The service was incredible throughout my entire stay. Two people stood out to me in particular. The first being Hugo. Hugo greeted my at the elevator my first day having breakfast. After taking my order we spoke for a great deal of time in detail about my trip to Los Angeles. The personal service Hugo provides is second to none! Not even the many Hilton hotels I typically stay at have staff members as friendly or as helpful as Hugo was to me.;3
"If you visit the universal studios, this hotel is right where you want to be. A free shuttle takes you there in less than 5 minutes.  Rooms are excellent. Large and with very comfortable beds. Views from the room were outstanding . Reception staff are quite friendly.  One strange thing that caught my eye when I checked in was that there were two hotel staff ""managing"" the elevators. I thought that it was a traditional thing, but not: elevators have all sort of problems: they delay an eternity. When I finally boarded one, it was empty and it stopped in every single floor -from the 12th, without anyone getting into it (!). Haunted? Then I could t board one or two that were full. All of that in one day!  The other downside was the concierge. The poor young lady really doesn't like";3
"You really take a chance at the Empire- you could get a nice newly refurbished room, but the HVAC system might not be working and your room looks out on an airshaft. After broiling alive- and it was March- they wanted to bring me a FAN! While that drowned out the noisy airshaft, it did little to relieve the desert-like heat in the room. And let's not forget about that showerhead that can't be adjusted unless you're 8'tall (the same with the ""make-up mirror"" that's set for a 6'4"" man...";3
Lots of noise and a very small room.  Dont expect much sleep you hear everything from water running to toilets flushing.;3
It's too bad that we had a number of issues during our stay here because the hotel had some nice features and is located conveniently for us. My first issue was with the parking. I was told one thing at check in, another by the parking attendant and then had a confrontation with a third staffer at the front desk who gave me a totally different story. My second issue was with the hotel rates. I got a nice reasonable rate by booking online through tripadvisor. When I went to check out, the rate was considerably higher and even though I had a printed copy of my reservation, they refused to honor it. I will be taking this up with my credit card company. Thirdly, they use the same tiles on the floor of the shower stalls as on the walls....they are so slippery that I slid and almost;3
Check in was nice and easy the receptionist was lovely and really cheery really happy to help. Had no issues with checking in/check out or concierge like some of the other reviews. Location is great however the rooms are in the small side even for nyc. They are also really noisy even for nyc. The heating makes a racket and walls are paper thin we could hear our neighbour coughing all night. The bathroom is tiny and run down, paint was peeling off and housekeeping one day didn't give us new towels.  For what we needed it for the hotel was ok as we were barely there. But the rooms let it down so unfortunately wouldn't stay here again. No major complaints just an average stay.;3
"Stayed 3 nights at this hotel.  Room was clean and in good shape.  Location is exceptional : seconds away from the subway, 2 Starbuck, great Italian restaurant nearby (Acqua).  The staff was very nice and helpful.  We had a few issues though.  Wifi was ""temporarily"" out of service for 4 days... We had to go Starbuck to get Internet access.  No working ice machine on 4 floors (3 to 6), not nice when you want to have a drink.  Elevators were slow, when we used them.  Tired of waiting, we used the stairs most of the times (we were on the 5th floor).  I recommend this place.";3
Felt like a mix between a hotel and hostel with shared bathroom and separate bedroom. The bedroom environment felt like a hostel. The bed was not very comfortable, but the room was decent size for a hostel (and small for a hotel). The Budgetplaces.com website charges a separate fee (~$50 extra) from what is listed on the website as the price to stay here.;3
Hotel had everything we needed. The only downside was that there was a mouse in my sisters room and then ran into her 2 children's joining room. She rang down to reception in the middle of the night and got no answer. She had to get dressed and go down herself. The Manager took her to one side and said they would investigate. we were moving on next morning and was told that they would ring us. No phone call or apology.  My sister asked for a refund through out travel company but this was refused. She was offered a free nights stay in the hotel if she was to return, as if!!.;3
Good location and clean rooms.  Quirky but dark rooms and corridors and depressing communal areas. Air con not effective.  Loved the location and have stayed here twice but the second time was for a longer business trip and felt too long because of overall slightly deppressing atmosphere.;3
First of all I think it is a very dark place, not enough light. Too dark for me, I will never go back!The air condition did not work the first night and the second night we were evacuated because there was a power outraged!!! They took a long time tomlet people know about it, hotel was not well prepared for this, not emergency lights in the exit stairs, simply crazy! The room size was ok, but bathroom horrible!!! It was tiny, no it is very expensive for what it is!!!ventilation, it was like a sauna.;3
This hotel located five minutes away from Los Angeles metro station. However, there are many people approach other people around metro station, which made me feel insecure, and won't recommend person who consider to stay at this hotel alone, you will feel insecure when you walk back home by yourself in the dark night. Hotel staff seems not knowing the stuff well, and not welling to help guest. Overall, it's just a hotel for people to stay, highly recommend people who stay in this hotel have to be at least group of two people.;3
"After reading some of the reviews we approached the hotel with some trepidation, bug spray and deodorizer.  Were lucky enough to have a friendly woman wait for us to turn around so we were able to park very close.  The elevator held both my husband, myself and our luggage.  The room was small, clean, and cheerfuly decorated.   Yes, the hallway was grim and I did see a cockroach or two but also saw them at the cafeteria at Macy's.  Did not notice any bad smells.  The low hotel price made it possible for us to do more of the things that mattered.  Neighborhood is safe; there is easy access to transportation.  Staff was very helpful when asked.  I'm not sure why our experience was so much better than others who have review Riverside Studios but perhaps attitude might be a clue.";3
We arrived at the Hotel after a long flight from the UK There was a long queue waiting to been seen. It went down fast the lady at the desk was very nice and asked if we wanted a room with a view or a bigger room we have but no view. We went for the bigger room. We made our way up to our room. Did not get any help with our luggage cannot remember what floor we were on but it was very high up. We found our room at last  We were told we could have a big room when we got in the room was dull one very small window looking out at a wall. Yes we were told large room no view but this room was tiny dark old fashioned the bathroom was not good dripping tap all night was not like a hotel bathroom cold did not look like it had been looked after old fashioned shower  not toilet paper.

The staff is very friendly. The style is Art deco and looks great. However, the bathrooms are still from the 1930's..... Also requesting for a room number on reservation in June doesn't give you the room number in December. Even after sending a (not answered by the hotel) reply a week before arrival. Value for money? NO.;3
We've just returned from a week's stay at the Ameritania Hotel. Everything in New York is expensive, so there was no quibble about price. This is the sister hotel of the Empire Hotel, so we expected similar. Unfortunately the amenities didn't match up at all. This is a far smaller hotel with only a breakfast room and a small bar. No rooftop bar, attached restaurant or feeling of luxury that the Empire offers. There was room service to eat outside food brought in, but with the whole of the Times Square choice of restaurants on our doorstep, who would want that? Our room was reasonably sized, but we either had to have the window open and endure the noise even during the night, or have the extremely noisy air conditioning on. We opted for the open window. The bed was very good and;3
Shocked that only one cup of coffee is given per suite.  No room service.  Did not get a call back from lost and found for my gym clothes left behind the bathroom door.  Why does one have to forfeit the entire reservation (mine was 7 nights) if they do not show up on the first day.;3
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel for 1 night; I was in town to see an opera at the Met. The hotel's location is fantastic; it's right across the street from Lincoln Center. The hotel itself was very chic, almost too chic for me. Check-in took a little while, but we had just come with a big group and they handled us as best they could. The room was fine; the bed was very comfy and there was enough closet space for my outfit. The bathroom was a little funny; the shower didn't have a full door. (It reminded me of showering in a French hotel...and not in a good way.) The room also didn't have many light sources; it just had the entryway light, the light inside the bathroom, and a lamp on the nightstand. But it was well-stocked and included earplugs by the beds, I'm guessing to combat";3
At first lookthe the hotel was great, nice room, good location. But the first morning when we went to breakfast there was a cockroach running across the wall next to me. Made my skin crawl. On the 3rd night the toilet overflowerd through out the bathroom, when we called reception he came in and said here's some towels someone will fix it tomorrow. eeek The location was good though, the train was just across the road which made it cheap and easy to get to the kodak theatre and to Universal and downtown. They had tours on offer that pick you up from the hotel which was great. For the money it was okay, but they do need to do some work to the place.;3
Here you have to take care: We had booked room in two periods. Both times we got a poor room at first! They were changed by the serviceminded reception. 1.poor room was at 1. floor to the street. Room was worn and the noise from the street was heavy. 2.poor room to the yard was very worn with a lot of damages in the bath. It was NOT clean.The door was too little and you were able to look into the room from outside. Also this was changed by reception. Be sure to take a renovated room. If you get a NOT renovated room you might better go to a very cheap motel!;3
The Jane Hotel is inexpensive (by NYC prices), quirky, eccentric, and different. This was a very last minute NYC run (in December - 5 days before Christmas) and I was lucky to find a room at all under a king's ransom.The rooms are designed like railroad car sleepers. That's all there is to them--all 50 ft. However, I was in NYC to see my son so I just need somewhere clean to sleep and it was  clean. The bottle of water in the room, slippers & robe (to go down the hall to the bathroom) were a nice touch. I have never stayed in a hostel before and it was a bit odd (to me) to leave my room with mussed hair, no make-up, & in my pj's to hurry down the hall to bathe. It reminded me a bit of my college dormitory days! I'm a bit old for this but I'm sure young people wouldn't mind;3
Brian the Fd Supervisor checked us in -- He needs a new uniform jacket as his current does not fit him correctly.  Our room was on the 7th floor with a great view.(I have attached a picture from our room)  We checked in late but found the late night room service very helpful as we traveled across country all day.  The food was not very good to be honest -- Very expensive -- 2 sandwiches cost over $50.00 -- I have come to expect Room Service food to be priced high but 2 deli sandwiches with a small order of fries should not cost 50.00 and not be perfection.     The next morning we were set up for the VIP Experience at Universal -- we had a 10am report time for the event.  We talked to Brian the night before and he suggested to arrive about 30 minutes prior -- which we were;3
Stains in sheets and chairs but clean enough and good customer service. The bus that goes to the airport is also a great plus I used it both ways I left one of my bags on the bus by accident and they were very prompt and helpful I got it back quickly;3
Rooms are aged to my opinion   Towels had better days  Staff is helpful  Shuttle to universal runs every 15 min  Coffee shop closes at 2pm (!?)  If you come for one day I'd take something in LA and drive to universal studios. Stay near is nice but doesnt give you much.;3
For central NY probably acceptable but with some care and attention it could be so much better. The decor was very dated and looked drab. Shower didn't work very well, took ages to run hot! However room was a good size.;3
Excellent location!! Couldn't ask for better! Small rooms with outdated furniture and very uncomfortable bed that sank in the middle. However, all staff were very friendly and we did have a great view of Broadway from our room upon request!;3
When staying in a New York hotel it is important to keep an open mind. If you want a large room at a great price you should look perhaps in some midwestern or sunbelt city. Hotels in NYC are TINY and very pricy. We have stayed in New York hotel rooms not much larger than the bed itself and the window looks out to a brick wall 10 feet away. We do not come to NYC to hang out in a fancy hotel, so much to see and do in the city. We stayed 2 nights at the Windsor Hotel over new years. The room was somewhat tired looking but clean enough and larger than we expected and the window looked out across to Roosevelt park. Unlike other NYC hotels we have stayed at the walls were thick enough to provide a quiet night for sleeping. There are literally hundreds of restaurants within a few;3
"I've stayed at the Empire at least 30 nights over the past 2-1/2 years, primarily on business.  And I'll stay there again. PROS: --location, location, location (perfect for Upper West Side/Midtown West--across from Lincoln Center) --many great restaurants within a few minute walk --bigger rooms can be very comfy --price relative to other nearby hotels is (usually) very affordable  CONS: --not really a business-oriented hotel; caters more to the tourist (i.e., non-repeater) crowd --check-in experience can be extraordinarily frustrating (read: takes too long, even for repeat visitors) --staff isn't generally the warmest I've ever received--particularly the front door --can be a little overwhelming when there's an event or Fri/Sat nights when the club upstairs is crowded--it's";3
This Hilton is a little outdated. As a whole, the decor is gaudy and hasn't been updated since what looks like the late 80s/early 90s. It's very average. If you're looking for a convenient and adequate stay for an affordable rate, this is probably your place. Beyond that, if you're looking for luxury, look elsewhere. Here's the highlights:  Pros:  -Very comfortable bed.  -Good bath/hair products, but the room is barely stocked, so you need to request extra of it.  -Seems clean enough  Cons -Bath is pretty run down -Don't expect anything more than the bare necessities. Sometimes you see a cotton swab in your bathroom, or a little sewing kit. Not here. It's no frills. Not even a robe to use. -No spa -Wifi for a fee -Parking for a fee -The food is eh (more on that below) -Room;3
Pros: * Excellent location to explore NYC or to visit the theatre * Super friendly bellboys * Really confortable bed  Cons: * Unfriendly reception personel * AC very loud * Toilett was not cleaned during our stay (4 nights) * Shampoo, soap, etc. was not refilled during our stay;3
The good: 1) Valentina.  Great, friendly personality, helpful and cheerful.  Knowledgeable and always willing to advise and assist. Abdul - very friendly, too.  Francesco - always smiling. 2) The roof relaxation area - great view over the city, fantastic ambiance.  Too bad December is too cold in the evenings, we would certainly hang out there if it were warmer 3) Clean rooms.  Comfy beds.  Nice toiletries. 4) charming decorations. 5) the staff supplied cellphones in case guests were lost.  Very appreciated because of the confusing location.  The bad: 1) super cramped rooms. Sandal room felt like being in a closet.  2) very dark lights - we had to use flashlights to read books in our rooms. no internet signal in the rooms. Had to sit either in the breakfast room on in the cold;3
Each year we pick a Premier Inn Hotel in London to stay at (me and 2 children) so we've stayed in lots throughout the years. This was out first time at the County Hall and my kids were so excited to stay somewhere so central and near the amenities!  Checkin in was quick and easy but when we got to our floor (2nd floor) it was obvious there was work going on as there was plastic on the floors and workmen walking around. There was no noise to disrupt us at all but I knew we were in an old section of the hotel and my heart sank as this is our only family trip away and the kids love a premier inn room for how fancy it seems for us!  We were actually put in a family room for wheelchair users so there was emergency cords around the room which I was worried my kids would pull by;3
We picked the Empire because of its location and we anticipated after long days out seeing the sites we would relax with a drink on the roof top bar. The weather was great but the roof top bar wasn't open for our entire stay. Really disappointing.;3
This is a good hotel it's being refurbished and it needs doing although it good it's showing it's age hence the work. Be aware we were on the 35th floor with a great view. The room was fine but dated. But here's the thing Monday to Friday there was constant drilling really loud drilling. Which started at 10am till 5pm.but this didn't really bother us as we were out mostly but if you wanted a late sleep in your going to be unlucky. Don't bother with the tick tick Dinner food was awful and over priced. But as I said the hotel is okay and we'll placed for everything.;3
we were just in NYC for a quick one night stop and picked the Empire Hotel as we used to live on the upper west side and love the location of the hotel. for one night, it was completely fine and the staff was very nice - especially the guys at the front door! However, there are some issues i see with the hotel that would most likely make me not stay again.  the worst thing is the fact that the hotel charges for every little thing! wifi, water, coffee, anything you could think of. Now, we have stayed at many different hotels in NYC (from the Sheraton TriBeCa to the Park Hyatt) and have never paid for morning coffee or wifi...personally, i'd rather be charged 10-15 more in the night rate and have these types of things included. rooms are extremely small - even for NYC standards.;3
Well situated for opera lovers. The room and bathroom were small but of good quality and comfortable. There was a problem with the smell of the room. Perhaps smoking had been allowed there although it smelled of strong disinfectant. The staff were friendly and helpful.  The real ' deal breaker' is the Hotels mean charging practices. The water in the room cost $8. To use the coffee machine cost $3 dollars per coffee. A large tray of snacks and drinks sat alluringly on the desk - each item with a hefty price tag. Tough with guests who have brought children with them. The wifi policy was also mercenary. They advertise as having free wifi but it is only free in the lobby area and the signal was not strong there. To use wifi in the room cost $16 per device per day. Yes PER DEVICE. I;3
The Empire met our needs and was perfectly located next to Central Park and the subway.  The hotel seems like an old lady but has plenty of New York charm and sass.  Rooftop bar is great and the beds and linen are good.  Not much noise from street and our ac worked perfectly fine.  The bathroom was small but clean and adequate for 3 nights.;3
"I get it. It's New York and it's an old building. The way I look at it, I was paying for its great location. Otherwise, it was way overpriced for a small and very outdated room. Do a quick search for ""small"" or ""tiny"" then you'll see I'm not alone in my assessment. Staff was friendly but check in was a bit slow. Cleaning service was good. I was by myself for a conference, so this place worked fine. When I visit NYC with family next time, I'll definitely look elsewhere to get better bang for the buck. Felt like I was staying at a red roof inn - which I like on my road trips quite a bit - just with a much smaller room.   I saw the automatic response from the hotel on other average and bad reviews about how they'll investigate the issue. LOL, you don't know how small and dated";3
The room was honestly pretty clean and was of average size. The only downside was the shared bathroom but it really didn't bother me all that much. Hotel is in a great location within walking distance to Central Park or Morningside Park. For the price this is a great deal.;3
In addition to the comments already made concerning the bathroom, I also found the hall way to be very dark.  Room 614 is at the end of a very dark hallway, the scounces discontinue to the end.  Thank you to Ricky at reception for his assistance.;3
My daughter and I stayed at Days Inn late December 2014. We were in New York for New Years Eve. I must admit I was extremely disappointed with the hotel. Firstly, the staff told me that my room was cancelled the day before. When asked by whom, they could not advise of this information as they had no idea. So, I needed to chase down my holiday booking centre to have it sorted. I was then apologised to, advising it was their mistake.  Two of the four elevators were out of action whilst we were there and they were very old and slow. The hallways to our room were very smelly, like an old wet musty carpet smell. The room was small but adequate for what we were needing and the room was clean. The first night, we needed to call the maintenance man as we had no hot water. He came quite;3
This hotel is clean and a perfect location to the subway which is about a 20 min ride into times sq. this is a basic hotel but was perfect for our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely go to the park west Turkish deli and bakery such good breakfast and coffee and lovely staff. I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget. I would stay there again.;3
We spent the night here before an early flight out of LAX the next morning. The location is right across the street from LAX and the free shuttle to the airport is convenient.  The room was average -- nothing special. There were visible stains on the furniture, and the walls were so thin we were able to hear our neighbors throughout the night. Unfortunately, I'm not sure we would stay here again.;3
As usual, the staff was friendly and very helpful at this hotel and the bathrooms were clean.  This time we stayed in the upgraded Captain's Cabin which normally costs around $325 per night.  The size of the room was adequate and the bathroom was nice, but the elevator wasn't working and we were on the fifth floor - ugh!  There was a sheet with holes on the bed and one heavy thin blanket.  The first night the heat must have been cranking because we had to crack the window and turn on the fan and were still too hot.  The next night there was no heat at all and we had to sleep in sweat pants and shirts and were still chilly.  The mattress was hard and a bit lumpy. I really like the building and there is some really good people watching here, but we may have to look elsewhere in;3
We spent 5 nights at the Ameritania at the end of our honeymoon in August. The staff is very nice, above all Mr. Julian at the front door... The room was clean but too small, I know we had a standard room and we didn't ask for any upgrade since we didn't spend much time in there, but I would suggest to make them a bit more comfy...   The WiFi is free only in the lobby, this is something they can work on, since many other hotels in the area give it for free also in the rooms. Cocktails at the bar in the lobby are delicious and the bartenders are very sweet and welcoming. The overall experience has been good, so I would suggest this hotel for the position and treatment, not too much for the room size (but you can also ask for an upgrade to a superior room).;3
After reading the reviews, I was very worried. Let me tell you, it was for nothing! We were received by smiling, helpful staff (who were busy, but courteous) and yes, the rooms are not the ritz, but the beds were comfy and clean (I check EVERYTHING...a tad retentive), the bathroom was small, but clean. The toilet had flushing issues, but someone was up within 5 min of us calling (c'mon people, its a reaaallly old building). I found it to be a place I would stay again and recommend to friends as it was inexpensive, clean (and by clean I mean well cleaned by the staff. There are age issues with the building for sure, but that can't really be avoided. They ARE renovating), and very convenient (cab ride to times sq was around 7 bucks. you can walk, but make sure you have good, well;3
The hotel was clean and tidy. The check-in staff were polite and efficient. We arrived a little late for breakfast so were sent to the burger/sandwich bar where things fell apart. There were no signs to tell us when the breakfast bar closed. Lots of staff but no one wanted to assist. the order took forever to arrive and then just after opening to begin, one of the staff came up to say the order was wrong. How can you get a single order wrong after such a long time? My recommendations are to sleep there and eat somewhere else.;3
I got to hang out at this hotel recently with friends. We had a nice room with cool views of Lincoln Center. The price was right about $200 a night. That's pretty good for New York. The showers and rooms are pretty clean. The hotel needs some updating. Condition of rooms and hallways a little on the shabby side. Staff was nice. The pool deck with cool views of the upper West side was too crowded. The pool is really just a lap pool and the water gets dirty. It's also a bit of a trek to get up to the roof. Still I'd recommend this hotel if you're looking for a place with a convenient location that's not too expensive.;3
Convenient to the park - walking distance.  Food is awful though.  Go somewhere else!  Rooms comfortable and well furnished.  Pool area is nice and hot tub as well. There is a nice outside bar around the pool area.;3
A good location at a fair price, although the decor, probably once Bohemian is now on the shabby chic side and could do with some attention.  We were treated courteously by all the staff. The bellman was particularly helpful in getting us a taxi during the Friday rush hour build up. And, as we were celebrating a special birthday the Front Office had left us complimentary fizz and a handwritten card which was a nice touch and much appreciated: thank you Mr Casas.  I was a little disappointed that the roof terrace/bar was only open Thurs - Sat, and was booked for a private function on the Thursday night! As we were staying Mon - Fri this deprived us of the opportunity to use the facility: as this had been a main factor decision making factor when comparing similar offers this was;3
The place is not that bad.  We had a family room with our own bath, so that was a big plus.  Nice location, easy access to the subway, short walking distance to restaurants, nice staff.  We didn't see any weirdos.  The hallways were small and did smell, but we didn't stay in the hallways.  For the price it was pretty good.  Of course we only slept in the hotel, much of our time was out in the city.  The building was secure.  We had clean linen, clean towels, the room was cleaned by a nice lady.  I'd stay here again.;3
They did not credit me with having another person in the room who was suppose to pay half of the cost for the room they charged me the total cost each night. I am very upset over this issue and I would like for it to be addressed and corrected!!!;3
"A group of us stayed at the Empire Hotel for a bachelorette party two weeks ago. We were delighted by the hotel and it's location but were not thrilled with the staff and service. Two of our three rooms were ready but the third still had to be inspected. We are not very fussy so we went and had some lunch while we waited the ""thirty minutes"" until our room was ready. We went back about an hour later and the room still was not ready. Our group (16 girls) went to the rooftop deck/bar for some evening drinks before we had an appointment. We were horrified by the drink prices: $17/drink and $42 for a bucket of Coronas (gratuity included). If you are coming for the pool, you will be sorely dissapointed. The deck was beautiful and the view was unbelievable but the pool is tiny! Not";3
Hotel is clean, very well located in Manhattan. The shower system is really old fashinoed and not so convenient.  My room was really noisy due to outside system. Woomen front desk were not friendly with expeditive & quick answer. Maybe I was not lucky...;3
This was very bang average. The cheaper rooms (still $500-600 per night) are very small. The bathroom is rather unremarkable and small. It also doesn't offer any sizeable shampoo or shower gel. As well as this, there is a very loud aircon that will either keep you awake or (when turned off) the heat will do the same. For this amount of money my three night could have been better spent.   * * *;3
Hotel is really really old, but well maintained.. i would say it's old-fashioned but very clean and in good conditions... the location in midtown is really good (for those who like the craziness in this area). if you prefer something quiter, choose something else (maybe not NYC). Service is good although i haven't asked for anything excepting the mail room, which has a very organised system to secure you'll get your packages in the right way... Room is not small but not so spacious... it's acceptable... restroom was very old-fashioned too, but well maintained and cleaned...;3
I have stayed at this property many times in the past and have always had a good experience.  This time, however, was a little disappointing.  Reservation system was down when we arrived and the front desk was checking people in by hand.  K cup coffees in our room were $3.00 each, which is crazy expensive.  The air conditioning in our room went out for the night, They brought us up a fan to use.  Very disappointing nights sleep.;3
We decided to stay at this hotel due to its very close proximity to Universal Studios.  Our biggest issue with the hotel was check-in.   At the heart of the issue, is that we felt they didn't really acknowledge our diamond status or treat us specially, like we are used to having happen at other Hilton properties.  For example, we had selected an upgrade option for the room and they made us pay for it.  We understand that this is technically is allowed in the diamond program, but this hasn't ever happened at other Hilton properties - and we travel a lot.  The other hotels upgrade for free.   Also, we were charged a significant room tax per day on our room when we used points to get the room.  Again, we understand this is technically allowed, but no other hotel has ever charged us;3
I found our stay at the Hilton to be average.  Quite underwhelming to what I am used to expect from the Hilton brand.  Although the staff was nice, it just didn't feel like a happy place.  I stayed here 2 nights, and the prior 3 nights were at a Hilton Doubletree in Claremont.  Having compared the 2 I wasn't excited with this pricier hotel.  I used to live in Los Angeles and always drove by this hotel, so for nostalgia I picked this hotel.  I wanted it to be more, it just wasn't.  However, the hotel was located super close to Universal and that's what I paid for.  The parking fees were ridiculous! I paid $28/day.  Parked my car when we got there and it didn't move until we left, just was too high a fee on top of the cost of the room. Also one of the elevators broke down, we;3
Even though I live in the region, I spent the night here (4/27/17) as my flight the next morning was at 6am...  Check-in was a breeze, although when we inquired about a room that was quiet, we were told that we had one of the quietest rooms. However, when entering the room, our window looked upon the runways, and for most of the night, the aircraft that were landing were quite noisy. And, when the evening TPAC departures were heading out, we could hear the engines spooling. But, since we had to get up early, it wasn't worth it to go downstairs and swap rooms.   Other than that, the room was really spacious and had an interesting motif, with bright lighting. The HVAC system was really quiet (it was not louder than the airplanes arriving and departing).   In the morning, after;3
Location is superb, really do feel in the thick of it. On top of Madison Square Garden, very close to the Empire State and a short walk to Times Square.  It has a lot of history the New Yorker, which is a pro and a con. The pro is that you do feel like you are staying in a classic New York hotel the only problem is you are used to a modern world. The hotel needs modernizing, Lifts, certain decor and the breakfast restaurant/cafe.   The best part of the hotel is the upmarket restaurant in the basement of the hotel, which is a converted bank vault. Lovely food and great service . The worst part was the Reception/Check in and out, slow, slow, very slow. The people behind the desk seemed as if the computers were a new development which of course for America this is especially not;3
This side of Manhattan had all the amenities that a traveler would need, including a Postal Office within 3 blocks. We visited the Riverside Park. It was clean, green, peaceful and friendly people walking their dogs. It was very secure too. The hotel facilities need some improvement. The header did not turn on and when we asked for extra blankets none were available because the housekeeper services end at 6pm. We waited for transportation pick up time sitting at the stair steps because the hotel lobby or hallway had no furniture.  The hotel receptionist made no effort to provide a chair for my 84 years old mother.;3
The hotel is in a great location. The rooms are VERY small, so if you are not good in small spaces, forget it! The room is he size of a double bed - no kidding. Its clean and the shared bathrooms are clean and pretty good. The bunk bed rooms make the rooms feel very small. If you on a tight budget, and have very little luggage, this is the place to stay. NB: The air conditioners are a little noisy, and theer are still some of the original residence living in the hotel who smoke and are a little out of he ordinary.;3
"Firstly, I would like to emphasize the fact that the hotel is located close to EVERYTHING!!! The subway is a 5 minutes walk, the park is just around the corner and Sturbucks is downstairs! You would expect noise, but in my case, it was very quiet...if you can overcome the very annoying humming of the aircondition.  Everybody in the staff was really helpful and kind, so no problem there! The room in particular was practical and spacious considering what I have heard about all rooms in NYC. The most important thing was that the cleaning lady showed up every day, which made me really happy. Be sure, however, to put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door if you don't want to be woken up every day at 8 sharp! The mini bar was a big temptation, but all the price tags managed to keep us";3
First stay at Hilton Universal not quite satisfied but i will give them a second chance. the only thing that is nice is, so close to City Walk. You can go back and forth to hotel in few minutes.  they have a large room and one thing i like about the room is... there's mini FRIDGE. yahoo! and extra pillow and blanket.;3
Before you get into the building, good luck finding a spot to pull off to unload or get valet parking - there is a very small spot that was full the entire time I was there. First thing to be aware of once you get inside is that the property has a $25/night (+tax) facility/resort fee.  This was a little surprising.  The rooms are tiny-tiny, about 15'x15'.  There was not enough room to have the desk chair pulled out and still open the door.  The small-ness wasn't all bad, especially considering it's NYC and a very old building.  What was bad was the archaic plumbing in the shower.  There were separate hot and cold valves with no ability to pick a temperature and stick with it.  During a 20 minute shower the temperature would swing from scaling hot to tepid cold requiring;3
Did like the location of the New Yorker, we walked everywhere from our hotel. Rooms were small, but expected that from NY. Beds were very comfortable. Staff were great at helping out on our room confusions when we arrived. Don't really have much more to say about this hotel;3
The room was pretty good - with a good size, comfortable bed, and decent enough shower.  But the hotel is woefully understaffed.  Check in had a huge queue - a twenty minute wait (none of the automatic machines were working), and after finally getting my room key it didn't work!  Apparently the battery in the door had died, so they had to send maintenance - which was another ten minute wait, outside the room.  And although the room facilities were fine, they only provided one towel, which was ridiculous.  The woman on the front desk was pretty defensive throughout, unlike the maintenance woman who was charming and helpful.  I think it's pretty poor that Premier Inn don't clean your rooms now (or replenish teas/coffees etc) unless you request this separately at reception..  So;3
The hotel was basic, but was good value for money.  Thankfully my reservation was in the system - as the receptionist said a lot of people had arrived and there was no record of their reservation! The receptionist was really friendly and dealt efficiently with check in. The room (budget single) was comfortable with a double bed, tv, fridge and small closet. The bathrooms were adequate although very tired.  There was no hairdryer available, even though it says on the website 'available of request' - the receptionist said there was only one and another guest must have it. This was disappointing, but not the end of the world. It was a little noisy during the night, both within and outside the hotel, but nothing too extreme.  In essence, this was an acceptable stay and good value;3
The Empire Hotel is in a great location right in Lincoln Center â you walk out of the hotel and you can see to your left the opera house! I had a junior suite corner room with some nice views.  The room was quite spacious by NYC standards with a seating area with couch, chair, and table and a separate desk and chair.  The bathroom was nice but poorly lit â it would have made more sense to put some backlighting on the mirror to help you see yourself while getting ready. It felt a little dim and unflattering. In addition, the toilet was too close to the vanity so that I would bump my arm against it while sitting on the toilet. The shower was great with a nice rainfall shower head plus a handheld sprayer.  It took me a minute to realize that to use both at the same time, you;3
The redeeming feature of this hotel is its location, right at Lincoln Center. I love the Upper West Side and wish there were more hotels to chose from in that neighborhood. The Empire is badly in need of an overhaul. Our room had peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, loose tiles in the bathroom - not what you'd hope for at this price point. Also very limited amenities and outrageous charges for minibar items so beware - if you open that bottled water on your nightstand you will be out $8.00. The property is older and quite interesting architecturally, a nice change from a standard, sterile box of a hotel, I actually like quirky spaces and wouldn't mind that the dÃ©cor is rather dark if it was well maintained. The lobby is very dramatic, with a sweeping staircase, a bar, and nice;3
"Reception on arrival the first time for 2 nts was very disappointing. Arrived on QM2 for 2 nts before touring. The woman was rude, the girl checking in could not believe her attitude. Room was rather jaded and as the building was old did not get a great room, pokey. On returning here after 2 weeks travelling and having 3 other very good hotels, again disappointed with receptions attitude and service. The girl spoke in Spanish to another girl back and for(I speak Spanish so understood) but that was rude waited whilst in the middle of checking me in she disappeared. The people in the next queue were checking in and gone who came after me. The room was even more pokey and the bath was disgraceful. Paint or enamel all chipped off. Had about 9"" to get through to the bathroom as a";3
If you're going to universal studios, this place is convenient, but I'm not sure it's worth the price.  The universal sheraton is also next door and there is a shuttle that runs to both properites and the park, and I believe they are slightly cheaper.  The staff at the hilton was very courteous except for the first person i spoke to at the desk when I first arrived at the property.  There is a buffet and table service available but again fairly pricey.  We ordered room service and the staff was great, but the food was just ok - nothing special.  Actually my son didn't like the food so he didn't eat much.  The room was ok.  we had a corner room which I expected to be a little bigger but not bad.  Overall the hotel was ok but i've stayed in nicer hotels and paid less.;3
This is NOT a $300 a night plus hotel and then $28 day plus tax just to park quite a walk from the elevators to the rooms. The elevators have been mentioned many times and they are bad! Pool area and personnel are great but housekeeping and front desk could use some retraining.;3
I stayed here only one night, the night before I left America after a recommendation from a friend who used to stay here long before it was the Jane of today - it certainly has a history.   I stayed in a standard cabin with communal bathroom.  All I can say is the rooms are tiny however they do advise you of this on their website, you literally have a bed and the width of the door (which isn't a particularly wide door) but if you just need somewhere to sleep its ideal.  The communal bathrooms were satisfactory as any shared bathrooms are.  I doubt I would stay in a standard cabin for any significant length of time but as prices in NYC are through the roof this makes for a cheaper option.   Can't say I necessarily noticed the noise but this was at the end of a long hols and I can;3
Please see my previous review. I stay at this hotel often, b/c it is across the street from to Lincoln Center. One serious concern is the hotel's WiFi system. WiFi is complimentary in the lobby, but if you want WiFi in your room, you must type in your credit card number while using the hotel's public WiFi system. As result, my credit card number has been stolen not once but twice. Unfortunately, the hotel does not offer the option of adding the cost of WiFi to your hotel bill. So, while at the hotel, I use only my smart phone.;3
I read many poor and scathing reviews and I have to generally disagree.  LOCATION Conveniently located right off of Broadway on 73rd.  The train station is a 1/2 block away.  Movies, dining and Duane Reade are all a short walk away as well.  BUILDING Typical of Central Part West.  Very nice.  LOBBY Simple and nice.  Very clean  STAFF Friendly and reasonably welcoming.   ROOM Small, simply furnished.  The room was cleaner than I expected.  No bugs.  That includes:  roaches and bed bugs.  And I looked! The furniture was worn but good enough.  The bed was not terribly comfortable but it served its purpose for a week in NYC.  The TV worked as did the frig.  BATHROOM Small, limited space but functional.  It was cleaner than I expected but typical NY.   The important part was the;3
"This was my 3rd visit to the Empire Hotel, and I was extremely disappointed in the room we had.  It was very small, we had 2 double beds and the bathroom was a disgrace you could not hang a towel up anywhere.   Furthermore they filled the mini bar and then put all sort of ""stuff"" on the desk for purchase.  They even had the gaul to ask for $3 per person to use the coffee machine in the room.  There was hardly any space to put 2 small suitcases, and a tiny closet.  I last visited in 2013 and had a very pleasant experience.  Furthermore you pay over $400 for a room the size of a broom closet.  The location of course is fabulous when visiting the Met.  I will not be visiting this hotel again.  Also wifi was only available in the Lobby not the bedrooms.";3
My staff was not as comfortable due to the small room size and the outdated amenities. The bathroom is very small and I ran into the door several times. One must step back and to the side in order to close the bathroom door once in it.;3
So I arrived at the hotel , the gentlemen on front desk was very helpful and answered all my questions I had . The hotel interior was clean, bright and even has a nice little patio area to relax . The hostel itself is a bit of a maze, lots of different rooms not really labelled effectively . Nether the less I found my room , let myself in and there was 2 males on both of the bottom bunks . Now I understand it's mixed rooms so it's to be expected to share with the opposite sex . However a single female traveller in her 20s walking in to a TINY room with 2 bunk bed and 2 men is VERY scary and off putting . The room fell silent and I just left . I'm sure those men were perfectly lovely and harmless I just did not feel comfortable in that situation , I feel when they offer such;3
Room was clean, good service, just 10 minutes walk to universal studio, great view and best sea food buffet at cafe sierra. Only 2 complains I had are... 1. Location of buffet line is a big mess. Food are line up at the walk way. Guest who try to check in have to walk pass the hungry guest who try to get the food at buffet line. Draging luggages bumping with hot food was not convenience at all. They should move buffet line to other place that not obstruct the walk way.  2. Shower head in the room is very cheap stuff, some hole are clog and water pressure was slow. For 200$plus per night I expect better shower head which not leaking and dipping all the time.;3
We stayed here for three nights last week.. The only thing that saves this hotel from a 1 star is its location.  1- room sizes are extremely small. Cannot even move around without bumping into someone or something.  2- Extremely old. Needs upgrading.  3- Bathrooms and closets are tiny just like the rooms 4- Hallways have an old dingy smell 5- $29.00 a night fee? for what no one knows  6- Charge $4.00 per luggage bag to hold it if your flight is after checkout. (not sure why the $29.00/ night doesn't cover this?  i will not be rebooking this place. Like the title, there is nothing special and it is over priced. Seems like there is not much you can do at hotels like this anyway but they need to stop charging the $29.00 a night for amenities like the business center and the gym;3
Hotel is nice and clean in a perfect location. Restaurant is very good. I specifically asked for a quiet room for the marathon. It is horribly loud. I phoned to ask why so loud and front desk was quite rude. Weâve not gotten much sleep since weâve been here because of the very loud noise. If youâre a light sleeper, be aware. The first morning we all had a cold shower due to no hot water. Second night there was bad wifi and spent a long time getting it to work with the third parties help. Again, front desk was not friendly. We are still here and I would go talk to them about the troubles but the last two times on the phone they were too rude and they tried to put me to a manager that never did phone me back or answer.  Again, itâs a nice room with comfy beds but with the rude;3
Cold water for two days, no pool access and not advised of this to arrival. Still waiting to hear back from manager despite requesting on numerous occasions. Requested brides room to be cleaned before arrival of makeup and hair however this was also not done. Great location.;3
Staff needs  to be more responsive and more people should be available to answer phones...if its a staffing issue. Hotel is nice, bathroom is tiny but nice. Location is the only reason why I stayed here.;3
I booked this hotel after receiving nothing but good reviews. I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival and I received a reply guaranteeing a room on a high floor with a view of the Empire State as I was there for a celebration. When I arrived we were given a basic room on the 21st floor on the opposite side of the building with no view. The room was in need of refurbishment but clean. As we were there to visit the sites the room was just fine for a little time we would be spending in it. On check in, I was also offered a bottle of wine/champagne as they noted I was there for a celebration. I was advised that this would be delivered to my room however we didnât receive the bottle of wine at all during the 7 days we were there. I am disappointed that we were promised 2 things and;3
My partner and I went to NYC to celebrate the New Year. We were on a relatively tight budget and were not too fussed about the hotel as in somewhere like New York, it's really only somewhere to sleep in the evening. There is so much to see and do that seems pretty pointless spending a huge amount of money on a hotel when you are out all day and evening.   One thing I would say to everyone is that every single hotel description on here says that it is very central. Literally all the hotels are central and New York is an absolutely enormous place. This hotel says it looks on to Central Park and yes it does but Central Park is massive and we had to get the subway to get to the part of Central Park we wanted to be at. Basically, no matter where you are or what hotel you decide to go;3
Staff was nice. Room was small. Tv channels not so great. But then again we were out in city a lot. Only two towels to the room. Kept asking for two extra. Staff had no problem getting it for us. No vending machines. Staff sells soda and water in the lobby. Convenience store very close for snacks. Traffic quiet. MTA orange line subway nearby . Used it everyday to get to city. Next time I'll request king size bed instead of queen. Walking distance to Italy . I will most likely stay here again.;3
We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights - hotel itself is big, clean and did the job for a few nights. It is 5 min walk from a metro station that will take you to Hollywood boulevard/universal etc for only $1.75pp each way. As per previous comments lifts were very slow! Parking also ridiculously priced and should be included seeing as the hotel wasn't exactly cheap anyway. Breakfast was OK - fresh omelettes were the highlight, everything else was average. Also was not happy with a sign on wall in dining room advising that there are detectable traces of a chemical within hotel that could cause birth defects amongst other things! For a newly wed couple this was concerning. Hotel also advertises an appertizer happy hour in courtyard - this was not on during our 3 night stay.;3
Hotel is average but the location is good. I don't like the heater in the room . It takes 3 to 4 hrs to increase the temperature of the room from 65 to 73 f.There are much better hotel in LA to stay at same price.  I did not try the food in there because there are lot of good options near universal city walk which is 7 minutes distance from there.;3
My husband and I recently stayed at the Empire during a short visit to New York. It has many positive features - the staff were helpful and friendly, the location just opposite the Lincoln Centre and close to Central Park is good and the lobby and bar area are interesting, though dark. Unfortunately the lifts are incredibly slow and one appeared to be out of order throughout our stay. We didn't get a chance to see the rooftop pool as it was closed every day of our stay, apparently because of the weather (there was a little rain). We initially booked a queen room which was tiny - we couldn't even get our suitcase open fully - with a view of the bin enclosure and a wall. After one night, we upgraded to a superior king, which had a better view and was much more spacious but the;3
Staying for 6 nights with my son.  We took a fly away coach from Lax to union street station which was $10.  We got on the red line underground line to Vermont/sunset station $2.75 each then walked down the hill to the hotel.  Weâve never been before, we are pretty resourceful and we found this trip from Lax pretty easy.  Room was ok nothing special but clean.  Was overlooking the car park.  Beds comfy and room service made up our room.  The air conditioning in the room works well but is the loudest air conditioning unit Iâve ever heard. Microwave, fridge and safe in the room.  Some sort of coffee maker but the coffee is horrible.  Pool is clean, sun beds clean and towels provided.  Pretty quiet round the pool.  Used the gym which is pretty small with minimal equipment but has;3
When arriving to MORNINGSIDE INN I was greeted by a lovely young lady by the name of MARGARITA. she was very professional, kind, and helpful she even gave a us a list of great hang out & dining spots in the area and gave us directions around town, that alone assured me that my stay here would be great. You really get what you pay for I only stood for 5 nights but i would've definately stayed longer, the air conditioned rooms are comfortable, clean, and spacious. Coming to New York you usually worry about how expensive and how rude people can be but here i got great prices and service. ****NOW THATS A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!!!!!!****;3
I had one of the small rooms and it really is small, make no mistake. At first I was a little underwhelmed but then it grew on me. The place has an interesting history (Titanic survivors were housed there) and you feel this strange cinematic atmosphere seeping out of the walls. The bar / club off to the right of the lobby looked beautiful but it was dead when I went in for a look.   My room was one with shared facilities and the bathrooms are very, very busy. I always had to wait. But that was just a mild inconvenience. The only real negative for me was that I asked for my room to be serviced early in the morning and was out for the whole day only to return to find it the way I left it. Then I had to call down and they said they'd get housekeeping on it and I had to wander out;3
"For a last-minute business trip, the Wyndham New Yorker was fine for my needs. It's centrally located, the bed was comfortable, and it's pretty easy to get uptown, downtown and to Brooklyn from this spot. But other then these things, I wouldn't stay here again unless I had no other options.  The rooms are small -- even by New York City standards -- and the entire place could use some sprucing up. Other small nitpicks:  -WiFi is spotty; works well sometimes, and slow-to-not working other times. -Temperature control did not work. -TV was bolted to the wall with no swivel (meaning, you couldn't watch TV directly from bed). -Shower turn-on handle was deep inside shower (meaning, you can't avoid getting blasted with water the second you turn the handle). -No views (at least, from my";3
Excellent location just 2 subway stations from Times Square. The hotel is clean although the furniture could use renewing.  The reception desk clerks were all very nice and helpful.  The hotel provides free wifi (not working in the lobby area, only in the rooms) On the down side, the hotel does not serve breakfast (you get avoucher for breakfast at a coffee shop across the street at approx $6.75.  Only 2 elevators were operating (out of 3 I believe) which made it sometimes a very long jurney from the 7th floor to  the lobby as the elevators are very small and the hotel has a lot of rooms. I sometimes had to wait 10 minutes for a free elevator.  Another issue was the room keys that did not work three nights in a row and I had to go back to the lobby to have them fixed after a;3
i arrived in my wheelchair after a 23 hour flight from South Africa via London. i was quickly ushered to a separate desk next to the check in counter. after a friendly easy check in, Mohamed stopped me before i went to my room and said he would like to upgrade me from a standard room to a bigger room in the new section on the 7th floor to give me more room for my wheelchair. Mohamed went the extra mile. the room had great space was clean and the bed comfortable. the location was central. With staff like Mohamed i will definitely use The New Yorker in the future.;3
Went 12/15 to NYC with Hubby no kids. Location is absolutely great across from Central Park. Easy train/bus ride from La Guardia. M60 bus to Astoria stop , then get on the Train.  N,Q, R train get u near , then Walk to 107street. Or taxi($8.00). We did it with our rollaway luggage no big deal. Building has small entry way, front desk, elevator and stairway. Decorated nice real big Xmas tree. Room was standard full bed, 1 small window with small in room sink, little fridge and a closet. See pics. Bathroom is a shared bathroom in hallway. Old nasty tub/shower with old toilet. (Or pay ridiculous fee for private bathroom) Make sure you have ur own TP, I observed several times when there was no TP in the bathroom at night time . Some what quiet (no complains except we could hear the;3
We were unfortunate enough to stay during the power cut and that wasn't very pleasant, but we have received a refund for that nights stay.  Apart from the obvious problems of having no power or water we actually enjoyed our stay at The Empire.  The room was fine, it certainly wasn't dark and our air con worked very well. House keeping did a good job every day.  The pool is cold but sometimes that's just what you need after a hot day in New York!!  The hotel is well situated for sightseeing and I must recommend  Le Pain Quotidien an excellent bakery and restaurant just a couple of blocks away, we had breakfast there most mornings.;3
Positives: Fantastic location. The shower pressure is amazing considering we were on the 25th floor. Not a long wait for lifts. Hand gel/sanitiser at each floor. They even have a 'museum'/ 'memorabilia' collection in the basement for famous moments from the hotel's history but it is not really advertised.  Negatives: Definitely feels like a has-been hotel - we stayed in the room next to the one where Muhammad Ali stayed which was a pleasant surprise! But otherwise the hotel has definitely had its hay-day. The place is in need of a complete renovation - new paint/ carpet etc. Whats more we stayed during storm Henri and had water dripping from the celling/wall (see pictures). Told the front desk and they said someone would come and have a look, 10 minutes later front desk called;3
"We arrived at the New Yorker after a 3 hour wait to get through immigration.  I would have thought an airport like JFK would have been more organised.  We got a taxi to the hotel ($65 plus tip) and upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a family suite on the 39th floor. We were also told that we had free wifi and free international calls.  There was a facilities fee of $135 which we were told was for things like water/room service etc.  Turns out the facilities fee was for the ""free"" wifi and we felt completely ripped off and we were charged $92 dollars for this privilege of using this.  Our upgraded ""suite"" turned out to be nothing more than a run down bedsit with a double bed and a dirty looking sofa bed.  We declined the offer of the upgrade and asked for the";3
It's a mediocre property with bite-sized rooms, but centrally located. Not to go for their breakfast package as you only get a toast and coffee! But their Tick Tock all-day dining restaurant serves quintessential American cuisine. Calling guest services is like dialing a customer service center that just rings and rings. In short, if all you care about is location, location and location, then the New Yorker is the hotel to be checked in.;3
Myself and the family were really disappointed with this hotel. Such a disappointment after taking the time to review it on trip advisor.   The hotel is located on the edges of universal estate and is on it's own. Because of this, we were a little taken a back by having to pay an additional $24 per night to park - as there was no other option!! (Hidden charges?).   The room was dark with little natural light. It smelt of stale smoke. The air con did not work making the room hot at times. It was a decent size and the decor a little tired.   The hotel lifts were undergoing work during our visit. So lengthy waits to come down were the norm.   The hotel buffet options were pricey and did not look appealing. We arrived via Las Vegas where for the same price the quality was far;3
Hotel rooms are small and bathroom was tiny.  Some features such as slow elevators (2 were actually out of service) show that this is an old hotel in need of further updates. Front desk is very responsive and helpful however.;3
Because the hotel is well situated by Penn-Station and Madison Square Garden, it will continue to get guests no matter what standard it keeps. Unfortunately, we found the incredibly tiny bathroom and old carpets to be filthy when we stayed, and the amount of college students loudly being all over the place because a large chunk of the hotel is sectioned off as college dorms will keep up from staying here again. The food at the adjoining diner is just okay, but we did have a nice check-in experience with a lovely lady seated at the membership desk. Pretty large resort fee too, which didn't get us much except internet if I remember correctly.;3
Service+++: charming personal but not as attentive and respectful as you can wish for. I asked for an extra sheet since it was 90 degrees and I didn't want to use the blanked. I had to ask three at different occations during my stay but they never gave me the sheet. THE ABSOLUTE DOWNSIDE FOR THE JANE Room+: the entire standard cabin was actually smaller than my bed at home. Luckily I got an amazing wiev over the Hudson River, but I had to sleep with my blinds open just not to get claustrophobic. The room felt filthy, like the dust has stuck to it's walls and the red wall-to-wall carpet for decades. THE HIGHLIGHT FOR THE JANE Location+++++: superb location. Greenwich Village with Bleecker Street is one of my favourite places in the world where you can simply walk the streets and;3
Stayed here 4 nights and have to say for the price was good. Bed softer than I'm used to but still comfortable. Great bathroom & shower. Plenty of decent towels toiletries & tissues. The staff were obliging and friendly.  Eating facilities are not provided but there are plenty of shops & restaurants nearby. Coffee and a selection of different teas are available in the reception area during the day. Unfortunately every time I wanted tea the hot water had run out, maybe a bigger or 2nd run would help.  Overall a good stay and based in a fabulous location for Times Square but away from the major hussle & bussle of being in the middle of it.  Would stay here again.;3
I recently spent one night at this hotel while attending Universal Studios.  I chose this hotel strictly for it's proximity to the theme park. Even though the hotel was close to the park, it was not convenient. Since it is located right next to the park, I would assume there would be a walkway or path that you could follow, unfortunately there isn't. I asked one of the staff members about getting to the park and she told me to go to the end of the ballrooms and the park is across the street. As we walked towards the ballrooms it was very clear they had events happening in these ballrooms and the foyers had catered food and a lot of dressed up people. Needless to say, since we were in our theme park attire, we stood out like a sore thumb and after getting a few looks from people;3
The hotel located in Chinatown a good distant from the metro station and everything you can need in the city. We stayed there and walk to the 9/11 memorial took the ferry to see the status of liberty and Brookline bridge, so we didn't spend money on the metro. It's also closed the village so if you want to explore down town of the city this hotel is great for it, and not to loud for the city.;3
First time in New York and I was already aware of how pricey hotels and accommodations could be around the area. Ultimately I picked this place simply because of price. Their website already had a competitive price, but lurking around I found even better through a third party. It was the cheapest I found right next to Central Park. So I thought that should be good.  The only transportation I used even from the airport was public transportation. Thankfully there is a metro station RIGHT by the hotel. This is a major plus for those planning to use the train/subway the entire trip and have plenty of luggage.   This location is also around the corner from a DR (Duane Reade). It's like a Rite Aid, Walgreens, all purpose store that is OPEN 24 Hours.   As for the hotel itself, the;3
My family and I stayed here for 2 nights so that the kids could meet the Minions in Univesal. It was an average Hilton, nothing exciting. The safe didn't work and spent the whole of the first night we were there beeping at us, but once they found the security man it was rectified quickly. There were 5 of us in the room and only 2 bottles of water were left and for some reason these weren't replenished the next day, you'd think the amount you're paying they could give you another bottle! The breakfast was an utter rip off, the a la carte child's menu was an insult, $9 for the tinniest piece of scrambled egg with half a strawberry. We went without on the second day. We asked for an allergy menu (legally obliged to be provided in the UK) or if they had any Gluten Free substitutes;3
Great location just off Broadway & Times Square. Issue with hot water the evening we arrived but was resolved the next day. Small rooms made to feel even smaller with giant furniture, but very clean and functional. Service good. Don't breakfast here, very basic .;3
The room was small but clean, which was the most important thing. However the walls were very thin and on our last night could hear people screaming about their belongings being stolen in the middle of the night - which was quite worrying - there aren't any safes for valuables etc so if you are going to stay here I would suggest taking anything of value with you and not leaving in the room. For a short stay, it was fine.;3
The room overall was good, a lot of reviews complain about the size, but its a good size for NYC and you likely aren't spending a lot of time in your room anyway!  The location is close to subways which is good but its very crowded as you are right near Madison Square Garden. The walls were paper thin though and I could hear the TV next store at all hours.   Plus its a big hotel so you are always waiting a long time for crowded elevators. I had a great Hotels.com price so it was worth it, but I wouldn't choose it again.;3
Being two college students at the time, we needed something on a budget. While this is a hostel, we made sure we picked a room in which we had our own bathroom. Everything is very small and it's hard to move around. However, it was worth having a small room for our own bathrooms. The beds were very small as well. I'm only 5'7 and my feet were nearly off the bed. The staff was friendly, though. The location is nice as well. We were just a Subway ride away from Times Square. I felt very safe in the neighborhood. We were also a walk away from Central Park. If you're young and looking for a budget, this isn't a bad deal.;3
Perfect for the traveler that wants to get a feel for the classic Art Deco hotel that you've seen in all the old movies!  I believe part of the hotel has been updated, unfortunately, part of it has not and that's where our room was.  Windows were very drafty and privacy in each room is minimal.  Doors opening and closing in hallways sounded like someone was entering your room.  Deadbolt on door alleved that slight panic each time:)  We had an amazing view of Empire State Building and enjoyed the very NY style Tick Tock Diner for breakfast off the lobby.  Would stay there again but may ask for one of the newer rooms next time!;3
Was in NYC for the weekend.  Needed a hotel for Friday night only - and since it's the Holiday season...almost every hotel in town 3* + is $300-400 on Fri and Sat nights.  So finding Astor on the Park for $210ish...was a great deal.  Quick facts:  Not within walking distance to Times Square (40 blocks away) Right across from Central Park (very convenient) Building is old (but isn't most of NYC?) Staff at front desk were polite and smiling Door locks/Beds/TV/carpet/AC unit are all out of date but functional Bathroom was actually quite nice (nicer than bedroom) The walls were kind of dirty  Bottoms line: for what we paid, we thought it was pretty good for a place to stay...especially due to the proximity to Central Park.  I wouldn't want to stay there for any more than 3 days;3
Great location, big rooms, EXPENSIVE parking, good (not great) service, clean, good breakfast. Overall, if you're planning to stay for just a few days and need a place centrally located, this is a great choice.;3
Good location, comfortable beds, nice enough space. Would've been nice if wifi and lights/heating worked better. Was very disappointed that each package that I had delivered to the hotel was a $5 fee.;3
Good thing this Hilton property is being renovated. It's old and overpriced. The hotel gets away with the high price because it's walking distance to Universal Studios. The staff is friendly and the coffee stand is nice. The free Universal Studios shuttle is convenient. The rooms and outdated, but clean. The valet is $44 per night (once you add in taxes), so beware.;3
We stayed here on our first trip to NYC in over 25 years.  Nice hotel..Evan at the front desk gave us a beautiful upgrade. However when we got our credit card bill we were charged a $150 âincidentalâ fee.  And for $5 bottle of water we never used. When we called inquire they insisted we were told about the âincidentalâ fee.  Thankfully my husband is polite and patient and we were able to get it dismissed. The hotel is in a nice spot, convenient to subway, Central Park, and Lincoln Center.  Many excellent restaurants close by.  Weâd stay again but would discuss fees prior...;3
The hotel itself is in a prime location next to Madison Sq Garden & Penn Station. Just a ten minute walk to Times Square. We were checked in by a very personable receptionist, I cannot remember his name but he upgraded our room floor and view which was good of him. The hotel room was adequate but the bathroom was small and the shower did not work correctly - it had very little pressure and the temperature was hard to maintain - either scoldingly hot or freezing cold. There were two occasions when we encountered cockroaches in the room. The toilet in the bathroom also made a loud squeak every time it was flushed.  In terms of the area around the hotel, it is littered with homeless people and drug addicts. It really is not a pleasant place to walk around - especially after dark.;3
For what I paid for the accommodations, i expected much more. I understand that obtaining a hotel in the York is extremely expensive no matter which proprietor you choose  however if you pay for a suite it should be worthy of calling it such. The location is absolutely excellent but the interior was extremely small and out of date. The weather was 90 degrees and the air conditioning system was not blowing cool air.;3
I love the location, but was disappointed in the room (tiny, dark, cheesy furniture). Front desk was unhelpful when I asked for help with the Wi-Fi setup. I paid the daily rate for Wi-Fi, but the front desk gentleman knew nothing about and didn't try to connect me with someone who did. The lobby feels dated, gloomy.;3
"Having just spent 8 nights there I'd like to chip in too.   We were a group of five people aged 32 to 71 staying at the Riverside Studios and enjoying our stay there. Excellent location for the price; reasonably clean room and bathrooms; plenty of hot water in the showers; no bed-bugs; large rooms with (clean) refrigerators; no odd smells. Fast and efficient reception desk. Beds made every day and rooms cleaned.  The place is run-down; paint is peeling off the bathtub and the sinks; you do have to learn your way around getting a comfortable temperature in the shower. The lifts are somewhat old (however only the very oldest among us used it; the rest liked the the exercise on the stairs).  We only entered the reception on the day of arrival and when departing since you don't have";3
"Great but not so great  On short notice my wife and I decided to travel from LA to NY to attend my brothers birthday and 60 wedding Anniversary after checking out several hotels in the Timeâs Square Area we decided on the Empire Hotel adjacent to the Lincoln Center located on Broadway and 63 Street. When we arrived at the hotel around 6:00 PM Saturday evening I was taken by the exotic furniture style (simulated tiger skin chairs and odd shaped couches.)   At check in I stated when I booked the room I requested a very quiet room as I was a light sleeper; actually I prefer quiet to view. The clerk informed me that the hotel was fully booked and he would see what he could do. The bellhop escorted us to the 11th floor room 1120 the room and bathroom were small. After placing our";3
I have now stayed at this hotel 4 times. I find the staff to be v. kind and helpful. All of the city is easily accessible from this location, either by bus or subway. It is also much quieter compared to the apt bldgs in the area. On the days you check in/out, they will keep your luggage in a locked room, so you can still have those days to be luggage free.;3
It's not easy to review this as we had both good and bad experience with this hotel.  The overall experience is good. Friendly staff, perfect location next to subway and Central Park, good value for money, ok size rooms, but I can't give it more than 3 points due to the placement of the queen bed rooms. When we first arrived we had booked a queen size bedroom. We came straight of the airplane and the clock was 4 AM in Norway so we were tired. Our room was on the 5 floor. But when we entered the room it was a big disappointment. The noise in the room was dreadful. Outside the window there was some kind of ventilation system running full speed. I can truthfully say it was the worst night ever on a hotel. So tired and unable to get a full nights sleep because of this ventilation;3
When we got to the hotel, check in was quick.  The elevators are small, but there are 4 so we never had to wait long.  Walking down the hall to our room, we worried.  The walls have different colored patches of paint and the carpet is old, stained, and coming up in some places. When we opened the door, however, we were surprised to see a clean, albeit, small room.  There was a King size bed with several fluffy white pillows and a clean bedsheets.  The bathroom appeared to have been recently renovated.  The toilet, sink, and tub all looked new and were very clean.  Even the shower curtain appeared to be new.  There was a window in the bathroom (a plus for women to put their makeup on in natural lighting).   There was a closet with lots of wooden hangers and the tv was old, but;3
We stayed here before going on a cruise, we used our Wyndham points to book a metro room. Room has 2 double beds and we normally see queen size anymore. Room an ok size but we did add a rollaway. Bathroom showed it's age, quite small. Staff friendly and two restaurants on site.;3
Overall nice apartments for the money we paid! This is not a hotel so there is no room service wake up calls and etc. it has a small kitchenette with microwave, stow and the fridge. Some plates, pans and other tableware available. There is a huge very inexpensive grocery store just next block from the apartment building. We saved bunch of money on food cooking at the room instead of dining out. However there is minimum furniture in the room and bed linen is not really clean good enough. So it might scare u a bit at the beginning. But nothing cost that cheap in this area! It is one block away from the subway, three blocks from Central Park and 15 minutes walking distance from Natural History museum! There are also plenty stores around and places to eat. I would stay here again;3
Was only here for a night, but had a generally good stay. On a night where everything seemed to delay getting us to our anniversary dinner, the hotel was no exception. Who knew that checking in at 5pm on a Saturday would be so busy! To the credit of the front desk, we were graciously upgraded to an alcove room with a King sized bed, which was very nice considering the original booking was made with 2 double beds, so excellent service there. It did take a little longer to get checked in as calls had to be made to the reservation center, and then the HHonors center, since we were using a points redemption, but overall it was worth the time as the room was spacious and had a great view of the hills.   The hotel property itself could really go for some renovations. Having stayed at;3
hotel locates a bit far from the midtown. $16~$25 from grand central st. by taxi.  room was clean. a door man was too kind. I paid $145 per night and it was a quite deal in NY.  but hotel stuff have a kind of problem. they never offer detailed info about anything like sightseeing, musical, bus schedule. they only recommend me to use the internet service downstairs. furthermore, they only provided $45 taxi ride to LGA, which is too much. usually, its $25+3.50 to LGA. maybe they get bucks from taxi drivers. I recommend to book taxi by own, or book airlink or supershuttle. even you can get $2 off coupon from NY guidebooks.;3
Conviently located right next door to Universal Studios, we chose the Hilton for that fact. Check in was pretty uneventful, though took the receptionist 10 minutes to find a King Alcove room that we had booked.  Will suggest an Alcove room if you like us were carrying a lot of luggage (last stop on a 5 week US holiday) or if you like that extra space! it was amazing.  Valet was helpful and very cost effective, and the tour desk was able to help us with booking a 4 hour LA tour on our last day, as well as directions to shopping/LAX (40mins in really good traffic, up to 1.5 hours during peak hour)   My only gripe is the elevators. they had 4 elevators to 20+ floors, with 1 being out of service the whole 3 nights we were there. The elevator took anywhere between 10-20 mins to;3
"Stayed at the Empire due to its close proximity (across the street!) to Lincoln Center as we had opera tickets.  Took #1 train from NY Penn to 66th street station and walked to the hotel.  We arrived at 3:30 on Saturday to a check-in line, and upon reaching the reception desk, we learned our room would not be ready for another hour unless we wanted a smoking room.  No thanks.  Other people also waiting in the lobby who must have had the same circumstances.  Note to hotel:  maybe reduce the # of smoking rooms and convert to non-smoking rooms?  While waiting I enjoyed an $18 (with tax/tip) cocktail; would have been nice for Empire to pick up the tab on that one since check in time is supposed to be 3pm.   Room was finally ready and we had a room with 2 doubles though we reserved";3
Chose this hotel to be near central park & all the main attractions but without the constant noise & light of being closer to Times Square. We also wanted a modern hotel with a pool & bar area so we could chill with a drink at the end of a busy day. The hotel location was as we expected, though in retrospect I probably would have liked to have been a tad closer to Broadway etc. The downstairs bar, lobby & bedrooms were very modern, but the rooms are small and can be extremely noisy if you are on the lower floors & therefore near the air conditioning units!! The pool is nice and has some fantastic views of the city, but is sometimes closed for private functions. Drinks in the pool bar are very expensive - even for NY!! Unfortunately we never managed a visit to the rooftop bar we;3
Overpriced for an experience which more or less leaves a bad taste if something bad should happen during your stay. Perhaps they could try to work on better customer service without having to ask 3 times and without seemingly demanding tips for everything, which is not-done for a hotel in this price range.;3
I agree with all the other positive reviews, but I don't think I would stay here again.   The first room I was given reeked of cigarette smoke, as did the hallway I was on.   I asked for another room, but they could not change the room the first night.  Fortunately, they switched me to another floor on my second night and the smoke odor was much less.  The hotel says that it is a non-smoking building, but there seems to be a problem with tenants who are holdovers from before the building was a hotel.    But, whatever the reason, if people are smoking in the room/apartment next to you, and the whole floor reeks of cigarette smoke, the hotel is not a non-smoking hotel.    There also are no notices/signs for the hotel guests informing that it is a non-smoking hotel and I can see;3
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and spacious. Is within walking distance of Universal Studios and City Walk. And for someone who has foot pain, I made it just fine! One thing I will say is that the restaurant in the hotel is WAY over priced! The food wasn't that great.. especially for what they charged. We ended up usually eating over at City Walk.;3
I got a pretty good deal on this hotel on Priceline Express.  However, they didn't tell me I would be paying $60 more for the ridiculous resort fee.  Seriously what does this get me?  My wifi was spotty and not worth $30/night.  At least throw in some free water or something.    So I have no issues with personnel, front desk was friendly, bag check friendly, though again charging to store my bag is really nickel and dimeing when every other hotel I've stayed at is free.  The rooms are tiny, that's fine I wasn't there for more than sleep and a shower.  But thats where the problem comes in.  The bathroom was incredibly dated and didn't feel clean.  The water kept dripping from the faucet in the tub no matter how much I tightened them.  Time for an upgrade I'd say.  Oh and I had a;3
Decent HIlton, nothing over the top special. But super close to Universal Studios if that's your plan. Had two great nights here. Hotel is a traditional 90s feeling Hilton that's been well updated. Had a very nice room with view on ninth floor. Fitness center was a bit strange. Good Precor equipment spread over two rooms with an absolutely ridiculously horrible view out the back of the hotel. Not appealing.  Restaurant was decent. Bar has reasonable selection of corporate craft beers. Nothing creative. Wonderful yogurt with fresh fruit for just $8. That was offset with the most expensive cup of tea ($7) I've ever encountered. Really bad form.  Decent stay. Very friendly staff.;3
"We stayed here in August for four nights.  Clean, comfortable rooms albeit a little on the small side.  Breakfast was plentiful and a good variety.  The only real concern I had was that the area seemed a little ""dodgy"" and you did have to walk at least two or three blocks for evening dining, which we didn't feel very comfortable with.  Other than that, it was pretty good.";3
Hotel was nice but my room smelt weird. My ac also didn't work and the staff was unable to fix it. The staff seemed apathetic. Breakfast was very expensive. Shower pressure was pretty good. Room was clean.;3
good hotel, walking distance to universal studios in LA. Its however not a thematic hotel, looks more like a formal hotel for conventions. Check in can take sometime. It offers comfortable rooms and service is ok.;3
Location is great. Close to penn and metro stations with walking distance to Port authority, times square and other highlights. Room was surprisingly big compared to what we expected from Manhattan. Hotel looks a bit old trying to keep working. Butâ¦ The hotel is very expansive and not so welcoming. We were 2 families traveling together. We arrived before checkin time and found our room ready. Our family companion room was not ready (no offence about that) so they had to stand in a very long not welcoming line in order to put their luggage.  The building has 12 elevators. 6 for 2nd-20th floor and 6 for 20th-40th floor. We had a room on the 19th floor. Some floors between 3rd floor and 17th are not used by the hotel. They are used as offices, foundations, dormitories so the people;3
There are some great hotels in new york, I just don't think this is one of them. Besides the good location in the upper west side, Empire doesn't really offer a lot in terms of service. Don't expect much natural light in your room, don't expect room service to show up and don't expect your bill to be right. The front desk staff are lovely, the bar staff are not.  For the price, you can do better.;3
Rooms are small..no bath..and heater wouldn't turn off which meant the room was warm all the time! mentioned it at reception..but they never did anything about it. phoned the front desk a few times..no one ever picked up! overall it was okay..;3
Nice and clean place. 2 blocks away from subway(1-2-3 lines). Baths are sometimes not clean. But it is because of the people. A classic hostel, do not expect hotel comfort. Rooms are not big, as of any hostel in NYC.;3
I was skeptical about this hotel, considering it's pretty much located in the armpit of a freeway RIGHT next to the airport (airplanes taking off just blocks away). Surprisingly, the hotel itself was quiet. As for the room, however, even after requesting a quiet room TWICE (once over the phone, and once upon arrival), we were given the room right next to the ice/vending machines and the elevators. Plus, we must have been near some vents or something because we could hear our neighbors' muffled conversations all night. The cherry on top was the mysterious tapping sounds we heard starting at dawn, that kept us awake and confused for hours. As for cleanliness and decor, it was nice and modern, but not amazing. The hotel is also not easy to access as it's circled by one-way traffic;3

The menu of buffet was quite basic- bread, bacon, cheese and some potato. Wifi was quite slow and lost network quite often. The staff at front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was 3girls and one of them was looks like trainee. other;3
I'll skip to the bottom line : We booked this hotel last minute because our host cancelled our AirBnb reservation.  We expected much worse experience based on reviews here, but were pleasantly surprised.  8th floor was great, practically no sounds from the streets. The location near 1,2,3 subway lines was excellent.  Tips: stay out of Europan / 94 corner cafe for breakfast, just go to Starbucks nearby. Oh, and the elevators are small and crowded, but that's not a reason to exclude this hotel.;3
My husband, daughter, and I spent one night here for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl.  We got a great rate on the room, and after staying there, I can see why.  When my daughter went to take a bath towel out of the rack, the rack came out of the wall.  The headboards in the room were at least queen size, but we had double-sized beds, not very comfortable for three people.    As a wheelchair user, the carpeting in the lobby and hallways outside the room made it difficult to wheel around.  Also, the hallways themselves were on the dark side, with odd jogs and turns, and I didn't like that either.  The employees were all very nice, but I don't want to stay here again.;3
Good hotel in great location.  We booked a room with 2 dble beds.  Confirm noted the beds and also that there was free wifi.  When we went to check in they had us in a room with a king bed.  We had to wait a few hours for the right room to be available.  Then we tried to use the internet it was saying that there was a high charge for it.  We had to work threw that issue as well.  Reasonable room and great location.  Was a nuisance that we had to keep negotiating for what we had booked for.    Be prepared.  It seems like this place does huge volume.  It has that feel and the staff although pleasant enough, just seem to deal with the masses.;3
"The initial check-in was slightly difficult due to the employee's accent.  I had to ask her to repeat what she said several times.  She did not seem very emotional in greeting me at the desk.  She seemed rigid and structured.  She stated that my room had a ""city view"", although most of my view was of the freeway.  The overall decor of the hotel seemed dated to me.  The hotel was undergoing some re-modeling at the time of my stay.  To me, the toilet paper dispenser was placed on the wrong side of the toilet, i.e., it was placed to the left and rear of the toilet.  This was slightly annoying due to the fact that the majority of people are right handed.  Room service was what I expected for a major hotel chain and it was great.  The shower hose in the bathroom did not seem to work.";3
We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of our honeymoon and we have to say overall the hotel was a bit on the disappointing side.    The good stuff first - The location is excellent with easy access to the subway and plenty of cabs.  Central Park is only minutes away and Times Square etc a 15/20 minute walk.  The staff were superb (special mention to the excellent bar tender who was friendly, good with guests and also very informative about where to go).  The rooftop bar was absolutely amazing with brilliant views up Broadway, felt like we were in a movie! The decor throughout the hotel was modern and tasteful.  Now the not so good stuff!  The room was small with little room to put cases etc.  The bathroom was also on the small side but I guess thats understandable for;3
I like this hotel almost solely because it's close to my business interests, and it's decently priced for that. And I do enjoy the proximity to Saddle Ranch Universal City, which sounds cheesy but is actually delicious. But if I was going for vacation purposes, unless those included a trip to Universal Studios, I'd think twice. Elevators are ridiculously slow and it's constantly full of conventions and weddings. That said, if Universal Studios is in your plans, go for it! It's a short walk if you don't opt for the very easy shuttle.;3
I've stayed here a couple of times now for work trips.  The property is in a good location, right across from Lincoln Center.  The rooms are acceptably clean and the room rate is reasonable.  For New York, that is sort of what it comes down to, isn't it?   I stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and second time in room with 2 full beds and room size is okay. There are rooms with just a single queen bed and those rooms are very small.   The bathrooms are tiny and I've had problems with the shower both times that I've stayed there. The first time the shower was leaking.  The second time there was no hot water so I had to take a chilly morning shower.  There is also only a door on half of the shower which is just a bit uncomfortable.  The bathroom gets a bit wet.      I completely;3
Look, beggers cant be choosers. This hotel may need some work here and there but over all it was a great stay for my husband and I. There was a little bit of a leak, not sure if it was coming from AC or when we showered but we noticed the carpet did have a bit of a wet spot near the wall that connects the bathroom and bedroom. I also would have wished there was a mirror somewhere aside from the bathroom. But aside from that the bed was very comfortable, the front desk, staff, and valet people were all gems. Very helpful and on top of it all! My favorite part was how close it was to Universal Studios and the City Walk. We spent a whole day at Universal studios and it was SO nice to not have to drive in that traffic to get to our hotel. We were literally on premises. We also loved;3
We stayed here in Jan 2018 - this was our first trip to NY. Location of the hotel is excellent and we had a fantastic view. However the rooms are tiny - we barely had room for our suitcase. Bathroom is dated and could do with a refresh. Beds were comfortable. Hotel corridors had a very strong smell and the hotel generally could do with some modernization and a refresh.;3
Seated in a good position, the hotel also offers some valuable facilities (roof garden with great view, small swimming pool, gym). Kind staff. The only flaw was the low brightness of rooms and the common parts due to mild light and dark walls.;3
"Hotel Wi-Fi these days is like hot water. You don't need to say thank you that it's there, and a hotel such as Hyatt shouldn't have spotty wifi that is unusable at times. It's like a hotel saying ""but we have warm(ish) water most of the day"".   The breakfast price is extortionary. $31 for a mediocre buffet - avoid it!  Rooms are well kept and very well sound isolated.  So if you need a good night sleep before a flight - this can be a good option. anything more than that - I would look someplace else.";3
I stayed for 2 weeks in this hotel. Room is clean, as well as the bathroom. Many things need improvement, like towels, which in many cases were old and not soft to the touch. There is no safe box in room. The rooms are noisy (you can hear steps from people walking I'm hallways, for instance). There are not many services like room service, restaurants or microwaves, but you can walk a block and there is a deli in which you can have breakfast, lunch or dinner and use their wifi for free. Subway is two blocks away so there is no big deal if you want to visit downtown or uptown. Staff is extremely friendly, I must mention Sonya which was our housekeeper, she took care of our room and was always attentive to our requests.;3
At first my sister and I were a little nervous because we didn't know what to expect.  But after arriving we found that the lobby is beautiful, the staff is really friendly and helpful. The rooms are small and old but clean. The location was great. We walked to as much as we could, and the subway is right out the front door. Lots of nice shops and great restaurants in the area. Very Safe.  Very Friendly. Would definately return.;3
This hotel is in a great location and the staff is very helpful. I was, however, unprepared for how ugly the room was! Perhaps they have better rooms but mine was on a lower floor and it was very dark. The furniture was quite tasteless. There was only one lamp in the room (by the bed) so if you wanted to work at the desk you couldn't.  There was a large TV but no remote control!  I am glad I didn't pay too much for this room.  It was so depressing that I decided to brave the snow storm on my check-out day rather than spending one more night in that room. You may want to hire their photographer, though.  They did a great job with the photos of the rooms!;3
Stayed at this hotel in February 2011.  Not our first choice but as we chose to go to LA on the weekend on the All Stars game and week of Oscars, there was not a lot of choice.  The Hotel was centrally located but the rooms were a little dated - the shower entrance was bizarre - my husband only just fitted in through the smallest opening.  Check in was slow and every time we approached the desk, there seemed to be an indeference to our presence.  The breakfast was the MOST awful we have ever encounted!  The eggs were powdered but were made into the shape of fried eggs and they were tasteless.  There was not a lot of choice so we basically had coffee and toast for breakfast each day.  Location was good - short walk to the train and close to Hollywood itself.;3
I have been using this hotel as our base to visit our grandchildren for years. The elevators are VERY OVERDUE to be replaced. There are 6 elevators which, if they work well, would be enough for the building, but each one runs so slowly (if it is running at all) that you lose patience.  The rooms in general are very nice, clean, well kept and the restaurant has very friendly and helpful staff. I just wish I could go up and down without a hassle.;3
This is a nice hotel but quite frankly i am a bit disappointed. The rooms are not that big at all. A hotel that claims to be ''upscale'' with ridiculously high rates should offer more space and amenities. The ''gym'', if i dare to call it so, looked more like a house basement rearranged with a couple treadmills. Mind you the internet is not free either (for over $200 a night), really? yikes. Needs a lot of improvement and a make over;3
The front of the building had scaffold up which is a little off putting when you first arrive however the entrance and lobby are beautifully decorated and give the wow factor, reception staff very friendly and helpful, the rooms are large however the bathroom was tiny and very outdated, missing tea/coffee making facilities. The roof top bar was a little shabby and dirty, the pool was closed and yet said open till end of sept. The location is very good for enjoying the sights of New York and is close to underground stations and cafes/bars;3
Decent bar, small rooms, clean although tired. Good location but rooms near road are noisy.  Room was either too hot or too cold, very hard to control.  Bathrooms are tiny and in need of repair, although clean.;3
Staff at hotel check-in was friendly and accommodating. They charge you $30 if you want to get into your room prior to standard check-in time. The room is large and we had a great view of Universal Studios. No frills, cafeteria/buffet style dining. Was mostly disappointed with the cold, low pressure shower. When you are paying premium prices due to location, hot water should be included in the package.;3
checked into the room around midnight after a long drive.  ac unit had wires hanging out everywhere.  My husband went to swing the tv to actually see it and the tv fell off the wall onto my husband.  I called the front desk immediately and told them to move us this was unacceptable.;3
We stayed here for one night after a concert and the stay was just ok. We stayed at a standard room with standard amenities--there was really nothing that knocked our socks off.  This is a good hotel to use if you are visiting Universal Studios because of its close proximity.  We would stay here again if we needed to.;3
We paid Â£150 each between 3 of us for 3nights which from what I can gather is normal NYC prices! The location couldn't get any more central to so many things! There is a subway literally under the hotel if you need to get anywhere not within walking distance and we also used the air train from Newark to penn station which took just 20mins. The room itself was extremely small and the beds didn't seem normal size either. For the amount of time we spent in the hotel none of this mattered. Didn't ever use the bar or diner as there's so many restaurants nearby. We arrived on an early morning uk flight and got into the hotel about 2 and the room was ready which meant we could freshen up before we headed out!;3
We visited New York for the new year with my wife and we decided to try the New Yorker as there a very good deal on expedia The Hotel is Ok and relatively well located in Manhattan. Check in was smooth but not really warm. Rooms are very small even as per NYC standard. We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms which nice. Overall OK but certainly better options around Manhattan;3
Rooms are spacious and clean and v handy for Universal. However the food is not good which is disappointing for a chain like that. My friends had dinner in the restaurant which they said was pretty bad and I was v underwhelmed by the breakfast. Plus lots of messy tables both in the bar and restaurant. Staff all very attentive though, so just eat elsewhere!;3
The foyer and exterior of the hotel look great, but our room was tiny, and very shabby - the bathroom, though definitely deco style, was clarly original, but this is no reason for it to look like it has never been given any attention, and it had a very stained and chipped bath, cracked tiles and just felt grotty. The bedroom was functional, but missing basics, such as a second bedside table, and a real lack of space to leave luggage, or to set up the ironing board. I know that New York hotel rooms are compact, but this was something else! Lifts were quick though, and the Tick Tock Diner offered large portions and great service.  However, the biggest issue was that, upon checking in we were informed there would be a daily service charge (which hadn't been flagged to us by the;3
One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was the rooftop bar, I stayed one week and at no point could get into the bar. Weds night I discovered it was only open weekends, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun... Private events (which incidentally played thumping dance music til gone 3am)... Mon & Tues frustratingly shut!!!  Having arranged to meet friends on Thurs night before a night out, not being allowed on the rooftop, we retreated to the bar and by way of apology, ibought a round of gin & tonics.... only when it arrived did I discover they were $14 each!!!!  On the upside, the location is brilliant.  The hotel is situated at the end of Jane Street and cross the road to the cycle path/promenade and you can enjoy lovely views of The Freedom Tower, pretty at night.  The reception staff &;3
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel of Gossip Girl fame for 4 nights in Dec 2011. The room was small and not too fancy. The hotel was located in the upper west side, so it was quite far away from the more tourist areas in mid town Manhattan. There were plenty of amenities and shops around; Starbucks, Duane Reade, ATMS all within 2 mins walk from the lobby and the Columbus Circle metro station was about 5 mins walk away. We had Christmas Eve dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Ed's Chowder House and it was quite good.  Overall the hotel is a bit pricey for what you get and totally not what I expected for a 4 star hotel.";3
The hotel is perfectly located, rooms are in good condition, lively bar downstairs. It is good for those who just need a room in the city and no expectations for good service. If you need concierge services or something delivered to the hotel - The Empire hotel is not for you. Things get lost at the reception. Packages are not delivered to the room. And at the reception there is always a queue. The staff doesn't even pretend to be helpful.;3
"We chose this hotel because it's walking distance to Universal Studio because we decided not to rent a car as we're only here for 2 days prior to our cruise.  I paid extra for a ""quiet room"".  It was away from the elevator but they gave us a room facing the expressway.  And the air conditioning is a bit loud (low humming sound).  They couldn't change our room as they were fully booked.  The restaurant downstairs was convenient and we went for the buffet for breakfast but it is pricey.  My son's little box of cereal and milk were $7.  We walked to the Universal Walk on the second day to eat at a crepes place instead.  The hotel does need updating (wall paper starting to peel at corners) but clean.";3
We have stayed at several Hilton hotels over the years and were sadly quite disappointed with this one. It just didn't have any kind of 'wow' factor which, given this is a Universal hotel was a disappointment.  The hotel was surprisingly dull (apart from the lobby area which was a bit better) and it was generally too business like.  The staff did little to make us feel we were special or even remotely important to them - we had emailed in advance to request a high floor (which is much quieter than the lower level rooms) they told us that they were unable to meet our request because we hadn't booked with them directly! However, after some discussion they finally moved us up a few floors, but we were still only about half way up the building. Sadly there was nothing special about;3
On reading some of the reviews of Empire (particularly on the commercial websites) we had high hopes for our stay at the Empire. Perhaps our expectations were too high but at best I would put Empire at average (even for New York standards).   The rooms are very small, windows rattle and allow considerable draughts. The bathroom is very cramped (approx 4 foot square) and lacks any ventilation.   No complimentary water on arrival. Very small bottle priced at $7. Staff were helpful. Avoid the $60 a night overnight parking. Parking lot at back on west 61st around $15.  SkyBar was mostly closed for private parties and was also restricted due to a snow storm. Iâd say the bar is overrated in any event. Handy bar in downstairs lobby.  Hotel is in a great location. Good selection of TV;3
The usual reception man was a jerk ,there was one young guy who did a night shift who at least tried to be helpful. The tour desk lady didn't have a computer and barely spoke english and was ALWAYS on the phone talking To a friend, it seemed to be fine with the management that she was. When we approached to try and book tickets/tours we where given the dirty eyes and told that everything needed to be booked elsewhere. Room was warmed by some device that sounded like it was about tk blow up. Every night at 3 am a loud blow off sound wOke us up, floor was soaked around The unit Rooms are very old It was the cheapest we could get over new years but that doesn't mean it was cheap! Location was good;3
Elite benefit not received and no welcome or check in service as explorist member.  The room is noisy, not as advertised. The hotel is at good position. The shuttle.bus is very convenient. The hotel overall is not worthwhile;3
We took a trip with our two little ones ages 5 and 7 to see the sights.  Wanted to make things as simple as possible so we stayed at Wyndham due to its proximity to Penn Station.  Long story short we were sent to our room which was on floor 18.  The door wouldn't open with either room key.  Went back down and a rude front desk woman said my cell phone must have been too close to it.  We knew otherwise because the door seemed broken/loose.  We were sent back up again carrying all of our bags and our tired kids.  Wouldn't open again.  Everyone was tired of walking but went back down and was told to go security.  Security told us to go back up and wait for someone to help.  We went back up exhausted carrying all of our bags still and sat on the floor and wAited.  Nobody came.  The;3
"This small (ish) 3* hotel in the Upper West Side is just fine.  Bed linen is clean and fresh, the water is hot and the location right next to 96th St subway station is very handy.  Just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.  Our room was small with a terrific internal view of the back of the buildings; the bathroom needed a bit of an overhaul and I know the carpets look a bit grubby; but all in all we didn't pay too much for a good night's sleep.  We were there for 4 nights and didn't come across any bedbugs.

I stayed in the hostel with a friend because it was close to the Shepherds Bush arena. My friend and I shared a double room, which cost Â£25 each. We were upgraded to an ensuite room, I assume due to a booking error.  The room was very clean but basic. You had to pay for Wifi. It was much nicer than a hostel though and the beds were extremely comfy. We had a fridge and the bathroom shower was very adequate. It wasn't hotel quality, but I would pay a few extra pounds for this over a hostel any day.  The blinds were quite thin so we woke up at dawn, also our room was opposite the bedding store and the staff woke us up talking loudly in the corridor in the morning. However it was a very comfortable stay and is in a great location if you're going to see a gig at the hammersmith o2.;3

My husband and I stayed at the Astor on the Park for a two night weekend getaway.  We booked online through nychotels.com and got an excellent rate for the Central Park area.      The hotel is located at the north-west corner of Central Park at 106th St on Central Park West.  It is a quick 5 minute walk to the subway stops at 103rd St or 110th St.    We really liked the location as it is outside of the hustle bustle of the southern end of Central Park.   We had a room that faced Central Park.     The Room itself is tiny, but clean.   There was one double bed and an armoire that had a closet and a television set.  Some of the channels didn't come in very well on the TV, but we weren't there to spend time in the room.  The bathroom was a good size and had all the amenities we;3
I was in NY for 2 nights - solo traveling. Overall, this did not feel like a hotel. It is similar to a hostel, with shared bathrooms, shared showers and 180 sq ft rooms. I felt uncomfortable in my room since I saw a handprint on the outside of my door. The walls are paper thin. So you can hear the person next to you and each time someone leaves their room. I asked to be upgraded or moved (since I read reviews that many people have been upgraded for free in the past) and the staff said I could move to a private room with private bath for $275 per night. I did not feel comfortable sharing a shower. I did not have shower flip flops or shoes with me. The bathroom reeked of bleach. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The bar was really cool- but that was probably the only part of;3
"The reservations staff was very accommodating of our request for a room on a lower floor (because the Jewish Sabbath required us to take the stairs instead of the elevator.).  Perhaps the ""price"" we paid was the tiniest of rooms that opened up to a dark air shaft.  The hotel location was excellent for our attending family events and the opera nearby, and the service friendly.  We actually would consider a return visit to the Empire, but opt for a more spacious room -- even one with a view!  Our weekend in the city was wonderful, and despite the comments above, we had fun and the hotel served our purposes!";3
I was going to stay in NYC for just one night and needed a cheap room that was near the subway line. A comparable room elsewhere in the city would've been twice as much. It was a decent place to stay. The room was a bit run down and it showed. worn out carpet, scratched & pealing furniture. The bed seemed clean. bathroom was also clean. only bad thing was that there was no way to regulate the heat in the room and it was very very hot for a cold winter day. I had to turn on the AC in order to be able to sleep comfortably.;3
The employees and staff were great!  So nice and very helpful. This hotel is in the best location.  The public rooms and hotel room were very tired and in need of updating.  Our room was very dark, the wallpaper was coming off the wall in several places. The bathroom had a lot of mold in the shower as well as on the door and behind the door. In general the Empire is in need of updates.;3
Beside the dark hallways, smelly room, low quality bathroom. It is a good value and central location to stay. Walking distance to Hop on Hop off buses, shopping, food, and subway. Employees are very helpful and courteous.;3
After a 19 hour journey, I arrived at The Empire Hotel ready to sleep. Unfortunately the room I'd been given was right next to an elevator shaft, which was very noisy. In addition there was some piping outside making a constant noise.   I didn't really want to cause any issues but knew I wouldn't be able to sleep with that noise going on (despite being provided foam ear plugs - which were determined to keep leaping out my ears). The reception staff were incredibly helpful in allocating me a new, slightly quieter, room away from the elevator. I greatly appreciated their efforts for this although the new room was still slightly noisy from the pipes outside and I DID need to wear my own ear plugs (Wax ones) each night in order to sleep.   Other than that my bed was comfortable and;3
Good location for people who do not drive a car and prefer public transport! Most staff were very friendly and helpful (Michel G. for instance), but unfortunately some were not interested at all. A Russian girl who works at the reception was not interested in our questions and spent around 10 min. talking to some Russian guests staying in the hotel, whilst other people were waiting to be served. We asked for directions by public transport, but the answer from her was to get a taxi!  And when we said we would still like to use public transport, she looked at me as though I cannot afford a taxi! The over person at the reception (almost sure he was Russian too) when asked for directions just said he does not know where it is and that was the end of the story! Could somebody please;3
Hotel is perfectly located near to Central Park and major attractions. The standard Queen room was clean and tidy but very small and right next to the service shutes outside so was very noisy. We asked to be moved which we were eventually on the second day of our stay however all standard Queen rooms have windows out to the service shutes so all suffered with the same noise conditions. I feel this should have been mentioned in the room dsciription as it was quite significant and the rooms aren't cheap. Unfortunately the pool deck was closed for the entirety of our stay too due to flooding the week before and we were not forewarned about this so could not change our hotel choice.

The rooms are ok, there is a club upstairs so it was hard to sleep. Lobby is beautiful but some of the staff needs to learn manners.

Overall ok hotel;3
"It's a hotel next to Universal and has great rooms. (You pay a premium for those, of course). On the plus: Great valet service. Fantastic and quick, a rarity at large hotels. They were 4 for 4 for getting our car--it was always ready by the time we got down the elevator. Kudos to the valet crew! Desk crew--TERRIBLE. From checkin to a few times we wanted to talk to the front desk, there was always a long wait and never enough employees. They prefaced their interaction both days with ""sorry about the wait"" like robots, because they know there's a long wait. Why there are only one or two people working--and then often they help one customer and spend time on the phone (which suggests not enough phone answering crew either)--is a huge mystery. It frustrates everyone in line. It";3
Room was very small with very little place to keep luggage and move around. Did not have provisions for tea or coffee in the room. Queen bed was comfortable and room service was okay. Front desk and other services were adequate. After adjustment o verbal stay was good.;3
We booked our the suite for our family holiday to NYC which consisted of 2 double beds in the main room and a pull out couch in the living area. Comfortable beds to sleep in. For being a suite I expected the decor and facilities to be a bit better - there was no kettle for a cup of tea which youâd think for buying a room for 2000â¬ youâd perhaps get that at least. Towels and linen provided which was a bonus. Room smelt a bit damp on arrival.   The cleanliness of the bathroom was extremely poor. First shower I took the curtain was off white and there was black hairs in the bath/on the tiles. Bit off putting and disgusting especially when your in there!!   First night we stayed was a Saturday and on the Sunday morning room service approached our door and walked in at 6.50am!!;3
"The location of this hotel is fabulous; with easy walking to museums, great restaurants, and a perfect entrance to a fun area of Central Park.  The rooms themselves, small even by NY standards, are nice with comfortable beds and great water pressure.  The Empire needs to address the leaking shower, which I see from other reviews, is an obvious issue. No matter how we tried to jerry-rig it, we still ended up with a giant puddle on the floor after every shower.  The hotel lobby and bar feel more like Jersey Shore, than Manhattan.  The animal prints are cringe worthy and the couches and curtains are an attempt at swanky but miss the mark and are just cheesy.  We came to NY on this trip with a large group of friends, so we spent quite a bit of time in the lobby and lobby bar area as";3
"Lots of pros and cons for this hotel, whose web site lauds its ""lavish"" rooms.   Pro: location, cheerful and friendly guys at the front door (not so much at the front desk), lovely rooftop pool deck and lounge, efficient service for our small convention, good food, window in room that actually opened, rational level (i.e. not Arctic) of air conditioning in public areas.  Con: room was tiny by any standards, lighting too dim for reading, bathroom so small it was easier to towel off in the bedroom, cold water in shower for the first 10 minutes, hot by 20 minutes (five mornings in a row), a vast array of items for sale (pods for the in-room coffee maker, water at $7.50 a throw, snacks and whatnot) taking up valuable real estate with not so much as a complimentary tea bag, paper";3
I have been to New York 10+ times and I have never stayed in this part of town (Upper West Side), but chose the Astor based on its proximity to a music festival I was attending.  I stayed with a large group of people, and the rooms were what I expected for NYC (small).  Washrooms in both rooms had clearly been re-done and were nicer, overall the decor could be drastically improved but if all you need is a cheap clean place to stay this is the place for you.  Also quick walk to a subway stop, and really close to tons of deli's and pizza places if you need something quick and cheap to eat. One woman at the front desk was especially helpful and really nice.;3
We had 4 nights, 4 people, 2 rooms.  I paid for both rooms.  One receipt had a $25 per day fee, the other did not.  I left a voice mail to have someone return my call, and no return call.  This was not explained to me upon arrival.;3
Arrived around 10AM, however had to circle the block due to being unsure of where exactly valet parking was. Valet was very helpful. Completed pre-registration where I was told that I would receive a call when our room was ready. We were able to use the luggage check free of charge to store our bags until our room was ready, although I had to wait in line a half-hour to do so. They do charge to store bags if you are checking out, but did not charge us because we were checking in.   We did some site-seeing and arrived back around 3PM to see people were being checked in. After waiting in line for about 15 minutes, the Wyndham Rewards desk called me over, and after checking my pre-registration confirmation, told me that our room wasn't ready yet. Seeing as so many other people were;3
"During my two night stay at this property (invited by a New-York company so I will not comment prices), I suffered from the noise coming from corridors. Room doors are very old, and there is a free space between the bottom of the door and the floor, making all the noise freely flow from corridor to room, or the other way. Room doors also make a lot of noise when guests close them. Although check-out time is noon, housekeeper knocked at my door at 8 am on departure day to see whether she could handle my room. I should have placed the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door but... such sign was missing in my room. Also a lot of noise coming from outside (AC and so on). To sum up, I have found it difficult to rest and have privacy in my room. Otherwise, the bathroom was rather small and";3
Yes, it's a little dated but it's in a great location. The staff are super friendly, beds are comfy, rooms are warm and the showers hot! Not sure what more you would need on a visit to New York!  Don't stay here if you are expecting a 5* swanky hotel though!;3
I lliked the Morningside Inn as its location was good in Uptown NYC, the reception people were very helpful and assisted in finding every place in the city. The standards of cleanliness were high. The marts worked 24 hrs a day and a night and you could buy everything very close to the Inn. WiFi worked and the subway station (110th street) was only some blocks away.;3
As a Hyatt globalist, I was disappointed with my experience. Worst Regency Club experience Iâve had. The female attendant was less than friendly. The food offerings were a joke especially in the evening. Some soda was locked during the day and I had to ask several times to have the cooler unlocked to get ginger ale. The restaurant bar service was a mess. Although the manager was trying the kitchen was failing. Sure hope things get better.;3
The hotel is easily accessible from the subway station and location is good. However it needs renovation desperately. AC is old and beds are not comfortable. Our room had an iron rod protruding out of the bed stand which hurt one of us badly. Theyâve a daily mandatory charge of around $15 which is not clearly explained to the customers. Do ensure that you request for housekeeping each day as the daily charge includes housekeeping, water bottles etc. We were informed that housekeeping is chargeable when we asked at the desk and hence we decided to opt for alternate days which was a mistake on our part. Also we were told that water bottles snack bars are complementary but actually the daily charge included all this. Lifts were smelly. Will not recommend this hotel.;3
Like many of you, I read the reviews and was deciding between the Hilton vs the Sheraton.  I chose the Hilton.  My boyfriend and I only spent one night here before moving onto the Hyatt by Disneyland.   I paid extra for the King Alcove room because the pictures looked nice.  The room was dirty.  The mirrored closet doors were streaked.  The carpet had spots and the smell was like a cheap, artificial smell used to cover up something worse.  The location is walking distant (5-7 minutes) from Universal and restaurants.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I would probably try another hotel if I visited again.  I paid more for my room here than I did the Hyatt and the Hyatt is two notches above this hotel.;3
Clean, well placed hotel in Chinatown. Value for money. Located in the Chinatown district of Manhattan.  Definitely worth a visit to Chinatown and Little Italy to experience the vibrancy of New York!!!;3
This property is a hostel but wasn't listed that way.  The room was extremely small but had a small private bath.  It was listed as having a hairdryer and coffeemaker, which were not available.  But the place was quiet, clean, and air conditioned.  It is located about 6 blocks west of the northern end of Central Park and was only 3 blocks from the nearest subway.  It is definitely more for younger people just wanting a place to spend the night!;3
We stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights. This is a great location for universal which was our only goal for this trip. The walk was super short.  Room was very clean with a great view. We were overwhelmingly disappointed that there was not a refrigerator or microwave. We had brought breakfast options with us that we could not use. Eating on site is very limited.;3
We stayed at this hotel for only one night.   It was right across the street from Central Park and only 3 blocks from the subway station.  Convenient to the subway made it easy to go downtown to the Statue of Liberty, 42nd St. Times Square, etc.  It was an expensive hotel for a room probably only 10 x10 ft, small window with a air conditioner in it, and room only enough to get around the bed!  It's definitely not a room to hang out in.  It's just for sleeping. The elevator could barely fit 2 people and 2 suit cases.  So---pack lightly and use small suitcases if you plan to stay there.  The bathroom had been remodeled so---it was ok.;3
Minutes from Amsterdam, Columbus and Broadway, great local bars and restaurants where you can mix with the locals. The deli on the corner of the block is superb, he even found the World Cup match whilst we ate. The subway is on the corner so access is easy to the rest of manhattan. Try the bike rental up the road, riding round manhattan was the best decision we made, so funny.;3
"Overall, this hotel is a Tad dated by modern standards, and the bathroom size is pathetically minute, so there is no chance whatsoever of me giving more than a three star ""average"" rating and that, in some ways, seems generous. That said, there are upsides! Location is 300 metres from the corner of Central Park; the hotel has Ed's Chowder Place downstairs, the bar area is surprisingly good, and Dennis on the door is great. Oh, and for those with more get up & go than me, then there's a nightclub upstairs as well. Downsides? Well, horrendously small bathroom, and the rest of the very small kingsize room was only just acceptable despite there being virtually no wardrobe space. Also, there's no room for your luggage. And they charge $3 for the coffee in your room if you drink a";3
"Now this is in no way a place to stay if you like your luxuries, but for a place to crash out after a day of exploring the city it's just fine. We found the room perfectly adequate for our needs; it was fairly spacious, there was a fairly comfortable bed with clean bedding (no sign of bed bugs), a fridge, a place to hang and store clothes etc and a clean bathroom just down the hall. It's not pretty to look at in the sense that it could do with a lick of paint and a general facelift, but at Â£40 for two people a night I wasn't complaining! The hallways were grim, and some had an odd smell not dissimilar to that of a wet dog! Didn't have much to do with the staff, but anyone we ran into was generally courteous. The location couldn't be faulted - 2 blocks away from the Subway and in";3
Great location, front desk staff could not have been nicer.  Room on 11th floor was small but had everything that we needed.  It was clean, comfortable and the decor was nice.  View out of our window was of Lincoln Center.  If you do stay at this hotel do not stay on the 11th floor because the roof top bar is above your room and on a Saturday night you get to listen to the music vibrating and the people stomping around.  I am sure any other floor would have been much better.  The bathroom was tiny and shaving or showering flooded the floor.   Towels were in short supply as was soap.  So bottom line if you want or need this location stay here but not on the 11th floor.;3
The lobby and room were nice with the exception of the bathroom which was extremely dated. There was a very loud fight going on in our hallway, and i called the front desk a few times because I was worried someone would be seriously injured. I really dont think they sent anyone, or were worried, as the fight kept going long after the initial phone call. Also, the hallway smelled like weed. Overall though, it was worth the price for a downtown New York City Hotel.;3
I stayed on the 4th floor in the Riverside Studios. Check-in was quick, the elevator is small and slow but not a big deal. The room is also small but this did not bother me since I did not rent this room to hang out in. This is the kind of place you stay if you are looking for somewhere to leave your belongings while you explore NYC, as the location is very convenient, in a quiet residential with a reasonable parking garage across the street. Riverside park, Central Park, and the 72nd Street Subway are all very very close by.  That being said, the stains on the wall of the room, the dirty hallway carpet which seemed to cover holes in the floor, and handful of roaches outside and inside the shared bathroom did put me off a bit. Tip: Bring Shower Shoes! Also, some of the random,;3
Keep it simple stop charging Guest for breakfast. Honestly I would not return to this hotel for that. The lighting in the bathroom is very dim. Overall the location to the airport is perfect shuttle service is good.;3
The location is terrific, but I donât think Iâd ever stay here again. The public spaces in the lobby were nicely done, but as as you stepped into the elevator, you could begin to see the wear. The carpets in the elevators and hallways were often dirty and tired looking.  As soon as we left the elevator, the smell of marijuana was beyond strong. This was the case every time we came and went for 5 days. Ridiculous and made the hotel seem super trashy and low budget.  The room was very small and showing its age. In NYC sometimes hotel rooms are small, but with thoughtful touches for storage/maximizing space. Not here. There werenât any places to really hang clothes because the fridge was in the closet. A tired looking chair was randomly placed. The 2 drawers on the bedside table;3
This hotel is across from Lincoln center/ Julliard school, accessible to metro stations( 59 and66). It is in a good location.They have friendly and helpful doormen and bar staff. Two of the front desk staff that I interacted with are not so friendly. There was a problem with billing and that I believed should have been avoided and handled better.Ther'es a lot of good restaurants closeby and Starbucks is just around the corner.;3
Tick Tock dinner staff were very pushy just interested in getting their tips even asking telling you to tip  20% ate in there twice had enough so found another dinner a block away staff there nice not pushy much better food there than at the tick tock room in hotel small;3
I booked this hotel last minute because this was the best deal that I could get. The area it is located in is not the worst in the world and there is enough parking around.  Lobby- Quite cramped and appeared old. Front desk staff were slow to respond while I was checking in but were courteous and helpful.  Hallways- Very small, cramped elevators and the hallways were cramped too. The paint was chipping off and it smelled musty and old.  Rooms- Had an old, musty smell to it. They had old CRT TVs, static filled channels and all which made me feel like I was back in the 90s! I wouldn't walk on the carpet barefoot- looked like it was over a decade old. The shower head in the bathroom came out of a hold in the wall and was quite loose.   Overall, not the best but also not the worst;3
My in-flight magazine had a review of this hotel that made it sound like the hot spot of NYC.  It is in a good area, with lots of restaurant options and small shops, and the subway is about 4 blocks away.  The rooms are interesting.  It is all about conserving energy, which I like, and it was comfortable, but the single bed is quite small and stiff.  We did not get our own bathroom, I don't know if that is an option, but the shared bathrooms were clean and rarely busy.  My main problem was the smell in the hall way and the noise in the middle of the night.  There was a terrible smell all throughout the hallway, it made me gag each and every time I forgot to hold my breath while walking to or out of my room.  I never habituated to the smell.  However, when I entered my room I;3
I am an ex New Yorker who hates relying on relatives when I visit. That said, I always seek out a location AWAY from Times Square. The hotel does the job if you just want to crash after  a late night, as it's a clean, comfortable though old room , but...if you are looking for more than that...keep looking! Pros: location is great, very near subway. (But a $15 cab ride into midtown)  Brand new bathroom thankfully. Very cheerful desk people. Big cons: Lighting, lighting, lighting. My room was so dark because of it's location in an odd tight corner facing other bldgs (I could see inside the neighbors' kitchen without my glasses!) but also, the lighting in the room was so dim, even the bathroom, it was a drag trying to get dressed for a big evening out. Also, you can wait forever;3
Our stay was disappointing. The management staff were good though. Vey dark space to stay in. Standard rooms have a view but small and very noisy. Suites are great size but in the middle of hotel so no view. Terrible bathrooms. I didn't know there was a restaurant and bar on first floor until day 3. Looked nice.  Location birmt far from mid town. Ok if you like walking a lot. But fine if you're Happy to use taxis.;3
"While having more room than the typical NY hotel room for the price, I ran into two main problems. First, there was only one outlet (plug, not whole outlet) available to plug things into. And it was partially obscured by the bed. Also, it wasn't near the desk, if you wanted to plug in your computer. There was also a plugin available in the bathroom and I used my extension cord to reach the desk.  Second, you can not make long distance calls from the room. I was trying to use a calling card and it wouldn't work. The front desk told me that I had to use one of the ""public phones"" in the lobby. I used my cell phone but the reception wasn't the best.  On the plus side, there is more room than most NY rooms at this price, including a full closet. Also, the WIFI worked much better";3
"Good things: Clean, good location and decent price, shower has good pressure!  Not so good things: bed is terrible, whole place smells like a hospital (but like I said very clean) service is minimal but friendly-ish... Don't bother eating in, when the kitchen wasn't ""out of order"" there is nothing to cut on, cook with or serve on...";3
You get what you pay for at this budget-priced hotel. Don't expect any more than that. Good price, small room (but so are most NYC hotels). Nice lobby, but the rest of the hotel could use a remodel and freshen up.;3
"Booked this through a discount site so reckon it was charged at a more reasonable rate than the daily charge . The location was everything you would need to explore NYC , the place itself I'd describe as jaded . Whilst appreciating the wood panelling and darkly featured wall coverings my partner described the lobby as dark and gloomy. The room was one of the smallest I have ever found in a hotel with very little floor space alongside the double bed , limited storage and a mini bathroom . The heating / AC was difficult to control . The booking held out the promise of Wifi (a must in NY ) , that unfortunately incurred an additional daily charge. The rooftop pool offered a pleasing night time vista - but a word of warning - the pool was not tiled but rather had a "" sticky back";3
The rooms looked nice online, are VERY small.  I travelled with 3 teen agers. The bathroom is about 5x5 including the shower. Fridge is stocked full, everything costs a fortune, such as water or soda for $7.50 a bottle.  No room to put anything of mine in without taking their stuff out.  Coffee in room, great! oh wait......it is $3.50 for each Keurig pod (which costs about $.40 in stores).  WiFi in room is $12.95 a day.   AC is freezing or roasting you. At least one elevator out of service at all times.  Called for Maintenance for bathroom 3 times in as many days.  Great location but I feel way overpriced for what you get.;3
The Pros: - The location can not be matched - it was just the best spot for access to everything (the Subway, Empire State Building, Times Square, the Vessel, Macys). It is a phenomenal spot and made the trip commutes around NY very easy.  - The staff were friendly and courteous.  - The lobby is lovely.   The Cons: - The rooms are dated and decaying. Our first room wasn't even cleaned properly when we went in and much smaller than the advertised pictures. We got moved to another room easily and that room was OK but barely.  We got to see next door's room and that was a little better so it's random how the rooms are allocated and some are better than others.  - Nothing really inclusive like other hotels. No mini bar, the service was also slow (took 3 or 4 separate calls for;3
We have stayed at the Empire before, but this is my first review. First of all, you really can't beat the location, steps away from Central Park, Columbus Circle, and Lincoln Center, plus Subway lines. The evening crowd on the roof is young and happy and loud! The staff is very accommodating and the rooms are neat and clean. My only complaint about this hotel is the bathroom. There is not a full shower door or curtain so that the entire bathroom gets fairly wet when you take a shower. There is also limited space to put toiletries. In my opinion it is not an efficient use of space. However, I'm sure I will stay there again, just be aware of the bathroom situation if that is important to you.;3
Very close to Penn St Station, this is a rather grand hotel that has seen better days. We had a a sweet little room with a view. My main gripe with the hotel is the rather large and unexpected 'facilities' payment that was added to the end - which was too much for the really poor wifi.;3
"...looks aren't everything.  The room looked clean, including the sheets.  There were towels, dishes, toilet paper, a wardrobe, a refrigerator.  There were about 4 kitchens on our side of the floor, the 1st floor.  The street wasn't noisy, and the window was a little bit away from the street; so you didn't feel you right there near the sidewalk.  The wifi was ridiculously expensive, so I didn't bother.  There is a library not too far away, but they don't even have wifi there.  The walls are super thin.  So you can hear talking and love-making, etc.  And the showers are communal, so all your bio-grime swishes around with everyone else's, sometimes passing over your feet before it hits the drain.  You have to push a button for the water to run at 1min. intervals, and the water";3
Stayed for 3 nights had room facing inwards not great but its only some where to sleep. The rooms were dark and bathroom was in need of refurbishment. Shower did not work properly and plug was missing from sink asked to be fixed alas nothing happened. The font desk staff need to be more helpful and learn how to talk to there guest better. The only smile we got was at checkout from young lady behind desk. Housekeeping staff done at wonderful job. The only thing going for this place is the location.;3
To start with I could not fault the staff at Park West as they were all lovely, friendly and professional. Unfortunately the building maintenance is what has let this place down. At first this hotel seems really promising. The exterior and lobby are very modern and inviting but this is soon let down when you make your way to the rooms. It is clear a lot of decorating work is going on to amend the problems that have cropped up in previous reviews, but the price should have been reduced to compensate for this. The elevator floor was extreamly dirty, all it needed was a hoover. The hallway leading to out room was also left in a half decorated state with light fixtures exposed and old paint. The whole feel of Park West felt very half finished. The room was perfectly nice but as you;3
While your establishment was nicely located I was disappointed in the rooms and the fact that coffee was not complimentary to each room and the prices were very high for a small cup which came with the coffee maker. The rooms appeared old.;3
I stayed in a double room here with two friends in January for the amazingly low price of $79/night. We basically just needed a place to crash and throw our stuff that was slightly more private than a hostel, and the Astor did the trick. Althought the beds are surprisingly big, the room itself can feel cramped as there is almost no floor space with 3 people's suitcases lying around.           The bathroom was a very nice surprise, sparkling clean every day and larger than expected. The shower has plenty of hot water and housekeeping gives you those handy little bottles of shampoo/conditioner- nice ones too! There is free coffee/hot chocolate downstairs along with high speed internet- convenient but expensive at $1/ 5 minutes. The location is not especially scenic or exciting,;3
I really want to give this 5 stars... But there are a few things that prevent that. First, the good: our room was quiet, aside from noise from the street outside, which can't be prevented. The room was cleaned well each day & we enjoyed the lobby bar at night. The location was great- subway nearby, not the craziness of Times Square, but close enough to it. Close to central park as well. The room (king junior suite) was a nice size by NY standards & the sofa bed was as comfortable as a real bed.  Now for the bad: the boiler was broken for 2 days while we were staying there so there was no hot water. I get that this is out of the hotel's hands... Things happen. What I didn't like was that there was ZERO communication from the hotel about it. We weren't told of the issue until we;3
This hotel is in a good location next to the Lincoln Centre but is a bit tired.  No free wifi in the bedrooms and no free coffee and tea making facilities. But a bustling bar.  The bedrooms at the back look are noisy due to all the air conditioning units.;3
"Hotel was clean and adequate with a reasonably comfortable bed and decor reminiscent of American Horror Story, Hotel (am I mixing up my art styles?).  In any event, I was ready to love this place.  Great, interesting architecture, good energy among the other guests, etc., but was quite surprised by the $25.00 daily ""Facility Fee"" that was tacked onto the price identified on the booking site that I used.    I am very aware of the steep fees and taxes that the City charges in connection with a hotel room.  However, those were always represented as ""hey, not our charges, the city imposes them,"" which I understand.  Looking to exploit the situation, it appears that many City hotels now charge a ""Facility Charge"" or similar add-on fee  -- for phone, gym, wifi, etc..- with no opt out,";3
second stay in 10 years.  gone down hill.  room 508 was old and battered.  horrid laminate shower walls black with mould and coming away, tiny bathroom with shower spraying all over floor, broken shower, toilet.   bed was comfy but nothing special.  room very dark and oppressive, tatty hangers, noisy air con and coffee maker that had a steady supply of ...tea.  Not coffee. really disappointed.  wouldn't stay there again unless some money is spent on rooms to get them up to scratch.  communal areas are nice.  concierge, Uri, was great. door men great and all but one of receptionists was very pleasant.;3
Hotel was nice. Lobby was spectacular. Rooms were just big enough. Location is spot on. It sits in front of the ballet and across the street from the smith and a couple of restaurants. Staff was friendly. The maid even folded my shirt I left out!;3
"We stayed two nights in this hotel right after Christmas. At this time of the year NY is crowded and it is really tough to get decent deals. We got a rate of $104 a night, which can only be found in Newark or close to LaGuardia.   The location was pretty good. Right in front of the Central Park. We stayed at the 10th floor and had an amazing view. From the balcony it was possible to see the NY's skyline. There are subway stations 3 block away (B-C) and if you walk 8 minutes west you can catch the 1 train.  The room itself was small and simple, even though we got an upgraded one. The carpet wasn't very clean but the linens were. The gap under the room door and balcony door were really big and wind blew thru it constantly making that ""horror movie wind blowing"" noise. The bed";3
I chose this hotel for our break in New York based on other Tripadvisor reviews. The location was great and not too bad to get to from JFK in a taxi. Check in was very sterile, not very welcoming. The lifts looked very tired and were very slow. Our room was soooo disappointing, we had booked a standard room so didnât expect it to be huge, but it was very small, the dÃ©cor was tired and the bathroom was very shoddy â worst of all we were on the third floor and subject to a constant drone  from the air conditioning fans on top of an adjoining building. After talking to reception they offered to move us to another standard room on a higher floor on the following day (nothing else available to us on our first day). the room switch went ok, our packed bags were moved on time but again;3
It's NYC so average. Most other cities this hotel would get a poor review. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Location is great. Ideal for morning/evening runs in Central Park. But the room was a bit filthy - refurbishment should be considered. In particular the bathroom was in poor condition. Cleaning not too impressive but not unacceptable either. Bed was clean and comfortable.;3
Tiny tiny older room. Very clean, comfortable bed, great wifi. No coffee service in the room. Good restaurant for breakfast right next door. Penn Station is across the street. Walking distance to Times Square.;3
We stayed this past weekend at the Empire Hotel and cannot say enough about the excellent location. It is close to Lincoln Center, Rock Center, Central Park and art museums (MOMA, Frick and Met). Starbucks on the corner below was also a plus! There were a couple of negatives though- there was a lot of noise from the street below. We were on the 5th floor and facing the street. Maybe go higher or toward the back of the building if you want a more quiet room. Also, the walls are paper thin. We could hear a lot of the conversations from the room beside us.  The hotel itself is beautifully decorated. The room was small but nicely arranged. The shower was excellent.  One last negative was $3.00 for the in room coffee...really??? you couldn't throw that in at no cost?;3
This hotel is just average.  We paid $200 a night because we went during high season in NY and everything else was already booked.  Our room was tiny (which you should expect in NYC for any decent location where you are paying less than $300 a night).  The room was clean, but seemed unfinished.  The was an open electrical box in the ceiling.  The TV only gets channels with infomercials or spanish language programming.  Our view was of the room opposite ours.  The elevator was fine going up from the lobby, but could not be called from the fourth floor to go down.  The stairs were narrow and difficult to navigate.  Not to mention, several of the marble steps were broken, unstable, or covered in unsecured plywood.  Overall, if you stay here, make sure to book ahead of time.  Had we;3
stayed Dec 2018 loved everything about this hotel, stayed again Jan 2020 and the only thing we enjoyed was our room, service was minimal at best no communication between departments, made to feel like an inconvenience more than a guest. Sent in an email to Wyndham and was basically told I would be better off contacting the hotel directly so pretty much passed the buck. I figured my concerns would fall on deaf ears and I was correct;3
I traveled with my 21 year old niece to this hotel for a combo business/leisure trip.  The hotel is within a comfortable walk of Universal Studios which made it very convenient, and there is a handy shuttle if you don't want to hoof it.  The hotel charges for parking, which irritates me but was not unreasonable for a large urban area.  One of its greatest strenghths is the Mandarin Buffet in the main restaurant every Thurs-Sun, which attracts over 800 locals per night.  Everything from Lobster Thermidor to jellyfish tentacles to Korean bbq to cotton candy to a chocolate fountain to sushi to carving stations to many salads - you have to see it to believe it.  All this accompanied  by a very good piano-playing gentleman who covered both Hoagy Carmichael and Miles Davis.  Our;3
Here for three nights when visiting Universal.  A great location to stay if you want to be close to Universal.  The breakfast was great with plenty of choice on the standard buffet offering with the opportunity to upgrade for a hot selection.  Everyone who interacted with us at breakfast, we found to be warm and friendly.  Rooms were large, but sadly, we found evidence of a previous guest in the room i.e. the cleaning standards were not the best. We did report it but there was really no improvement during the time we were there.;3
Placed room service order and wrong food was brought. Called RS and they started someone would call us. After 15 min no phone call. We called back down and was told only 1 person was 'working' room service. The gal at he front desk had no solutions and stayed it was not her responsibility. Such a shame such poor customer service at a Hilton Property .;3
Having buffet many times in Hilton Universal City when I visit LA. since 12 years ago.They got lot of choice special in seafood, even more , more than Hotels in Las Vagas. But this year I visit on Mother's Day for Brunch buffet, very disappointed. Charged more $60@ but less choice, no lobster, worst is every served food is similar canteen quality. Only remain excellent service. Will not go there anymore.;3
I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The room is as you would expect in New York quite small. The bathroom was very old fashioned. The bars attached to the hotel were very good. The hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and 10mins from Times Square. The walk to Times Square there is a lot of homeless and people on substances but if you ignore them they will ignore you.;3
Overall it was a decent hotel. Considering that it is in the city and you're paying a pretty penny for it, I expected a bit more. There should have at least been milk/creamer and sugar in the room for the coffee and tea, since you had to pay for the coffee. Also, we could not get internet in our room, even though we paid for it. Overall, it was a decent stay. The hotel staff were all very friendly and accommodating, and the roof top pool was pretty good and great to use on a hot day.;3
I arrived with 2 family members early in the morning after a 10-hour overnight flight. I was grateful that we were provided with a room as we were exhausted. The room had 2 double beds and a roll-away bed along one wall and a table and chair pushed against the opposite wall, leaving about 3 feet of space to walk from the beds to the small bathroom. The roll-away had to be entered from the bottom of the bed. That's how limited the space was. We picked this hotel because of its proximity to Penn Station, which has extensive subway connections. Because we were only staying 2 nights, I didn't try to change our room which was very uncomfortable. Otherwise, the hotel was old but okay.;3
Hotel is amazing. The breakfast is awesome it's a full free breakfast. Only had one issue with check in booked a double bed but the reservation said for 1. After a stern talking too they didn't charge me for an additional person fee. The hotel is located near some free clinics not an issue for me since I went on a weekend and they weren't open. You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance of the hotel. The pool is amazing as well.;3
If you are traveling in and out of LAX to get to Hawaii or somewhere else in a short time period this place is great. Shuttle to and from airport 24 hours. Our shuttle drivers where mostly nice, one was not friendly but did his job. Make sure to looks for shuttle we had to flag down one, because the driver wasn't interested in stopping. Staff very nice. Check in pretty easy for Hyatt members. Although remodeled hotel is worn. Our rooms were dirty and well sticky looking. But given the location and shuttle and staff would totally stay here again. Biggest annoyance restaurant breakfast. We did not want the buffet asked if eggs and potatoes if ordered would be cooked to order. Nope they were cold when they came out and we purposely asked for well done and over hard eggs. Basically;3
If you need a hotel for Universal it's great as it right there. But as a hotel it's about average.  We popped out from the park in the afternoon for a swim as we were getting hot and tired and then went back in the evening to take advantage of the smaller queues.  But as a hotel it's only OK.  Staff were knowledgable about the park (good tips on how to plan your day) and wait staff in the restaurant were excellent.  Other good points - right on highway 101 so easy to get in and out.  That's it.  Bad points - expensive wifi in the room, expensive parking ($24 a day was the most I had to pay in 3 weeks in the US), expensive breakfast and it's an ugly 1980s hotel.  The only reason to stay here is either for a business conference (and you don't get a choice) or for Universal;3
Second trip to NY first stayed in RIU hotel (amazing). The rooms were really small but we had been upgraded as I asked and it was my 30th. Perfect location across road from Maddison square gardens. Penn station and all subways right outside which was fab for getting about, Deffo get 7days pass for $33 well worth it!! Empire State and Mach within easy walking distance.   Hotel does need a bit of an update especially on some corridors as look a bit outdated and dingy but they are clean. We were on floor 22.;3
The location is great if youâre wanting to be near the park, which we did- one of the best things we did in NYC was go for an early morning run in Central Park.   The main problem was the noise !  The window of the room looked into the central âcourtyardâ with the fans and the noise was deafening. Really loud!  Granted it was hot outside, but the noise was very very loud.   The room was small and not fancy.;3
I stayed only one night at the hotel. The room is very small, the bathroom is even smaller. There are an annoying noise outside of the room and the air conditioned also makes too much noise. The only solution was to use earplugs.;3
If the Empire Hotel were branded Marriott or Hyatt, it would cost $60-80/night more.  And for the added money you would get exterior windows that seal well, bathroom faucets that don't come off in your hand when you turn on the water, functional sink drain stoppers, and bathroom doors made of metal or non-wood composite. These minor annoyances are just that, minor, and for the price, the Empire Hotel is a great buy.  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated with a comfortable mattress and nice towels and bed linens.  The location is hard to beat, across the street from Lincoln Center (see photo) and a block from Central Park.  On this stay, the iPod docking station worked, but the a/c unit went from the ideal white noise of fan only to a clattering bag of bolts when the;3
Back hall was very noisy due to tile. Bathrooms were old and mildew in some places. The staff was extremely nice accommodating. Restaurant was nice and good food. Bed linens we're confortable. If you like nostaglisa, this is the place for you but don't expect a 5 star experience.;3
We stayed at the hotel in late August 2014. We travelled as a couple as part of a California road trip.   Good points  1. Good in-room amenities. Free wifi, air conditioning, empty fridge, hairdryer, safe, iron, lots of power sockets.   2. Spacious room.  3. Friendly staff.  4. It's a 5min walk to Universal Studios. The hotel will tell you it's a 15min walk and they even lay on shuttle buses. Seriously, in order for it to take 15min you'd have to crawl on your hands and knees, it's very quick once you're out of the building (in relation to which, see point 1 below!).  Bad points  1. On arrival we discovered that there is major modernisation work being carried out for 15 weeks to the lifts. This caused CHAOS. We were staying on floor 18 and it took us 20min to get out of the;3
Average hotel . It seems to be common practice that certain rooms so not have tea and coffee making services in the room and no fridge . Internet Service is good but you need to lob in every 24 hours. Expensive for what you get .;3
We just stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and we found that the location including the free shuttle service that takes you to universal was fantastic - it was a great feature and the rooms were extremely spacious and clean however we ordered room service 3 times and all 3 times the food was not enjoyable even being uneatable one time we also ate in the restaurant and we found the food choice to be limited when ordering off the menu and again not that great we do believe the food needs to be improved and the variety updated - finally we enjoyed the service very friendly staff our arrival was handled pretty normal just a few glitches but nothing to complain about although the look of the hotel could use an update it is a very old looking outdated hotel;3
Good location (we had an event at MSG) Staff was helpful and did a nice job. The rooms are SMALL but everything was clean. Was nice there is a 24 hour diner attached to the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for a midtown stay;3
Pleasant staff and fine location. However, this hotel could use a serious face-lift. The wallpaper is rather drab and just outdated. The lighting is something out of a eastern block experience circa 1970. The bedding was definitely not premium. Amenities were decent but the bar was closed all weekend.;3
Our stay did not start off well as I had booked the Moderne and was moved to the Empire (which was 8 blocks further away from Times Square) due to a supposed flood in the room but that's another story.  The carpets and furniture are dated. The bathroom is minute - not just small. Breakfast on our first morning was a shambles.  There were no seats and no food.  Meanwhile there was a separate part which had only one table with guests but we were told that area was for a group and we could not sit/serve ourselves from that side. Second morning was less busy but still breakfast was minimal.;3
"I spend loads of time in hotels for work and can honestly say there is nothing ""wrong"" with this hotel. The location is fantastic to start with. The rooms are clean, the beds are small but comfortable, the water-pressure in the showers is good and the staff are friendly. Its a massive hotel with very little eye for a ""personal touch"".";3
Great location and service prior to staying, however room was tiny with no storage space and bathroom was very dated and old again the smallest of rooms. The service received was purely on arrival and departure so was acceptable.;3
Overall the hotel is nice, the room was tight. The breakfast is good a lot better than the chains, the made to order omelet was nice Watch out for the fees, why canât you just set a price and be done with it?;3
This hotel has a greate location. You have everything within a few Blocks. A big Subway station two Blocks Down and Central park around the corner. THe entrance is Nice an clean, the lobby bar a bit small, but you will manage. The room it self was small, but all NY rooms are usully. The room was clean and the beds where good. The bathroom was not so good, it could use a upgrade. Clean but not in good shape,.. and there was no hot water...;3
We stayed there only 1 night. And the hotel was OK. Good & quick reception. Nice room. Location was good for the closest proximity of airport, but far from city center. Shuttle to airport available. For 170$ for 1 night 2 persons it was ok;3
Choose this hotel only if you are traveling by car and if you are not planning to spend time in your room. Is a good value for money but location is not as good as it sounds and as other reviews said there are under renovation so it gets quite noisy in your room. One of the best parts of it is the service at the breakfast room: Hugo and Sonia are very welcoming.;3
Horrific check-in procedure, dated rooms with little to no amenities at an outrageous rate even for NYC.  Have to call front desk even for ice.  One vending machine on first floor only takes dollar bills and front desk didn't have any ones they could spare (or didn't want to, hard to tell).;3
Our first trip to New York didn't start too well! Arrived, checked in, got stuck in lift!!!! No apology from management at all. Room was good size, although in desperate need of a revamp!!! After the initial shock though,  bathroom large, great shower and very clean. Bed very comfortable and room cleaned and clean towels daily. Reception staff couldn't have been more kind or more helpful when my credit card was stolen,even letting me use theirpersonal mobile. If your looking for decent size room in fab location at good rate I would say give it a go.;3
I stayed at Wyndham New Yorker Hotel for a long weekend in NYC. Very positive is the location of the hotel, close to Penn Station with good access to the Metro and LIRR to JFK airport as well as to Uptown and Downtown.  The hotel itself is a very busy place with queues at the checkin and at the luggage storage. The Wyndham Rewards desk was always closed when I was in the lobby. Anyway, the staff is friendly and trying to keep waiting time short.  The rooms are clean and the sleeping comfort is good. Unfortunately the standard rooms are very very very very small, so that there is even no space for your luggage. Traveling with two adults, this could be a little challenge.  The bathroom is clean an functional, although its time for renovation to get back from the 1990s. As;3
This hotel is about 20 minutes of brisk walk from 46th street (Times Square) and the Subway station is just around the corner for you to take a train to any place in Manhattan.  Slightly expensive. The room had a good air conditioner, Music system, TV, Microwave and minibar (empty though).   Did not see a restaurant though . i.e., no breakfast . Helpful, polite and friendly staff.;3
Staff was nice.  Security good.  Room was ok.  Plumbing was not.  Shower would not maintain temp.  No lock on the bathroom but there was one on the closet for some reason.  Toilet was very loud.  No shelf for toiletries.  Overall ok for 2 nights.  Liked the location.;3
This iconic Midtown Manhattan behemoth of a hotel was once the place to be.  Sadly, time and economic realities have taken their toll. Still beautiful in it's Art Deco architcture, rooms are small for 2 but adequate for solo stays & run around $200+ per night If you're in town for mostly theatre, this location is perfect. Minutes by subway to all Theatre District locations. Close to Macy's and Herald Square for shopping.;3
I am currently staying here. I just drove over hear from the Hilton in Carlsbad and although they are both Hiltons the people here in Universal city are frazzled, tired, a bit argumentative (even when asking for something off the menu they will argue with you about taking the buffet instead).  The elevators are in need of repair, only 1 or 2 work and constantly full.  The remotes for the TVs are bad as you need to be about 12 inches away from the rv to do anything. The system is also crappy as you cant easily stop the porn selection from coming up and when you travel with kids... that's not a good thing.  Overall a good looking Hotel but inside it has a lot of notable downsides.;3
This hotel is reasonably priced for New York. Located on the upper west side it's in a good/safe location. Customer service is fantastic! My room was on the second floor and upon arrival I was pleased with how much space it had. In addition the room had a renovated bathroom with makeup mirror, great water temperature setting and AC unit. There were some minor inconveniences such as a very slow elevator, outdated TV and slow WiFi.;3
But the best cheapo dump in NYC. It's a ramshackle old tenament building.  It's not a hotel, it's a hostel.  And a derelict one at that. The rooms are a crap shoot, there are some that are clean and semi pleasant. There are some that are dirt filthy, stains all over the carpet, funky lighting, curious bedding, etc. I've stayed in several hostels in NYC (cheapest way to travel) and this one was by far the strangest.  It's an old tenement, there are travellers renting rooms and folks who live there permanenly. But that's true about most hostels on the upper west.  Yup, the johns are shared.  I'm a little shocked at the reviews here, how on earth did people did not know this place had shared bathrooms is beyond me (it's posted on their website, on Travelocity, Expedia etc,  it's;3
Stayed at The Jane for Halloween, as I wanted something a little fun and different from The Bowery (sister hotel).  Rooms were spacious, well-equipped but definitely felt a bit 'budget'.  The downsides are no room service, no lifts (and no door man to help you up the stairs with your luggage) and bed is not all that comfortable (no luscious feathery duvet here).  Lighting is low, so not great for doing any work.  It's not the kind of place where you'd want to chill in your room.  I had a nice balcony which was great. On the positive side, the staff were very jolly and helpful.  It is a cool hotel and in a nice quiet residential street.  The bar is amazing and the highlight of the hotel - worth a visit even if you don't stay here.  I realise that it the price reflects the;3
The Empire Hotel is located just across the road from the Lincoln Centre and is a great base for walking around. The staff are excellent and a special mention goes out to Vanessa and Eric who really made the New Years Eve party Rock! The Room was tired and we stayed in room 110 which is right next to air conditioning units which are so loud I had to wear ear plugs. apart from that, cannot fault it!;3
I was in New York for a business trip from Sweden. I stayed at The Empire Hotel many times before but this time I was more than a little angry that there was no dining establishment to eat at.I was early for check in and fortunately, there was a lovely bar in the hotel lobby. It was about 12:45 and the roof deck bar wasn't even open. The lobby bar was delightful with a splendid drink menu. It got very busy at check in so other patrons were pleased that this bar was open too. Comfortable and friendly bar staff.;3
With so many amazing options for places to stay in NYC, this is not a place I would choose to stay again.  Macys is right around the corner, but we were always wanting to be closer to Rockefeller Center or Times Square for shopping and dining. Getting an uber was a big waste of time and money in the winter months when everything we wanted to do was too far to walk in the freezing weather.  The rooms...so tiny! I paid $200 per night for a tiny dated, old room with one QUEEN bed to share.  I have never seen a one bedroom room with a Queen bed, it should have at least had a King.  We had just enough room to walk around the bed, but with our 2 large bags on the floor (the closet was not large enough to lay out one bag) we were very cramped.  There was a tiny window with view of a;3
This hotel has a perfect location but while the price might be acceptable for NewYork, I expected more than I received. I had trouble with the shower and the fan in the room was too noisy. The wood on the bathroom door was pealing and the desk light bulb was burnt out and not changed.;3
My husband and I were transferred to this hotel by Ameritania who we had originally booked with, but they were fully booked. We received complimentary Wifi and breakfast.   The room: The room itself was quite small. It had a fridge and lots of nibbles you could buy, but they were extortionately priced e.g bottle of Evian water 750ml was $8.  Although the AC was powerful it was very noisy, sounding like a tractor at times. The bathroom like the room was small too. It had a shower, but no door to close it so water kind of splashed everywhere.   Breakfast: The complimentary breakfast was lovely. Delicious scrambled eggs with  potatoes. You had the choice of fruit, cereal, yoghurt, breads, pastry and drinks  included tea, coffee and juice.   Location: The location of this hotel is;3
My room had a very bad order and toilet area was not cleaned properly. The hotel staff was amazing but for the price I paid for room, it could have better. I was very disappointed with my room at the Hilton;3
We are just back from 4 nights at The New Yorker.  The location is superb but the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  The staff were friendly enough but the whole hotel needs gutting, I appreciate it is an art deco style hotel and some features in reception are very charming, but it needs totally refurbishing, our room was clean enough but so so dated and I doubt it's been touched since it was built, it felt very old, dreary and depressing.  The worst thing about the hotel was the lifts, we would wait up to 15 minutes morning and evening for lifts down to reception and then back up to our floor again after a day out!  There were at least 3 lifts out of order with no signs informing anyone of this, the queues of people waiting for lifts in the lobby was ridiculous.  This really;3
Stayed here for 5 nights in September 2019.  The room we had was a double queen room so that our daughter could share with us. The beds were definitely not Uk sized queen beds, more like 3/4 doubles. The room was clean and a reasonable size for New York. No fridge, minibar or coffee making facilities though. The hotel has a nice lobby with the Tick Tock diner attached. We used the diner a few times and the food etc was fine, very handy when returning tired after a whole day out sightseeing. There is also an Italian and a steakhouse attached which we didnât try. Check in was quick, the staff member didnât really take much time to talk to us or point out any features of the hotel, just really âhereâs your key and the lifts are over thereâ.  I had contacted them in advance to tell;3
Hotels need refreshening.  I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past two years.  The rooms are getting beat up and the bathroom was miniscule. The desk staff were like robots, but efficient.  Because I like the area (across from Lincoln Center and close to Central Park), I will most likely return....if the rate is decent.;3
Very good bed but nothing special about the room although very large.  Bathroom is fine. It lacks of little attentions: Cups or mugs for coffee instead paper cups and bathrobe would have been nice.  I will not visit this hotel again. Adequate but nothing more.;3
I'm somewhere between admiring and hating how such small rooms were handled at this property. The theme is certainly appropriate and you gotta give points for creativity, I guess. Bottom line is this place is too expensive for what it is. Paid nearly $100 a night for a room that was so small I couldn't lie down in it widthwise if I tried (and I'm short). The mattress on the teeny bed was better than expected although no mattress that small can ever be considered comfortable.  Nice pillows.  Rooms include towels and washcloths (mentioned only because many shared bathroom hotels don't), TV with built-in DVD player, clock/radio (with old iPod dock only), a fan that's good for drowning out some noise, a large mirror on one side of the room and an overhead shelf that runs the length;3
Stayed for two nights during a west coast vacation with my son and husband.  The location itself is great - convenient walk to the park.  The room was comfortably appointed.  Had a corner room with the view of Universal - great way to get excited about our visit.  For the price that we paid (in the mid $400 range per night) I was surprised at a few aspects of the service.  We had requested a roll away bed for our son, which was delivered to the room with a single pillow.  I called the front desk to request three additional pillows as my husband and I each sleep with three pillows, my son with two.  The front desk clerk told me that it was against hotel policy to provide us with more than 1 additional pillow.  When I pushed back politely - she would not budge.  I travel;3
"The Abercorn House is a quite basic hostel in Hammersmith, but with plenty of single rooms, very close to the tube.  I was on the fourth floor, which appeared to be all single/double rooms.  There were two toilet rooms and one shower room.  Toilets were sometimes not left very clean by visitors.  The showers were only just OK; the room was cold and the hot water not very powerful; there was nowhere to store dry clothing (no hook on the door, for example) other than over the top the door (which does not go to the ceiling) â this might be a bit disconcerting as I think the floor was mixed (there were no segregated toilets or showers).    Although there were only 4 showers, the floor had 5 kitchens, each with one or two electric cookers (oven + rings), microwave oven, kettle and in";3
"Stayed here for one night for my Valentines.  We had finished watching Wicked at the Pantages and didn't wanna drive too far home late at night.  Thus, we used this Groupon deal to stay one night.    Parking - If you wanna park in the hotel's parking lot, you have to pay $20/day.  We end up parking on the street for free.  Ridiculous, how that hotel will charge for parking.    Service - Checking-in was simple and the receptionist was nice and courteous.  Though, when it was check-out time, we were running a little behind cause we slept in.  We received a call around 11:15am reminding us check-out time is at 11:00am.  Would have been nice if they offered us a later check-out time or something instead of nicely saying ""get outta here.""    Grounds - The hotel is not in the nicest";3
Location - was great location for the local train to get you around LA but would only recommend to use in the day. It is a few blocks up from the observatory which is a really nice area but the hotels location is not so nice, itâs the only hotel in the area so no tourists only locals and staff from local hospitals. This was not ideal for a family as did not feel safe walking out at night for an meal etcâ¦   Hotel - no facilities available just the swimming pool to the right of the carpark. Bar, restaurant closed so not ideal when not allot in the area for tourists. Staff were friendly enough at the main desk.

"Everything there is in various shades of brown, the reception lounge, the walls, carpets, pictures, furniture, curtains,  fittings,  beds, shower rooms, corridors, mezzanine, even the lifts - I don't actually dislike ""brown"" in its place but everything?  It meant that the small bedroom and shower room we had on the 11th floor looked even smaller.  We had a ""view"" from the window of a brick wall with windows although if I stuck my head out of the window I got a tiny bit of New York between the two brick walls!  We were there during the severe snowstorm at the beginning of the year so while it was freezing outside, our room ""cool air"" thingy wasn't working and even with the window open it was just so hot in the room!  As previously mentioned, the in-room hospitality items were";3
"This hotel is located in quite a central place with easy access to everything through the subway. Rooms are nice and clean. A bit on the expensive side though. We booked with breakfast included and we were really disappointed with it; only a voucher was provided to an in-house place which simply offered a juice glass, coffee or tea and 2 toasts (croissant or bagel) - probably the worst breakfast we have ever had in an hotel.";3
This was our first trip to New York, as we were being checked in at reception I overheard the other receptionist giving a couple of females free wifi in there rooms. So when we were offered it only in the reception I queried it and also received it. So don't be shy ask for it. The hotel could really do with an upgrade. Our room on the 10th floor was quite enough clean and tidy but very compact. The bathrooms were tiny and very little room. The air conditioning unit could do with a change there was no temp gage on it so we either froze and couldn't hear yourself think, or just unplugged it. There is no extracter fan in the bathroom therefore the bedroom got full of steam. The hotel is in a great location with two wonderful eating places across the road The Smith and Cafe;3
I made my reservation, 2 connecting rooms and a dog. Nice rooms, great location. Right next to Universal Studios. Five stars for the hotel. So then I signed up for the HHonors program and was frustrated over and over again. The WiFi is only free if you sign up for the HHonors program AND you remember (write down) your HHonors member number. They make you enter Captcha's constantly, which didn't work, ultimately had to call the Help Desk to link my reservation to my HHonors account. I still can't login online, but the iPhone app is a slightly better experience than on the web. I stayed this weekend and app says I have zero stays logged so far. Technically speaking, they have NO CLUE how to manage their online experience. Zero stars for the online experience. Waste of time!!!;3
We stayed for one night early December - so with that in mind it was ok. The room is small and very hot (better than cold), there is a bathroom with toilet. The bonus was there is a breakfast granted not a huge choice but it does the job. I agree with other travellers it does need some TLC and upgrading it is very tired. However you don't spend your holiday in the hotel - the location was good and we slept well what more do you need for a flying visit.;3
The positives for this hotel, were the location, the comfortable bed and the front desk...the concierge was particularly warm and friendly, though we didn't actually need his services.  The negatives were....The room was very small, even by NY standards.  The air conditioning was barely adequate and very noisy, but my biggest complaint was the shower.  It had a great rain shower head, but the water was only slightly more than a trickle!  Very hard to actually take a shower. This stay was only okay for me...I expected much more.;3
"Location is very good because it is close to the tube station and there is nice part of London all around with some great English pubs, restaurants and shops. On the other hand, the hostel itself is not very comfortable - the rooms, kitchen, bathroom were rather clean, but toilets haven't flush water very good and showers are poor (rather clean but uncomfortable to use), the furniture in rooms was very minimalistic (there was only one chair for two-person room; the bedclothes were clean but old, etc.), although it is worth of notice that there was refrigerator in our room. The common kitchen was clean as wall but also not very nice (no table or chairs). Also wi-fi needs a comment - wi-fi is not included in price and it is not very fast. It is rather peculiar considering that";3
I've stayed there twice. The beds are pretty good, the size of the twin room wasn't bad and the bathrooms and showers were quite clean. The soundproofing of the rooms is very bad, if you're a light sleeper you might find yourself annoyed. They charge for the wifi, which isn't very pleasant. The location is very convenient for tourism in London and it's very close to a tube station. I would go there again.;3
The hotel is very nice. The service needs to be improved. Lack of care and attention. I asked for a wake up call. To no avail. I called to complain. No one picks the phone. Impossible to speak with anyone on the phone. Long lines at the reception. No one seems to care by making more receptionists available. There is a wide discrepancy between the physical condition (4 star) and the human condition (2 star);3
The rooms are very small, bathroom is nicely done and clean but very small,  very friendly and accommodating front desk, great location for visiting family on upper west side. There are many good restaurants nearby.;3
"This property was chosen by my employer based on its proximity to our event at Jazz at Lincoln Center.  The hotel was very convenient.  I was able to make several runs back to the hotel without the hassle of catching a cab.  There were plenty of restaurants close by as well as a drug store.  The hotel was very dark in general.  The worse part of the hotel was the gym.  The plaster was literally falling from the ceiling.  the basement level where the gym was housed was extremely dark, scary and smelled of mildew.  The elevators got stuck quite a few times as well.  My room had a ""view"" of a brick wall.";3
If you are visiting Universal Studios and I would recommend the VIP tour there, then the Hilton is a short 5-10 minute walk away. The rooms are large, but the only word I can think of is grotty and the place has a run down feel to it. Insects in the room, including mosquitos drove me mad on the first night. Room service is quick and reasonable. Overall impression is ok, but not great.;3
It is an old hotel and it is not very comfortable. But I was having such a great time in New York, that I didn't mind. For me the hotel was just to get some rest. I also had a great deal on the room rate. The hotel is close to the subway station, which helped me a lot, and also near to the Central Park.;3
The Empire hotel has several good points, but the standard of service lets it down. It's location is a great one, just across the road from the Lincoln Centre and a short walk to Columbus Circle. Check in was ok if a bit slow considering there were four staff on reception. The hotel is atmospheric due to the style of its decor and dim lighting, but I found my room unsatisfactory in several respects. If noise can prevent you from sleeping, I'd advise you to ask for a room facing out front. My room looked out on the inner hotel walls, and was very noisy due to loud air conditioning equipment. Were it not for the trusty ear plugs I always bring on holidays, I wouldn't have slept a wink. The bathroom was small and pokey, with no bin and a box of tissues that was almost empty. I had;3
The location made this place a gem of a hotel at a great price! Close to the subway, Central Park and all the museums!! And it's really quiet compared to other places we have stayed downtown! The first 2 nights we stayed in a renovated room and then had to move as we wanted to stay 2 more nites to an OLD room...it's an old hotel, needing some love, is all I will say. Just make sure to allow extra time for exiting the building as the elevator is small and you can wait 3-4 trips to get down to the lobby from your floor.;3
This Hostel was quite good, pendent of your depozit. There was realy clean room , shower , and kitchen. As a deficit i saw share shower, and toilet, so there are not privacy. Hostl is situated in good location about 25 minutes to London center. The Hammersmith location is well qaurter, but little noisy. In total i rate Abercorn like good, average hostel.;3
As early reviewer stated, don't listen to THE WHINERS!  I've stayed at this hotel two times and the second time for over three weeks.  No, its not your $300 a night hotel, but my room was clean the availbility of the shared restrooms was fine.  I didn't have to wait for anyone.  Most people just don't understand the concept of NYC hotels.  Most hotels under $200 a night have shared restrooms. If you want an expensive hotel then be ready to spend it, but if you're in the city to see the sights, shop and enjoy the nightlife then stay here.    NO, not all the shared bathroom hotels are clean as this one, but I'm a very picky person and I wasn't grossed out at all here.   Don't stay at the West Side INN next door that was gross!!;3
We chose this Hotel because of its location near a Metro station and the price. Having read previous reviews we were aware of the locale. Whilst there were some vagrants around they were not threatening. We were unable to find any reasonable eateries locally although that was not too much of an issue as we used the metro which was relatively inexpensive to travel up to Hollywood Boulevard where there was plenty of choice. We also used the Metro to go to Downtown.  The  Courtyard was very nice and the pool area was really well done although with all our site seeing unfortunately we did not have time to use either. Our room was perfectly acceptable although the electrical connections were a bit iffy with the sockets having to be wiggled around to make a good connection. The only;3
"Perfect location (was attending a conference at Alice Tully Hall). Very nice staff and kind of funky lobby. Room tiny. No space for your laptop (there's all kind of junk you don't need - like a Kurig coffee thing -  on the tiny desk). They charge for in-room wifi. My shower was HORRIBLE. Only has a partial door so cold air hits you, and then the ""rain"" style shower head just barely dripped tepid water on me. Really the only major drawback was that shower. Everything else was pleasant enough (good rm service omlette) and in a great location.";3
The front desk staff were outstanding.  I selected this hotel as we were arriving by a late train, and the hotel was close to Penn Station.  The rooms were tiny, but the prices were reasonable for New York.  The front desk staff were warm, welcoming, and friendly - after midnight.  The rooms are small, but definitely adequate.  The bathroom had a small patch that was either mold or green paint that had been inadequately painted over with white paint.  Otherwise, it was a good experience made unforgettable by the outstanding staff.;3
Stayed here for 4 nights, good location with easy subway access, nearby Penn station made it an easy journey from Newark airport. We were able to get our room early which was great as we'd had a long journey from London. High resort fees are not justified by erratic WiFi and $2 charge per item to leave your luggage. Rooms were very small and poky, we had a double double and there was very little room left with 2 suitcases etc, had to do the ironing in the bathroom as the ironing board would not fit in the bedroom! Although it being New York we didn't spend much time in the room. The bathroom was small was a bit grubby although clean towels were provided daily. The 24/7 diner was great for breakfast and late night snacks when needed. So great location for seeing the sites but;3
The hotel is in a great location close to Central Park, The Lincoln Center and subway stops. However we were charged $6.70 for a bottle of water we used in our room and you have to pay to get Wifi access so take that into consideration if staying here. Rooms were clean and staff were friendly.;3
Bath room had a column in front of the mirror which made the bathroom very uncomfortable and hard to use the mirror.  Shower needs maintenance. Lots of dry rot. Sink did not drain well. Location of hotel was great. Rooms are small.;3
but not enough staff on during the day for the star rating, but looks great.  the roof bar is good, but a bit of a pick up joint after work.  pool closed when I went, but had not said so on the website even on the days I was there;3
Average Hotel, You have what you need, nothing more.   Stayed: June 14th -  16th 2014  Pros: -Late check in  -Awesome Location (steps from restaurants, subway, central park) -7 min subway ride to Times Square  Cons:  Don't come with high expectations, this hotel has mostly what's needed ie: private wash room, bed, tv, air conditioning, sometimes functional wifi or elevator and nice enough staff and no parking.  I would recommend this hotel because of the location.;3
We stayed at the Hilton so we could go to Universal Studios.  They make is difficult to check in early, even when requested in advance and are lacking in letting you know there will be a fee.  The hotel is also going through some renovations so expect some issues.  The air in our room did not work and we had to have an engineer come to fix the problem. The room was so hot it was uninhabitable for the majority of the day.  The folks working the check in desk seemed irritated the day we checked in.  This hotel is right next to the park but next time we will stay at the Sheraton again where there are no issues with early check in and the rooms and hotel are just as nice.  It's just a few steps further to get to the park or City Walk and they offer much more hospitable service.;3
I had such a strange experience at the Jane.  On the one hand - I encountered some very courteous staff members, the cafe was great, super clean bathrooms and the location was ideal.  Really.  So many good things. Then - there's the other hand.  Bedbugs.  I understand there's an epidemic in NYC right now.  (I saw the billboards.)  But I would feel remiss in not letting people know ahead of time.  After I discovered the problem, the room they moved me to for my remaining night was immaculate.  FIne.  But, again, I just have to let you know.  Keep your eyes peeled and your fingers crossed for one of the clean rooms.;3
Very convenient to Universal Studios Hollywood - right across the street.  They have a shuttle but it is only a five - ten minute walk. Room was clean and comfortable but they really ding you for things that are either free or much cheaper at other hotels.  You need to be a member of Hilton Honors program to get the Wi-Fi otherwise you pay for it.   Self parking is $28.00 a day - wow!  Restaurant prices are sky high.  Would not stay here again.;3
First impressions of this place were not good, in fact very worrying. The hotel is a maze of corridors, the sort you would never escape from in a fire, but luckily we were on the ground floor.  On the plus side: Our double room was adequate size, and was fine when all we were looking for was a bed to sleep in at night, and we received fresh towels every day. The shared bathroom on our floor had just been refurbished, and the machine on our floor sold Reeses peanut buttercups, and the walls were quite thick so we could make love all night without waking the neighbours.  If you're looking for a cheap place to stay, stay here. Just dont ask for a safety deposit box.;3
We were recommended this property from our travel agent and a brief google search gave us some optimism. It was a 4-star hotel, in a great location, so what could go wrong?  We were prepared for the $35 city tax, per room, per night, so that wasn't a shock to us. The rooms are very small, and outdated. Coming from London, we are used to some small hotel rooms, but this was beyond belief, once you had your suitcase and other belongings in the room, you had no moving space. The hallways are a dirty brown colour, and they look like they have not been updated for 20/30 years.   The location is great, you are right next to Madison Square Garden's, Penn Station and a host of other places. It is pretty easy for you to get around new york with Cabs, Uber's and the Subway.   We were;3
Well when we walked into reception it is beautiful looking. Everyone, well nearly, were friendly. We got called to a separate desk to check in. He said it was too early. We knew this anyway but wanted to leave our cases to wander. Didn't get the man's name but he was quite rude. I said have we got a view, I'm excited about this holiday. He said we'll obviously not because you didn't pay for one. I was tired couldn't be bothered to argue. Came back to reception later, forgot the lady's name, but she was lovely. She said she had given us a nice room on the 8th floor. I sound ungrateful but I would of liked a high floor. View of empire state, but through a very dirty window. Slightly disappointed. Didn't want to feel like this on my special birthday. Unpacked. Very comfy bed and;3
This hotel has so much potential, and many things about it are very good, but many things about it are not. I stayed here in late August to move my sister in to college across the street at Fordham. The lady who checked me in was rude and very short with me. I should mention that I work in an actual Forbes rated four star hotel in LA and there is no need to be anything short of lovely to a guest. Beyond that the lobby looks like it was decorated by the same people who decorated the Cheesecake Factory. It's like, I get it, you spent money, but why did you spend it this way? The shower doors were weird. It is set up like a conventional sliding glass door but instead of them both sliding, one is permanently fixed and the other is just not there... but the tracks and wheels are. I;3
Hotel is in a perfect location just around the corner from madison sq gardens and 10 min walk from towns square. Room are clean but in need of modernising. Staff are always friendly. Rooms can be quite noisy but I have always found this in whatever hotel I stay in in NYC. Good wifi. Beds are comfy.;3
I arrived before check in and was greeted un-enthusiastically by the guest services agent at the time and then was pointed in a general direction which I assume to be towards the bellman who then left the bags on the trolley in the middle of the lobby and went to do other things... I am not normally paranoid with things like this but there were large groups etc and anyone could really just take my backpack or luggage.   Jeff the bellman however was superb, he was such a help with directions and suggestions and even ordering us a ride to the airport etc. he definitely turned around the experience. Unfortunately, Jeff was not there when we were leaving and the bellman at the time insisted on receiving a tip for opening the door for me and was quite rude when I apologised for not;3
It is average at best as far as the hotel service. No one person stood out as going above or beyond their job. Guest rooms are average. Nothing special. Amenities are also average at best. Fitness Center was adequate and clean, but fairly small. The elevators are in the process of a MUCH NEEDED upgrade, and are very slow. Letters in the rooms acknowledge the issues and concerns with elevators and request guests to plan accordingly. Very much in need of lobby and restaurant upgrades and updates. It is old and worn. Location is perfect for Universal Studios, but that is about it. Not near much else. Be aware there are additional charges for EVERYTHING, from WiFi to Microwaves to self parking. It is not an inexpensive hotel. Value for the rate paid was at best average. Would stay;3
This hotel has good prices, but you have to fit in a small cabin, where you just lay your body on the bed and put your luggage beside you. My room was extremely small, but the biggest problem was that it was so hot during the night (July) and when I turned on the vent it was so noisy I couldn't sleep. Even though, I would come to this hotel again, but probably not during the summer :) Why? It has a very nice location just few meters from the Hudson river. The hotel staff is very friendly, helpful and the atmosphere in the hotel is very welcoming. I used also their bikes, which are for the hotel guests available free of charge, but bikes are not in a very good condition, so you better be careful while using them. Anyway, I have enjoyed a short ride by the Hudson river.;3
Absolutely great location very central, needs more than a lick of paint. Reminds me slightly of the Tower of terror at Disney. If you're getting a good price then stay here, staff are friendly, just really could do with a full make over.;3
Helpful staff from check in and quite convenient expedited check out. Also doorman was helpful when we're considering transportation options. Small room though at its price and bathroom had limited toiletries.  There was also limited power supply;3
Our room was small and the bedroom portion was nicely decorated. The bathroom looked like something from the 40's but it did the job and we had hot water. It was quiet and the elevators were fast. The location is excellent. Walking distance to Broadway, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Times Square and other subway stations. We were charged a daily fee of $30 US for phone, internet and fitness room. This fee was a surprise and was not optional. The safe did not work, but someone came up to fix it.;3
Truly in the heart of it all. And you're paying for it, but if you want all the amenities of an expensive hotel, this one is not the one for you - unless you want to roll out of bed into Lincoln Center, in which case there is not other place like it.;3
Pictures look great but its actually a bit shabby. We had to be moved rooms twice due to loud plumbing but we did finally get a really nice room. 75% of the staff are nice the rest don't really listen to you and talk over you..... concierge was incredibly rude! Pool was closed which was disappointing as it was one of the main reasons i booked it. The bar was nice but incredible expensive even for NYC prices.   Wasn't a bad stay but it wasn't great, NYC must have better options than this. Great location though;3
My wife and I stayed here while visiting LA and it's a very pretty hotel, but park your own car is $28/day, room is over $350/night, dinner Buffett for two is $110, a drink is between $10-$15. Next door at Sheraton is about 2/3 as much. Won't make that mistake again;3
the first room we were assigned wasn't clean and they promptly switched our room. The second room was clean and perfect for a quick stay in the heart of New York City. I would surely stay there again if I had to stay in Manhattan particularly at the Manager's special rate offered on the hotel website. the parking garage was a couple of blocks away and offered a special $35 nightly rate for hotel guests. A good deal all around;3
When you walk in its beautiful lobby friendly staff..  Check in early great so far, room on 34th floor not bad look around small but nice.. Go into the bathroom this is what I founded gross.. Got my room change upgrade even now I have a view great right.. This what I found.. The first three pictures are from my first room, the second is the upgraded one, beautiful bathroom a little small but nice heated floors and all.. But the staff is very nice;3
The staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful, however the interior when leaving the nicely presented reception soon shown an outdated appearance. This hotel could do with a makeover and even the facility charge is essential to their services which I find is ridiculous that we had to pay for âfacilitiesâ we didnât even use! It was a nicely situated hotel within New York, the Empire State Building just up the street and Madison Square Garden just opposite. Even Central Park is just a 30 minute walk away. The room was small, queen room I might add, it was noisy with no coffee or tea making facilities! (Room 2553) - It was okay but I felt a little disappointed. There is a diner attached to the hotel called Tick Tock which is open 24/7 which is accommodating and do bare in mind if;3
I have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Empire Hotel and overall I have to say that there are great things about the hotel, but the main thing being the room was a bit of a let down.  When we arrived, the hotel reception area looks great, the reception staff were great and it all looked amazing.  The room was on the 2nd floor and facing the front with 2 double beds.  I shared the room with a friend and was on the bed next to the window, as the windows seem to be able to open the most awful cold draft would come in at night and I assume for the same reason, a LOT of noise. On one occasion I was awaking to a very loud bang at about 3-4am, god knows what it was.  The above are the only negatives I can think of with this hotel.  The location is amazing as it is a 15 minute;3
First, the good: great location, and, once the various problems were solved, generally pleasant. Also, comfortable bed, and nice decor (though the wallpaper is peeling)  Now the bad: 1) Although I called the night before to make absolutely sure the room had the kind of facilities I needed for the shower and was assured that it did, it did not. This meant a complex negotiation to get the right room, and negated the whole purpose of reserving for an early arrival. While the hotel did compensate for the problem, it ruined our first day.  2) The second room had incredibly loud knocking in the radiators. They fixed it, but by then we were on day 3. They need to do regular maintenance.  3) No exhaust fan and no night light in the bathroom.  4) Noise from the street - not terrible, but;3
Just stayed at the Hilton Universal City 16 February 2013.  It was an overnight and the location was convenient to a social event we were attending in the Hollywood area.  We chose the Hilton based on location and access to HWY 101.  We have stayed at this location before and never had any issues - BIG MISTAKE THIS TIME!! Since it was President's Day Weekend, the place was overrun with kids and RUDE people.   We pulled up to the valet and I looked for a garbage can to toss my road snack papers.  Umm not single garbage can in sight.  When I asked the valet where to find one, he pointed across the parking area to a can about 50 yards away.  Mind you I am NOT a jerk but that is stupid.  I looked around the entry way of the hotel and not a single garbage can.  I looked in the lobby;3
We arrived Sunday 1/26/20. Poor check in experience. Our flight & Lyft has us at the hotel by 1:50. We were told to sit and wait until at least 2:30. We checked a couple of times after and still had to wait as the âJr. suiteâ room we had booked wasnât ready yet.. After 3pm we checked and was told it would be another couple of hours, or they could put us into a newly renovated room âfor no additional chargeâ  Around 3:45 we finally got into room 209. The room A/C didnât work. When we called the front desk to complain they told us it was part of their  âgreen Initiative â We had to sleep with the balcony door open to cool down the room to our comfort level. Then, at least twice during our stay we had to close it as somebody was smoking outside and the smell was coming into our;3
I had read reviews after we booked this hotel so I was not taken by surprise when we arrived.  The elevator is, indeed, only big enough to accomodate two people with one large piece of luggage each.  Our room was the smallest I have ever slept in.  Someone commented that they could only open one suitcase at a time.  Unless you put them on the bed, that's true.  There was barely enough room to walk around the bed.  The t.v. was within reaching distance of the foot of the bed and it was a model I haven't seen in years.     That being said, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was also clean although the shower enclosure was a bit odd.  A large pane of glass (or plexi) that extended half way down the tub leaving the other half open.  It meant strategically;3
Sorry, this place is almost great.  The no shower doors and antiquated heat and air is not good.  Location is great.   It's loud in NY but it is what it is.  Its a bummer so many people still smoke.  Lots of conveninces;3
Perfect location for transport being close to Penn Station for airport and subway connections . Appreciated the history of the hotel, the basement museum was well done. Staff were welcoming and helpful, Five stars  to housekeeping staff, who were super pleasant..Room too small to fit luggage and clothes for two for a three week trip [stayed six nights at start of trip) not enough storage space, hangers etc, Added amenity charges annoying - if i have no use for a gym or an office why should this be added to the bill?;3
Recently visited New york and chose this hotel due to its proximity to central park which indeed a great location to stay in Manhattan. I did my booking through a third party for bed and breakfast and found the bed very much there except breakfast. The hotel staff informed me that they don't have any in house restaurant, in fact they have outsourced their terrace restaurant to another vendor who runs his business there. I had to pay every time I ate there despite paying for it already while booking.Talking about amenities, my room was clean though Bathspace and WC were very small. I think they are slightly overpriced for what they offer.;3
Typical Hilton in format, but three major issues:  1 The lifts are undergoing replacement and the wait to get to/from the lobby averaged 15 minutes. Just too many people for the remaining working lifts  2 The breakfast was appalling - the worst ever experienced in a Hilton. Very bland buffet served in a cold bar environment. It is as though no thought was given to providing catering services until the hotel had been  built  3 The bar was the most unwelcoming, cold, uncomfortable area I have ever seen in a hotel other than perhaps found in a small chain motel.  So OK, but don't eat or drink here and give yourselves plenty of time to arrive/leave the room;3
The hostel is located really close to Hammersmith underground station, the position is excellent to get to city centre. Since accomodotion in London are so dear, this one is not so bad being quite cheap, but staff is very very rude, and you can just pay in cash, which, in 2013, is pretty unusual..;3
Forget everything you know about 'tiny' - the Jane's rooms redefine the meaning of 'tiny'. Well here's the breakdown: The location is superb.The Jane's reception is gorgeous, the service is great, the bar as well. The room is very clean and has everything you need. Except space. It's really REALLY tiny. And at $115 a night a bit too pricy.;3
We stayed 4 nights at this hotel first week of December.  I donât have anything to complain about. Rooms was clean, free wifi, very quit a night and the best thing â only 1 min walk from Grand Street Subway that has excellent connection both up- and down town.  However didnât expect the hotel to e in the middle of China town and if I ever come to NY again I will look for a hotel where I get more value for money.;3
Great location. Less than average hotel. Not hot water, no water pressure. Booked room through travel agent, and the reservation was messed up on their end. Front desk service was only so-so. Have been using the hotel several times a year for business travel, and will likely start looking around for something new.;3
After swearing the place off for a few years, I decided to give it another try.  The service was much better. The rooms are small, but if you just need a convenient and comfortable place for a couple days it's fine.   I had booked the hotel through a travel site and paid in advance - I like to have the room charges and taxes out of the way before any of my trips. I arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or I could pay a $50 fee and they'd put me in a room early.  I've not seen hat option in a long time. I decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as I had places to go and things to do.   The morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door. I expected the $50 plus tax for the early check in I did not expect an additional;3
Hotel lovely and very convenient for Times Square, Central Park, etc.  Staff were very helpful.  Unfortunately we got very little sleep due to the road noise.  It's on a corner with two very busy roads outside.  We were only there for one night, otherwise we would have asked to be moved to a quieter room (if they exist?) or moved hotels.  It's a shame, because the hotel itself seemed lovely but I guess there is little they can do about the road noise - if you want the good location you have to put up with the noise!;3
WIFI does not work even after working the the tech staff. Roudy crowd stays here Conceirge and bell staff excellent Has changed from a boutique hotel to just a hotel. Errors on the bill--charges from bar when I wasn't even registered at the hotel.....;3
I booked this last year for World Pride. We arrive at 3pm and go to the Wyndham rewards desk to check in since I'm Diamond.  Get to the front and get told we have no rooms ready. I will swipe your card and you can check with the front desk later.  I replied that's fine but I'm not leaving this seat until you find us a room.  Magically I had a choice of 5 rooms!   Our room was upgraded good size room for NYC . The location is perfect! Subway right here and Macys for shopping.  Wyndham Diamond benefits - upgraded room, no resort fees and offered late check out.  This would of been 5 stars except for the check in process.;3
drinking water is not made available to guest unless it is paid for. and the staff do not provide complementary water. and I saw one of the staff members offer some to a guest that was checking in before my husband and me. and the water in the room cost 3 to 7 dollars a bottle and we had already paid over $1000 for the room. never has this happen with any other hotel we have stayed during our vacationing and never again.;3
Wow, I haven't felt this controversial in a while...it seemed whenever there was a pro, there was also a con to outweigh it.  I would have given three and a half points if I could have, but settled for the lesser score. It's always nicer to be positively surprised than negatively. Since it is a huge hotel, it was not surprising that there were tons of people checking in at the same time I wanted to. Fair point. However, the check-in also felt like a mass-market procedure and I didn't feel welcomed at all. The room wasn't ready until 4pm. which was an additional challenge after an 8h flight. I just wanted a shower and lie down for a bit, but that wasn't possible.  The room was big enough, so I was very pleased with that. I even had a little balcony! The shower however turned out;3
Would recommend this Hotel for how central it is and the staff are pleasant and helpful other than the adjoining cafe/bar where the blond Lady behind the bar doesn't like her job or people!. The rooms are not big but more than OK and the facilities are clean. Is short other than just one miserable/rude member of staff behind the bar and the unexpected surcharge for facility's advised on their website with no reference to extra fees and the are we had no need or use of them somewhat goes against this Hotel is GREAT;3
It's tough to find a reasonably priced hotel in Manhatten. We had an appointment and we found a good price for this hotel. We used google street view to check out the neighborhood before booking. It is semi-residential, and near the subway entrance. When I pulled up to try and check-in and verify where parking was, the doorman was rude and ignored me, but the desk clerk was very friendly and helpful, and the doorman was 100% better  after we had checked in. There were plenty of good restaurants around the corner, and a drug store next door. The Thalia theater and Symphony Space are just around the corner on Broadway, and we caught a nice open night for artists. The room was small with no view, and could really use a couple shelves or small tables. The heat is from an old;3
After many Covid related cancelations of LA trips and stays at this hotel over the last year or so, we were finally able experience the offering.  We reserved a King Room a couple weeks ago choosing to use a free night award in the World of Hyatt program.  We checked in using the App near the beginning of the window.  We flew to LAX from JFK, and spent an hour on the tarmac awaiting a gate.  Finally arriving at the Check-in counter after midnight. The agent was warm and professional, recognizing our loyalty.  Unlike most other hotels though, this property does not seem to pre-allocate rooms/upgrades for even the Globalist member level-so if you, like us, are one of the very last reservations to present for the evening, you may not receive a room upgrade. Our room while on the 3d;3
Basic hotel. No catering on site but diners on street for breakfast. Clean air con room with impecvable bed and bathroom linen and towels etc. Hot water hard to find first morning but ok after. Quiet surroundings. Subway 100yds away mainline 1 for straight run down to Broadway and Battery park. 2 blocks to Central park and pleasant walk to midtown. Purpose served. Pleasant staff at reception and service.;3
Nice hotel, little rooms, a bit expensive, but great location. there is free coffee and tea in the mornings. A mention to Jeff the buttons of the hotel, thanks for all your advices and for being so polite with us;3
There in December 2003 for six nights and paid about $75 a night. Hotel is passed it's glory days but room was clean, comfortable (great mattress) and quiet. Heating on first night was too hot but ok for rest of stay. Plenty of good cheap places to eat close by. Subway entrance across the road. Staff are indifferent except for Ron? the porter who is world class. Perfect for a budget stay in New York.;3
Tried to charge $5 for cork screw by room service which was not in room! Sent me down to bar which did not have extra cork screws. After complaining to front desk I was given a free cork screw but what a hassle! Housekeeping needs more customer service training! Spent over $400 + and they want to charge me $5 for a cork screw?!?!!;3
"We were very disappointed with the lobby bar restaurant.  Food was served cold (Tortilla soup) .  My daughters waited for a half hour to get their drinks.   We told the waiter about the drinks about 15 minutes in - still no luck.   My daughter walked up to the bar to ask again (this was about 30 minutes in).   The bartender responded to her with a tone ""We're busy."" There were three bartenders on that night and plenty of tables and people at the bar were getting served in a timely manner.   I should have went and addressed his rudeness that evening but we were on our last night of vacation.  I honestly still can't believe his response and attitude after waiting for 30 minutes for a drink.   I still don't feel comfortable paying for that dinner.    Never been treated with such an";3
My husband and I decided to book two hotels in NY: the first one we booked (and stayed) was quite near the Times Square. (We were satisfied with that one, too.) We wanted our second hotel to be in lower Manhattan because the tour agency which took us to Washington DC would drop us off near Chinatown. The Windsor Hotel seemed to be a good choice with its reasonable price and available rooms. The Windsor Hotel is in Chinatown and one block away from Little Italy. Itâs close to subway stations, and a variety of restaurants. We enjoyed several restaurants (Malaysian, Vietnamese, Chinese and Italian.) It's within walking distance to Soho, Wall Street and the Financial District. (We are in our early forties and like walking.) Our room was clean and bigger than the one in the other;3
If youâre looking for a reasonably priced hotel close to public transport and within easy reach of the main Los Angeles attractions by Underground Metro or Bus â this is the hotel for you.  A five minute walk from the hotel takes you to the Metro Red Line and a number of bus stops â meaning Universal Studios, the Walk of Fame, Downtown LA and set-off points for Beverly Hills tours are all less than 30 minutes away. The hotel staff wonât tell you this â but they will sell you expensive, time-constrained tours to your desired destinations.  The Hollywood Hotel (formally a Ramada) boasts that its âan ultramodern Hollywood Hotel is 21st century living at its finest. Decorated with luxuriant European designs and laden with cutting edge technology.â This might have been true five;3
Stayed with my wife over Christmas. Great location, could not fault it. Easy walk to subway stations, central park and times square.   Good sized room, we were on the 12th floor, street facing corner. However view was undesirable, looking down onto neighbouring roofs and water towers.  The room was always very hot, even when you set the aircon to cool and the temperature all the way down. One of the windows wouldn't stay open and we had to prop open with a book to try and cool the room down.  The hotel itself is a bit run down, badly fitted windows and you can tell they have cut corners on a recent update, especially in the bathrooms. We had plumbing issues with the sink, after use it would need 15 minutes to drain for simple tasks like washing hands.  The beds were comfortable;3
We are a family of 5 and spent 6 nights at The Hollywood - the staff and the amenities were great - however we reserved a car with Advantage Cars 4 days prior to needing it to drive to Vegas.  On the Day we were supposed to get it the young man informed us he had let our car out - I understand accidents happen but this young man wouldn't do anything to even try to rectify the problem and being Easter Sunday all local car rentals were closed so we had to catch the subway and the bus to LAX to rent a car - this man was extremely arrogant and rude. I would have given Hotel Hollywood 5 stars if it wasn't for Advantage!;3
Having read previous reviews which I take seriously, I looked forward to getting to this hotel after nearly a 3 year wait and was celebrating my birthday whilst there and my wife was belatedly celebrating her 60th and the hotel knew this as it was mentioned on the booking, Previous users have extollled the virtues of the check in staff and their willingness to offer free upgrades NO such luck for us We were then allocated a room on the 21st floor which we didn't realise at that time would mean a terrible wait most of the time for elevators. The elevators on the right serve floors 20 to 40 and are so busy. whereas floors up to 20 use elevators on the left which seemed to hardly be used. The rooms were old and dated and did not seem to reflect the glossy look on the website. Also;3
The location of the hotel and the lobby are the positives of this warn out tired establishment.   Elevators creeky, rooms with oppressive heat (I was one of a group of 8 staying for 3 nights and all concurred on this problem.), Rooms clean and attractive but the limited space on the desk and the frig is taken up by the items for sale ($78 for a bottle of wine!!!);3
We booked this hotel through Priceline thinking that it was a great deal. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel. I arrived extremely early that day so I left my suitcase and proceeded to give my information to the hotel clerk. I asked her if she could provide us with a room with a view and told her that the highest the floor the better thinking that it would be a better option. I was so wrong! First, let me tell you that while she took my information she started complaining to her coworker how difficult her job was and how it was to accommodate all the guests that have the same type of the request because apparently everyone wants a view...I politely asked her to do the best that she can as I was going to check in later in the day and maybe a good room would be available by that;3
I am so disappointed that this property charged to hold bags after our checkout and until our pickup for our departure from the city.Â  That $5 pushed me over the edge and I will be leaving negative reviews on Google and Trip Advisor.  I booked a queen view room.Â  There was no scenic view of NY as promised in your website. The view in 3340 was of the guests in the rooms across from us, we were in the armpit of the corner.Â  The room size is misrepresented in the pictures on the website, and the room was so cramped that i hit my knee on the heater every time i attempted to exit the bed and maneuver my way around the heat unit to the bathroom.   and of course, there were no amenities such as complimentary coffee in the room or lobby.  If i were staying for more than one night, i;3
We picked this hotel because of its location close the Universal studios and because the parking was only 17 dollars a day. LA is so big itâs hard to know where to stay for a first visit. The hotel itself is ok, easy to find and in a good location. Universal city is 3 mins walk away with lots of shops and restaurants. Or you can walk down the hill and under the bridge to a fantastic pizza place with singing waiters! The room was spacious and clean with a great view of the city. We were on the 21st floor. However it was very noisy, we could hear the man next door blowing his nose for example. There appeared to be no sound proofing between the rooms. We went for the continental breakfast, which was ok, but there was very little choice and not a lot for the health conscious. They;3
Booked by our travel agent, we were looking forward to our stay. On arrival we asked if we could have a room with a view, but were given a very small room overlooking a utility area with window cleaning gantry, and no view of the city. Just one dressing gown, blocked sink requiring replacement, and very thin walls so disturbed by adjoining bathrooms. Quite glad to check out.;3
We travelled to New York for 6 nights to meet our daughter from Australia. we chose the hotel as we had stayed there before and because of it's central location, This time however they put us in a small double room at the end of the floor corridor. it was not clean also for the length of stay no facility to hang up your clothes.On complaining to the desk we were told that it would cost $500 to change rooms , On saying that it was not acceptable and that we would find another hotel, a room much better was offered at no extra charge. Why didn't they just move us before all the fuss.Also the hotel was not ideal for a xmas visit as they have a policy of no decorations for xmas;3
First impressions: We could barely fit our 3 cases in our first room and open the door, the room is tiny. Can almost touch the window, bathroom door and main door from the bed! A view of another building through the window. And beware if booking online as you may not be aware they add on $29+tax a day resort charge for no real reason.   The bed creaked badly, the pillows were not comfortable. There is no water or tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel!   It's Art Deco, so old fashioned and original. if Art Deco is your thing as the lobby is a nice example, as are the fixtures and fittings. Otherwise find somewhere further out and save your money. The previous night was spent at a hotel overlooking the Central Park and this cost half the;3
Old fashioned building.  Checked in early. Room small, not updated recently, but clean. Comfortable bed.  Staff gave me choice to wait and get a larger room, but i took first option.  Window air conditioner worked well and not noisy.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  No restaurant in hotel, but one just half a block away gives discount for breakfast.  I stay here because a friend lives close by, making the location excellent for me.  Very close to local and express subway making it easy to get around town.  Less than 15 minutes travel to 42nd St.;3
it is a normal hotel of new york.  Small rooms, but the beds are enormous and comfortable. the position is strategic because near to the metro and in front of central park. I have slept in this hotel for 5 nights, in a very cold period and unfortunately there was a problem to the heating the last 2 nights. the laborer is kind and helpfull.;3
A few friends and I stayed at the Ramada for 3 nights. The neighbourhood isnt bad at all apart from a few homeless people. Our room was excellent very clean, beds were comfortable, we had a fridge and microwave. Although we didnt spend a lot of time at the hotel it was perfect for our needs, its great location for getting to La Dogers stadium, and also Staples center, its about 10 minute drive to the kodak theatre.  The breakfast was standard as well, cereals, toast, etc. Overall i would recommend the ramada inn.;3
Let's start with the good: shared facilities were always kept very clean. Location was great for Highline, Greenwich Village and not too far from underground. Bad: bunk rooms were so tiny our cases took all floor space, aircon was noisy and the room v stuffy without it on. Felt very claustrophobic.;3
"I had a private room for two persons with shared shower and toilet on the corridor (all were clean; unfortunately not all showers had hooks for clothes). The room was basic and clean (expect for some stains on the wall). The beds were ok and a towel was provided. There was a small table with chair, a cupboard with a mirror and a medium sized fridge. Also for each person there was a plate and crockery. Perfect to get some food from the many take away restaurants in the neighborhood or drink a beer after the bars are closed (almost after dinner in UK). The metro is on 5 minutes walk from the hostel. Especially it is a convenient if you want to see a match of QPR or Fullham or  a concert at the eventim arena. There is a Belushis bar which closes at 2:00 during weekends, so you do";3
We stayed here for 3 nights while apartment hunting on the Upper West Side, and had no problems whatsoever.  It had pretty much what we wanted and expected in a hotel. The room was large enough for two people not to feel too cramped, there's free (but slow) wireless, they were happy to receive a fax for us, check-in and check-out were fast, bathrooms and linens were clean and everyone was professional.  On the 11th floor where we were, street noise was minimal.  The location is fantastic, just a few steps to a subway stop, and you can easily walk to lots of tasty restaurants and cafes in a variety of price ranges.  Of course, you're not paying a super-high price, so you should have some realistic expectations.  There was some grunginess where the carpet was coming off the floor;3
The hotel staff when we checked in were very friendly and helpful, once checked in they couldn't care less if there was a problem.   None of the drink machines worked and when they did work they took your money, then the Hotel staff said we had to talk to the manager in the morning, no good when you wanted some water at night!   Also the ATM at the hotel wasn't working and when it was fixed only lasted 1 day before being out of order again!! Rooms were a good size, close to pretty much all things in LA, but staff were not helpful at all!  Also much cheaper to catch the Metro to Universal Studios only $5 compared to the $79 dollars they wanted to charge from the Hotel!;3
Stayed at the Empire for 7 nights on my Honeymoon two weeks ago. Overall we enjoyed our stay although I was disappointed that the hotel did nothing to make our stay extra special despite being aware it was our Honeymoon, I don't necessarily mean a free upgrade but just something to show they appreciated us choosing the Empire for such an important holiday! Apart from a half-hearted congratulations for the front desk on check -in the hotel did nothing else.  We picked the Empire after lots of research and heard that they treated you really well but we did not fell that while we were there.   Also, we were given a front facing room with a great view of the Lincoln Center but were not informed that there was road works going on in front of the hotel and were awoken at 7am every;3
Staff was very nice.Upon checkin we were told I had a second reservation however, it could not be found which 3rd party company. With that,  they offered an upgrade to a King Suite very spacious in compared to most hotels in Manhattan. After spending about 45 in the upgraded suite we noticed the air conditioning wasnât working and it was very uncomfortable in the room. Maintenance guy said it was shot and they changed our room however, no more King Suites .. we were not happy but the Queen room did have air which was better. My husband complained some and they gave us each a drink voucher for our inconvenience. Over all the place is nice close to subway and Central Park. Quiet part of the city and away from the touristy areas. The lobby is really pretty and the bartenders are;3
Empire hotel has a very good situation, close to Central Park and Columbus Circle. You can go walking to main places in New York like Times Square, MOMA or Metropolitan. We were one week and we were very comfortable. We had the subway very close, and directly connected with downtown Manhattan. The worse of our visit is WIFI system, it doesn't work very well and you must pay for it in your rooms.;3
Great location next to Penn station and Madison square Garden. Stayed in a room with two double beds so a bit more spacious. Staff very pleasant apart from our first encounter with the lady on the reception desk who was not the most welcoming after a very long day traveling, my credit card payment would not process so I had to give her 1000 dollars in cash - she was not at all helpful, I dont know what would have happened if I did'nt have cash - was she going to throw us out! - she certainly did'nt offer any alternatives and her attitude tainted my whole experience of my stay in the hotel. Also the hidden charges are a major turn off - 29 dollars per day extra charge which was not specified on booking. However overall I enjoyed our stay in the hotel but I think I could have got;3
It's cheap for LA and the room is okay but the location is not so good. There are no places to eat within walking distance, not that you would want to walk in this area as we never felt safe. I think it would be better to just pay more money and stay somewhere else.;3
Nice area, easy access to the bars and restaurants in universal. The food in the hotel was expensive. The room was good but was cleaned late and not very well. I never understand why you pay for wifi?? $28 a day for parking as a guest is outrageous. The concierge was unbelievably helpful. As were the bar staff.;3
We booked here because the reviews were great and it was rated higher than the Sheraton next door on trip advisor. We arrived to find half of the hotel under renovation, horrible elevators and rooms that were, well, we have stayed in doubletree better than this. The digital room key is hit and miss with your iPhone. Only 25% of the time did it work straight away. The upside was that the breakfast buffet is pretty good. If you want the free shuttle to the theme park, in the morning, there are no staff to supervise the queue so people ended up pushing ahead of us and we nearly missed our prebooked tour which was really disappointing as the doorman the night before was amazing. If we had some kind of warning for the renovation we wouldn't have minded so much, but to pay full price;3
This hotel has the makings of a really great hotel! However, despite meeting rooms that are named after movie stars, a lovely fountain in the back entrance, nice wide hallways and renovated rooms, this hotel falls short.   I arrived at this hotel very excited because many movie stars have stayed at this hotel in its long history. The hotel still has that feeling of past grandeur, but it needs some money and time spent on it to bring it up to snuff. It also needs a better cleaning staff.  We arrived to our room. Smaller than anticipated, but bright, updated. No bathtub, but we were prepared to live with that until I started to notice hair on the tile floors. It was long, dark, curly hair and it was all over. I called the front desk and complained and was told that housekeeping;3
There wasn't anything wrong with this hotel.  Judging by most of the reviews, I thought I was in for it.  However, when we arrived, the front desk was very helpful.  We got there awhile before check-in time and the associate personally went to our room to check if it was cleaned.  It was, and we proceeded straight to our room.  Breakfast was fine...it was the same every morning but what more can you expect for breakfast other than eggs, sausage, juice, coffee and waffles.  Location is excellent.  I had a car and a GPS and everything was within 10-15 minutes.  The room was a little small but sufficient.  We had a balcony facing the side street which blocked the street noise.  The bathroom was fine with a large stand-up shower.  We also had a small couch and coffee table. The beds;3
My 75 yr. old mother and I spent a couple of days in LA after attending a conference in Anaheim. Checking in was easy and fast! The hotel has a contemporary flair but not fancy. It was not easy to locate the pool for there are no signs. The gym was located on the penthouse and has a pretty good view HOWEVER there are no cleaning wipes to disinfect the equipment after use - YUCK! Some travelers allowed their young children in the gym to fool around on the equipment despite the posted rules against it. There was a slight odor of cigarette smoke in the lobby and in the halls of the hotel - YUCK! The coffee in the room sucks and the hotel is stingy with the body wash etc. Even though the hotel states on their website that parking is $16 it is NOT. It is $44 for valet parking and $20;3
I booked Empire Hotel because of how it looked, the location and the link to Gossip Girl. We stayed over Christmas and New Year and travelled from Glasgow in Scotland, UK as a couple in our late 20's.  I was so excited about staying in Chuck Bass' hotel.  This is an honest review.  Location- excellent! Thanks to Chris at reception on our first day he gave me a map and told us the nearest subway (5mins away) where we could travel to anywhere we needed to go. Right beside the Lincoln centre, near to cafes bars delis and restaurants. Two or three min walk to Central Park and 10 minute walk to Times Square. Perfect location.   Decor & atmosphere- A lot to be desired, NO Christmas decorations up, no Christmas cheer, door men/bellmen were not dressed smart like other hotels, I asked a;3
The room was just average.  Everything worked, the bed was clean and the shower hot.  Maybe I expected more from a Hilton.  It served it's purpose.  The lobby, restaurant and other areas look great.  A great place for a party.  The location next to Universal Studios is great.;3
From the hotel's own photos, the place looks amazing, so we were a little surprised when we turned up as the hotel is a lot more run-down than you would think from the photos. The neighbourhood is unpleasant and far away from main tourist attractions and nice restaurants. However, the staff were nice and the breakfast was impressive.;3
Nice staff, very expensive everything. You only get free wifi if you book directly through Hilton, but the Hilton site didn't give the discount for the room. The dinner buffet was $58 per person which is way too expensive when you can walk to universal city walk and have a decent meal at a far more affordable price.;3
Reservation and check in was great.  The Location was perfect, and I felt secure even coming in late in the night.  I unfortunately was over charged and a week later, I am still waiting on my account to be corrected. Looking forward to hearing from someone.;3
I had stayed at the hotel many times for business several years ago and had a good experience,  but we were  disappointed with the service this weekend. I booked through Sam's club with a good rate but when I checked in I was told the room was very small and I should consider an upgrade for $40 per night. My husband said we would go see the room and come back down and let them know. We went up saw the room and decided to do the upgrade since it was our anniversary weekend and we had booked for 4 nights. We came back down and the upgrade fee was changed to $50.00.  I asked why $50 now since only 10 minutes prior it was $40. The desk clerk said they had no more rooms for the $40 fee, yet the room that we upgraded to for $50 was the same room offered for $40. We took the upgrade;3
"This is a busy, noisy hotel located just across the street from Penn St and Madison Sq Garden.  Thus, a little random at night --lots of homeless and mentally unstable people all over the place, esp. at night.  But you are very close to every subway (A,C,E, right at your corner; 1,2.3, one block up 34th; B,D,J,Z, Q, R, N another block up). Macy's et al right at your doorstep.  GREAT location comes with crowds.  Must factor that in. You'll have to show your room key to get into elevators.  Now, the rooms are nicely sized (bathroom is TINY), but I would have been happier if 1) there was a hot pot in the room to make tea and 2) real glasses were used. The hotel tries to give the impression of 30's glitz, but gives you ""disposable"" grit instead (individually wrapped plastic cups in";3
I stayed here for almost a week and I chose it because I was looking for a place in Manhattan with just relavitely cheap price, and bathroom inside the room, without having to go to Brooklyn or another area of NY. It was a good choice because it has an underground station very near so you can move around easily (itÂ´s almost in the beginning of Harlem, very calm area). Ok forget staying in Manhattan visiting NY is a must (brooklyn or queens might be a good place I guess, and everybody knows much cheaper and with a wider range of places to choose from).. but I didnÂ´t think so and itÂ´s not easy to find a hotel in Manhattan with these features and not super expensive. Rooms were average, just basic, and we indeed had some problems with the hot water since some days it just didnÂ´t;3
Firstly the room I had wasn't cheap, over $1200 for 5 nights (3 staying in the room) so the expectations rise with the price.  The room was spacious for NYC, the beds were comfortable, large fridge free to use, nice coffee machine and free safe to use.The bathroom was large, if a bit tired looking, and the shower wasn't the best but it done the job. The flush makes some racket so be prepared to hear other rooms using theirs during the night. I found the maid service was great for the first two nights then seemed to get rough the last three, no new towels two days in row, no loo roll left one day. Little things that for the price should be taken for granted. The aircon is pretty noisy but can be set really warm if that's what you want.  The wifi in the room was sound, you have to;3
Public spaces are much nicer than the very small hotel rooms.  The rooms and bathrooms need updating.  Our shower dripped all night.  Could use a deep cleaning. Location of the hotel near Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, and many restaurants males it very convenient.  Bed was super comfortable.;3
"Stayed in a ""Standard Cabin"" with one single bed and shared bathroom for $125 ($147 with taxes).  PROS:  Price is a major plus - where in Manhattan (let alone the Meatpacking District) are you going to find a hotel room for that price?  Decor is very cool, retro train cabin feel, the staff at reception, bellmen, doormen all wear old school train porter style uniforms (the two housekeepers I saw were wearing old school french maid uniforms), and the lobby is very grand (although the deer heads and the stuffed peacocks were not my cup of tea.)  Nice cafe off of the lobby that serves breakfast/lunch/dinner, but didn't dine there, so I don't know if it's worth the visit.  Robe and slippers are provided in the room, along with a bottle of water and a bath towel and face towel.  The";3
We were upgraded on arrival, although we have no idea what the other rooms would be like.  Our room was adequate, the children shared a twin queen, which had a depressing view onto the wall and the air conditioning units.  In need of some upgrading, (like double glazing!!), it was charming, if not overpriced.  Good location for central park, columbus circle and the Lincoln center.  Also only ten blocks away from the National History Museum and the Dakota for Beatles fans, was just round the corner.  Long walk for central attractions.  Would have stayed further downtown if we had known where we wanted to be or go!!;3
Jack hammers running all day in lobby. Staff more combative than receptive. Food in restaurant good.  Pricing on their website does not reflect the additional 30% for parking taxes and ancillary charges;3
We stayed at the Hollywood Hotel in October 2011 and found it to be very good value and a pleasant hotel.    Check in was a breeze and the staff were very friendly and offered help if we wanted to book shows/tours/transport. Our room was comfortable, and of a good clean standard.  This is a middle of the road hotel charging reasonable prices and we were happy that our expectations were exceeded given price paid.  Our bed was comfortable and although our room was on the road noise was not an issue for us.  The breakfast, served downstairs in a nice breakast room was extensive and generous  with a good mixture of cooked and uncooked items.  Breakfast was included in the price we paid for our room and was much nicer than we've been presented with for expensive prices at more;3
For a 4-star property, I expect courteous and prompt service from the employees, bellman service for luggage, and the room to be absolutely spotless.  The hotel, while VERY nice, especially in location and public areas (bars and lobby), is in need of room renovations, cracked doors, chipped paint, rust-stained floors in the shower, a slightly musty smell to the room, and an absolutely ancient air conditioning system.  Everything is extra, wireless, access to the rooftop bar, etc, which isn't a problem, but it adds to the already-deficient issues with the hotel.  From someone who travels for a living and actually stayed in the room (and didn't just come for the bar) the hotel is solidly in 3-star category.  Nice, but not 4-star by any means.  Plan accordingly.;3
The rooms are tired though clean upon arrival.  During a five day stay our room was not serviced at all.  We had to go down for fresh towels and refreshing of consumables.  The bedding is poor quality and well worn, the beds are just ok. Overall there is little service at the hotel.  It's just a place to stay that is very handy for Universal and LA sights. Disappointing and wouldn't rush back.;3
I booked this hotel as it is iconic on the NYC skyline. It didn't live up to expectation at all. We paid Â£170 per night plus the local tax on top, plus $75 for a late check out on the last day. When we checked in the lady said she would give us a free upgrade to one of the newly renovated floors higher up. I dread to think what the un-renovated floors were like. The room (3034) looked tired and well used, there was no view as the room looked over to another room, the room was very small. The room was clean, I just don't think it was at all worth the money compared to other places I've stayed. The location was central with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. It is a 10 min walk to Empire State and Times Square.;3
We had a 3 night stay using HHonor points for a 2 queen bed room. The first room we moved into had water damage by the windows - not sure how, but we requested to be moved and the new room seemed much older. It had an interconnecting door - although closed - it was not as noise proof as a wall and we had the conversation going into the late evening hours (no issues expect when you have young kids trying to get to sleep) - i guess payback in the morning as ours we up and at it very early. The beds were comfortable and the space in the room was okay (not sure if we got a diamond hhonors upgrade). The main issue was the shower - it was shocking - it would go from a comfortable pressure and temperature - to boiling then to cold within seconds - not a good experience, the house;3
Went to Hollywood with 2 friends as it was somewhere I had always wanted to go since I was a teen. I built Hollywood up so much and It truly was as crazy and as fun as i imagined.  firstly, we didnt want to spend loadsa money on flight and accomadation, we found a good package on Expedia: Ramada Inn on Vermont with Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand was great. Ramada was also good, however there were a few issues, but nothing major.  1) the Location is fine if you hire a car, I couldn't as i am only 24 and you have to be 25. So we spent a lot in cab fares, which was annoying.  Ramada is close to universal studios, which is great. It is also about a 10-15 minute drive to both Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip in west Hollywood. If however, you are able to spend more money on;3
The hotel is on 8th Avenue, three long blocks from the Javits Center.  I chose valet parking as the price was about the same as do-it-yourself parking around the block. While I was there, Madison Square Gardens is a block away. I took in the Billy Joel concert while I was there. Good hotel for the price conscious.  There are old rooms and newly updated rooms. I had a updated room ... nothing to complain about.  Friend had an old room & was less than thrilled.  Get an updated room.;3
"This hotel is one of those ""only in New York"" kind of places;  barely adequate, generally. Room was clean - refrigerator worked;  bathroom OK -  had a nice view north to the east end of the nave and the crossing of Cathedral of St. John the Divine.  There were safety issues, however.  Door on street is open ALL NIGHT 24/7.  ANYONE can enter the hotel;  be sure to keep door to room locked when inside.  Two of the major elevators were BROKEN FOR WEEKS.   But, one does not travel to NYC to spend very much time in hotel rooms.  If you don't mind the consistent bad situations I mentioned, then by all means, stay here.  It's very convenient to subway (Broadway IRT), taxis, delis, etc.";3
Had a short stay here for a business trip. The hotel has a great view from the higher floors of Burbank and surrounding areas.   The hotel lobby and conference areas feel a bit trapped in the late 80s/ early 90s which started me worrying that I was going to be staying in Jim and Cindy Walsh's guest room. Happily, the room decor had a much more modern look though only half of the furniture in the room looked like it had been upgraded.   The views from the 22nd floor room were spectacular. I was in one of the alcove rooms which, I was told, was larger than a standard room. It also came with panoramic 180 degree view windows. I would say it's worth the upgrade. Valley views to the north, Hollywood Hills to the west, and Universal Studios lots to the north and east.  If you're;3
The room was fairly sized (for a king bed). had everything you would want safe/mini fridge/tv/nice shower. but after we took a swim at the rooftop bar and came back to shower the hot water wasn't working, it seemed everyone was trying to call the front desk and took about 15 minutes to get through, they said water should be back in 15 minutes, after another 45 minutes it still wasn't working, went downstairs and they gave us a complimentary drink at the bar. okay fine. we went back to the room later and discovered the AC was not really working, called front desk several times but still wasnt going through so called house keeping and they sent someone up, who said the circulation in the room was bad and brought up a fan which helped a little but it was warm in the room (this was;3
The guests should be informed that they need to notify the front desk that they want housekeeping services. Other then that we enjoyed the lounge area and bartender and Jeff at the front door who was extremely helpful in our inquiries and arranging our early departure.;3
This was a hard review.... the staff, especially Nicole and Beatriz were great!!! The room was pretty nice for the most part and clean. The breakfast was pretty good, especially the made to order waffles and omelets! This hotel is close to the metro which is a nice way to skip on all the traffic!! There is a RiteAid right next door, gas station a block away, and a bunch of quick food options close by. There is also a little shop on the first floor with GREAT prices on everything!  Now for the little less than satisfying...  The rooms had NO AC and were kinda stuffy. You could open the windows for a little airflow but there were no screens on them so that can only be for so long. The Courtyard was pretty but basically closed down with no cushions on any of the furniture. The pool;3
In the city that never sleeps the hotel bars and restaurants are closed at 10:30 ? But the diner was open. I went to have a nightcap at The Butcher and Banker and got the door closed in our faces by some rude staff. So why do they advertise cocktails to 12:30? Go to Nick and Stefs  for steak at the side of MSG. The shower water spills across the bathroom because its not contained in any way. Meaning its an open shower with 2 drains to collect the water in the middle of the bathroom. Mr Manager listen to me. Lawsuit waiting to happen. You can't walk into the bathroom without getting you feet wet?;3
Hotel is in a good location, 1 block from 96th Street Subway which was really handy. 24 hr convenience store/pharmacy on the corner.  Plenty of restaurant options and McDonalds close.  Staff were pleasant to deal with.  Laundrette opposite.  Good Wifi reception.  Only 2 negatives, the very slow lifts which were sometimes full and so you spend a bit of time waiting and noise from the street even though we were on the 9th floor, fortunately we had packed earplugs so problem solved.;3
Hotel is very Stately Not sure what was going on but folks seem preoccupied with work . I Saw at least 6 hotel personnel in lobby not one engaged my party with a smile or a welcome. Passed several folks in hallways, not one said hi. Service just isn't on par with the stars. Without the hospitality this is just an old mt box. The competition is too strong to compete on points. Room was nice n spacious for a NY. Hotel. When you wash your hands in the bathroom the water comes out with force and hits the stopper and splashes right on you.  Too Funny !  Place is nice and close to Msg. My view out my Windows look into a hole. If you cant check in then plan to wait 25-40 minutes in a line to check your bag. This line was a constant thing, think you might have figured this out by now .;3
Number 1 on our list for wheelchair accessibilty!---pool & hot tub both have lifts Front desk--robotic like, Curtesy & travel employees, & bar staff, they rock! Assisted us beyond expectations!! when we go back, we will stay there, but soley due to the above mentioned!!!!!;3
"Stayed here for a week in August. We are a young couple who went to go and see the sights. First thing is that the location is fantastic - about 5/10 minute walk to Times Square; 20 minutes to Central Park and about an hours walk to south Manhattan.   The hotel itself is very back dated. The lobby is lovely - big open space. The room is small but not tiny. The bathroom is possibly the worst part. Shower would spray upwards as well as downwards! The bin men at 4am every day wasnât ideal - Iâd take ear plugs!   All in all, a dated hotel in a good location.";3
The room is in need of updating. There was peeling/bubbling paint over the entire bathroom door. The outlet in the bathroom was loose from the wall and barely worked. I had to wiggle and adjust the blow dryer over and over to get it to work. There was a sticky substance on the window when I opened it to air the room out. Also, housekeeping left ONE regular coffee each day. It is customary for at least two regular and two decaf coffees.;3
Stayed at  the NewYorker Hotel Wyndham, it got so many clients however i would like to register my disappointment with the room service, it was skipped twice and also done very late, comes with a polite notice that bedsheets will be changed every after 3 days or after checking out...........not my kind of Hotel hygiene, finally the Queen bed was not Queen compared to other Hotels, but the stuff are friendly.;3
Our room was actually tiny, with a tiny bathroom and a tiny wardrobe. Staff was not very friendly. I would only recommend this hotel for a nice location.;3
The location of the hotel is wonderful if you plan to attend an event at Madison Square Garden.  If not, it's a taxi ride to attractions, good restaurants, and shopping.  The lobby was bustling with travelers and the lines were long at check in.  We had to check our bags since our room was not ready, and we waited in a long line to retrieve our luggag once the room was ready.  Our room was small but clean.  It had a small living area with a sofa, desk and television along with a coffee maker.  The bedroom was small too with a very comfortable bed and mattress.  There was construction and scaffolding outside our windows, so we kept the drapes closed.  The bathroom was adequate, but the low pressure shower head with little warm water was unpleasant.  I don't think there was heat;3
The location of this hotel made it easy to get around to many area attractions. You are close to Times Square, Theatre District, the Subway, Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden just to name a few. We even walked to Central Park although it took about 30 min. The hotel staff were all very nice.  The lobby was beautiful and having a restaurant and bar onsite is great.  We found the food was very good. The front desk even called us after we left our luggage to explore hours before our scheduled check in to let us know the room was ready early. We didn't even request that so a pleasant surprise.   On the opposite end of the spectrum, I paid for the metro view which was one tiny window partially blocked by a wall because we were on a corner.  What a waste. The room was small;3
The hotel is very tired and with few of the things I would expect. Ability to make tea, but tea bags not replenished. No coffee shop, breakfast was poor and parking expensive. There must be better options. Our friends locally were horrified we had booked this hotel. On the plus side the room was big, and the beds comfortable.;3
I wanted to stay within a quick shuttle ride to LAX and this fit the bill--shuttle comes every 10 minutes for a 5-10 minute ride.  But the big things (forgot my 7am wakeup call the day of my departure,  Elizabeth at the front desk acted like she couldn't be bothered and there were window washers at 8am right outside without notice) coupled with the small (powered creamer, only two glasses provided in the room, body wash was empty and candy-store like concessions in the lobby with no healthy offerings) make this a hotel I'll skip next time.;3
Great location,very calm,polite staff and excellent cafe. But a real problem is with the the climate control especially the heating system that probably dates from the early 1900's. During my last stay this month I was so cold I had to sleep with my winter coat on. What was really disappointing was was that I paid 300 plus for a room that was barely heated (60F) and was not compensated for a really miserable night of sleep.;3
5 night stay in July @ Hollywood Hotel - all staff members were friendly, helpful but one supervisor, Cecile Eugenio  went out of her way to ensure my son's 15th birthday was recognized & made him feel very special!! Will certainly return to this hotel due to the excellent customer service received especially from Cecile - thanks once again Cecile!!;3
A bit disappointed with the hotel this time, stayed 6 years ago with my husband and had a fantastic room, was really spacious and clean, unfortunately not so this time, we were on floor 20 and felt like we were in a converted storage room, 2 double beds with barely enough room to move around, extremely dated compared to last time,looked like the room hadnât been decorated in years. Pokey bathroom with a bath you couldnât possibly lay down in and a shower that if you were taller than 5ft had to bend over backwards to wash your hair, grubby skirting boards and paint peeling off the walls, floor never got hoovered in the time we were there. Overall canât say Iâd recommend this hotel and if we visit New York again think we will stay elsewhere;3
i visited the quality hotel between the 9th and 13th of march 2005 with my college.prior to arrival i was worried about what the hotel would be like because i had read a number of bad reviews. however upon arrival our group was greeted by the door man. he was very pleasent and told us where the best places in New York were. the room i shared with my friend was clean the bed sheets were clean and the room was tidy. the bathroom was accaeptable,except for the mould that was building up on the bath seem. the room had all the basic ammenitys such as a phone table safe wardrobe t.v a lamp and a hair drier.  the beds were cleaned every day and the room had being vacumed, except for the edges. they could have being vacumed better. The carpet could also be re fitted. the lifts were a;3
The hotel is in a great location and you can tell it was once very nice. It's in desperate need of an update. Rooms were hot and it was only 25 degrees outside, we had to turn on the A/C. Wallpaper peeling off, window treatments didn't close properly, downstairs bar closed, furniture worn and tired. However, the staff is all wonderful and very friendly.;3
I stayed in Days hotel for 3 nights with my daughter and I am very pleased as it was perfectly clean, great customer service, great value and excellent location!  I felt like home and will stay there when I go to NYC again.  Thank you!;3
We took this hotel at short notice after our AirBNB failed to materialise. In a great location, but lots of street noise and noisy aircon, Room small but comfortable and the staff were very good and helpful Enjoyed the $11 breakfast, and the best possible has been done with an older style building and facilities to make our budget conscious stay an enjoyable one.;3
Stayed at Hilton to visit Universal Studios. Bed was comfortable. Location to Universal Studio & Citywalk within walking distance + there is bus service every 10 min until park closes. Did not opt for the breakfast buffet & resulting service was inept. Waiter didnt ceck on us or food, we had to ask where it was & when it arrived it was cold & order wrong. We complained & instead of new food it went into the microway & was barely warm. And did I mention that my Americano coffee was cold too? Expected more, got less. Bar staff was good the night before. Should have eaten in the bar for breakfast.;3
"Very disapointed .... , the room was to small  It very  comfortable  ... bath room  very little space ....  no wif.... TO  used it   must be at the recieption  not very prive   to talk . Bar is not open at all times ;; breckfast  everyday  you eat the same thing. .... I could nt  have lunch at this hotel nerver saw want they propose , its like no resturant at all .;;";3
Good location on West side near Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center.  Decent value but lacks some of the finer touches.  Small but cool lounge and bar with a hip crowd.  Rooms a bit tight but not bad for NYC.  Very comfy bad.;3
"This hotel was okay, nothing special. They need to pay more attention to the platform beds and vacuum around the mattress. We had no hot water and my husband was having surgery the next morning and would have liked to shower. I was looking forward to a bath, but no such luck. We called the desk and she sent up an ""engineer"" who turned the water in and said ""it's getting warm let it run"" which is what we had been doing.";3
Well-situated hostel in Hammersmith rather close to the city centre. The double room was spacious but the matress was quite saggy.  Fridge available in the room as well as some kitchenware. Shared bathroom and toilets were rather new, not clean at all times.;3
Very good location in NYC. metro station is just around the corner. friendly staff that helps. walking distance to boardway musical. can walk back after shows. will certainly come back and stay at this hotel again;3
The hotel is within walking distance to Universal City and the Universal walk. They do have a shuttle service if you dont want to walk. The room was clean and the qween bed was very comfortable for my wife and I. Good choice of hotel to stay at when visiting Universal City. We stayed there last weekend and got to enjoy all the beautiful women auditioning for the Pussycat Dolls. The MTV Music Video Awards was also at Universal City that weekend.;3
Itâs 0130 and I have been awake for ages with very noisy people in rooms around us.  The night before awake with smell of cannabis at 4am from an other nearby room.  Bathrooms so noisy that a flush echos in other rooms. Windows donât shield the outside street noise. Iâm not a light sleeper usually but not a decent sleep here in 5 nights.  Corridors very dingy, lifts can be slow but maid showed us the service lift location.  The rooms are very small - I have never seen double rooms so small and very dated. Please consider this when booking. Safe did not work in either room as we had 2 rooms  Beds comfortable, showers powerful. Ice machine on floor 25 which was good.  Staff pleasant and no issues at all.  Tick-tock breakfast great.  I wouldnât return to this hotel but the position;3
i live next door and my kids and friends stay there when visiting.  The rooms are basic -- but adequate.... rooms in all nyc hotels are small --- this one is small too... but adequate... and nice to be on the park;3
The hotel was in a fantastic location!  Just a short, easy walk to Universal Studios.Upon our arrival, the greeting was tepid. The room was ok, tired and in need of a facelift.We had a fantastic day in Universal Studios. When we arrived back to our hotel room, our room had been cleaned, but we discovered our daughter's special necklace was missing.  She had left a few items on her bed, which were carefully placed on the bedside table, all except her necklace. Needless to say, this was upsetting.  We filed a report, but have had no response. We didn't realize the uncleanliness of the room, until we were searching corner to corner for the necklace. Bits of dried food, packaging, debris...the room was in need of a thorough cleaning.  The beds were small, but comfortable.;3
Nice hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are small but comfortable and clean.  Walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and attractions. Short walk to Central Park.  Lot of street noise at night. The lobby bar has a great happy hour, but it was closed one the two nights we stayed because of staffing issue.;3
Good location next to Lincoln Centre & Broadway. Great for Central Park.  Very tired hotel rooms & corridors. Bedroom 225, small, poor/shabby fittings. Worst hotel bathroom I have had to endure. Nowhere to put anything except on top of toilet seat. Cranky shower mechanics. No curtain. Had to ask for extra towels to cover floor so not slippery. Water goes everywhere, even the door is rotten due to excess water splashes yet has at least 6 coats peeling paint to hide it.   No Air Con. Cranky room heater. Older windows mean lots of traffic noise. Would be so good if it was refurbished then it might look like the website photos!. Such a shame as it's excellent location.;3
I am a Globalist with Hyatt, already there again for this year.  This hotel is a one night stay over place and I get that but it used to have a good bar scene and life to it.  I won't be back until they open it back up again with the bar etc.  The ability to walk to and from LAX is big, but I don't want to eat in my room and there is not much close by so might as well go somewhere else until they open back up.;3
The room was so small, one of us had to leave the room and close the door so the other person could get out. The staff was wonderful, and we felt very safe. I expected it to be a smaller room since the hotel is so antiquated, but we could barely move in the room.;3
"We took my 9-year-old son on a trip to see Universal Studios and chose this hotel for proximity and because we are regular Hilton users.   First, the good stuff: The staff were genuinely kind, courteous, and hard working. Our housekeeper did an especially exceptional job. We bought a suite, so there was plenty of space in the room. The hotel is nice and close (walking distance) to Universal so no need for a car if you taxi in from Burbank. The room service menu has a nice assortment and food is delivered hot. The view from the upper rooms is lovely.  Next, the ""Meh"" stuff: The hotel needs a makeover. The wallpaper and carpet in our suite were not in great shape and the look of the overall place, plus our room was pretty dated. We upgraded to a suite to have extra room for our";3
Found the location was near to some great restaurants. We enjoyed Rosa Mexicana around the corner and an Italian antipasto bar across the street, The room was tiny ,and the maid didn't leave us any facecloths either. The lobby bar had a great vibe and the view from the roof was amazing.;3
"when arriving on a friday was greeted by drunken teenager outside who were queuing to get into the bar. the room is tiny and smelled a bit (think was the carpet).. however, was clean, great location, staff was friendly. cannot complain. think the review from ""miril44"" is pretty much complete. would stay again...";3
Summary: beware of service fees when booking, check-in and during your stay.  Great location.  Not a hotel.  Comfortable small apartments in NYC.  This is not a hotel, it is a group of (sparsely) furnished apartments that rent like a hotel, daily, weekly, etc.  The building also has permanent residential apartments, so you ride the elevator with tourists and locals together.  As long as you go in with these limitations in mind, it's a great value.  I grew up in the neighborhood, and this place is in a great location, as advertised.  I liked having my own little Upper West Side apartment in a pre-war building (pre-WW2, that is, highly coveted in NYC).  I have a 2-year old, and there is a great playground nearby on 76th in Riverside Park.  Fairway is around the corner on Broadway,;3
Pros: The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel was located around the corner from the subway, so getting downtown was a breeze. We were only a 10-minute walk to Central Park. The beds were comfy.  Cons: The facilities were lacking: no fridge, the TV had four channels, the room was a bit cramped, the Wifi barely worked, no breakfast included, and the elevators took 10-15 minutes to get to your floor. Parking was also not included, they did provide the name of two parking garages near the hotel that would offer discounted rates because you were a guest.;3
Stayed for one night at The Jane. The rooms are very small (originally designed for sailors) but I knew this in advance. Very quirky but absolutely fine for a short stay.  I was however very disappointed by the bed... the mattress was so old, creaky and uncomfortable that it made my stay quite miserable.   Bathrooms are unisex/shared, I don't mind this at all but the shower cubicles had absolutely no room for your towel and clothes.  The food at the restaurant Cafe Gitane was wonderful, extremely high quality.  Price for NYC and this location was excellent value. However, I don't think I'd stay there again. I would definitely go back to the restaurant though!;3
The room was well furnished but had a few quirks. For instance, no exhaust fan in bathroom, water took a very long time to get hot, AC was very loud and did not maintain a consistent temperature, pillows were uncomfortable.  Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was awful.   All of the staff were wonderful. The pool area is very relaxing. There is a shuttle that runs to Universal every 15min and it's only a 10min walk if you miss it.;3
Bottom line - I don't think we would stay here again unless it was completely renovated, along with other improvements being made. I've been in better Holiday Inn Expresses. You are solidly paying for the location, so if it's worth that much to you, you can try it, but you may not get much sleep.   Apparently, we were across from a maintenance closet, and at 11:30pm and later we were awoken to loud banging and someone in and out of the closet. The sound proofing in these rooms are terrible. You can hear average loudness conversations in rooms next to yours, as well as people in the hallways.  The rooms themselves need some serious renovations. It appears the bathrooms may have been done more recently, and they have added new tv's, but the furniture and carpet is dated.  When we;3
Hotel Staff were very helpful especially Sade on the front desk Be aware though, if offered a room 01 (as our one was Room 201) to 10 on any of the floors the noise from the Aircon units in the Shaft outside the window can be horrendus. We got our Room changed;3
I stayed at the New Yorker while conducting business in New York. The reason I chose the hotel was its location. It was a walking distance or a somewhat short taxi ride to the places that I needed to be. Check-in was a breeze, I was hardly at the check-in counter for a minute before I had my room key and was on my way to my room. The check-in clerk was very efficient and courteous.  This was about the only very good thing about the hotel.	  There were supposed to be renovations which have taken place so I didn't expect to be greeted by old stale carpet smell when I got to my floor (I stayed on the 29th). Perhaps the renovations didn't include carpet replacement or deep cleaning. The furniture in the room looked OK. The room however didn't look 100% clean. I could see some debris;3
This was rather a mixed experience. The hotel is in a great location. My room was excellent and large. The bed was big but not comfy. There is really, really good food and some lovely staff in the restaurant. The breakfast is a buffet, but I have a bad back and they kindly helped me. I cannot praise the majority of the restaurant staff highly enough. The Italians were especially agreeable.  However, some of the reception staff were very unhelpful. There is a weird policy about not cleaning rooms unless you tell reception you would like this strange service, which fact isn't properly advertised. It isn't possible to get through to reception on the phone.  As I left I was blithely told that there aren't any chairs in reception when I - doubled over in pain and carrying a walking;3
I don't think this hotel should be so expensive for what it offers, there are no upgrades, TV are old & just regular channels not even basic cable, the beds are old & springs are sticking out. If you don't be careful to getting in & out the bed you will get cut or scratched. toilets easily get clogged, the shower water is always changing. Staying here is if there are no other places to go. The staff are great & very sweet & always willing to help. To bad there not the one's who own & run the hotel. Prices are always competing with other hotels but they don't have amenities so if there is no other place to go then go but if u get something better for the same price or cheaper then go for it.;3
"Yes, the Red Line of the subway that will take most LA tourists to where they want to go is close; however, I would still suggest renting a car and paying for the daily parking ($24/day).  Just factor that into your total from the start.  We talked to other guests staying at the hotel and they really wished they had rented a car because the neighborhood is not great to walk in, especially at night, and they wanted the freedom of driving.  We did use Uber once during our stay and it was convenient, so that could be another option for transportation.   Pros of the room: seemed clean, very large space, refrigerator. Cons of the room: minimalist decor, seemed cold and stark, no closet door just a rod for hanging, coffee pot wasn't functional because pieces were missing, our balcony";3
Hotel ok, but this is what you expect in New York.  Areas of the hotel need updating and decorating.  Room was clean and quite spacious for New York Hotels.  Breakfast in the hotel Diner and Restaurant good.;3
"Location is the main reason the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City ranks 3 stars in my perspective as Hilton Honors (HHonors) Diamond member that regularly stays at Conrad and Hilton properties in SE Asia.  Itâs a superb location for Universal Studio Hollywood visit; bar none.  Their rooms are nice renovated, but suffers from structural maintenance problems with slow bathtub drain with high room occupancy and bathroom sink drain pipe replacement - which was fixed during our stay.  The room bed is on the soft side which was another big negative with my bad back.  I end up sleeping on the sofa (not the sofa bed) which was firmer that the bed as the best night I slept!  The other  main reason for the 3-star rating is the room maid service needs improvement to pay attention to dirty";3
This was the second part of our LA Vacaction and having stayed here in the past both on business and pleasure, I knew the area and hotel well.  I did find the staff to be a little on the straightforward side.  NOT overly friendly but professional.  Our room was immaculately clean but even with the DND sign on the door, the maid came in and cleaned anyhow.  For a hotel chain that is supposed to offer Complimentary wireless internet and oops bag (forgotton bathroom amenities), they lacked.  I did get my high speed internet but it came with a price tag and No oops bag (Doesn't that dock QA points).  Although the neighborhood isn't the best, we didn't feel unsafe and even made use of the Metro (Subway) to spend the day at Universal Studios (beats the parking cost)and walked home in;3
Upon arrival we did not receive a warm a welcome.  We stayed for 7 nights and never felt welcome (the only people who actually said hi were the cleaners in the morning!) but it seemed to be a running theme in the city that everyone was extremely rude.  Check in and check out the staff were unfriendly and I felt like I was bothering them by asking checking in!  Tick Tock diner served good food with a few friendly staff.  Room and Bathroom were small but adequate for what we needed.  Facility fee is a joke (why not charge for use of the gym/ office rather than charge EVERYONE whether they use or not?).  Everything seemed like it was in need of a good refurb. Location brilliant.;3
Pros: Convenient LAX location. Free shuttle, which was a huge plus. Meeting staff are friendly and helpful. I always like modern clean Hyatt room interior design.  Cons for particular this location:  - Unlike other Hyatt hotels, this particular hotel doesn't have robes inside the room. No big deal, but for $400 room price I would expect it.  - Room reserved for 3 people, only one shampoo set was in bathroom, and not enough towels. It took me 2 times to request it before they brought it to me. - I accidentally left some a must have travel piece of clothes in the room. NO ONE contacted me. EVER. NO good sign, for sure.  - Finally, a huge minus - food cafe downstairs is horrible. No good choice of food, but overpriced. My family member ordered some soup and burger/potatoes, taste;3
A hotel that is across the street from Central Park.  A good value in New York City.  The people that work there are friendly and nice. It reminds of a European hotel.  Small elevators and rooms.  Needed help to know how to get the shower head to work. The room only has about 10 TV channels.  The reception isn't good. Only 1 key for the room. They allowed us to check in early.  Very good with answering our questions. Not a hotel that I am used too.  If you want a good value in Central Park, it is a good place to stay.;3
Mixed comments - location is good for Broadway and Times Square - and easy to get various tube lines to see other places in Manhatten and Brooklynn.  Room was tiny with just enough space to walk around the bed, with a huge mirror propped on the floor and not fixed to the wall, but the room was cleaned every day, thebed was comfy and the shower was good.  Coffee available in the foyer first thing - but not later in the day, and no tea/coffee facility in the room.  In my view - very expensive for a basic room with no breakfast, but it is New York!;3
"I booked this last minute, and expected to pay a premium because of the time  of year (NYC Marathon, sold out MSG 2 nights) and location. What I didn't expect was a 1980's room. It was not an updated retro look which I have seen in some hotels. The entire room need to be updated, the sleeping area seemed as if there were certain updates, although the bathroom was an embarrassment. Paint was literally pealing off the wall, mold in the grout lines, a shower head that had the pressure of a fire hose, the valves squeaked as you turned them on and off (I could clearly hear the other ones in the adjoining rooms) the toilet seemed to be one you would find in a locker room  and the water ""never got hot"".  I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes until a receptionist showed up, and when I";3
The only reason I chose this hotel was the airport shuttle. In common with most other businesses, services were not available, curtailed or provided by staff obviously selected by their cost rather than by their presence, ability to be cheerful in the face of all the threats we are faced with and ability to communicate (engage in conversation, rather than utter monosyllables) in English. The check-in process was the highlight, although there were no porters to help us with our luggage. Rooms are small, bathrooms tiny with showers where the water pressure was so low that you. had to run around to get wet. Breakfast menu was awful - no health options, everything with potatoes and no decent coffee. Bar and meal prices insane. $250 for a meal for mum, dad and child!!! No thought;3
A historic hotel with a proud history. Today, hotel-wise, I consider it average. On the plus side, it is in a very good location in midtown Manhatten, opposite Madison Square Garden and next to Penn Station. It is a decent place, good for a quick stay or for a business trip, just don't expect anything fancy. Some of the floors are rented out as student accommodation so you will see a lot of students there. The 24-hour diner is very handy if you need to eat or drink at odd hours. You can visit an exhibition about the history of the hotel in the basement for free.;3
Hollywood hotel is located quite close with Universal Studios and Hollywood Bvd nearby a metro station. But your car will stay your best friend to remain efficient. The hotel need to be renovated : out of fashion bathroom, small room pared-down. Clean. Very good breakfast. Too expensive at he end of the day.;3
My family and I have visited this hotel for over 10 years however I was more disappointed with this stay than ever.  Firstly our room was located on the third floor, a floor currently being refurbished. Our room was extremely dusty which I can only imagine is coming from the renovation works. Secondly the cleanliness of the room has been appalling compared to other years and I was shocked to find out that now you have to request your room to be cleaned each day - something they could have told us at check inn.  Obviously the location is what helps make this hotel located a the quiet street and v close to the centre of London. However sadly I think for my next trip I will be looking elsewhere;3
A big shout-out to doormen Jeff and Mourad (and their colleagues), who are the very very best I've ever met: very helpful, genuinely friendly and interested, always in for a chat and full of tips and information.  Housekeeping staff also very nice.  Front desk staff on the contrary seem completely disengaged from their guests.  Rooms are decent size, and the beds are very good.  Unfortunately, the windows let in WAY too much noise, which in this bustling area in Midtown makes for interrupted nights of sleep (too much street noise in the room).  Bathroom was OK, but could do with a renovation (paint coming off, door stuck, a small leak in the shower screen, uneven shower floor).;3
Booked this hotel at the last minute  The good: - Location is great! (opposite Madison Square Garden) - Beautiful old Art Deco building - Proffesional attaentive staff - Very clean (beds, bathroom etc) - VERY GOOD value (I paid $125 for the night!!!) - Free wifi and free long distance calling (including international)  The bad: - Room was TINY (<150sqft) - Hotel is old and needs a makeover  - Hallways need new paint and carpet - Bathrooms work but have very old fittings  My PET PEEVE: Most hotels toda have EITHER a coffee maker in your room OR complimentary coffee in the lobby.  This hotel had NEITHE. I want my coffee!!;3
Easy to access from Newark Airport as Penn Station is just across the street (8th Avenue). Being in the Midtown area it means you can walk most places or go to Penn Station (we preferred the walk as the weather was good). The area surrounding the hotel is a bit seedy with lots of rough sleepers. On checking in were asked to pay a 'resort charge' of $29 per night to give us access to the 'free' wifi and allow international calls. When we questioned this as our travel agent had not made us aware of it, the fee was reduced to $10 per night. The room was comfortable and well serviced throughout our stay. We really only used our room to shower, change and sleep as we wanted to make the most of our stay in the city. There was a small deli one block towards Midtown where we could have;3
The stay was just ok. We had issues with the air conditioner not working properly on more than one occasion and I noticed when checking out that my sheets had holes in them. Beds were comfy but small and not for tall people and the rooms are very small! Bathroom needs more counter space because there is NONE!  Best thing about our stay was Jeffrey the doorman! He was very kind, courteous and very very helpful both with checking in and checking out...he took the time to store our luggage because we arrived before check in and he went over a map of all the must see attractions and their locations around the city. He also arranged a ride to the airport for us when we checked out! A true asset to the hotel!;3
Room was small even for NYC standards.  Stay away from any room by the elevators (room 710).  I heard the whizzing of the elevator all night.  Check-in staff were nice.  Lobby was amazing.  Expensive for what you get compared to other NYC hotels I have stayed at.  You cannot turn on the shower without getting in it and getting wet.;3
Arrived at reception to a robot checking you in. No emotion. Then arrived at room with no view. So top tip ask if you have a view or can you get one. We left it as we are only using this as a bed for the night. But would have been good to have a view.  Apart from the disappointment of room, at least the room attendants done a great job and were very pleasant. So well done to them.  Please note that they charge for coffee and $8 for a bottle of water. But there is a Starbucks next door. There is a shop around the corner for cheaper water.  The Hotel needs to be refurbished.  Never managed to see pool as door and access seemed to be blocked at 1900hrs. So no comment there.  For a room that was tired looking and rhat the front staff think it's OK to give out without mentioning that;3
If you have back problems.....the bed was absolutely horrible!  The room faced the bathrooms of another building.  It almost seemed that because the room was discounted quite a bit that we received an inferior room...;3
We were celebrating our honeymoon and stayed at the Ameritania for 3 nights before moving on to Antigua.  The hotel itself is relatively basic with small rooms but what you'd expect of a hotel in the centre of NYC. Location is perfect, close to times square, broadway, Central Park etc so ideal for tourists.  Our stay started off poorly as we had an awful experience at check in. We had booked the hotel over a year in advance and our travel agent had emailed to let them know when we would be arriving - 2pm so we had asked for an early check in. We had also specifically asked for a room on one of the higher floors.  When we arrived, there was no friendly greeting and the lady told us that our room was not ready and we'd have to wait. When I explained that an email had been sent to;3
I booked a double room for two nights for two people here as I was going to the Adventure Travel Show at London Olympia, which it is very close to.  Getting off at Hammersmith station it was just a short few minute walk away and pretty easy to find, which was a definite plus. When I checked in the staff member was polite and efficient. I paid in cash on arrival and received a handwritten receipt. I was a little worried as I read on the email, on the day of check in, that you needed to call beforehand to confirm the booking, which I had not done, but there were no issues.  I received one key and went to find the room. The room had a reasonably comfortable double bed. Towels were folded on the bed (Security tagged to prevent theft). There was also a bedside table with drawers,;3
First visit to LA. November 2004 Hotel is in good locatin, 4 blocks from Metro. Vermont/Sunset. On same line as Hollywood Blvd and Universal Studios. Booked with Expedia requesting smoking room - hotel non smoking. Room large, cleaned every day as was bathroom. Coffee facilities & TV. Request room on 2nd floor due to noise form disco Thurs - Sun, can still hear it, but just. Complimentary breakie is quite good, saving on mid day meal. Reception staff not friendly but all others are. Didn't try restaurant as lots of places to eat on Sunset Blvd, 5 min walk. Hotel was best thing about this experience. Would recommend it if you are on a budget. LA has street people every where in centre. Got of at couple stations to explore and got straight back on. Be very careful if using the;3
We stayed for 4 nights. The highlight for us was the free breakfast. Really good selection of hot and cold food.  We had a king room, which was large and comfortable. It came complete with a fridge and microwave.  We had a shower/bath in the bathroom. However I know other rooms have just a walk in shower which we would have preferred but it wasn't a problem.  The location was very handy if you didn't have a car, as it is a couple of minutes away from the metro and around a 5 minute walk to a bus stop.  Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning to rooms and we left our ipods in the room and they were neatly put away when we returned.  The reason why I have scored this hotel only three stars is down to not having anything in the area to do in the evenings, we did go down to the bar;3
My wife and I have just returned from 6 nights in the Wyndham New Yorker booked through a package deal.  The hotel is ideally located for anyone wanting to travel around the city, with Penn station across the road and its easy access to anywhere.  The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment yet the hotel lobby is still very grand. The Art Deco dÃ©cor throughout the hotel is plain to see, even in the rooms where the bathrooms have period feature vanity sets.  The room we had was a standard double, and was very small. Enough room for two suitcases, the bed and our shoes, however the room was essentially only for sleeping in as the city was the main reason for visiting.  The hotel has two eateries connected to it, an Italian (that we did not try) and the 24hour Tick-Tock diner. Both;3
We selected the Empire due to its location with Broadway, Columbus Circle and Central Park. The location is fantastic the rooms were very small and dark,due to its configuration you had no privacy so most of our stay the blinds needed to be down. Dining at the hotel was limited due to the restaurant not being available after 8pm for diners under 21 we had teenagers so that was annoying The major issue we had with the rooms was the temperature, this wasnât able to be adjusted so each night was very very hot;3
I was here for a week, and was quie nice place. Quite cheap to new York and really clean. You have a metro station just few meters away and bar and restaurant close by. Few meters ago is the Smoke jazz cafe, one of the best place to enjoy a great jazz concert;3
Bathroom looks old and it is chipping. We found hair on the floor and in the bath tub. I have lived in NYC for 3yrs and returned for a mini vacation. The room size was fine for a hotel in NYC but the quality of the bathroom was very disappointing. I was in a standard metro hotel room on the 21 floor. Our friends also had the same complaints in their hotel room.  Service was great. Cleaners were very nice and prompt.;3
My wife and I (26/27yo) stayed here for 4 nights at the end of March 2017 for our honeymoon. For the price we paid and that we were here for a special occasion, I expected a lot more.  The hotel is situated in a good location as you are able to walk to times square and there are plenty of restaurants located in the immediate area. It does however come with the traffic which is unavoidable so no complaints about that really.  We arrived on a Monday night and were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. We requested a room with a view of the empire state building and they managed to accommodate this for us. They even brought a handwritten card congratulating us on our recent wedding.  The room we were in was situated on the 28th floor and like I said had a view of the empire;3
"I stayed at the Ramada Hollywood near Universal studios' for 6 nights in the month of May. Me and 3 other friends shared a double room. And even though, we were sorta nervous (after reading the reviews online) We went ahead and kept our reservation. Well first of all, this hotel really isn't that bad. I think a lot of the reviews are a bit on the dramtic side.   1) The location: Yes, this hotel is located in Hollywood. However it is NOT in the ""glam"" end of it. I wouldn't call the neighborhood ""scary"" at all. It's just a hispanic neighborhood, but we had no problems and ventured out often. The metro line and busses are about 1 block away.The hotel is pretty close to a lot of touristy spots, and there are city tours daily from the hotel. I would advise buying a map before heading";3
I had a very good time in Marrakesh staying at this riad after looking at tripadvisor and other travel related websites.  The riad is very nice and well furnished in naturally a Moroccan theme, light and airy.  The staff were good and Marco who is the owner was attentive and kept a sharp eye on the staff.   They were all attentive and polite. The bedroom was clean as were the public areas.  The only thing that brought this riad down was its location.  The riad is, at times, down dark alleyways and I, travelling as a  single female did not feel very comfortable walking back when it got dark especially dressed up with heels on.   Taxis cannot get to the front door.   It is about 15 minutes or so walk to the main square and souks.   If it were not for the location, I would consider;3
Check in, check out and luggage collection staff were excellent. Efficient, helpful, professional, friendly and polite. Room was very clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped. Location (as discovered on a previous visit) was ideal for our needs. The visit to the restaurant was a huge disappointment. It was 8.45pm and we hadn't reserved a table so had no problem with the 30 minute wait for our table. Once seated we were left for at least 15 minutes with no assistance at all. Two waitresses kept wandering around, occasionally serving other guests but not busy or rushed and it was impossible to catch their attention (without shouting). My husband approached the supervisor (?) who (not politely in my opinion) said they were busy (NOT) and doing their best (if so, oh dear!).;3
Had 4 days in New York and couldnât fault the location of the hotel. As previous reviews have said, the extra Â£100 âservice chargeâ is just a stealth revenue uplift for the hotel- you get nothing for it, not even tea and coffee facilities in the room.  Check in team tried to sell and upgrade before weâd even seen our allocated room - definitely recommend you check your allocated room before agreeing to any upgrade (cost!)  Would advise against eating in tick tock - the food is over priced and poor. Forego the convenience factor and venture out a block or two.   Room was ok. Tired and bathroom âsweatedâ with ceiling dropping water after anyone had a shower.  The key selling point is the location!;3
Hi. During my stay at Ameritania, I had to go to the front desk to acquire ice. The representative first brought me a bucket of ice water. I then replied that I only wanted ice. He returned with a bag of ice. I next inquired about where my bucket was? Another representative replied that it would be brought to my room. It never was. The WiFi also stopped working before my checkout was completed.;3
Great location for exploring NY and with fabulous rooftop bar, but room quite small and tired. The noisiest aircon ever! Very good buffet breakfast, but not cheap. We found the  Lincoln Centre cafe next door more than adequate for a quick breakfast with free wifi at half the price, and quieter than Starbucks. Hotels of this standard really should have free wifi by now ( it is free in the reception area/bar, but even this wasn't working one of the two days we stayed).;3
We recently stayed for 3 nights at the New Yorker. Lovely hotel in convenient but noisy area of Manhattan. We chose one of the renovated rooms due to the age of the hotel and  previous bad experiences staying in old Manhattan hotels. It was a good size, nice bathroom and updated amenities. Staff members are generally friendly and helpful. I am giving an 'average' rating because of a few things: very long check-in process with not enough staff, un-flushable toilet which took 2 phone calls and a 3.5 hour wait to get a response for maintenance to fix it, and a surprise Facility Fee daily charge of $30 +tax not included in the reservation confirmation.  This is being credited to my credit card after me writing to a manager with details of my reservation: the registration clerk on;3
The location of the hotel is perfect, rooms are not spacious but at least clean and comfy. The staff was helpful but long check-in time is expected at weekends. Bottom line it's not a bad place to spend a couple of nights in NYC.;3
Front desk clerks at check-in possessed poor customer service. Once in the room the stay and the service from the other front desk clerks, to housekeeping as well as breakfast service  was excellent. As a guest when traveling for business it is essential that a hotel is accommodating & pleasant.;3
If you are staying here plan on leaving at least 15-20 minutes early for wherever you are going. There are only 3 functional elevators. Also if you need the hotel to hold your baggage while you wait to check-in or before departure they charge you 5$/bag.  The check-in/check-out process is very inefficient and the lines are very long with few hotel staff working. The room was tiny even for nyc standards but we did get a free fridge delivered to our room upon request. Overall would not recommend but location was convenient.;3
Stayed here for a week long convention.  Our room 2944, was clean, but very out dated!  The bathroom was tiny, and they really should replace the tubs!  Put in bigger shower instead.  Tub is ancient and was very hard to get into and out, as I have back issues.  A walking in shower would of been nicer.  Tub was from the 1950's I think, really old!  Floor tile was not clean. Basically, they need to redo their bathrooms.  Bed was firm.  O.K. to sleep, but what they call and queen seems more like a full size.  Safe in closet.  If you want to make your own coffee/tea, ask at desk for a Keurig to be brought to your room.  No refrigerator. At least in my room.  Elevators are very confusing.  One set goes as high as 20th floor, other goes 20 to top. In conference area the rest room are;3
"By NYC standards this place is good value for money although it won't suit everyone. The location is West Village (I think) which means you're quite far from the major shops and city attractions although you're only a hop skip and a jump from the Village and it's cafe/bar scene. There is a cafe/bar on the ground floor which serves decent enough food though I'd say the service is questionable as they made me wait an eternity for my change. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are tiny. My room was clean although it did feel kinda ""lived in"" and well used. The TV and IPOD dock was a nice touch. WIFI was a bit temperamental. The shared bathroom was clean although I only saw one on our floor so I can imagine it gets real busy at times. All in all good value for money";3
"On two nights business related stay in Manhattan I chose the hotel for it's location near Penn Station.  Arriving at the hotel at noon, the clerk tells me me my room is ready but my rate only allows me to check in at 4pm. Therefore for a mere 50$ I could check in early. The weather outside is turning and the rain changes to snow. Let's do it.   What a ""customer first"" experience... NOT!  I head over to store my luggage and the guy asks me for 5$. I have never been at hotel before that charges money for this, but here I go.. Than I ask if I can tie my backpack to the big luggage, and the guy says sure, but it's five more dollars, I'm like no way and head out into the snow...  Everything else is normal, but old and a bit rundown, though everything works and nothing is obviously";3
"If you need a place to stay for work, this hotel is perfectly fine. But it's just not one of your really good hotels.  It does have a great location right between Hollywood and the Valley.  And if you're spending any time at Universal Studios, it doesn't get any better.  The rooms are pretty well put together, but again - its just your average hotel room.  One of the things that gets me: they have ""Executive Floors"" which normally means a lounge of some kind.  Nope! And I've been running across this at a number of Hilton properties lately.  I know its kind of nit-picking, but here's one of the reasons it's important at this hotel.  They are known for this massive dinner buffet on the weekends.  Meeting people at the bar or in the lobby for a drink really isn't possible anywhere";3
the picture on website is actually the back door to the parking lot. the front door on Vermont makes the place rather unappealing. I had booked a room in Beverly hills but was offered a deal to use the Hollywood Hotel instead. hotel itself is clean and room was comfortable and spacious. Huge shower. neighborhood is so so at night. Short walk to metro.  however we arrived at hotel about 2 hours early and front desk would not offer any kind of early checkin and had no place for us to store bags while we went for dinner.;3
Overall we had an amazing time in New York! We spent very little time in the hotel.  The staff st the hotel and the bar and rooftop area are definitely worth a visit.   The only downside is that the rooms were extremely small and the air conditioning was soooo noisy!   The breakfast was also not great, it was like warm;3
Went to NYC to see Billy Joel at The Garden which is just across the street from the hotel. Location is actually pretty good..Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are across the street (Penn station subway entrance is next to the hotel). Short walk or taxi ride to midtown, Times Square, Lower Manhatten (9-11 memorial, Freedom tower, Battery Park etc). The hotel staff is wonderful, service was just a call away. Unfortunately we were not offered Bell service even though we took a cab there from LGA.  In fact we didn't know they had it until we checked out and asked if someine could get our bags. The hotel is outdated and requires upgrades. Needs nee carpet, paint, beds, etc. There was no coffee maker or fridge in the room but housekeeping did bring us one when we asked. Closet;3
This hotel needs much faster elevators & much bigger bathrooms-  The drain in the bathroom sink was clogged & did not drain very well when it was unclogged - shower area much to small - could not move & water had no place to go....;3
Grandchildren looking forward to rooftop pool. It was advertised on line the week prior to booking. The day prior to arrival we were told it was being repaired. On arrival we were told it was in the process of being repaired for the last few weeks. That would mean it was not available the whole month of  August.;3
First hotel that I stay in during our trip to the USA... suffice to say that out experience was somewhat mixed. The hotel itself does not look too bad on the pictures and the outside, but the room could be improved with some updating.... The staff is very friendly, the breakfast is somewhat monotone - same stuff everyday... The hotel is not too far from the public transport (subway and bus stop).  Internet access is one of the are that could be improved, during our stay it was somewhat slow and unstable.;3
We chose to stay here twice on our last trip to Los Angeles from Europe, one night each on arrival at LAX and then, again, before departure. The hotel proved itself adequate with much to say in its favor, but it was not without its minus points.  Itâs very close to the airport â which is a good thing. We only waited about ten minutes until a free hotel shuttle bus (QuikPark) came our way. Ten minutes later we were at the hotel. Check-in was fast (as was checkout the following morning).   The huge lobby is nicely decorated and lively (bar, snack bar, restaurant) with lots of seating.   Our room was spacious. Although the furniture and woodwork were modern and the rooms (supposedly) newly-renovated, our room looked rather tired. The furniture and the walls were scratched and there;3
I wanted to stay near a performance venue.  This hotel also is very close to Penn Station.  The building is interesting, art deco with a huge lobby and convenient diner tucked into the corner.  The room was tiny and not inspiring.  I was impressed that they had enough elevators to make it easy to get up and down.  Front desk staff was plentiful and good, got me into my room way early.  This was adequate to needs but I was happy to leave when the time came.;3
The staff were so friendly and polite, food at the lounge was good, and the hotel decor was fun.  Air conditioner in room was very weak and should be replaced.  Our room refrigerator also didn't work, they supposedly replaced it but I wouldn't put anything perishable in it.  Beds were ok.  A good stay overall for the money, nice location.;3
I had stayed here previously and had an excellent experience the first time, but this time was pretty dreadful.    * The first night checkin took an hour, because of a down system.  This also caused other problems (like not being able to re-enter room and not being recognized as HHonors).  * They botched my wakeup call on my last morning, which caused me problems.  * There was pretty heavy construction in the lobby area (right next to the dining area) which made eating there an unpleasant experience.  * At breakfast the second day the waiter insisted to me that they didn't carry sugar free syrup even though I had had it the day before.  Otherwise, without the problems, this is a good place.  Nice room, beautiful view, right next to Universal Studios and Citywalk, and a short;3
We went to Lincoln Center 3x during our stay which is right across the street.  This convenience made up for the somewhat tiny room and stuffy air circulation.  In addition, while WiFi is free (and slow) in the lobby, you have to pay for WiFi in your room.;3
A dated hotel with a good location. Right near the express train which shortened our trips. Across the street from a great cafe. Nice closet space and not very noisy. When we arrived there were no towels in our bathroom. When we called to get towels they sent a guy to fix our electrical wiring.;3
This is an older hotel and like much of NY, my room was tiny.  Fine for one person but if my husband had been there, we'd have had trouble.  The roofbar is nice as is the lobby bar which is popular and lively.  The breakfast was not good - buffet at $25 was way overpriced for luke warm food and mediocre coffee and baked goods.  Skip it.  Drinks in the bar were good though.;3
Stayed here for 2 nights before QM2 cruise, was worried seeing other reviews but pleasantly surprised as it was clean and had a spacious bathroom with a tub to soak in, yippee! I get so fed up of just a poky shower with no tub. Nice area with good little turkish run deli at end of block which I highly recommend for breakfast and good coffee-not too strong and really tasty. Opposite c.park, great location and on direct bus route from centre of NYC, need to get a metro card for fares as the drivers can only take dollar coins and its only $2 a trip. Frequent clean buses, why pay taxi fares? And on departure day they arranged our taxi to cruise terminal for us and it was on time waiting for us. Only drawback is noisy plumbing during night. Would I stay again, probably yes if I was;3
Relatively-priced 3 star hotel in NYC so can't ask for more. Near the subway. Minutes away from Central Park. Can walk across to the museums on the other side of the park. Also near Broadway Restaurant, one of the film locations for Meet Joe Black owned by some friendly old men who whipped up a great American breakfast. Bedsheets were slightly old and not very clean.;3
I stayed here on the 20th of June for a few nights. I was very worried as I had booked this hotel by mistake and read the reviews and how bad it was and desperately wanted to change hotels but I couldn't. I just had to grim and bear it. To my surprise, this hotel is not nowhere as near as bad as some people are making it out to be. I will not exaggerate anywhere in this when I write this. Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly staff who seemed like they wanted to help but I couldn't help but notice the very obvious scent of cigarette smile looming in the seating area of the lobby: this was quite concerning as they emphasized how this hotel was a non-smoking hotel. Not a great first impression of a hotel. We were quickly checked in and proceeded to our room. I was on the 3rd;3
We went to see a concert at HB, and the hotel was convenient to the shuttle.  We got to the hotel around 1 p.m., check in was a little slow but ok.  When we got to our lovely room it was quite warm, tried to adjust the thermostat, but it did not seem to work.  We then called the front desk and they said they would send someone up.  He arrived about 30 minutes later.  He said he would have to go down stairs and do some adjustments and left the room very warm.   We had to leave for our concert without the ac being fixed and when we got back the room was freezing without any success in adjusting the temperature.  We hoped to get a room where the ac worked correctly, but apparently there were none available.   This was my only disappointment with out stay at the Hilton, because we;3
NYC hotel rooms are tiny, the Empire is no exception to this. My first room was on the 1st floor, next to the elevators and with an interior view on the graveyard of ventilation outlets. The noise was deafening, didn't shut one eye that night. During the night I wen to the tiny closet bathroom and was greeted by a cockroach. Rooms are below average, used, with paint peeling off from the bathroom door, fixtures are poor.  Front Desk service highly depends on whom you are dealing with, it rates from very poor to really great.  On the plus side, the cold breakfast buffet is a steal, different breads, muffins, bagels, cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit etc. for under 20 USD.  Bit weird, if you call the elevator on the room floors, you have to push two buttons. Corridors look also rather;3
We stayed at the New Yorker from the 28th November 2021.  Upon arrival we found the hotels position to be perfect. Across the street from Penn Station, opposite Madison Square Gardens and just a few minutes walk from Macys and The empire state.   The check in procedures are easy and simple, however with a hefty $300 holding charge.   When we reached our first room all I can say is how disappointed I was, having requested a to have an especially impressive room, the room was tired, poorly lit and decorated in a terrible shade of brown. There was one tiny window which offered a view onto a brick wall.   Back to reception, who could not be more helpful and into a new room 2926.  Immediately better, much bigger window, much more light and the view was incredible, straight onto the;3
Unfortunately, I dont have photos.  Our scout troop had decided to stay at this hotel for the cost and location. Total of 7 of us (5-girls and 2-adults). 3/29-4/2. Scouting out the location (via google map) and distance to where we were going to be. This location was best for cost and distance. We arrived at the hotel fairly late (10:00pm) since LA is infamous for its traffic. My co-leader checked in and I didnt think she had a problem.  There were no bell hoppers to assist you with your luggage. The girls took their bags and placed them in the rolling cart and rolled the cart themselves. Fortunately, our room was on the first floor.   Room 130 - was updated. I was pretty impressed. New paint, recessed lights, large new bathroom (no tub).  We were surprised how updated the;3
"Let's start with basics: Yes, rooms are very small i.e. 50sqft or 5m2 and if you are staying in standard room, bathroom/toilet is shared. Good news is that it works. Some have said that beds are rock hard, but I don't agree. Firm maybe, not hard. The premises appear clean and comfy. As so many before, I'll also tell you that the place is quaint, picturesque etc.   Main concern is noise:  Pick your favorite: Westside hwy; The Ballroom club and your A/C -- they are all there rumbling, thumping and humming when you are trying to sleep. And I was at 4th floor, not directly above the club or facing Hudson.  Pros on the other hand: Location is very good! It is still a bang for your buck in this price category; it is safe and it is clean. Additionally, thereÂ´s a nice sense of community";3
I know The New Yorker is an old hotel, so I was prepared for it to perhaps be a little dated. And it was. I had hoped itâd be charming. But unfortunately I was not charmed.   Cons: Cleaning: Sub-par to say the least. Long dark hairs on the towels, grimy looking tile, mold in the bathtub, a strange wet spot on the carpet inside the door.   Past itâs prime: Decor and carpeting in the hallways was old, dingy, and smelled stale. Felt a little creepy in a strange way.   Bathroom: Very compact (ie. tiny!) No storage space for your toiletries- just a very narrow glass shelf above the sink - with barely enough room for one personâs things. Also, extremely  high hooks to hang your towels or whatever. As a short person that was very annoying.   Bedding: No blanket or cover on the bed or;3
As everyone's said, this isn't a luxury hotel but it is a comfortable place in a good location. It's handy to a subway and an easy walk to Central Park. We stayed in a twin room and the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was clean and functional. Noise does carry a bit in the hotel which could be a downside if you're a light sleeper. The price was very reasonable, easily the cheapest we could find - recommend it based on that alone.;3
It was a great experience and good location. The staff was very good and courteous. On the other hand the rooms are small and very limited area to store your luggage if you are travelling with your family;3
Shower not functionung properly... ventilation does not work properly... room is humid and has bad smell... employees very distant...Breakfast limitted and expensive... Airco loud.Location of the hotel is perfect all major sites easily reachable either by walking or the subway, which is very close;3
I stayed alone 6 nights in a single room - 70$ per night (w/o taxes). This was by far the cheapest possibility in an individual room. The location is great, 1,5 blocks from the next metrostation, at the and of a dead end road. It is 5min from the river, a park is there, quite calm. A tip: breakfast at Papaya's just at the next metro station (72th street), really cheap and friendly. The hotel inside: the room is small, but proper, fridge is working, as the AC, which is quite noisy. My next bathroom was just next door, I never ever had to wait. Just take flip-flops to go there, and then there is no problem, water is hot, and in the room is a sink for brushing teeth. There is also a TV, with bad reception, but who cares? For the reservation, keep a paper copy as they do not have;3
Overall my 2 night stay was fine. All the staff were friendly and helpful. My room in the 8th floor was small, but very clean. The bathroom is tiny. The vessel sink was shallow so water splashed on the floor and it was difficult to wash out my reusable water bottle. There is a shelf behind the toilet and sink. Unfortunately the toilet seat cover didn't stay up because of the shelf. Every time I used the toilet, the seat hit me in the back, that was annoying.;3
This review is just for the breakfast buffeet which we visited twice during the second half of December. Kids up to 15 get to eat free with parents. For my family of 4, the buffet came out around Â£21 for us. The buffet includes decent English breakfast items, pastries, cereals and drinks (latte, coffee to juices). Overall, it is a great value comparing to other options. The location is right by London Eye and the south shoreline. The Waterloo tube station is nearby.;3
Have just returned from this hotel. We chose this particular hotel following a recommendation. The hotel location was very good (just outside Penn Station) and it was very art deco in appearance. 2 adults and a 16 year old so we booked a double double room, it was very small and we struggled to accommodate our clothing and suitcases etc. The room had art deco type lights which were very dim so all lights were on when we were in the room. The window overlooked another bedroom and absolutely no view. The whole place seemed tired, they had painted the bathroom, evidence of this was paint all over the chrome towel rail which came off onto the towels. We got up one day and found that there was no water at all in the room, yes it was resolved, but three of us with no shower in NY;3
"Stayed there with my boyfriend and family.  There were 5 of us and I had requsted a cot for the 2 double bed room.  I had called the hotel 2 days before our trip to confirm and there were some issues (i.e. there are limited large rooms that will fit a cot.) After speaking with the manager a few times, he ensured me that I will not have a problem.  Arriving at the hotel, we were there really early, they allowed us free storage of our bags. Lobby had an old charm to it.  Parking was 1 block away but it was close and was about $22 USD which is reasonable. Upon check in, front desk told me that the room was prepared and that a cot should be in the room.  The room was large even included ""kitchenette area"".  The cot wasnt there as of yet, but was brought in within 30 minutes.  For";3
My wife and I stayed here from August 4th until August 8th as part of the first leg of our honeymoon US tour  The hotel itself is basic as it is an older building and when you first walk the corridors you wonder what you have let yourself in for.  However the room although basic was very clean and the maid service was daily and fresh towels were always left and it was very pleasant  The air conditioners are old and ours was clicking so much so we had to get the maintenance man to sort it. He was prompt, polite and efficient and although the method he used to fix it was lets just say...bizarre....it still worked and we had no complaints  The staff at the front desk were exceptionally helpful from day one. They advises us on the best bus tour, shuttle buses to the airport and how;3
My room was a bit worn and warm.  There didn't seem to be a way to lower the temperature which was set at 72.  The room was also very dark without enough lighting.  The dÃ©cor of the hotel and rooms I can only describe at resembling a bad 1970's porno.  Really tacky.   The location is great - near the subway, Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Central Park. I stayed here about 30 years ago and remember it as sort of worn then, but with a more old New York feel to it.  Not sure what happened. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Lots of lounge space to meet and have a drink.;3
I have stayed at the Days Broadway previously and was compelled to write reviews describing an awful hotel.  A client booked me into a New York hotel for 3 nights and I was horrified to discover they had chosen the Days Hotel Broadway.  Anyway, circumstances conspired such that I could not change the reservation and I checked in with trepidation.  I have to say the improvement is vast.  The room was on the 14th floor and it was clean, the sheets were pristine, the bed was comfortable and the air conditioning/heating worked.  My only problems were a lack of hot water and the truely awful elevators.  It is hard to conceive how they can be so slow.  I will have no hesitation about staying there in future.;3
"Overall ambiance is good. I was surprised at how thin the blanket was, and that there wasn't another one in the room. I liked the coffe mug with the in room coffee service (as well as the  to-go cups). It was a shame that they didn't provide coffee at the banquet. I also had a great deal of difficulty with their ""Best Price Guarantee""";3
"The pros are the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Universal Studios theme Park; great remodeled rooms. Very spacious. Friendly staff. The cons: Parking is $28 p/day; No continental breakfast available only an expensive restaurant inside the hotel; No magnification mirror to apply makeup so pack your own; Bathroom counter is small.";3
The location of this hotel is great - close to subway stations, central park and Columbus Circle. I had high expectation for this hotel based on its high rating. However I was disappointed the first night after checking-in. The front desk receptionist who assisted me checking-in and changing the room to a two-bed room had an almost-rude manner to my request of changing rooms..   When we went up to the room, the door was broken. The same receptionist came up and looked at it, and then offered to put us in a different room although previously he insisted that he only had one available room that night. When we went to the second room, I asked for wifi password, and he emphasized and made sure I understand that usually the wifi has to be paid but he will offer it to me for free.;3
A great location right across from Lincoln Center with easy access to subway lines.  Rooms on the (very) small side, but it is New York after all.  On the plus side, our room was very quiet.  The heat/air conditioning is very close to the bed and cycled off and on so needed cover for the cold air, then got hot.  And no top sheet, only a duvet.  Staff was friendly and helpful.;3
I stayed here for 10 days. The location of this hostel is good - about 3 minutes from Hammersmith station. The facilities are adequate, nothing spectacular. There are a few shared kitchens on each floor (they are spartan with a microwave, kettle and oven but no kitchenware or anything else provided apart from detergent). The rooms have a fridge and I stayed in a private room which had two single beds. The unisex showers are bordering on uncomfortable - they are cubicles with very large gaps underneath the stalls and lots of half dressed leering old men in and out. One morning someone (male) was on his hands and knees in the stall next to mine. Didn't see his face but was not sure what he was up to?? Would have been easy to get an eyeful under the partition. Even brushing my;3
I was staying at the Astor last week for my first trip to New York and must admit, i was a bit worried by all the negative reviews that have been posted. On the first night, it seemed like they were all coming true! The whistling radiators, nowhere nearby to eat!  But then after a good night's sleep (the beds are clean and comfortable) and a shower (the showers are really nice here!) i felt much better and then set about exploring NYC. And it's then you realise that the Astor is an ok place to stay. Once you learn how to use the subway and explore the city, the Astor becomes a really nice base. There are two decent cafes two streets behind the hotel, there is a grocery store nearby and of course, the hotel is right opposite the park, which is lovely in the mornings! But most of;3
Friendly service, great location, but very noisy to sleep.  The rooms are okay.  There are great restaurants in the area and it's right across the street from Lincoln Center.  I would recommend this hotel for location, amenities in the hotel and service.;3
"When we made the reservation and got a good ""deal"" on aroom at Central Park, figured it would be less than impressive.  It's location being close to the subway, clean and efficent room overlooking the park and a lovely newly remodeled bathroom made us smile.  We really didn't expect that!  Though it came with no ammenities such as breakfast or coffee pot, ice machine on the same floor...we slept very well and the little corner store was very New Yorker for our morning coffee and warm blueberry muffin.  We were giddy and happy for the three nights/four days we were in NYC.  It was quaint at best and perfectly fine for us.";3
The hotel is far from the attractions.  The room is ok but work in the hallway with painting and terrible odours was bad. The hotel has only bar and restaurant occasionally and not during our stay. The breakfast was very good.;3
The room on the third floor was very noisy  from the street. The window was very hard to shut, the most of the elevators were not working.  The food was very good and at good prices. Service was very good.  They had plenty of HOT water.;3
Very small rooms and noisy hotel with traffic outside otherwise location was good right by Penn station not far from Time Square staff were helpful and restaurant on the premises was also a good place to eat Would perhaps stay somewhere else Ne t time though;3
Tiny shower that needed maintenance....hand held did not work and tile in places need to be re-grouted. Great location. Have stayed here before but has lost some of its appeal and needs some updating to bring me back.;3
We booked this hotel as it seemed central to all we wanted to do. It is in Hollywood but the area is not good,we didn't venture out at night but I'm sure if you had a car you would be fine. The saving grace was the Metro line which is one block away which we used to travel all over LA,it's $7 a day which took us to Santa Monica,Long Beach,Universal,Hollywood etc,it's clean and we felt safe during the day. The hotel room was adequate for us,microwave,coffee machine and fridge provided,bed comfy,bathroom shower with small bath. Rooms are rather tired and could do with updating. Breakfast provided which was OK,sausage and hash browns everyday and an egg station,no bacon!!! Staff always polite and helpful. Pool area quaint,pool in need of a clean and I was bitten by something while;3
"Stayed for a couple of nights and overall had a good experience . The hotel staff were friendly and always had a smile. As other reviews note the bunk rooms are tiny; their were 2 of us in the room and although the drawers under the bunks are deep enough to put your clothes in, there is then nowhere to store your bag. We each only had 1 carry on size bag but storing them on the floor then means you cannot move around and have to take turns getting dressed etc. The robes and slippers were a nice touch to use for going to the shared bathroom ; but would have preferred to have one for men and another for women. It is noisy at night, could hear the music from the nightclub and doors banging as guests came and went. A/C helped drown out the music and it was also noisy. Overall as we";3
Just visited here recently (oct 2008), enjoyed the stay. Fab location, visited Empire State Building & went to a show or two ( young Frankenstein & mamma Mia). All within walking distance etc. Hotel was bijou, but fitted its description perfectly (smelled of cigars throughout tho) !;3
I meant to write a review on this back in June when I was in New York. Stayed here and was a little nervous based off the reviews but our room was totally fine. Bathroom was very clean. We had AC & Wifi. It was VERY close to a subway and lots of little places to get food and walk around.  I guess the only downside would be the elevators, how dark the hallways are and it smells weird sometimes.  I'd recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere cheaper/affordable to stay.;3
Good points - great location for major tourist attractions. Close to the subway. Tick tock diner in the lobby had excellent food (although pricey). Very friendly hotel security guards. Great views if on the right site of the hotel. Bed linen and towels clean and fresh. Convenient coffee cart downstairs for a quick snack. We complained that our room was tiny (couldnât lay 2 suitcases down) and got moved to a bigger one.  Bad points - no coffee / tea making facilities in the room. No fridge. Needs updating a lot - especially for the price. Paint in bathroom flaking off. Carpet needs changing. Whole place needs a refurb. Very noisy - surrounding rooms using their water created a racket in ours. We were close to the lifts which woke us up a lot. Some staff were abrupt (to the point;3
"Sad to see this west side gem decline so rapidly.  We have been coming for over 10 years and over the past few months have noticed a marked deterioration in service.  On our last visit in early November one elevator stopped at every floor on the way down, the bathroom had a tiny two inch square of soap, coffee in the room carries a ridiculous $3 price tag (not to mention $7.50 for a half pint of water), the hotel charges for wifi at some ridiculous daily amount.  The desk now adds $200 to your bill for ""incidentals"" and promises to refund the amount if nothing is taken from the service bar -- as if this doesn't invite a frustrating dispute down the road.  $200!  We looked at the few goodies in the room and they hardly added up to $50.  The rooms are clean but the carpets are";3
"The location is fine if you are wanting to be near the airport which I did as my business trip was 4 days in and out, and did not want to be bothered driving to the car rental and airport on departure day. I had a very clean room with a partial runway view on the 5th floor. The room was sound proofed so I did not hear any airplane noise thankfully. If you have the ATC app on your phone, the LAX ATC for runway 24 L & R is "" LAX Tower North"". I actually sat there listening to the tower clear Jets and watched them immediately depart as well as land, very cool stuff! The fitness center is on the top floor and overlooks the entire airport, which was also really cool. The pool looked beautiful as well, big and clean. Nice lobby with a restaurant that I stayed away from for reasons you";3
Good hotel - room was comfortable, washroom small.  Internet and room temperature setting was not consistent.  The room we were in overlooked an alley, I would avoid this room as it felt constraining.  I had my family, probably not the best for families, better for couples.;3
We stayed @ the Empire from sunday 21st until friday 27th. Normally until saturday 28th, but we got a earlier flight because of the coming hurricane.  General feeling about the hotel: nice hotel, nice rooms, very friendly and helpfull staff.  The bathroom is indeed small, but was ok with us.  The shower gave us some problems: we had to phone maintaince to get water out of it. Seemes that we had to put the handles on the right place to have a decent shower...A manual for the shower is maybe a good idea?  The noise in the room ( 705 ) at night from the AC ventilators in the building next door was very loud at night, we had to sleep with earplugs! The AC in the room was also very noisy, so we didn't use it. The Roof-poolbar was very pleasant to sit, and enyoing the sun. But 33;3
Although Hotel was a nice looking NYC Hotel, unfortunately we had issues. When we got to our room it was very hot. AIr was not working. I know these things happen, but when I called to get it fixed they could not fix it. Person working front desk dismissed the issue. Due to this issue, I had a horrible night sleep. Safe didnt work, drain in sink didn't work, shower had no door. Overall, hotel could have been a better experience of they just do some periodic inspections and fix the issues. They did put us in another room the second night...but air didn't work in that room either.;3
"The room was little and the wardrobe was not enough; the two beds, that should give room enough for two adults and one children each one (as declared by the hotel) were not so big and for this reason our nights were not relaxing. The bathroom was like the room: a little place where to stay one by one. OK for the cleanliness.";3
Itself the hotel is in good place. All sightseeings, park are on foot distance. What cuased me to be disappointed is that from my credit card the big amount was charges for some expenses in the restaurant on roof top and in mimibar, but I have never been in the restaurant and nothing taken from minibar. This is very frustrating and disappointing. You feel yourself like your money are stolen and you can not do anything. So even now, after around three weeks, I have not received my money back and even do not know will I receive that or now.   Pay your deposit by cash, that is more secure, never by your card.  Otherwise after check out you will have to prove that it is not you to spend money somewhere in a hotel.;3
I was a bit nervous booking at the Hollywood Hotel based on some of the previous reviews.  However, the value for the rooms  for a 5 day stay (got a good deal on hotels.com) was great and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room (it was a corner suite).  We had 2 queen beds, a microwave, fridge, and sofa and table and chairs.  The room was on the 3rd floor and faced south and was very quiet.It wasn't sparkling clean, but not dirty either.  Unfortunately the airconditioner wasn't working during our 5 day stay and our room smelled like fresh varnish.  And if you need any supplies at night (shampoo / toilet paper) there are no housekeeping staff late at night and the front desk staff state they have no access to their supplies!  Additionally, the housekeeping staff do not;3
Hotel positives:  - location  - comfy bed  -fresh linen and towels daily  -decent size double room  -air con good  -safe   Negatives:  - the hotel is majority student accommodation so the lifts are a nightmare so busy and loud noise  -busy lifts  - shower boiling or freezing no in between  -really old decor  -broken plug on bath  -300 dollar deposit for 7 day stay;3
Finding a good priced Hotel in New York City can be difficult at any time of year. We came across this hotel as one of the better options for Manhattan on a budget. Yes, the hotel is in need of some renovations. It's very old in many ways and lacks the features of a fancier Hotel. There was an issue with the heat system. However, the hotel is in an excellent location. You are maybe 10 minutes from Central Park and there is a subway line very close. Some excellent restaurants around the area as well. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was clean and maintained by the staff everyday. Most of the staff is very friendly. If you prefer a quieter area of New York City, but still with plenty of access to the finer aspects. You could do a lot worse than stay here. I won't lie, it;3
This hotel has a lovely bar and leisure area.  The staff was very friendly and the concierge extremely helpful.  As with any hotel in New York, this hotel was as well, very small.  Four of us stayed in a room with 2 double beds.  There was barely enough room to place our luggage to allow for walking space.  The bathroom was smaller than my coat closet back home.  So there was definitely not enough room for four woman to get ready each day.  Luckily the bedroom did have a large mirror.  It was a warm week in New York during our stay.  The air conditioning was a joke.  So the room did get a bit hot.  This hotel is a bit north of Time Square - but only about a 15-20 minute walk.  The subway is easily accessible - and it's a 2 minute walk to Central Park.;3
The staff was very friendly. The location was perfect, just across from Penn Station/MSG. The rooms were dated and tiny, but clean. The walls were thin and you could hear the people around you. It was perfectly fine for my fiancÃ© and I who were just staying for a night after the Rangers game.;3
I love this old building. Tiny room is OK for tourists who have a lot to do in the busy city. Fitness facilities are good as well, and 24 hours available. However some staff were not friendly, especially lobby staff. Room staff were good: broken safe box was fixed within an hour.;3
As New York hotels go, this is not a bad one. What you see is what you get: slightly shabby but not too bad. Value for money? Where do you get that on Manhattan anyway. We were put off by the facilities charge that they add for Internet, the business center and what they call free international calls. Well, nothing is free, as you have to pay the charge whether you use the Internet or not. A bit sneaky. Rooms were ok, we were given one with a view when asked for it. The first was a joke, but the last room had good views.;3
"First the good: Very nice and helpful staff whose customer service was impressive. Great location for Upper West Side, close to the express 2/3 train or local 1. Nice lobby, reasonable sized rooms.  The less than good: Water in our bathroom only ran hot. No cold. We asked once at the desk and miraculously that day had cold water, but never before or after. The shower was uncomfortably hot. Plumbing is old and though we were careful, the toilet backed up. Having seen a maintenance man walking around with a plunger, I suspect this happens often?   NYC rooms are small and this King room was no exception but it was doable. Unfortunately, it's really drab and in need of upgrades. The doors to all rooms do not have the sound ""catchers"" that keep them from slamming loudly. We had";3
I had a very quiet stay which was nice.The bed and room were clean & comfortable. I did not get a room with a view which is fine, but for what I paid I should have. Needs some updating,overall not bad;3
Although we had to change rooms, beacuse the first option was too small and the TV didnÂ´t work, the second room was better. We had to insist on the TV as well. The location is good, even though is approximately 20 minutes away from central attractions, there is a subway just around the corner.  A revamp would be good. Some floors are smelly. We had breakfast in the spot across the street, it has many options, good prices.;3
The hotel is located not near everything, but it's in a nice and quiet area. Walking distance to Central Park and 2 blocks away from the subway. It has a convenient pharmacy next to it. It is not an awesome hotel, but it's clean, quiet, has comfortable beds and clean bathrooms and a friendly staff. If you need a place to stop by for a few nights at a reasonable price for this expensive city, I would definitely recommend it.;3
I used to love this hotel.  It still has a cool lobby and nighttime lounge.  But many negatives now:Wait at front desk repeatedly longI and others wanted a slightly later checkout.  Others were rejected but I was granted extra 90â.  Odd. Gym is small, without mats, circa 2000Rooms cramped and grout in shower in poor repair.;3
This was the cheapest place i could find for a private room in August. The place is old, rundown & smells like mildew. The elevator broke while I was there & that was an inconvenience (more so for the people on the upper floors). No computer internet stations or kitchen area. They do have vending snack machines & soda. Second floor bathroom was always a mess from one of the residents who lives there. It kinda has a Bates Motel feel in the long quiet hallways, but I felt safe. No bugs & no issues really, just weirdly rundown in a nice neighborhood.  The carpet & chair in my room were stained & plaster was peeling off the wall by the furnace.  So my biggest issue were my allergies & wondering if I was going to get lead inhalation from that old paint & I was nervous I'd pick up;3
"I recently spent one night in this hotel: the location is convenient : 5 min walk from Cathedral hill subway and less than 10 min walk to Central Park ( N-W corner); there are shops and various restaurants in the area and it is a pleasant neighbourhood. The hotel building is old but clean. The room I was in was small but fine. The only downside was that I had to share the bathroom. One positive aspect is that there is a small kitchen that one can use. It is a good choice for traveling on a budget. I would probably go back.";3
Our hotel room was very noisy, the windows are poorly fitted and only single glazed. The fitness centre is of low quality, with broken and poorly sited machines. We also feel the price paid of over Â£250/night is very expensive compared with the quality of the experience. The location of the hotel is good and the staff are welcoming and friendly which just scrapes a 3 star review.;3
The location of the hotel was brilliant in times square. We were given a tiny room to begin with. Reception explained to us that the room was small and if we didn't like it we could change the next morning. Already this didn't bode well before we got into the room. We booked a standard room but we're told we had booked an express double.  No mention on the site of an express double. Well they were right we couldn't even open our cases together in the room it was that small. Also noise from the lift and fans outside. Moved to a larger room which was better alot of noise from the street outside when in the room. The hotel is nice enough and the location is good. Hotel had scaffolding around it. Overall nice hotel but would stay somewhere else if we came again.;3
The hotel is beautiful, very old Art Deco style I think. Lobby was lovely to sit in and use the free wifi. Our sons had a lovely room looking out onto the street, but we were given a room that was like a cupboard that had been converted. It had no view at all, just looked straight at another building. The room was a funny shape and my husband kept stubbing his toe on the bed, because of the layout of the room and the room size.  The room was right next to the stairs to go up to the rooftop bar.  We asked to move and were told we couldn't. The room was such a let down after saving for years to travel to NY from Australia! The rooftop area was lovely, great view there.;3
I first stayed here in November 2017 with my sister . We arrived to the room about 6ish from Newark and I had a bad migraine . The view from the window was lovely (not the Empire State Building direction but still good) . Room was small but most are in New York . There was a tv with an ok range of channels on , a bath in the bathroom as welcome too . I really liked stayed here itâs close enough to Times Square , Penn station subway is right outside , itâs next to Maddison square garden too , and there is a 24hour diner at the bottom . There are fees to pay at the end for the facilities regardless of whether you use the facilities or not and if you donât want to be caught out I would use the resort fee checker before booking any New York hotel .  In February 2019 I returned with;3
I guess this is not technically a review, but wanted to give everyone a heads up. The times my family and I have traveled to NYC (plenty of times) we have stayed at hotel Riverside Studios. It was not a fancy hotel AT ALL...but it suited our needs. The room was always decent (clean sheets, mini fridge, bathroom) although we did have to share a bathroom with other tenants. Fortunately, we did not experience anything extremely horrible that other visitors did. It was a good place to crash at night. Anyway, I was planning another trip out there and was trying to book a room at this place but saw that all of their dates were booked online. So, I decided to call and see if I could book a room. The person who answered the phone told me that they were no longer allowed to rent out;3
Stayed here over the weekend. Check in we relatively quick, even though there was a queue. When we got to the room it was looking a bit tired, could do with a bit of a make over. Couple of things that weren't quite up to scratch, towels were small, and toiletries (shampoo etc.) weren't replaced during our three night stay. Hotel has plenty of history, and it's well located, just not quite what we had expected;3
Was a regular at the Empire a few years back. The location is great, the sun deck during summer is amazing, the service is pretty much ok for NY and the prices are good value for the city.   Spent two stays (one of two nights and another of one night) the same week this August.  First room was great - two queen beds and nice view - the second was awful - minute with view on a... wall. Even though both rooms cost the same, it was something to do with the rate at one particular date. Suppose it's fair but I would not want to have paid 300US$ for the second room at any time ! More annoying is what they call the Splash package - which was supposed to englobe free wifi and breakfast - Well... the receptionist forgot to give me the code for the wifi so as I had no idea she was;3
While the hotel itself and the rooms are brand new and fantastic, there had been a water outage that affected the entire building. As of 4 am July 9, there's still no water anywhere in the compound. Guests are freaking out and many are asking for refunds or to be rebooked at another hotel. It's very disappointing (although it's mostly not their fault as the water pipes in LA have aged poorly). Otherwise, I've had a great experience in my first two nights. The hotel staff are trying their best but DON'T BOOK TODAY.;3
I stayed in a single cabin and as a petite female I had no issue with the size of the room but definitely do not see it being a comfortable fit for anyone larger.  Upon checking in I was given a room on the 5th floor that had no phone reception and was a dead spot for the hotel wifi, I requested another room and the staff accommodated this and told me they would bring a key to my new room up to me. 20 minutes later, still no key so I had to go down and get it myself, not a problem but I just wished they would have asked me this in the first place instead of leaving me hanging around. Both the rooms I saw were clean but they were also both extremely warm and the fan in the room was loud and did very little to keep the room cool, the air con definitely needs to be updated as the;3
Stayed one night at this hotel because it was directly across the street from Lincoln Center, where we had show tickets.  The staff was great and check in was fast and easy.  Unfortunately, when we got upstairs to the floor we were staying on, the place was not as appealing as the lobby.  The wallpaper is dated and way too busy.  Our room was small (expected) with a view of someone else's room across the way so we had to keep the blinds shut.  The room was stuffy and try as we might, we could not get the AC to make a difference.  The unit was old and could not keep up with our needs.  I will say that the bed was very comfortable and the place was clean.;3
The room we got at the hotel was nice and clean, average size with a nice view. The beds were good and the bathroom had all necessary services. It was very quiet on our level, i.e. we had a good sleep. If you should visit Universal Studious then it is a great location, you can easily walk there. Otherwise there is nothing to do in the neighborhood without going by car. However, the rest of the hotel was actually a joke. Almost like Fawlty Towers. The porters and parking staff were unfriendly and did not care about the guests. E.g. I was squeezed against the wall in the elevator by a luggage waggon but the porter refused to move it and did not want to take the next elevator with more space. He refused to move it even when I should step out so I had to climb over the luggage.  The;3
We stayed here from the 1st - 5th Dec, so the first weekend after the christmas lights were switched on. Therefore NY was very busy. The location is very good, right opposite Maddison Square Garden, with the Empire State Building at the end of the road, Macy's on the same street and Times Square around 10 mins walk. You can walk to pretty much anything around midtown. Easy to get to with Penn St Station nearby, where we got the train to and from JFK. You can also get the subway to 9/11 Memorial/Wall Street and Liberty Island Ferry. The interior of the hotel is not quite as grand as the pictures, but is quite nice, their is work ongoing and signs on several floors apologising for this, but a lot of levels are very tired looking. I think we had a refurbished room on the 23rd;3
I love the location but that's all I enjoy from my visits here. You can walk everywhere which is the bonus but the rooms are tired and small and don't always look clean (which I'm sure they are!). It looks as it was a grand hotel back in the 40's but it does need a good make over to compete with all other hotels in the area;3
The hotel is an excellent location close to all the main sites. The hotel photos may give the impression that this is a modern hotel but it is not. The elevators, long winding hallways make this immediately evident. You will realise that the hotel does need a major refurbishment including replacement of all doors and bathrooms.  The room size was very small, probably the smallest hotel room we (a family of four)  have ever stayed in but the room decoration is pleasant and the beds are comfortable. The magnetic key card system used it outdated and very inconvenient because it loses it code whenever you place it next to other devices. We had  to have the key cards re-programmed on a number of occasions.  The reception staff was friendly and conceirge and porters always ready to;3
Bathroom = poor design with no shower door Wifi and coffee in room should have been free like most hotels! Closet rod too high for me, at 5 feet tall. Housekeeping was excellent, cleaned all glass surfaces every day!;3
This hotel is literally a 10 minute walk from the Park. It's not the nicest walk but very do-able, otherwise there are shuttle buses leaving frequently which are excellent. The room was large and nicely appointed, bathroom was nice too. The main problem with this hotel is the downstairs communal areas, the entire ground floor was freezing and they had one restaurant open in the evenings which had a very limited menu. The breakfast in the main restaurant was a fabulous buffet.  I would recommend this hotel if you want to be as close to Universal as possible!;3
I stayed at the Hilton Universal for a night in a corner King room. The room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. A highlight was the separate vanity for make-up application. On the downside, this hotel is well trafficked, check-in time at the front desk time can be very busy. It took 20+ minutes to wait in line (in a very busy lobby/long line) and finally check-in. Yuck. I may return, as an HHonors member I like to be loyal, and the Hilton family of hotels has few choices in Beverly Hills/'LA, but it's not at the top of my list.;3
Over all the Hilton staff were seemed to be quite rude and the place a little old (90s decor).  maybe its because this hotel is convenient to the Universal Studios that the staff can be complacent and to be fair it could be that it is peak season and the staff are overwhelmed?;3
"Good location,  about 10 mins drive from the walk of shame,  etc.   Clean enough,  but bit grubby in the corners (though this is my experience of many hotels at this level).   I paid for an extra bed,  and was questioned at reception as to whether i still wanted it,  which i found a bit odd.   On checking in,  i was advised that parking was not free.  But was in fact 24 dollars a day.  When i stated that I was not aware of it and hadn't seen it mentioned on the website,  the receptionist said ""it's all over the website"", which i found very unhelpful and unnecessary.  I've just checked,  and it's definitely not mentioned on the mobile site.  I booked thru an agent (Agoda), and it was not mentioned in the confirmation either.   This of course bumps up the cost per night. However,";3
Hotel was okay needs a bit of a makeover bit dated rooms are quite small staff was friendly The hotel is very close to everything in good location of macys and train station         Staff and cleaners were very friendly so overall had a great time in new york;3
We were a bit worried about our stay having read previous reviews but overall felt the hotel was good though only used it as a base really.  Positives - location is great very close to Central Park but still within walking distance to Times Square, bed comfy, and staff were helpful.  Negatives - drinks in the bar expensive which was a shame as chose this hotel because of it's roof top bar, missed having tea/coffee making facilities and would rather have had that and no mini bar and air conditioning was noisy but didn't stop us from sleeping.  We had a fantastic holiday in New York and would definitely visit the city again.;3
Hotel and  staff fine, hotel location excellent however  as a business traveler i tried to check in 35 mins before the 3pm check in time and the hotel wanted Â£10- i refused to pay- i accept if a room is not ready and  thats not a problem but to try and charge Â£10 for early access  ( 35 mins) is just annoying and would seem to be PI's  way of  making  additional money on a room, perhaps in future and given check out  is 12pm  and i  normally vacate early  i should insist that PI don't access the room before 12pm to clean unless they agree to give me Â£10 for letting them have that  early access-. More annoying when i returned to CI @3pm i had to queue  for 25 mins given the number of people now checking -in - it was ridiculous;3
Visited New York for my daughters 30th, there were 4 of us all adults for 5 days,  check in was easy, staff very friendly.  I was a bit disappointed with our room decor tired, very small and really dark, but clean which is the main thing as it was only to sleep in.  The hotel is walking distance to Times Square about 20 minutes, 10 minutes from Central Park.  There is a lovely roof top bar if you want a view with your drink.  Would recommend for a short visit;3
Good value for money, good location, very helpful staff at reception. If the wake up call on last day at 5.45am would not have forgotten a very pleseant experience! I would be happy to book this place again and recommend  the double room with en suite bathroom (403?);3
My wife and I booked a room in the Morningside Inn for two nights--mostly just to sleep.  Our room had a queen bed and its own bathroom, and the rate was $90/night plus tax--about 1/3 of what other discount hotels in the city wanted.  The location was terrific for our needs.  We stayed in room 505 and, contrary to what I've read here, we found it very clean and comfortable.  The flat screen TV worked, the bathroom had fresh clean towels that appeared new, and the bed had a nice sheet and duvet--all clean.  Our only complaint was that the bed was rather hard, and they only supplied two pillows (I asked for another but it never appeared).  However, I would not hesitate to stay at the Morningside again and if you need a basic room for a night or two while visiting NYC, which does;3
A well located place, just one block from a Subway Station! Staff was nice at all the time. Beds were very comfortable. The room was clean including bathroom, air conditioner worked fine for us! The towels, besides clean, looked old/dirt! No breakfast!;3
Iâm sure The New Yorker was a grand old dame in its hey day but it feels very tired today.  Heating in rooms was very ordinary - it was either full blast hot (which made sleeping tricky) or cold.  Shower wasnât great and the rooms are very small.  The staff were pleasant enough and the room rate was ok but just an average experience overall.;3
Excellent location, friendly staff, fast check-in check-out. Spacious double room in 8th floor. Stylish lobby. Walking distance to times square. Many restaurant and coffeeshop around. 24h grocery store in front of the hotel.  Parking is 40USD and 45USD for SUV (for hotel guests) nearby.  Sewage smell was coming all the time from the bathroom during our stay.  Old, small TV. not HD. Limited channels.;3
I thought it was a pretty nice place to stay overall.  But luckily it was only my husband and I because the room was pretty small.  We barely had room to put our luggage (which was right by the bathroom door and in front of the main door).  It was nice that we had a microwave and small fridge.  Most hotels don't offer that for a regular room.  And there was a small balcony that was connected to two other rooms, which was nice when we needed to step out for fresh air.  Other than the size of the room being too cramped, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean.  Also, there was a free breakfast which was cool because we didn't have to go hunting for a place to eat.  Oh, and the customer service was okay.  At least they processed everything very quickly so that we could get;3
Booked with some trepidation due to the mixed reviews but have learnt to take some of the reviews with a pinch of salt, however on first impression I was disappointed with the Empire, the standard queen room was tiny with hardly any space for luggage or clothes storage. It was also uncomfortably hot, the only way to combat this was to have the antiquated AC unit on full blast which sounded like a jet engine including speed variations sounding like take off! Even this struggled to keep the room at a comfortable temperature.  On second impression though there are some good points, we got the room at a decent discounted rate, the staff and maid service were very friendly and good, the location is good for central park and the subway, the hotel is decorated very nicely and is very;3
"The Windsor Hotel is a good place to stay, as long as you accept that it is not exactly what it advertises itself to be. The safes in the room don't work (the kid at the counter offered to hold on to my valuables. Thanks but no thanks) and the wireless was down, but the hotel is clean, you don't have to share a bathroom with anyone, and besides that one sort of harebrained kid, everyone else at the desk was totally cool and super helpful. Plus it is located in one of the coolest  parts of the city.  A couple of blocks to either  the Lower East Side, Little Italy, Soho, East Village, and right on a quiet strip of Chinatown. We had some issues with the plumbing in the room, but after ""shoving"" that kid at the desk around a bit, he finally gave  us another room that worked.   The";3
Think I'll start with the positives  Location for universal excellent. View not too bad from our room would have liked to have been looking at Universal but never mind.  Staff friendly but more to honors members. Hotel looked very nice very clean and big  Now for the negatives   This was part of our honeymoon having only got married the week before in Hawaii staff aware of this and I made it pretty obvious with the mr & Mrs tops etc but not even a smile or a congratulations I wasn't expecting anything free just an acknowledgment would have been nice but they only seemed to care about their honors members when they asked if I was one and I said no their attitude changed and didn't even get 'have a nice stay' or anything was just - 'here's your key and the lifts are over there';3
The staff was amazing, both housekeeping & front desk. Security was great! Rooms need an upgrade. The bathroom is very small & old. Iâm not a fan of shower/tubs. I prefer walk in showers. The curtains tend to stick to skin.  AC kept shutting off & didnât seem to be the desired temperature I was aiming for. TV also kept losing connection several times. The floor carpet seemed worn & old. The beds were very comfortable with clean linen.;3
The staff at the hotel were helpful and welcoming. A special shout-out to Mohammed at the front desk who checked us in for his friendly demeanour, great service and helpfulness.  The room was clean and good sized (for New York), but lacked soundproofing. The bathroom has virtually no shelf space. The furniture, especially the bed, has seen better days and was noisy just tossing and turning.  On Check-out, we also had the surprise to learn that facility fees were charged per day, instead of for the duration of the stay, despite us not using any of the amenities. Worse though was the baggage stocking fee on the day of departure, which just seems greedy after I've just spent hundreds of dollars in that hotel.;3
When I come to New York, I have no intention of spending a lot of time in my hotel room.  The most important things for me is that I sleep in clean sheets and have a decent clean bathroom with fresh towels. This was provided by the hotel. The reception and doorman were pleasant enough. The general state of the decor is tired.  Overall it did the job.;3
We visited this hotel mid week in late April.  We got what we thought was a decent deal on a nicer room, so my expectations might have been too high.  Turns out we got an average price on an average room.  The rooms are small--two queen beds, one dresser, one desk, no closet or storage space, no bathtub, no separate toilet area.  Linoleum on the floor rather than carpet was a bit off-putting, but in keeping with the boutique-like ambiance they're going for. Rooms do have a mini fridge and a microwave, so that was nice.  A/C never worked (we didn't report it because we were only in the rooms to sleep and didn't want our sleep to be interrupted by a maintenance worker).  Computers were down when we arrived, so we couldn't check in right away.  Elevator next to our room was also;3
This was a cheap stay in london and it did what it said on the tin. It was nice and close  to the tube station and a few good pubs. Our rooms was ok, overlooking a courtyard area but the best was really quite uncomfortable. Other than that, it seemed clean. The bathroom was shared and had 4 female showers but two were better than the others. Guests also had access to a basic kitchen which was a nice touch.;3
Good art deco hotel.... but room small convenient though... Well protected by security guards who keep asking you for your room key in order to get access to your room. Busy hotel lobby... Some rooms face the Empire state building. Very convenient for Macy's shoppers... a good diner is downstairs.  Friendly staff and clean but a bit old....;3
Very nice hotel in good area very close to Central Park. Only things that let it down was charging for wifi. Which is bad considering what you paying for room. Also they leave water at side of ur bed which we assumed was free but no they charged as mini bar usage. Water wasn't even cold and they charged near $9 a bottle;3
On the surface, The Empire is a fantastic hotel. Location is impossible to beat, the staff is courteous and responsive, the decor has been chosen extremely well, and the location has the benefit of being used in Gossip Girl, so there is pop culture appeal.   The beds, however, were hard as a rock. There were also only two very small and flat pillows on each bed, and no flat sheet underneath the comforter. When requested, the porter brought up flat sheets and extra pillows, but it was a shame to have to remake the bed at 1AM when we just wanted to rest.  The room (suite 1105, a corner suite with a separate sitting room), was laid out well and decorated beautifully, but curtains were stained as well as the couch cushions and lounge chair, which we avoided sitting on. Also, the air;3
This hotel is beautiful, full of history and character and the staff were so welcoming and friendly, it was the New York welcome we needed! What we didnât need was a room that was so small (so unclear how to get a room with a balcony when they are all the same size?) that it couldnât fit two suitcases. That room was also directly above a nightclub that had beats pounding until 4am Thurs - Sat. Our first night was without sleep basically. The only way to avoid feeling the mattress beats was to stay out until then, which isnât fine for everyone I imagine? One night we got into the Ballroom and couldnât believe they suggested we call them up if the sound got too much, how could we stop the party in a club that size? Anyway, stay there if you can but make sure youâre not above the;3
Hotel was just that, a hotel. Its advantage at the time was its location,  close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, The Javitz Centre and a short walk to Times Square. No call out on special service or anything. Nothing to rave about nor nothing to complain about. Rooms were smaller than expected,  with 2 queen beds, not much space for 3 or 4 suitcases.;3
"Reminded them about my AAA discount when I arrived and twice it was ""accidentally"" left off my room check in sheet. $70 was the difference so important. Finally after the dork at the front desk made the change, I got the discount.";3
"Just returned from 4 nights here. Hotel location is excellent but hotel inside is very dates. Rooms are small and dark, plug sockets are not practical at all and limited storage space. Very clean though cant be faulted for that. Reception was very rude on check in I had 3 rooms booked and was told that she would ""not be booking all the rooms in - one at a time is how she would do it"" !! Resort tax not sure what you pay it for free WIFI and that is it as when I tried to make a call to the UK from the room, surprise it did not work. Who wants to use a gym and business centre when there for 3 days? this is included in resort tax but really! Tick tock diner is a must next door, good food service a bit hit and miss but overall great. I would stay again if the price was right, but";3
Fine hotel in a great area with proximity to central park, dining out and the metro! The Empire Hotel has good family rooms and although very small pool (disappointment versus the website), a superb and rare pool deck.;3
Went to NYC to see Billy Joel at The Garden which is just across the street from the hotel. Location is actually pretty good..Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are across the street (Penn station subway entrance is next to the hotel). Short walk or taxi ride to midtown, Times Square, Lower Manhatten (9-11 memorial, Freedom tower, Battery Park etc). The hotel staff is wonderful, service was just a call away. Unfortunately we were not offered Bell service even though we took a cab there from LGA.  In fact we didn't know they had it until we checked out and asked if someine could get our bags. The hotel is outdated and requires upgrades. Needs nee carpet, paint, beds, etc. There was no coffee maker or fridge in the room but housekeeping did bring us one when we asked. Closet;3
We were close to Universal, We were there for a Business Meeting,  It is a nice place, Pricey, and if we would not have been in the basement, or gotten our coffee for the room, it would have been a lot better.;3
I had read the reviews and had seen the pix before I stayed at the hotel so I wasn't suprised when I arrived. We  found an adult roach on the second to last day of our stay in our room but the room itself was clean and decorated nicely. It takes a little getting used to have to share a bathroom with the other occupants of your floor we took flip-flops to wear in the shower so things turned out fine. It is helpful to understand Spanish as the housekeepers that we encountered were primarily Spanish speaking but if the guest does not, with a little patience and appropriate gestures the guest will be able to get their message across. There is a drug store only three blocks away where you can buy soap, disinfectant, tolietries and snacks. There are several restaurants two blocks away;3
The hotel from the outside is spectacular and gives that 1920 new york feeling that tourist and business man look for when staying in the City.  Bedrooms however are a bit dated and when I stayed over (january) they had a little bit of a draft.  I would reccomend it for short stays and not for prolonged sejours  Davide;3
I visited the Hollywood Hotel over Labor day weekend this year. The hotel is pretty nice inside with a private fenced parking lot that made me feel pretty secure leaving my car there although they do charge for parking you want to note (I believe $18 a night). The suite we stayed in was fairly large with a mini kitchen, desk, couch. Some of the items in the room are up to date (TV's, refrigerator, desks) but other things like the carpet and AC system seemed a bit outdated.  I am not a very picky person when it comes to staying places so I was happy with my room, but if youâre looking for something lavish and lush you might want to look around more. You also share a balcony with the room next to you. You get free Wifi which is nice and a free breakfast every morning with a;3
Empty shampoo bottles left for days in shower base (obviously not cleaned) rubbish bin not emptied , we had to call cleaner back to clean toilet, bathroom floor not swept or washed carpet not vacuumed. In fact most days only the bed was remade. We spent 7 nights there. When called housekeeping never answered nessitating a trip down to reception. Location is excellent   However I would hesitate recommending this hotel due to their lack of care.  Ed was;3
Visited New York for the first time with my wife and this hotel was adequate. Its nothing special but it was clean, cheap and in a good location On the upper West side across the road from Central park. Subway was close and the deli one block up was great for breakfast. Smoking rooms available on third floor. Staff polite.;3
Well, what can I say. The first room we had was small and fairly clean. It had an overbearing smell of chlorine/bleach. After half an hour of lying down my eyes were streaming and we had to complain about the room, by phone. We had a shower and the smell slightly improved but it was causing me a headache and there was no way I could have stayed in the room. We went downstairs and complained to the front desk, after a couple of minutes the girl on the desk swapped rooms around and we changed rooms. The second was a much larger room. The room was clean and the beds comfy. The location is fantastic, the rooftop bar great but the pool a disappointment (its a plunge pool about 12 foot by 6) So I'm not sure if I can recommend the hotel as the first room wasn't fit for purpose but the;3
To be honest, after reading all the negative reviews about this hotel, I was nervous to check in. But it was much better than reviews lead me to expect. Our room was always cleaned well, toiletries were always replaced, and the room was nice and warm which was great considering it was February in New York. The wifi was slow at times, and it would have been nice to have a fridge but we still enjoyed our stay.;3
We've been coming here for years and have noticed its physical decline. Rooms are tired, bathrooms worn, elevators rickety, lobby getting shabby. But...the location and staff are excellent and it's clean.  We usually find a room deal, so keep coming back.;3
We stayed 3-10 July.  Great central location.  We stayed on the 23rd floor and felt the corridor was rather dated as was our room.  It was very clean, great air con and shower.  Beds smaller than home (king size) were however comfortable.  Ideal location to get about.  We walked to a lot of locations from the hotel.  We found tic rock quite expensive and on our second occasions a bit pushy  and an expectation you would be back the next day(we went twice).  Liked the security of staff checking you were a resident of the hotel before allowing entry to the lifts.  Our biggest annoyance was the note through our door at 6am on our final day to tell us our resort tax was 170 dollars.  Our travel agent told us we wouldnât need to pay it.  I felt the hotel could have given us more;3
My family stayed here 4/28/17. We were checked in early (and promptly), and the hotel staff were polite. We had a corner king with sofa sleeper. Huge bathroom and nice sized sitting area.The room looked great, but when we opened up the sleeper sofa we noticed that the sheets were clean but quite damp. Upon further inspection, the cusions of the sofa were very wet on the bottom side. My best guess is that the previous occupant spilled something on the sofa, or sat there with a wet swimsuit. I called housekeeping and had them deliver up a new set of sheets. There was a spare blanket in the closet which was in really terrible condition. I would definitely recommend that housekeeping pay more attention to the condition of the sleeper sofas in the future. It was disappointing and a;3
Unfortunately this Hilton is very tired. The lobby and rooms are in need of a Reno/modernisation.   The lighting in the rooms was not great, the walls between rooms are Very thin and and for the three nights we where there all four of us did not get a very good sleep because of the couple coughing all night every night kept us awake.   The beds where not overly comfortable. There where marks and stains on the wall paper, some of which could've been wiped clean. We had 4 in the one room (2 teenagers and ourselves). The room was standard not a huge amount of space but not tiny either, the bathroom had a shower over a bath and a shower curtain ( I am not a fan of these types of bathrooms), and there was a little bit of mould in the shower grout.  The lifts where ridiculously slow,;3

This was our second stay from London. The first time we had a double double whilst this time we were upgraded from a standard double to a slightly better standard. It was nowhere near as good as the double double we had previously (price was roughly the same).   Despite being upgraded and being given a free bottle of champagne for my partner's birthday, it still felt like the hotel made some odd choices for a four star hotel. There was no complimentary water ($7 for a small bottle), WiFi was extautionate in the rooms, the gym wasn't available throughout our stay and they charged us $6 to print two basketball tickets. The main issues we had were with the showers and heating. For some reason they have removed the doors on the showers so the bathroom gets soaked when it is not;3

Stayed at the Newyorker for four nights.   We enjoyed the spectacular view frm our room.  The hotel also provided us with comfortable beds. The hotel was also centrally located with convenience stores, cafes and retail shops close by. The Newyorker also has a comprehensive gym in the basement, which is a big plus.  Service was good. The reception desk and security people were friendly.  However, the hotel is quite old. The furnitures and bathrooms were not not up to a four star standards.;3
Standard room was very small but cozy.  A/C was to noisy to left it running when we were in the room.  Shower should have a door to avoid moisture accumulation.  Despite that, through pool and deck was awesome and the location is just perfect near central Park and Time Square.;3
I stayed 4 nights in a standard cabin on fourth floor room 451. I would definitely recommend this hotel if there were not for two things, bed bugs and a very noisy air condition.   First the rooms are very small but they their job very good. They are practical and comfortable even if they are very tiny. The shared bath rooms worked very well and were always clean. Only at one occasion I had to wait otherwise there was always a free toilet or shower when I need one. The small room and the common bath rooms are compensated by the lower price compared too many NYC hotels. Personally I rather spend my money in nice restaurant, bar or go shopping.  The location in West Village and Meat Packing District is very good and itâs a short walk to the subway on 14th St and 8 Ave. There are a;3

Stayed at the Ramada from Apr 26 to May 4 2004. Advantages: The location. It's a hop, skip and jump from the Metro station, and just a few stops away from Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard and downtown LA. It's just down the road from Sunset Blvd and boho enclave Los Feliz and is handy for buses and banks. Staff are courteous, efficient and eager to help and the rooms are neat and clean. There's a good comedy night on Mondays in the bar, and it's got a nice swimming pool.  Disadvantages: The juice in the breakfast room tastes like it's been watered down, and Metro trains are very infrequent in the evenings so can be a bit of a drag when you want to go out - get a taxi instead. Air con in the rooms is quite loud, but maybe this is normal. I'd stay there again.;3
The hotel is OK.  The rooms are clean and fine.  I was disappointed that there was no coffee making facilities that there is in every other NY hotel.  Its perfectly located for Macys, Madison Square garden etc.    Unfortunately the area has lots and lots of homeless people as the area has a high foot fall.  It can be a little intimidating as a girl on your own.  Staff were friendly and lots of places to eat near by  7 min walk from Macys so its perfect for shopping;3
This is a difficult place to review. First of all, agree with other reviewers: the size of the rooms is part of the package and they don't try to hide it. The place was built as accommodation for sailors and apparently designed to mimic an ocean liner (although you would imagine that was the last thing a sailor would want). If you want a palatial space to relax in, go elsewhere.   Pros: -excellent location, stumbling distance from the highline, nice shops and about 15 excellent bars & restaurants. About 10-15mins walk from the subway, which was fine for me.  -nice staff in the hotel itself - more personality than the usual drones -it genuinely has character. The place has an interesting design & history, and this is something important for me (i appreciate it is not important;3
Room smelled like mold. Bed was very uncomfortable. Service was good. Location is good but the price you pay did not match the quality of the rooms. Breakfast was extremely overpriced. I'd have to say I would not stay here again.;3
"This hotel is beautiful and an iconic building, well placed for Times Sq activity, the staff were all very polite, helpful and friendly, and the Tick Tock in house restaurant- a very nice ""diner"" vibe with lovely staff and great choices for all meal types. The rooms were ""compact"" but you are only there to shower and sleep, so okay, very clean and attended every morning by room service. It is, I suppose a little tired just by its age more than anything, and make sure you have all you need when you go out for the day as the lifts tend to be difficult/busy, and unless super fit 7-40 flights of stairs is not an option to many:) and you can waste valuable NYC time.";3
If you are in LA for Universal Studios, you can't choose a better hotel.  It's location is excellent.  However, it had only one restaurant which was good, but not amazing.  It's pool was beautiful with a nice, grassy area for relaxing, reading, or soaking up the sun.  The rooms were nice, but average.  I felt like I was Anywhere, USA, when I wanted to feel like I was in Los Angeles.;3
"My fiancÃ© and I stayed at the Hotel Riverside Studios on December 1st and 2nd of 2006 for just a little over $200 CAD total. I read a lot of really bad reviews on this hotel - some were about the hotel itself and others about the ""rude"" staff working there.    This was our first time in NY and all we wanted was a place to crash for 2 nights. Since it was the holiday season, hotels prices were extremely high!!! I really didn't want to pay a small fortune to stay at a ""nicer"" hotel since I knew were weren't going to spend much time there anyway. I'd rather spend the money on a tour or sightseeing or shopping!  So we made a decision to book this hotel and it really wasn't that bad at all. Our room was actually decent - it was clean, no sign of rats or bugs. And yes...the decor was";3
I stayed in this hotel for a very short time. The location is OK, if you want to go running to the Central Park, the metro is also across the street. The room itself is nice, but very small. There was actually a mini store in the room, the mini bar offered technical stuff, cosmetics, food and drinks. good idea, but prices too high. The lobby is small, but very chic. I took breakfast in the hotel and the choice was not very big, but pricey.;3
This is a no frills hotel on the upper west side. We usually stay here when in New York City. There is a lot going on all of the time. Our last visit we had a very nice updated room. The wifi is not the greatest but it was acceptable. The elevators are small and had to wait at times to ride it. The business center is nice but does cost a small fee to use it. Overall we are very happy with this place. We don't spend a lot of time here just for sleeping. The price is right!;3
"If you book a room at this hotel and go with the attitude that 'its just a bed for the night' then you wont be disappointed.  The beds are comfortable, the linen/towels are spotless clean, the shower is good, the guys on reception are very helpful.  That's the good stuff.  Our room was very small and had 'partitioned' walls, so you can hear everything from other rooms; showers, toilets, voices, their air-con etc.  The noise aspect is the hardest thing to accept; other peoples noise, the air-con which is ridiculously loud and disappointingly ineffective considering how hard its working, the extractor fan in the bathroom is so loud that you can't have a conversation with someone in the bedroom unless you shout. The toilet blocked twice and the plug mechanism was broken on arrival";3
Visited this hotel at Christmas and it is ideally situated for all that New York has to offer.  The first double room we were given was tiny...so tiny that it was uncomfortable for 2 people to move around.  We spoke to the great staff at reception who moved us to a larger room....much better!;3
But the location of the hotel was outstanding. We had been looking forward to sit i the topbar but it hasent opend. We had booked a big room in Sweden and the one we first got was so tiny that one person had to go backwards to let the other person throuh. But luckely we vere able to change to another room the next day.;3
Quite out of the centre of London (on the very edge of Zone 2), but very close to tube and bus station. The hostel was a bit of a maze but the staff were quite helpful. The hostel was not unclean, but definitely needed a lot of TLC in the decorating department. We stayed in a double room for Â£21pp pn and had everything that we needed for a short stay. Overall, good value for money.;3
I spent 5 nights at the Jane, mostly due to the fact that the price was far lower than most hotels I could find, and it wasn't a hostel. The staff were friendly, the location was quite good (and a short walk to the subway), and although the rooms were small I found it fairly comfortable.   The in-house cafe/restaurant had some good food for breakfast, but the staff didn't seem interested in acknowledging me, even when I sat at the bar each time I went there, so the service was quite poor.   Overall, good for the price.;3
Stayed here with some friends for a reasonably priced girlfriend's getaway...and we were scared!  It's hidden on the second floor of the building, with no obvious signs.  Check in occurs in an actual apartment turned office.  Elevators are slow as molasses.  Keys are used- not card keys and we stayed in an executive suite located on the 10th floor which was under construction.  Walls were thin but I am a heavy sleeper.  Overall, it was small but clean and made with updated materials (Pergo flooring, marble tiles in bathroom, nice kitchenette counter.  Beds were pretty uncomfortable with no mattress covers, you can feels the seams of the mattress through the thin sheets.  Location was great, right near the 1,2 and 3 Subway.  It was decent and tolerable for a short visit.;3
"Chose this larger, older art deco-type hotel on Booking.com b/c of the price but didn't read the fine print regarding ""The Resort Fee"" which I believed was already included in the quoted price. They require you to pay it when checking in. The Resort Fee includes 1. free wi-fi (worked mostly well) 2. 24 hr gym (didn't use b/c we were out touring the city 80% of the time & who wants to come back exhausted, then go work out) and. 3. All local & long distance & international phone calls (only good if you have no cell phone or tablet) 4. Use of the business center (who charges to use the business center?) Anyway, this cost is $29 per day on top of the already steep NYC hotel & city taxes. It's next to Penn Station so it's convenient to take the shuttle (makes 2-3 stops) from LGA for";3
Actully everything was nice - location is good, lovely bars and restaurants around, staff is nice, elevator. BUT - something with plumbing (? water in WC) - time after time there is terrible sound from water coming (from somewhere). Acoustic is low, so you can't sleep. There is kitchen also, just no dishes at all, so you can't prepare food or even tea/coffe. Otherwise - price is very good for what you get, very good that WC is inside room. We came from Europe, adaptation period is longer, so it is good if you have more comfort! Thank you :);3
My FiancÃ© and I stayed at the Ameritania for 4 nights just recently during thanksgiving and Black Friday.  The location is brilliant as it is in the heart of Times Square.  When we arrived we were informed we had an upgrade to a bigger room which was nice however, upon arrival the room was small and the view....there was no view. It was of a courtyard with no natural light. I decided to ask Reception for another room with no sunlight. I was offered another room which was a standard room to then arrive, and the room was even smaller! The windows of the room had 2 massive cracks with tape on them and the room was not in the best of conditions. I asked again and due to the time of year there was no other availability so I stuck with room I was given.  The rooms are far too small;3
"The Jane is a young hotel, and has some rough edges, which is particularly noticeable in the services provided. While some staff were very friendly and went above the call of duty (JP, Carlos, Jose), others were less so. e.g. when I wanted some boiled water front desk just said ""sorry, we don't have the equipment for it"", yet there is a bar AND a cafe on the ground floor.  The room was clean and didn't smell bad or was particularly noisy, though I was on the 4th floor.   The shared bathroom wasn't too bad, though the supplied slippers were worthless, and the showers have offer no facility to keep your towel or bathrobe dry. Take a few plastic bags with you. They do however offer free shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.   The residents/visitors were all very friendly - didn't";3
I loved the location of the hotel but they need to upgrade the furniture and carpet in the rooms. The food was really good. Staff were really nice. I truly had a good time staying at the hotel. Kudos to Hyatt.;3
Stayed for 4 nights dec 2-5, dont know why some people complain about this hotel, staff were excellent,very helpful at all times,clean room,hot water day or night,clean towels and bedding every day. never watched the tv only in the room to sleep really. nice little deli run by turkish family along the street,great breakfast.

"morningside inn PROS: near subway (110th), walking distance to central park (3 blocks), clean towels and sheets, nearby grocery,restaurants,etc.   CONS: we were transferred from a room (facing the street) since the room was under maintenace and front desk officer was not aware (duh!)  to a room (facing the wall of another building).no working tv,fan (no a/c,was ok since the weather was still cold); internet connection was poor even when your in the front desk; no shampoo; no tea making facility in the room (as per advertise in budgetplaces.com); common kitchen was useless since no pots,utensils, etc. to be used by the guests.; the bed was not cushioned enough, u can feel the springs; walls are too thin, u can hear footsteps, closing doors, shower running, flushing toilets,etc!";3
We stayed here for three nights with our children while visiting Universal and LA. We are also Hilton Diamond members so booked this through their website after reading reviews here.   Location - is great proximity to Universal. Itâs about a ten minute walk which our 3 young kids were fine with.   Rooms - are OK, nothing spectacular. Not sure if it was due to capacity but no upgrades available for Diamond. However room was not available by 4 (little after, but matters when with young kids). We had a King Sofabed corner room which had a partial (barely) view of Universal.   Service - not great. You need to ask for housekeeping each day, which we had, and it didnât happen. They even asked for a specific time we prefer, but we came back to a room still not cleaned after a long day.;3
"I can warmly recommend this hotel to low-budget travellers. But to be honest, not to anyone searching for any kind on luxury or ""top place for small money"". Riverside is like ""last stop before a hostel"" -place. Nothing more. Best properties were low price and good location.  The room was ok (tv, freezer, air conditioner, good double bed), bathrooms were comfortable and clean. Housekeeping was diligent. Location is quite good, 2 good buss-lines from downtown and several subways comes to 72st station which is just 200m away.   After all, hotel administration should chance all the advertising information in hotels presentations: 1)""Hotel Riverside Studio is only a couple of blocks from Broadway next to Trump Towers new buildings"" - NO WAY 2)""surrounded by many restaurants featuring";3
My daughter and I booked tow cabins for an overnight in New York.  The good: providing relatively inexpensive lodging for those of us just needing a clean and safe bed in a good location fills a seriously under served niche in NYC.  The cabins are well designed and attractive.  The bad: the lounge area was closed to guests for a private event - the entry guarded by no fewer than six bouncer type guys milling around the small lobby, making us feel like intruders in the hotel at which we were guests.  The only other gathering place  - the rooftop lounge - was closed to anyone under 21 (this included my daughter) leaving us with nowhere to relax in the hotel.   In a way this reminded me of the Surf Lodge in Montauk - not really a hotel, more of a night club with rooms attached.;3
Great location for NYC just a couple of blocks from Macyâs and next to Penn station.  Not a lot more to say, rooms were nice but do need updating, hotel did not offer much else, like i said the location is perfect but for the price I would have expected better rooms and amenities;3
We just got back from Los Angeles and this Hotel is not in the best of areas The hotel has a wonderful breakfast . the guy called Hugo and the two ladies that worked at the breakfast were so nice and friendly and they made the best omelettes ever and breakfast was great . But the hotel does not serve any other food and there are no good places to eat with in a walking distance from the place . The staff at the front desk could not even suggest any good places to eat . We were not happy about this .The staff at the front desk were nice but not really helpful . It was like that they did not know the area of Los Angeles . It was our first time there and we did not know the city .We needed some help and we did not get much;3
The staff at the Empire are all very professional and friendly.  They make the stay memorable.  The room are in need of remodeling,  Peeling wall paper, stained carpet, and a dated feel.  Bathrooms very small.;3
My room was not just small but tiny. Also my view was a wall. I had no real place to rest my bag without blocking my ability to get around. Also my suit and dress shirts did not fit in the closet. The check in took for ever and I even had to wait for check out. The room had one nice touch of a nespresso. Also the bed was comfortable. For almost $400 per night I would have expected more.;3
Great location for our check up to Mt Sinai. Lots of nearby places to eat. Parking garage around the corner at a discounted price.  Check in was great-fast and easy-room was ready early. King room was fine. Bed comfortable and a suite area with two chairs and a desk. Small bathroom and old faucet fixtures in shower that were hard to use. No frills here. Basic room. Not even a bedspread for esthetics. But bed was very comfortable. Air conditioner is a window type so it's a bit loud but worked fine.  Good room even though price was still up there but less than others in the area. Will stay here again when need to.;3
You probably wont get much sleep if your a light sleeper as there is way to much noise to get any good sleep. The facilities and staff are adequate and you definitely get what you pay for.  Location is amazing though and really easy to get to anyway you need to go to via the tube station 2 minutes away;3
Nicely located just across from Lincoln center, near Central Park and Columbus circle with subway access. We spent 5 days in January.  Hotel is clean and staff are nice. Some minor maintenance would be helpful. Rooms have nice views !;3
