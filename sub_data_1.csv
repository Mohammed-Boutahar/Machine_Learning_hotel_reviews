When we arrived, the lady behind the check-in counter was very short with me when I asked questions. She was pretty rude.  We hauled our luggage to the elevator, which was extremely slow. When we got to our room, the windows were open, the maintenance man was working on the air conditioner and the maid was cleaning the room. They told us to come back later. I asked the maintenance man if the air was broken and he replied no that is was just fine. We hung out in the parking lot until they were done with our room.   During our stay, the air did not work. I asked for a different room, but I was told they were completely booked. They sent the maintenance man up who said he thought the room was fine but that he would tell his boss it felt hot. We never heard anything from anyone.;1

this place is falling apart the rooms stink, my room had punched in walls a windows covered by a plank of wood, toilets and bathroms were filthy and we jus chose to shower on the last day thats how flthy they were, wernt cleaned in 4 days...all bathrooms are shared website advrties wrongly...i acutally cried thats how bad it was... most hostels are better...it a illegal hotel meant for public renting and has WORKING MALE PROSTITUES staying there no joke...only good thing its in a nice safe area!!!!!;1
At first I thought my room (#340) smelled like a wet dog. After a long trip, I was willing to put up with it for a one-night stay. When I lay down, I realized it wasn't a wet-dog smell, it was a homeless person smell. It is now 2 a.m., and the stench has grown unbearable. I'd like to check out immediately, but the earliest train to my destination on Long Island doesn't leave until 7:30 a.m. I had been planning on a leisurely morning in the city and the noon train. Now it looks like I will be going first thing in the morning on three hours sleep.  I booked this after reading about the place in a news story online about cute, cheap hotels in the city. Don't risk it. It's sooooo gross.;1
We made reservations at this hotel for the busy Christmas season by calling the Days Inn 800 reservation number. Prior to arriving I called the actual hotel to confirm our reservation and was told that an error had been made. The person at the hotel informed me that the hotel did not allow the specified roll-away for our 10 year old son, and that the room did not allow for three people. I explained that when I made the reservation the person actually called the hotel to make sure a roll-away was available.  The indifferent clerk said she didnt make the reservation and she didn't have any more rooms at our confirmed rate.  We were offered a smoking room for $100 a night more.  After several calls to the so-called Days Inn corporate customer service and several unreturned phone;1
"One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in.   Unprofessional staff singing songs about ""crusty vaginas"" on reception whilst we waited for them to get our keys.   One of two bathrooms on the floor broken so everyone on the floor shared one toilet, one sink, and one shower. The shower was broken and the whole room was wet as a result of it being constantly on. The flush on the toilet didn't work so we had to put up with the stench of its contents as well as look at the lidless bin full of bloody sanitary products and stand in years of accumulated rat faeces whilst brushing our teeth.  The room itself was extremely spartan, and had peeling paint on the dirty walls, but the bed was fine.  Slight concern about safety as there was a patch on the wall where the smoke detector used to";1
I had a terrible experience with this hostel. They were inefficient and rude, and I would never recommend it to anyone. They treated us terribly. I phoned on the day we were arriving to confirm that they knew we were coming as we were getting there late, which they said they did. Then, when we got there late at night, about 11pm, they told us that they did not have space for us and were going to put us in another hostel. We were exhausted, having travelled to get there all day, and this was a dreadful way to be treated. They made us wait alone in the freezing cold outside for a taxi and sent us about 20 blocks away. We had selected this hostel for the location, so to be sent 20 blocks away was unacceptable. If we had known before hand, which they could have told us, we could;1

Very small room as well as the bed (I'm not sure that it is a real queen size bed). There were 4 people in our group so I try to pay extra (10 dollars per night) to upgrade my room to a biggest one. And I pay more (20 Dollars per night)for one single extra bed. They gave me a key to move our stuffs to new room by ourselves. More over, when we are back from our trip in the evening they did not add any extra bed to my new room so I have to call them to finish it and they said they forgot to. Moreover there is no staff available at that time so I have to wait for more than 15 minutes for their staff to finish their dinner!!!  I've heard that hotel was recently refurbished but I don't think so. Room's door was a bit broken as well as bath room door.   There is no wardrobe and the;1
Me and My partner stayed at this hotel between 28th Feb to 4 March 2019, where do I start....  1) when we turned up to the hotel no one was helpful what so ever all stood round chatting while we stood waiting to check in and while we was stood waiting a customer checking was arguing with them due to their poor service.  2) me and my boyfriend ask for some help with getting some tickets printed off so we can a guy down stairs at the desk, when we ask if he could help he very rudely said I don't do that, go down stairs and do it. which at this point was our first 24 hours there so we didn't know we could do that.  3) about the second night in we wanted to go to a comedy club but was having problems booking the tickets so we asking the desk if they could point us in the right;1
I previously had given this hotel a somewhat positive review, partly because for whatever reason they always gave us a free upgrade to top floors that have been remodeled and are ok. On our last visit we were offered a $50 upgrade for presumably a nicer room and a fruit basket and few other trinkets and we declined. They put us in Room 1004. My God! The wallpaper was falling off, it smelled, it was truly disgusting. We couldn't wait to get out of there the next morning. We stayed in the past in part because of the rate but if we have to pay another $50 a night to get the top floors, it isn't worth it.;1

"We very recently stayed in the hotel from the 10th to the 16th of February, we checked out, and left our luggage in the hold behind the reception desk, during the time our luggage was in the hold a pair of $250 headphones were stolen, after arriving home, I rang the hotel twice, enquiring about the headphones, the woman I spoke to said ""well they must have been stolen so there's nothing we can do about it"" and the second time, I asked to speak to the manager and she said ""I have already told you, we can't do anything about it, we don't steal, we don't do that here.""  I am currently waiting to call again to speak to the manager due to the fact I was told she would be back ""in a while.""

This was rated a four-star hotel by Priceline.  The true quality of the room (hardly larger than a queen sized bed) is truly two stars, but the fact that I was given a smoking room after requesting a non-smoking room and the evening manager was unwilling to change the room earns the Empire Hotel just one star.  When I called to complain about the smell of the room, the evening manager, Nicole, said there were no other rooms available.  I then said that I would leave my review on TripAdvisor and she threatened to send Hotel Security to my room if I did that.  Obviously, this is a case of poor training -- not institutional bad behavior -- but I would never risk a decent night's sleep here again.;1
After paying the high price of the room, you also have to pay for parking and thereâs no breakfast included. Plus, we drove a Tesla and to park at the charge ports was a hassle itself. Super annoying.;1
A great location but the shabbiness and disrepair of the facility is hard to take, The greatest complaint was the excessively slow elevators, lack of elevator floor indicators and tiny bathrooms in the regular rooms. The lobby and hallways need a major cosmetic upgrade.;1

I came to town from WA to visit my mom in a hospital down the street. My brother booked a room for me for 2 nights online and at the time of booking, gave credit card information and was charged $50 as a deposit for the room.  After a long day at the hospital, I arrived around 9pm to check in. To start, the person working was very unfriendly and did not make a good first impression. They looked up my reservation and then asked me for a card to charge the room. I told them my brother booked online, but they said there was no payment made. I tried calling my brother, but he lives on the east coast and did not answer the late phone call. I was so tired, so I asked if I could pay for 1 night with my own card and then get everything straightened out the next day. They said yes, but;1
We arrived here in Novemeber a day before my 21st birthday so anyone who has visited this hotel can sympathise on how i felt on my arrival First we sat in the so called lobby area which looked like something out of a scary film while the so called receptionist looked up our reservation....30 mins later we where taken to a room on the 10th floor....as we walked down the corridors the hotel stunk of smoke and mould...not inpressed with the room which had a leaking radiator ratteling windows and just smelt awfull we went back down 10 flights of STAIRS as i was too scared to go back in the lift due to its random juddring and floor stopping We where re located to a more acceptable room on the 4th floor (although the toilet did over flow twice and the showers heat was very;1

When I walked into this dump I immediately recognized it from an episode of Law & Order SVU. It truly looks like one of those hotels that would end up in a show about killers and rapists. It was awful. Half the deadbolt was missing, the mattresses were covered in plastic, there was no water in the shower and the sign for the elevator was written on a US Postal Service label.  The front desk people were unfriendly and dirty as was the hotel. The shared bathroom had a sink that was falling out of the wall. Scary!!!!!  We actually ended up staying out as late as possible to avoid sleeping  here.  Let's just say this place will never see me again.;1
this hotel was horrible! we had come off a 20 hour flight, and were exhausted, and we entered our hotel room and found one double bed that barely fit in the room. we also had a communal bathroom in which we had to share with many others. the doors didnt lock either, which meant we had to take all valubles with us!!!!;1
Was the first time we stayed there.  As we saw the front and the inside we thought it was ok, but when we got into our rooms, OMG! The air vent was hanging off its hinges, the bathroom had mold and the shower was disgusting.  The only good thing was the breakfast and that was the only good thing.  The night staff at the front desk were rude.  Never again will I stay there.;1
"I know this is a long review, but I must get this off my chest. My stay at The Hollywood Hotel, ""The Hotel of Hollywood"" was NOT a pleasant one! Let me start by saying that the original hotel I wanted to stay in stated clearly on their website that they were having renovations done and thus, because I'm on vacation, I didn't want to deal with noise or any inconveniences so I chose The Hollywood Hotel. Big mistake! What This hotel failed to mention on their website and even upon my checking in, is that they too were undergoing renovations! So on Monday morning, while I understand it is a work day for most, the hammering began at about 9:00 AM at a noise level that can only seem to be coming from, literally, inside my room! Â I tried to ignore it in hopes that it was just a quick";1
Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of October, in a nutshell:  It's close to the metro It seems reasonably secure The breakfast is ok for free, don't pay for it though  However...  The area is deprived & obviously rough The rooms are tired & in need of refurbishment The staff could not be more abrupt, rude & generally uninterested in their guests.  On our final morning we were awoken in the small hours by banging on the door, upon answering it we were greeted by armed police asking us to evacuate to reception, several marksmen we're taking aim at a door a couple of rooms down.  Eventually we were allowed back into our rooms, upon checking out later that morning, there was no apology for the disturbance or even an acknowledgement that it had happened.  Needless to say when we;1
My partner and I stayed here in July and were left beyond disappointed with our stay. Within minutes of entering our room we discovered that we overlooked the 'courtyard' which houses all the air conditioning units. Even with our unit turned off the noise from the other units below us was so loud that it even vibrated the bed. We called to see if we could move rooms and offered to pay more for an upgrade but were told they were fully booked. We asked again the next day and were told that they were aware of the noisy room we were staying in but there were no rooms available for another 2 nights. So we did not sleep for 3 nights. Surely the main point of a hotel should be that you get to sleep?!! After the third night we returned to reception to double check they could move us. We;1
Pretty awful. Room was dirty and we found some bugs in the room - possibly (but we hope not!) cochroaches. Door had been kicked down a lot so didnt seem very secure. One positive was that the toilets were clean.;1
"I had several thousand dollars stolen from the room safe.  Chief of hotel security Michael wright said he would contact us but but now I cannot contact him. The front desk will not put me in touch with hotel management and say the issue is now being handled "" legally"" . We payed over $330 for a small room and then had several thousand dollars stolen from the safe. The hotel knows one of their employees took the money . Do not stay at this hotel and most defiantly do not leave money in the safe!!!";1

Horrendous - no heat at ALL in the room on a night that it was 20 degrees.  Noise from the street was unbearable.  The hotel has long term stays and it seems that people are LIVING there.  I would never stay here again.;1
Worse experience EVER! We stayed 2 nights. The first one the room was dirty, with dirty blankets and dirty bathroom. There is a club on the building running all night and the music is too loud to sleep! The second night we got a new room. We arrived at the hotel at midnight and the room had not been cleaned!!! The hotel was full and they wanted us to stay in that dirty room! They were not giving any alternatives. The manager would not speak to us. Till 4 am he did not gave us a solution, which was moving us to another hotel. He wanted us to surrender and stay in that un cleaned filthy room. I booked the hotel through Last Minute. After 40 days I have not received any kind of compensation. Worse experience ever;1

I would not stay in this hotel/back packers place again, when we booked in and went to our room it was old and smelly, the bath was stained on the bottom, the sink was cracked, the TV was from the 60's big and bulky, the wallpaper was coming away from the walls, the carpets were dirty, the hallways smelt bad. We called up and asked for another room and had to pay an extra 40USD each night and we were staying 6 nights. The building creaks during the night and wakes you up. The Internet is very slow (but free). We would not recommend it.;1
To all Scandinavian and European tourists do not stay at The New Yorker hotel! They have over billed my stay with more than USD 1,100. I settled everything when I left the hotel and was according to the receipt handed out promised a refund of  USD 329. Instead, they invoiced me an additional USD 831 after I asked for the refund.  They do not write back and when calling there is no proper answer to get.   Please spread the message to anybody you know so they can avoid being over billed by The New Yorker Hotel.   Also, worthwhile having in mind The New Yorker Hotel is placed in a bad neighborhood with a lot of homeless junkies in the street so not a pleasant place to walk home with your family in the evening.;1
Now this is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The first time was 3 1/2 years ago, and we had a great time. Rates were less than a $100, and they gave us huge renovated clean rooms.  This time, we paid almost 3 times what we paid last time, and our family of 4 got a small recently renovated room on the ground floor overlooking the parking lot. My Indian parents got a smaller, older room, with an incredibly tiny non-renovated bathroom for the same price. We had two mosquitoes in our room, and I spent 30 mins trying to kill them, with thoughts of Zika and West Nile viruses in my head. Next day, I complained at the Front desk, and they said they would send someone to spray something and get rid of the mosquitoes, but non-one came, and we still had them in our room the;1

went to NYC for Beauty con and when we got to this hotel we could not believe how we were treated! The man at the front desk refused us a room meanwhile we had it booked for MONTHS! He was prejudiced against us because my cousin asked to be close to an exit. It was the worst experience I have ever witnessed. We had all our bags and luggage and had to be out in the city streets with nowhere to go. It was horrifying and embarrassing. When booking.com called the hotel they said it was because of the exit thing as well. The man also spoke very broken English which didnât help his unprofessionalism. I strongly advise you to find another hotel!!!! DISGUSTING!! I hope this happens to one of his relatives so he can see how it feels to be left in the street with your luggage for a hotel;1

Wyndham you need to be ashamed.  Where are your standards?  This hotel is a dump.  The only redeeming factor is the location, 94th & Bway which is awesome for express 2/3 subway and the fact that a ton of restaurants are all within short walk.  Other than that, where do you begin?  Elevators.  I can take my office elevator to 50th floor in half the time it takes Days elevator to go 12 floors.  Half the time buttons are out. Half the time one of them is out.  Internet.

First stay booked a twin room but this had not been done had no option but accept it as no rooms available told about the extra charge which had been placed deviously unbeknown to us in the booking paperwork. A ploy now being used more and more by American hotels and you cannot have it removed. Second stay twin room. The foyer is wonderful and that is where it all ends. Upper floor corridors showing their age dingey. The rooms aren't the best and bathrooms are in dire need of refurbishment. The hotel was booked by our travel company we relied on them to provide an acceptable hotel. Their turnover of guests is high and it is always busy. In this environment management are not particularly bothered as they have plenty of bucks coming in. Basically a lot of one nighters. Basically;1

This already overpriced (over $300 per night without breakfast!) hotel added a further $27 per day âFacility Feeâ when we were checking out. When I questioned this I was told it was a âtaxâ. When I then asked one of the managers I was told it was a âmandatory chargeâ. They tried to explain that it covered WiFi and use of the gym (which I didnât even know existed as nobody mentioned this at check-in and we therefore never used!). Charging for WiFi was bad enough until we were then asked for a further $5 per bag to store our baggage after checking out! They want to squeeze every last dollar out of you. Be warned. NEVER AGAIN. And Managementâ¦ PLEASE do not reply with your usual copy/paste âThank you for choosing to stay with usâ¦ we would like to investigate your claims and make any;1

So, they told me go and fill the authorization form for the credit card and you should be ok.So, I did fill the form online and made the reservation.So you should be ok Right? When my wife get there they told her they needed the credit card and you should fill the form 48 hours before and they don't do that at this location for personal reservation.So I called them again stating that I called the customer service at this location and they told what to do and I should be ok.The customer;1

The hallways reeked of a fishy smell. The other elevator was out of service and had a window on its door that had a bullet hole with an ""Out of Order,"" sign posted that was written in marker on a plain white paper.

Our twin room did not match photos on Travelstay website. We had to pay for both nights on arrival - should have asked to see the room first, but unfortunately I didn't! Our room was on the top floor and there is no lift - had to carry a heavy suitcase up and hurt my back in the process! The stairs looked really shabby. Part of the hotel has been renovated but not the floor where we stayed. The corridor was very dirty and shabby. The door at the end of our corridor led to the fire escape and was left open all night - and we felt really unsafe!  Our very small room was unbearably hot and staff refused to turn central heating down. When I wanted to get into my bed, there was hair on my sheet. As I lifted the sheet, I found two other sheets underneath that one - both had hair on;1
Terrible experience at this hotel. Everything is outdated here.

Ok guys I booked this hotel for December for 3 nights with my wife. I booked this in March this year as we are traveling from Australia. Ever since I used my bankcard details to confirm my booking they have been slowly taking money from my account. I have only just noticed this as they have gotten greedy and tried to withdraw $300 from my account!! The manager won't talk to me or return my call.. Please never stay at the hotel!!!;1
Bar was closed, couldn't get ice, front desk was the rude and snotty and literally could not give a crud except one new guy. The bell guys were amazing!!! Maybe, the front deskk should not get paid unless they ar tipped? idk , but they should all be fired except the new people who were amazing and not bitter. The reason I know this is because he said it in order to help an easy situation. Anyways, stay away, it is overpriced and  they need to upgrade their staff, but they don't.;1
Just back from a 5 night stay in NYC, myself & boyfriend were booked into this hotel believing it was a great location right in the heart of city! This is not true! It's on the edge of Harlem right at Central Park but feels very unsafe as not many tourists about! We were booked in to the hotel for 5 nights but after the 1st night we left and booked into 1 at Times Square. The hotel is very basic and externally run down! The receptionist was very ignorant when we checked in (more interested in her mobile) there was a 10 min wait for the 1 elevator in the place! The corridors were very narrow & badly worn & dirty carpets! The room was the Pitts! It was barley 5 feet by feet! Dirty carpets & dirty windows with a lovely view of a brick wall!!

Don't go there. The manager is very rude and disrespectful who doesn't care about his customers. After the first night we complained about the condition of our room that sheets were not cleaned, bathrooms are horrible and rooms smells really bad. In answer manager start cussing for five minutes with F words. We decided to leave the hotel because of his attitude. Long story short we left the hotel in the morning and he charged us for that night and I'm still working with my credit card company to get my money back.;1

I stayed with my family for 4-days in a studio apartment. I would say this is one of the worst hotel stays we have had. The service is downright terrible -- unfriendly and unhelpful staff.  To start with, there was no mattress in the sofa sleeper and it took them two days to find me one, after repeated requests. The hotel room was very hot even though the outside temperature was only 40 degrees F. There is no temperature control in the room, and we had to use the air conditioner (with the attendant noise) to bring the room temperature to a tolerable level. There was no Internet connection available in the room although they advertise that they offer Internet access. There were only 2 towels for the three of us, and we never got the extra towel we requested.  During our stay, we;1
I picked the hotel due to its location and cute cabin style rooms- I didnât expect a huge room as itâs advertised and pictured as a rather small accommodation (if you reserve single cabin). I arrived fairly early in morning and was told there was no room available to check in. Fair enough. I went for breakfast and came back. I sat in lobby and saw multiple people checking out however no room seemed to become clean for me to check in. Hours passed by and suddenly the lobby got flooded by a leak originating from the lobby bathroom. At this point I got up again asking for an update on my room. As I came of red eye flight I was super exhausted and therefore suggested to change the bedding myself to be able to check in. The rooms are super small and to get it turned around 10 mins is;1

When we saw the hotel and the area. We were initially excited until we had to deal with the customer service. First of all, I would highly recommend not booking a room at Empire through one of the cheap hotel sites, or priceline.com, or hotels.com. First, after booking a room for 3 people, we were told that we were reserved for a Queen standard room, with one bed, we told them that we needed double beds and the worker informed us that we would have to pay an extra $100 for our room if we wanted a room with double beds, because they had nothing available. After realizing that we were not going to budge, she then said, we do have a double bed room in the smoking area. We suffer from some breathing issues, but in order to be comfortable, we had to take the room. We were told that;1

The keys for the elevators and rooms constantly demagnitize requiring frequent trips to the front desk and standing in line to remagnitize.  The staff is in denial and not helpful.

we booked through 800-hotels, but called the actual hotel twice to speak with the front desk, once to confirm reservation{made in june} and once to verify that if our plane arrived late checking in would not be a problem. They said both were ok. They lied. We got to NY and at the desk, miriam looked puzzled, said she could not find our reservation, and I showed her our printed confirmation, which was also paid in full. She said she would check with the manager{it turned out that the manager was not even in, some other person in the back was the checker.} They came back after 10 minutes and said that they had had the same problem with several other guests that day-the the 800-hotels people were going out of business and had cancelled our reservations.

We arrived late to our room after a night out. I have stayed here numerous times so this last visit was a surprise how dirty our room was. I didnât notice until the next morning when I was in the bathroom. The bathroom door was grimy with finger prints all over it an some kind of spillage on the bottom of the door, the cabinets didnât look like they had ever been wiped down,but the truly disgusting thing was the toilet seat lid. RealIy really grimy! I sent  a letter to the hotel manager, and to her credit, she called our room right aware and assured me everything would be taken care of right away. When we returned to our room there was a hand written note with an apology and some treats. But the room was still dirty.the bottom of the door had been cleaned. Dirty fingerprints;1

The windows you could not see through because they were filthy. ..no curtains up just blinds that were broken.  The bed linen was clean however they put blankets on the beds which to me is a big nono! !

At Morningside Inn, the idea of customer care is far below the imagined standard, infact they simple dont care about what you get.

There was no safe in the room which made us worried about things being stolen as there ware always people coming and going out of the hotel.

Then, the shower turned cold after 5 minutes, and I was asked by the front staff if ""that got my heart beating"", verbatim. So, in a nutshell, that part of my life is over, and I'm back to the Park Ave. Kimpton where life is well, civil again, and I have a room with correct, livable temperature, no bedbugs, and a shower that provides hot water.

We stayed at this hostel for NYE in London. It's a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith station so thats a good thing. It's basically the only good thing this hostel offers. The floors are sticky, the walls are dirty and the toilets won't all flush that good.   Service is also not that great. When we bought a travel adapter they all did not work and because there was only one guy at the check in desk we had to grab it in the shop ourself en take it to the desk.

The hostel was in a fairly good location because the metro station is about 5 minutes walk from the hostel and it looks new and modern BUT I will not stay in this hostel anymore.   The reasons being:  1. We booked for three beds and were expecting that we could at least share a room together, but was told that it was very full so they had to separate us. That was okay, but when we POLITELY expressed slight dissatisfaction, the staff began to act rudely.   2. As mentioned, my friends and I did not get the same room, so one of my friend was given a key to access to another room, sharing with three other guys. But the key that was given by the rude staff did not work, so we went to talk to that staff. Perhaps he did not like being questioned or he could not handle complaints, he;1

We arrived after midnight and had to park our own car three blocks away, a little nerve wracking for us senior citizens.  The non-smoking king room we reserved was a queen with smoky hallways all the way to the air-conditioned room without no extra blankets.  If we turned the AC off we smelled the smoke.  There was no hot water and the water pressure was negligible, certainly not enough to rinse out shampoo.  Even when we called to have the shower fixed, it was warm for about 5 minutes and then went ice cold again.  One bank of elevators was out of service and the only working one was slow.  After 20 minutes of waiting, we opted to walk down six flights of stairs with suitcases.  The worst, though, was the feeling that we were being judged as unreasonable.  The second;1
There was rubbish on the cloakroom and she was totally dusty. The blanket was dirty and stained. The lamps were dusty. In some corners I could not define if it was mold or dirt. There was a bloodstain in the bathroom on the wall. The drain of the shower was totally rusted, the crane of the shower also.  Upon arrival, nearly $ 400 was required as a deposit, although in advance the entire trip was paid. These were charged to the credit card and have not been refunded so far. Today is the 4th of June and on the 16th of May I left. An hour longer stay in the hotel room cost 50 euros. That's too much! The service was not exactly  friendly and did not prove to me until today what exactly was charged as a deposit. At my request, I always got only the information that it will be paid;1
Our experience here didn't start well... tiny, badly decorated rooms, no doors on the showers or ventilation fan in the bathroom (ie: wet floors and peeling paintwork). No sheer curtains so you have to choose between no privacy and darkness in the room (unless you have a view of a wall in which case privacy won't be an issue).  To top this off a hotel employee unzipped our luggage and went through all our belongings while we were away from the room. Despite the fact that an unauthorised employee had entered our room twice (as seen from the electronic key card report) and they had no CCTV footage to suggest anyone else had been in the room, the hotel management refused to take responsibility or take any action other than sending us flowers. The manager just described the incident;1
This hotel would have been great in the early 90's, but unfortunately it's very dated.   While they are in the process of renovations, there are current issues with lifts being out of action, loud construction noise by the pool and musty smelling rooms / aircon.  Our shower head sprayed in every direction so we had to have baths.  Only positive thing I have to say is that it is close walking distance to universal studios.  I would try the Sheraton down the road.;1
When I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, I came back with welts all over my body! I had at least 100 bites. I called the hotel to notify them, and they did nothing but try to convince me that I got the bites somewhere else. Needless to say I will NEVER stay at this hotel again for as long as I live.;1
We had two double rooms or thats what it said on the paperwork. One room was so small you had to climb over a bed to enter into the room and then climb back to visit the bathroom,the other was a better size but still small and the radiator leaked hot water obviously for a long time as the carpet was soaked to the middle of the room.The plumbing was so noisy in both rooms that it was impossible to sleep.We had views of the rubbish tip.After one night we demanded a room change ,which we got. The next rooms were slightly better, thank goodness we were only there for two nights.This is without doubt the worst hotel I have ever been in,in fact hotel is not the way I would describe this place, my pets are left in better accommodation. This is a dump do not stay here .This place ruined;1
"We were not allowed to use the pool, housekeeping did not clean the room four days of our stay (front desk clerk replied ""housekeeping was overwhelmed""), one morning there was no hot water for showering, we found cockroaches in the bathroom. We asked to speak to the manager and he never showed up. The hotel never answered our emails. Our claims were not heard at all. A nightmare. We want our money back.";1
Not only did they overbook the hotel and send us elsewhere the first night (a huge inconvenience), they charged us for parking during our visit and we didn't even have a car!  We called to ask what the charge was about and after several days of no response, they agreed to credit us the money back but never did.  We ended up having to file a claim with our credit card company to not pay this charge.  I wouldn't stay there again.;1
Had so many problems with check in and hotel staff here I will most likely avoid Hilton from now on. They messed up our reservation, separated our party on different floors even though we booked 6 months in advance and made us feel like our comfort was not important at all.;1
I called the number on the website and booked a room for that night. The agent on the phone asked when I would be checking in and I told her in about 20 minutes. When I got to the hotel the person working the front desk, Anthony, informed me that the reservation was for the following night. This was false. I stood in front of him and called customer service, who confirmed the reservation was for that night, and not the next day. He was unapologetic and slightly rude, as he refused to give me a room, claiming they were fully booked. The agent on the phone was helpful in finding another hotel.;1

when we arrived they said we don't have a room because they tried our credit card and it got rejected. strange. on the same day we paid with this card and everything was fine. after they found a room for us there was a problem with the water and they blaimed us saying we broke the tap. I wonder how can one do that, never heard about it. they shut-down the water in our room for a day and still charged us for a room with a private bath. terrible!!;1
If your room number is between 01 and 10 go and find another room or another place to sleep.  The worst thing is the sound of the ventilation system of the building(?). There is no isolation at the windows and you feel yourself like you are still in the airplane. I was there because of the NY Marathon and really had some difficulties to sleep. The good thing is the location. Location is awesome, especially if you finish the marathon at the central park;1
"My husband and I came to NYC for the weekend, we had never been and were very excited to stay at The Empire. Unfortunately that excitement quickly faded once we got to the hotel. We had a bit of unexpected business to attend to and needed to use their computer/fax room. We scanned a handful of documents to email and apparently the scanner was broken. When we went to the desk the employee simply said ""Oh yeah, it's broken."" She faxed our documents for us and said the manager would refund us the $15. When we checkd back at the desk, a different employee informed us the girl was wrong. They sent a bottle of wine that cost less than what we paid to scan our papers.  The following night we needed a bucket of ice sent up. We waited over an hour for ice. Over an hour. I called the desk";1
Charged my credit card twice the amount as the standard rate, and four months have passed, they REFUSED to refund me!  Cannot believe this!  THis company deserves to be bankrupted! STAY AWAY!!;1
This experience was not a good one.  The service was average. The hotel leading towards our room smelled musty and mouldy. Our room was dark and well outdated. A queen bed only had three pillows, so we had to ask for an additional one. We were most disappointed to get into bed on the first night to discover instead of a quilt we had a thin blanket.  One night we were in bed, it was about 11pm and out of nowhere a male housekeeper was outside our door looking into a cupboard yelling and swearing about having walked up 6 flights of stairs to only find one sheet. I'll leave out some of the choice phrases he used, but he then proceeded to slam the cupboard door, and every other door he used to leave the floor. It was lucky we were both awake, otherwise he would have no doubt woke us;1

We stayed here for a mother/daughter weekend and were disgusted by our experience. Our room was not ready for check-in until close to 4pm (check-in is at 3pm). Once we finally got to our room, the light was broken, the sink was clogged, and the a/c wasn't working. Additionally, the shower was designed without a door so the whole bathroom gets wet when you shower. After discussing our situation with management, we were given a small desk fan to cool the room and towels for the flooded bathroom floor. To add insult to injury, the pool is closed indefinitely due structural damage. They refused to discount our stay. Most disappointing and unpleasant stay...we will not be returning.;1
Stayed in room one week beginning 31st October. Staff very rude. Accidentally left something in the room which seems to have disappeared now!!  Called hotel & was asked to call back later, 6 phone calls later & my property has not been found.  I have no been blocked from leaving reviews via Booking.com!!;1
I cannot stress how filthy, small and horrendous this hotel is!! Barely enough floor space to even open your suitcase, only enough to just walk around the sides of the bed. The carpets didn't look like they have been vacuumed in a very long time and there was an overall grubby smell about the place! There were mattresses and furniture in the corridors so we struggled to get our suitcases past. We had read previous reviews on here but thought it would be fine because we just needed a place to sleep as we were going to be out exploring everyday. However we didn't anticipate how dirty the place would be, dust everywhere, wallpaper peeling off and the air con was so loud you wouldn't of been able to sleep with it on.   Cut a long story short we actually ended up moving hotels (that;1
I had booked a trip here for July which got subsequently cancelled. Iâve sent the hotel countless emails which all get the same response. Refund request with âupper managementâ Absolutely useless.  I think in these trying times a companyâs response is very indicative of what they truly think of their customers and their attitude is shocking. Constantly fobbed off and no one can be bothered to do anything. Never ever book here.;1

Myself and my husband(both in our early thirties) stayed at Riverside for  a 2 night citybreak, shopping and partying holiday in august 2007. We found the 'hotel' extremely basic and felt that it wouldnt be rated as any type of hotel or even hostel in Ireland!! The first day we got there we dropped our bags and left immedialty as its not a place you would hang around in. Getting drunk both nights helped us to sleep in our new abode as we didnt feel comfortable in the place!!!! the 1, 2, 3, subway lines were 2 blocks away on 72nd street. The sheets had hairs on them and there was mould under the bed, however the floor, wash hand basin and fridge were clean. The air conditioning was fine but noisy.

As a solo female traveller I requested a room with other women if possible  and due to health conditions I asked, with plenty of notice, that they kindly keep a bottom bunk for me. The men at reception were friendly enough on arrival. However in my 4 bed room were 2 men, who had both taken the bottom bunks. My only option was to sleep on the floor between two men or upgrade to a private room. At Â£20 extra per night this was kind of worth doing. However the room was too hot, soulless and right by the elevator. The elevator was noisy enough but the bedroom doors are noisy too, thank good as for a white noise app on my phone! Mobile internet signal is poor so you have to pay extra for the wifi. Good kitchen facilities and the best bathroom I have seen in a hostel but I just didn't;1
My husband and I stayed here for 3 weeks, we live in the area and needed a place to stay while our apartment was being renovated.  The only positive thing I have to say about this hotel is that the staff are friendly and try to be as accommodating as possible.    The wifi is not reliable if you need to work, we had no heat for two days which happened to be 50 degrees on both days and raining.  Needless to say we were in our room cold for 2 nights!  If due to budget you must stay at this location please try to avoid a room on the 7th floor! The carpet is filthy in the hall and in the room.  Our room, 727 also had filthy carpet, it smelled like someone recently passed away.  The sheets were clean the bathroom was clean-ish. There is no mini fridge in the room and only one chair at;1

One of the worst hotel experience in terms of hotel staff and room settings.   1. Front desk  Out of three words that front desk lady said upon check in, âlast name?â, âincidental is $150â and âenjoyâ, I sesed that particular person is tired of working and careless about the guest. She seemed to be focused more on how to get thru the day with bare minimum fake smile and minimum conversation as possible. The lobby was empty and there were no other guest waiting for check in or anything. No direction to the elevator nor internet was givin. Great, letâs ask somebody who is willing to help but not her.  The envelop enclosed a room key was dropped on the counter without a word as if you were tossing old newspaper to the couch. Not that I expect a lot but âhow are youâ or any general;1
I am someone who travels a lot for work and typically stay in Westin, Hyatt, Hilton quality hotels. I booked this hotel thinking it was going to offer the same quality. I WAS WRONG! I arrived in at 9:30pm and they checked me into a room that hadn't been serviced yet - bed unmade, garbage in the room They were barely apologetic about that. The rooms are small and stuffy and the AC is loud. Coupled with the busy street noise outside and you can barely sleep. Never again.;1

"The New York Marathon filled many hotels so I booked the ""Recently Renovated"" Astor on the Park based on a 3 star listing ny Tourico and JustNewYorkHotels. The place was a real dump.  The room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and ""other"" odors. There was a leak in the ceiling and roaches running down the walls.  We called JustNewYork hotels and they were rude and refused to switch us to another hotel. The hotel manager offered to change rooms but one was worse than the one we were in; the other, had hot water in the sink, not the shower. Shower enclosures allow water to get on the floor causing leaks and attracting bugs. The TV received only Spanish stations. The location is not convenient, it is near Harlem.  JustNewYorkHotels and Tourico misrepresented Astor as a 3 star hotel,";1
Usually in previous stays in the Empire, I have been pleased with the room and never experienced such a disaster as a heater that would not turn off.  I felt like I was at a stifling summer camp. This room and other rooms on the same floor that were west facing all had issues with overheating.  Windows were inoperable.  I have in the past praised this hotel, but watch out for a miserable room assignment. I will go back because of the proximity to the Met Opera and the opportunities offered for entertainment at Lincoln Center.  Next time, I'll be on guard against a raunchy room assignment, as you should be!.;1
Room 2260: Everything was dirty and moldy in the bathroom! There weâre large stains on the carpet and on the chair. Absolutely disgusting!!    Facility fee: what was it for?! No one at the Front Desk could explain. They just said: âevery guest has to pay it.â No information at all about that before arriving at the hotel (reservation via Booking.com). We feel screwed!!  We asked for a Baby crib weeks before arriving - no answer at all! It seemed weâve been lucky that there was one available upon our arrival. Front Desk Staff tricked us with strange facility fee. Housekeeping staff seemed not to be operating at all. The whole floor in the room was a dirty mess.  Definitely will NOT recommend this place. Fraud with facility fee and totally overpriced for dirty room and lousy staff.;1
"I rarely write bad reviews but I'm afraid this hotel isn't up to par. I requested a street-facing room, and was given a room that overlooked an internal courtyard filled with loud machinery. I would imagine the rooms might have sound-proofing or something to lessen the din (especially as this seems to be a common complaint with guests, based on reviews here). I asked front desk to either find me a room with less noise, or refund me some of the charge for the inconvenience of the noise; both receptionist and evening manager weren't understanding of the issue, apologetic, or able to offer a solution. The noise is a frustrating (and probably solvable) issue, but when basic customer service is amiss it's disappointing; it impacted my stay negatively here.";1

The only saving grace for this hotel is it's location. We travelled by train from Montreal to NYC and this hotel is almost opposite Penn Station. I was previously aware of the 'Facility fee' though Internet research and our travel agent got this removed from our prepaid bill. The hotel say this is a mandatory fee to cover WiFi, phone calls, gym and online check in for airlines. We needed none of these. My wife needed a refrigerator which was $20 but this was waived as it was required for medical reasons. Despite asking for this prior to our stay it wasn't delivered to our room until the second night of our stay. Our room (a twin room) was on the 34th floor. The corridor was dingy and smelt musty as did our room. The room was very small but at least we could move round the beds;1

Basically our travel agent sold us this hotel as one of the most exclusive hotels in NY. The lobby looks awesome but then you get into the reception desk and you find quite rude employes. We were lucky to beeing treating with Jessica, she told all everything was paid for and that a deposit of $45 per night will be kept for security reasons. We agreed as that is standart. We got into the room after beeing waiting for an elevator for 5 minutes and the room was small but we thought it was clean.  On our 3rd day here the hot water stoped working so we phoned to let reception know. I phoned 2 times and they said a person was coming to check what was going on.

My husband and I have stayed at The Jane several times. Weâve always enjoyed it. Itâs in the heart of The Village and you feel like youâre in a Wes Anderson movie. Itâs great value and the shared bathrooms are cleanâthe AC works. Hereâs the punchline though: Our most recent stay involved a room infested with bed bugs. We saw one in our bed the morning after and as the day progressed my husbandâs bug bites appeared with a vengeance. Our New Yorker friends instructed us to return to the hotel and notify them. We did this, despite having checked out. The staff were calm. We told them we wanted the night comped and our clothes and belongings cleaned and they obliged. We waited in a spare room for 3 hours while they did whatever is included in their protocol. They brought everything;1

When she made me aware that we didn't have our own bathroom in the room but would be using a ""shared bathroom"", I should have known this would be a disaster. But looking on the bright side of how cheap it was in a good location in NYC I decided we could grin and bear it. But I have never in my life experienced such a horrible stay in a hotel. The place smelled so bad upon walking into the lobby. The guy at the desk could barely check us in because him and some bums that were hanging out there with him were hitting on us the entire time. Then we go through a series of hallways that look like they were from a horror film to get to the";1
"Let's start with the positive things about the hotel: It's a really pretty building and conveys some of the typical Hollywood flair. The breakfast is AMAZING, a lot of variety, and the staff in the breakfast room was very polite and nice, preparing delicious omelets and waffles. However, I usually do not book hotels for good breakfast, but for service and a great room to stay. Unfortunately, both is not to be found at the Hollywood Hotel.  The rest, quite frankly, makes this hotel not worth the money. Not at all. The concierges at the front desk are not only unhelpful, they are rude, impolite and unapologetic. Words like ""sorry"" or ""apologies"" do simply not come to their mind! Example 1) Having booked the trip through lastminute.com, I had prepaid the trip before online. Upon";1

I was however told by the front desk that they had given away our non-smoking room and they had no other option but to give me a smoking room (this despite the fact that I am a Hilton VIP member).  The smoking room they had given was so filthy and chock full of smoke particles. The ventilator the hotel staff placed in the hotel room was of no use. One of my children (who is asthmetic) had breathing problems, and chose to sleep in our car parked in the Hilton's basement carpark instead (thats how bad it was).   The bedsheets and bathroom were also filthy. We even spotted a cockroach running along the walls;1
The Empire Hotel is across the street from Lincoln Center - After a long evening of opera conducted by Maestro Levine, who needs long intermissions,  imagine walking across the plaza and crossing one street to your hotel room. I imagine that its first floor is filled with light colors, photos and paintings of the performing arts, an area on the first floor set up for afternoon tea after a matinee, late night drinks. Each hotel guest floor has a theme -  How about a few afternoon nutcracker teas?  The hotel experience extends the entire Lincoln Center experience, you make a reservation for your next ballet, concert, theatre weekend even before you check out.  Got the vision?  Now shake yourself because the current management is charging top prices for some of the dirtiest, broken;1
The place is in an unsafe location. Before checking in, outside the hotel we heard a commotion in a place that was close by where a guy ran with a knife chasing another person. We didn't want to check in given the location and were willing to pay one night's rate to cancel the reservation, but Gisele was extremely rude and said that they will not refund our money. Her attitude was very bad. I cant believe this exists in a hospitality industry. Also, we hadn't even checked in. We had booked for 3 nights and the total was close to $350. It is money down the drain for us as we were willing to lose the money than stay there even for one single night.  Booked elsewhere and left the place and didn't look back.;1

"We visited this hotel last Dec 15, 2017 for a one night stay.  I can say that experience to this hotel is terrible from customer service to room amenities due to the following: 1. Front desk officer with the name of Asprid (maybe an alias, that was the name given by Erika when I called the front desk to know the name) was not accommodating and not willing to help when we had a problem in our online booking; 2. Customer service is very poor, they let their customers wait for so long just to answer a simple question, that is, to know the name of the person who assisted us in our check-in; 3. Since breakfast was not included in our accommodation, I asked the front desk if we could just charged same to our room and the answer was yes. Then, the following morning, when we had our";1
If I could rate this hotel with zero stars I would. My stay at the The New Yorker was by far one of the worst experiences I've had period. And as a frequent business traveler this says.   First, I tried to cancel my reservation a week in advance due to schedule changes. Commonly happens in business. To my surprise however The New Yorker would not issue a refund or a credit for a future stay or even allow me to reschedule. For this reason alone, I will never stay at The New Yorker or a Wyndham property ever again, for business or personal travel.   To matters worse, the hotel itself is a run down, dilapidated hotel. The elevators were incredibly slow. The hallways are dirty, in disrepair and have a moldy smell. The rooms are tiny, all the trim and door frames are all banged up;1
If I could rate this hotelâs restaurant as zero I would. We waited for over an hour for food,listening to the family at the table behind us complain that their food was cold on delivery. When ours eventually arrived my husbandâs chips were cold, steak overdone. The worst was our daughter has food allergies and the food wasnât cooked correctly. We queried her meal with 2 members of staff who said they would check but of course they didnât . We were absolutely disgusted with the standard of service and care and we certainly werenât the only Customers who felt the same. My son in law has a business account with this chain and will not be using them again;1

wat can i say!

Room was double-bed instead of queen, got offered stinky smoking room with queen bed, refused, got 'upgrade' to king bed complete with springs poking out, this was replaced with a queen mattress on the king base!  The cleaner flooded the bathroom, said it was all fixed but it happened again the next time we used the toilet!  There was NO TV service to the whole hotel throughout our stay, the sockets in the bathroom didn't work, the tea/coffee in room were not replenished, the furniture was chipped and the carpet was dirty. The wallpaper was stapled to the wall and the carpets were torn in the corridor. The day we left there was a 'Stop Work' order posted on the front door by NYC ordering all work to cease in the basement due to unsafe working conditions.  The only nice thing I;1

I do not recommend staying at this hotel as our credit card was skimmed when paying and over $2,500 in cash advances were taken out over the next 3 days. I know it happened at this hotel as it was the only place we used the credit card on our trip. In addition, the area is very rough and it did not feel safe to walk around at night.  When I emailed management to let them know my issue I received no response - what terrible service!;1
After traveling for over 5K miles and advising this location of my late check-in, we were told our room was not ready and would need to wait for 30 minutes...all of which we were told they would call our name.  We sat in the lobby for over 45 minutes and observed what appears to be a shift change, frustrated and tired - I decided to stand in line to speak with anyone at this point.  When I finally got to the counter, no one knew about our situation so the obvious now is - I do not want to stay here any longer.  A Manager was called and were finally given our keys, by this time - as tired as we were, we were unable to rest after the wait and anger and frustration.  We were offered a $30 voucher for food at the bar which was very crowded, we will NEVER stay here again.  One great;1
I do not recommend using this hotel if you are ever in LA.  It is not really near anything.  It will be a long cab or expensive shuttle to the Walk of Fame, Dodger Stadium, the beach, or the airport.  The hotel itself was not in that great of a neighborhood.  The room was very damp and uncomfortable, plus the carpet was wet when we arrived.  The breakfast was terrible.  The eggs and sausage were very rubber like quality and the milk for the cereal was warm.  They ordered us a shuttle for the airport and said it would cost $89, then the it ended up costing $120.    All in all nothing good to say about it.;1

Run from this place!!Worse than the airlines.Staff could care less.No hot water one day.The fellow next to us at desk was given wrong key and walked in on a couple in bed!!There wasn't room to stand in front of the sink in the bathroom.The concierge was rude.The wifi doesn't work(we had to go to Starbucks).The room was $350.00 per night and they charged $7.50 for a bottle of water and charged for coffee in the room.Not even an ice maker in any hall.Red Roof Inn would be a better choice!!;1
I am extremely disappointed in the condition of our room. The window treatments were stained. Some of the furniture was peeling and also stained. The lighting in the room was terrible. Lamp shades were stained. The bathroom was dingy with only one light. The shower curtain smelled. The mattress was very hard. Everything was very old, worn and tired looking. Considering the location so close to Lincoln Center, Iâm shocked at the condition of our room for the price that we paid. This room is a total gut job.;1
This was our worst decision ever! We booked 10 days in Morningside Inn and we arrieved at 10 p.m. The woman at the front desk  asked us for the payment of the room and we paid for the whole stay before seeing the room (BIG MISTAKE!) when we arrieved to the room it was stinky and totally different from the pictures they have on the internet. The sheets were dirty (see the pictures). The morning after, we tried to talk with the manager (Patrick) but he said he did not believe that the woman didnât show us the room. So he called her to check it, the woman lied and I, suprised, started to tell him that it was true but he became very rude with me and started to call me NASTY.  HOW COME YOU CALL NASTY TO A CUSTOMER THAT SPENDS HIS MONEY IN YOUR HOTEL?!  Take my advice and DONâT GO!;1
I booked this hotel for one night as my flights were changed and no availability at my original hotel for the additional night. We arrived around 10pm and were shown into a room behind the reception desk via an employees only door?? Down a narrow corridor that was cluttered with paint pots and cardboard and was full of dust. Could barely get our luggage through. The only decent thing about the room was the bed was comfortable. Other than that I have nothing positive to say. The room was dusty, the heater made a loud hissing noise every 30 mins and lasted for 5 mins (was told by staff this is normal??), TV didnât work, bathroom was filthy - to the point where I didnât even shower in the morning.   Was woken at 6.30am by some sort of church service going on next door and then at;1
Great location, staff a bit unfriendly as noted in other reviews, storage facility for bags pretty rudimentary (shed round the back with crappy lock) reasonably priced, room looked clean but had nasty attack of bedbugs. Your mileage may vary.;1

There are a few things you might want to consider/ask yourself if you're thinking of staying here. Are you comfortable walking through a maze of doors and hallways that smell worse than a frat house after a night of binge drinking? Are you ok with taking a potentially temperature challenged shower every morning? Are you prepared to be-friend bed bugs?  They have a 'no refund policy', which should have been the first clue, buyer beware. However, at $100/night for a room in Manhattan, it's easy (at first) to forgive a dark, dingy room that smells like a combination of vomit and air freshener combined. I understand that hostel living means that you have to walk down the hall to a bathroom, but I didn't expect to find filthy bathrooms with roaches and trash on the floor. While there;1
One Bad Apple can spoil a bunch! As a frequent traveler and Wyndham rewards customer, I stay at the Days Inn on 94th & Broadway. While Angela and Shayleen are attentive to any problem that may arise, the hotel needs to be invested in. The interior is outdated and in some parts of the hotel down right disgusting. At night the women at reception has been UNHELPFUL , RUDE, and RACIST. I was given 35% off of my next stay at the hotel by a manager and had booked a 2 night stay in which I wanted to apply the discount. Because of her lack of knowledge or maybe the fact that she couldnât be bother I was not able to apply the discount. After booking another reservation... and 45 more minutes of confusion I was sent off into a dirty room. The sheets were dirty ... the bathroom tub was;1
We actually checked this website before booking this hotel but I can only assume the reasonable reports at the time were written by people on another planet.  The place was filthy.  There is building work going on (which we weren't told about) which just added to the mess. Our room was small and in dire need of decorating just like the rest of the hotel!  The staff were helpful and friendly but that was the ONLY plus point.  Avoid this hotel at all costs!;1
"This hotel is undoubtably the worst I have ever stayed in; I don't even know where to begin! Upon arrival we had a lengthy wait to be checked in and were then greeted by rude staff - not exactly what you expect at a supposed 4 star hotel. During check in, I had to hand over my credit card for a fee of $22 for our 4 night stay, when I asked what I was being charged for I was told this was a fee was to cover both of us for using WiFi and the phone. I've no idea why this hotel advertises that it has free wifi when it clearly doesn't - false advertisement must play a big role in how this hotel manages to get bookings.    Before we booked this trip we checked out photos of the room online and we thought they looked fine! Nothing extravagant or overly fancy but nice - we couldn't have";1
Stayed here for family holiday, good location, room clean but very old fashioned, but really annoyed to be charged for left luggage on last day. Five dollars per item (our bags were small, but five in total - so twenty five dollars). This on top of paying over one hundred and thirty dollars in taxes. Prior to staying here, after booking, called to confirm reservation and were told twice they couldnât find our booking. In a saturated market, this just isnât good enough, definitely would not stay at a Wyndham hotel again. Would not recommend.;1
My husband, my 3 year old son and myself came to the days inn on December 9, 2016. When we got off the tiny broken down elevator the smell hit us like a ton of bricks. The walls were filthy with stains all over them. When they opened the door to our room we were in shock. It was the most disgusting hotel room I've ever seen. Wallpaper peeling off the walls, a hole In the wall. Blinds were broken and cracked. The heater on the floor was layered in inches of dust and dirt. The air conditioner was filthy, the tv was old and didn't work, the mattress had holes in it. The floors looked like that hadn't been vacuumed in years and the smell was awful. We immediately had to find a new hotel room and fast. So we had to re pack the car and pay more money for another room. I was afraid to;1
This was our 3rd stay at The Empire, its previously provided a convenient location, even if the rooms are small.  As reported by others an incident happened shortly after midnight on Fri 23rd June, resulting in the Security Director making confusing and conflicting announcements. Was there a fire, was it necessary to evacutate?? Not clear to us , nor others gathering in corridors to try to decipher what was being said in ever louder announcements.  We took the emergency staircase to exit the hotel, just in case.  The stairwell was in total darkness, no power, no emergency lighting, lots of people using phones as the only lighting. Total confusion amongst guests as to what was happening.  After milling around outside with no further information we returned to our room and heard;1

Find somewhere else to stay.  Other than the location and hotel history this is a property to avoid.  I was a resort manager and found this property to be very poorly run in virtually every area.

Everything was old and in only fair condition if not poor condition.;1

He definitely has ZERO clue what customer service entails. Having a conversation with him was absolutely impossible.

Thanks to Travelocity and Expedia for their efforts in facilitating a refund.;1

I shall keep this brief, and not give a full description of the debacle that was our 36 hour stay in this awful hotel.  We had a late check-in - 11.45pm and had been travelling for almost 24 hours when we arrived at this hotel to be greeted by an indifferent receptionist who checked us into a smaller room that we had booked. We were too tired to object and decided to rectify the error in the morning as we had booked to stay for 3 nights. The room, 117 was small, dingy and dark, with a dirty bathroom.   Reluctantly they gave us another room 256, which was larger however the loo flooded the bathroom. Only after we insisted to be moved were we given another room - 111 which was of the same ilk as 117. At 11.30pm that night the door opened and two people started to enter the room -;1

I have never written a bad review, however guests need to be warned about this hotel.   I checked in after traveling approximately 36 hours. Check in was easy.  My room, however, is musty, the bathroom light flashes on and off (bad switch), hot water is iffy, and the furniture is dirty.   I was hungry.  I went down to the bar, which was fairly busy, with 3-4 guys hustling.  I sat at a dirty table for about 20 minutes with no service.  Other people were having similar issues.  People were going to the bar to pay their tab, when they should be paying their server.   I gave up and went to the front desk. Very nice gentleman there apologizes for the lack of service, tells me that their main restaurant is closed because of the âbaseballâ game, and gave me $40 of credit for room;1
I second all of the negative reviews I just read through.  Okay, who is getting the $50 and $80 rooms?  My rate was $129 a night - now I feel even more ripped off.  For that I don't expect Trump Towers but I do expect - no rodents, no hair on the blankets, TV reception of more than 1 station, rooms larger than my home walk in closet, beds that have no sharp edges that cut me on the ankle.  What else awaits you here... stinky elevators, shabby carpets, bathrooms that are left in a shambles with water all over the floor and make you want to thoroughly clean them before you take your own shower.  I laughed at the comment about the weird hippie guy in the lobby, I remember him.  The only good comment I have is that the owner did try to make things sort of right and he tried to find;1

For the amount of money I spent on the room the view was horrible and in the end they wanted you to pay for wifi....when it's free at Starbucks imagine that.   I just joined trip advisor for this and I wish I did before I would have known, it shows a lot when the manager of this hotel only replies to good and excellent reviews and doesn't even apologize for bad ones.  An apology does help and shows that you care about your customers and this hotel and their staff do not.  The Hilton is;1

Seriously, it's a terrible hotel. I stayed here for a work trip as it was in a good location but that's about the last good thing about this place. There's a big difference between having a vintage aesthetic and simply having old furniture and decor. Long lines in lobby. Understaffed front desk. No concierge to speak of. Guests always have show key card to rude attendants. Elevators slow and stinky. Hallways are musty, worn and dim. Room key worked half the time (made many trips back down to front desk to wait in line). Carpets are disgusting - at least a couple decades old. Chair is even worse.  Old and stained, definitely did not want to sit in the stanky ass thing. Lighting is real bad - like staying in an old 80's Beijing apartment. Water pressure was amazing though. No;1

We said no and they said well there has been complaints by residents who said its being used as a hotel. We said we were staying the night and they told us that it is not allowed to be used as a hotel and who did we get the room from. I said travelocity and they said well try and get your money back.

We stayed for 5 nights, upon arrival myself and my friend got told to wait because he was eating we weren't greeted upon arrival, the room was beside a building site very noisy, we had our own private bathroom and shower we had to go back and forward to the communal bathroom to get toilet roll because they wouldn't put some in our room, the water from the private shower was freezing cold we could not take a shower had to go to the communal shower, there was no pots pans to make food, it took 3 days to get an extra pillow and took 3 days before they came to look at the radiator because the room was so cold, we then got a tiny heater sent up to us on our 3rd day stay the staff are rude and ignorant, the fire doors where left open all night by people smoking it was very annoying;1
I purposely reserved the Ameritania hotel because of the location. I had prepaid reservations and when my wife and I arrived they told us that they overbooked the hotel and due to renovations they couldn't accept my reservations.  They ended up pushing us to their sister hotel which placed us to a 20 min uber ride outside of all our planned events instead of just walking distance. The room was filthy, water leaks along the window,  stains in the tub and torn carpets. Since I prepaid through a third party I couldn't cancel the reservation without losing money. Due to being sent to another hotel we also incurred additional charges since we had to uber/cab to the places that would have been in walking distance. I could only suggest to anyone thinking of this hotel or the Bentley to;1

"My stay at the Hollywood Hotel was abysmal. I stayed two nights and at the end put my bags into storage in a ""secure"" storage room at the hotel. When I returned to pick them up they were gone. One of the staff members was so rude and told me ""well tough luck, you signed a contract."" Once the LAPD were called they viewed the security footage and said they saw someone take my bag and vanish. The hotel management subsequently refuse to answer or return any of my calls, emails or letters. Besides the theft I was given a room with cockroaches in it and the hotel staff refused to move me, which is totally unacceptable. The saving grace of the hotel is the kitchen staff, they make a great breakfast and even offered to help me find the person who took my bag. I will never stay at this";1
The price was right, and the fact that it was opposite Central Park and close to the Subway....But that was it!  Our shower drain and sink plug was not working, we complained for a few days, and then finally had someone come look and fix it.  Discoverd on the 5th day, that the window in our room didn't lock at all!!!!!!  Was quite upset about that....took 2 days to have them fix it!  Did not replace washcloths and or towels, we had to ask for that quite a few days in a row.  Then the kicker was that I had a bag of gifts/souveniers stolen from our room.  When I went down to inquire...an hour later that bag re-appeared with one picture that I had bought still missing but the rest was intact!!  They said the maid thought it was garbage!!

"The room is 50sq ft.  It includes a single mattress on a wooden bunk with two drawers underneath and a space to put your luggage (also underneath).  There are two shelves that are not even a foot wide.  There is no closet and no hangers, only small hooks. There is no sink in the room, unlike most other hotels that have bathrooms in the hallway.  There are more than 50 rooms per floor, all sharing a total of four showers, two large sinks, and four toilets.  Not surprisingly there is a strong smell of mildew that was almost overpowering especially when brushing my teeth.    They charge your credit card an extra $50 a day ""for incidentals"" (which is supposed to be refunded afterwards) but there are no apparent incidentals to purchase.

"So so disappointed with this place...but let's start with the positives. Location is excellent and some staff are very friendly.   Negatives: the pool is closed indefinitely with NO warning whatsoever. We pay a premium for a hotel with a pool, we have 2 young children, yet as my booking is ""non refundable"" I am told I can't get my money back. No director available today to override this.  They have no rollaway beds. I had to borrow a blow up mattress from my friend so both kids can have a bed. (Again no mention on the website).  Moreover I ask them at 1.30pm to make the pull out bed (for the other kid), again at 6pm, and at 9pm it is still not made. I am then given sheets, duvet, pillows and pillowcases. I have to make the beds myself. Yes. I made both beds. Just never";1
The hotel has no parking, they referred me to 2 garages that were full. I had to find a garage on my own 4 blocks away. Most of the staff were typical new york rude, and all of them spoke broken hard to understand english.  Homeless people panhandle  30 feet from the entrance to the hotel. The rooms are EXTREMELY small and they only have one elevator that holds 4 people comfortably. The conceirge is useless and hardly speaks english. The maintenace staff was very good.;1
We have just left this hotel after staying for 3 nights and i felt compelled to warn other people to stay away. I rarely review hotels on trip advisor. The place is dirty, i questioned if the room had been cleaned before we arrived (shampoo in shower half use etc). The staff are rude and super unhelpful and just tell you anything you want to hear so that you stop asking questions. The one plus side was the hotel restaurant where the staff were actually polite and service was great.  There are so many amazing hotels in New York to stay, i would recommend that anyone traveling here keep looking when you come across this place.;1

The bedroom en toto was too small with a very uncomfortable, very small bathroom and no coffee maker in the room. The room had been painted but they did a sloppy job of it. Couldn't get consistency of the heat/cooling system. They should probably combine 2 rooms together in an upgrade.;1
"I was just about to write the hotel a letter about my recent stay, but thought it might be more effective to simply warn others away.  I recently had a one-night stay at The Empire. It was my second stay at the property, which is one of the preferred properties of my company. My first stay was unfortunate, loud, and tainted by really lackluster service. However, last week's stay was tear-inducing.  Like @alsmith031's post below, I showed up for my non-smoking reservation and was ""tricked"" into a smoking room on the 4th floor. When I called to ask to be switched, I was told that no other rooms were available. (Even though I had checked in late, and had a mere one-night reservation.)   When I physically went to the front desk with my luggage, they miraculously found another room.";1

If you find yourself desperate for an affordable place to stay in lower NY city, this might be the place.  However be warned.  My room did not come with a flat sheet and had an unclean duvet.  After two conversations with the reception she was still unclear on the difference between a flat and fitted sheet.  Please consider.  Have you ever stayed in a hotel in the US with only a fitted sheet?;1
This is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in from the moment the Taxi pulled up outside the place i was feared the worst, there is scaffold in all round the building, when we walked into reception area it was like a cattle market all people waiting for pick ups layed all over floors and chairs,  when we checked in thought the woman was very rude and not really interested, we were given a room on the 9th floor (915 avoid all all cost). we waited for the lift and waited and waited there was only one lift working out of a total of 4 i have seen in previous reviews this as been the case for months, it was really warm waiting in the lobby area with the amount of people that were hanging around. when we finally got the lift to our floor the 9th and the doors opened i was;1
Horrible experience at the New Yorker.   We had to charge one of our phones in the bathroom, not to mention the fire hazard plug socket behind the bed!!   Room was tiny, our luggage took up most of it! We couldnât move around much in the bathroom at all. Room was very dated and dirty (marks on the headboard which was very off putting!) - the walls were so thin all we heard was walking about in the hallway all night, alongside our neighbours being noisyâ¦. VERY thin walls!!!! Awful night sleep.   We got there about 11pm at night due to a late flight, stayed one night and left a day before we were due to because of the sheer state of our room. Hotel reception were very poor and not very helpful or sympathetic at all.   Currently speaking with our agent we booked this through to;1
The staffs are understaffed and very rude. The room is a bit antiquated for a Nice Hilton standard. It took me almost an hour to check in and I was really tired. I had traveled from east coast and landed there around 3am which makes it 6am. One guy was working all the guests, it was unbelievable. Plus I was there for doctor conference traveling with my office manager only. They charged breakfast for four people and tried to get away with billing me. When I confronted the staff, they were rude and said they were right. I had to walk over to restaurant myself for resolution and was late to my meetings for which I stayed for. Horrible.;1
"I usually stay at The Jane but this was my last trip there. It was the first time I got one of the smaller rooms and we did this as there were no Captains rooms available.

It cost $160.00 for the night which I know is considered a bargain in NYC but we got NO sleep and left pretty upset the next day. I know ""It's Only Rock and Roll"" but I don't like it.";1

Advertised as recently updated this place was a disaster. If I could have moved I would have. Disrepair does not describe it. Torn and stained window shades, dead cockroaches, furniture found in a dumpster, smelly, tub rusty and chipped, vanity door hanging off and the list goes on. I asked to be moved  and it was a bit better....but just a bit. Thank goodness it was one night only. Requested towels, blankets, coffee and cups from management. No surprise, never received.

Hi four of us booked in on saturday the 2nd until thursday the 7th and i ended up leaving a day earlier, i dont know where to start as its a joke of a place, firstly nobody cleaned your room thats ok for a night or to but 5 days is a bit much secondly on sunday night one of us flushed the toilet and it overflow luckily one of us had the cop on to lift up the toilet system, we rang the reception and they told us that nobody would be there till the next day so we had to put the towels all around the toilet  so we had no towels for the next day. we looked for a different room and it was such an effort but eventually we got a new room and they thought that they were doing us a favour, we asked for clean towels and at first we were not getting them but in the end he gave them. all i;1
We reserved and PREPAID a room several weeks in advance.  Even checked into that exact room type when our plane landed, hours before arriving at the hotel.  Did that hold our room?  NO - THEY GAVE IT AWAY! Forced us to take a smaller (and incompatible) room without providing compensation or even an explanation of what happened.  AVOID THIS HOTEL unless you are willing to assume the risk of a similarly terrible experience.;1
I've been to many hostels during my studies so I knew what to expect from an hostel. Of course you don't get comfort and all the strings attached but at least hostels are a great opportunity for socialising (and saving money). Well this hostel is not. The common rooms are non existent. Kitchens too small. We didn't socialise with a single person in 5 days.   Furthermore the bathrooms and showers were very cold (and shared with at least 40 people per floor).   At night there is a mess you can hear every single door of your flat slamming open and closed.  Rooms are too small, especially the four bed room, enough for 1 or 2 days but not for more.  Wi-Fi is supposed to be paid extra 5 pounds for only  5 hours of connection per week.  Staff is really really rude and they don't do;1
This place is grubby and dangerous. The only plus side is that the bedsheets and towels were clean but that was it!! The towels often had holes (clean holes). The bathrooms were disgusting with rotten doors presumably eaten away from water damage at the bottom. The tiling (floors and walls) were gross and needed to be scrubbed at least but realistically needed ripping out. The carpets in rooms and particularly corridors were dirty and sticky (you certainly wouldn't walk barefoot anywhere!). Paintwork was the brown paint which you get when you mix all your left over paint together and then let a child paint the woodwork. Truly low standards. Plug sockets hanging off walls. curtains dirty and difficult to open/ close as rails were mucky. Windows did not look like they'd been;1
We started to worry at the smell of urine in the corridor on the way to our room.  It got worse when we killed the first cockroach on the bed.  The wallpaper was peeling, the room was generally grubby, and the blinds had to be kept shut at all times as the view was of other rooms. A request for a hairdryer was ignored for 30 minutes and then we were told there were none available.  We were not expecting much from a moderately priced hotel, but this was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.;1

"The good: Relatively inexpensive, OK service and nice UWS location adjacent to subway station...  The bad: This is a dive of a hotel, that while not dirty or unsanitary per se, has that ""perma-filth"" that becomes embedded in properties that are old, poorly maintained and never updated/upgraded. Industrial fans in guest floor hallways in lieu of AC, poor lighting, old ratty furniture and linens, cracked tiles and damaged fixtures in bathroom, etc., etc... Also, zero access control/no security or visibly working camera system. I entered and exited unacknowledged and/or unnoticed several times; would not feel comfortable allowing a female member of my family to stay here alone. Perhaps fine for international budget travelers and those who are accustomed to ""roughing it"", but to me,";1
Me and my girlfriend stayed here for the weekend and it was just a bad experience. I really don't ask for much in a hotel, I'm very low maintenance and easy to please, so when I say this place sucked take my word for it. When checking in, we waited about 20 minutes for a receptionist. We were charged an extra $30.00 per day for hotel amenities  ( international calling/gym...which we didn't use once), and then given the wrong room. After calling we got moved to the right room, which was insanely small. The room was bare with nothing but a tiny t.v, the bathroom was even a disappointment. In the shower it took fifteen minutes of messing with the knobs to get it to a bare-able temperature, then fluctuated from freezing to scalding the entire duration. If I had to find something;1
My husband had the flu and passed out in the foyer of the hotel. The staff were very helpful initially. I got my husband back to bed with the understanding a doctor was on the way. After waiting an hour I tried ringing the concierge, the front desk and room service. I could not get anyone to answer the phone.  A guest in a foreign country is very daunting when you cant get assistance. I finally went downstairs and asked how long before I could expect the doctor. They then inform me that a doctor had not been called and if I wanted one I should just ring 911. I was gutted.;1
I am currently staying at the Jane, and it is terrifying. Last night around 2 AM when a whole bunch of people were banging the doors around me I put my head out into the hall and asked someone speaking loudly next to my room to keep it down, He tried to strong arm into my room. Throughout the night, you will hear nonstop banging of doors and you will have terrible sleep. Men will harass you  and since the bathrooms are shared, you will receive unwanted advances when coming to and from showers. Iâm a seasoned traveler and this is the most harassment Iâve ever received in a hotel. Canât believe i have another night to suffer through;1

If I could rate it zero I would.  This hotel has no service at all. You can't even pull up in front the door to check in since there is no one to help.   Other guest were honking for us to get out of the way while we were advised by the reception staff to unload our Luggage.  We had to wait for our room to be ready even though it was past the check in time.  The light switch did not work by the door and the air conditioner blew warm air. We called the first night and the front desk insisted that we needed to wait all night to feel it cool down. We did and it didn't. We tried to call the second night after a whole day in the hospital and the phones weren't working. We called the next day and they assured us it will be fixed. It wasn't. The remote control didn't work and the;1
"I booked this hotel for one night during a quiet week and arrived early hoping a room was available for early check-in.  Desk confirmed they did in fact have rooms ready, but that there is a $50 ""early check-in fee""!  I have traveled around the world and stayed in countless hotels and have NEVER been asked to pay a fee for early check-in, even in the famous ripoff town of Vegas.  I decided to store my bags and avoid the fee, and found the hotel charges $5 PER BAG to store bags for their guests!  Finally, upon check-out I noticed a ~$35 ""resort"", or ""destination"" fee (can't remember exactly what they called it).  I know these added fees, which are not made clear at time of booking are becoming more common...but still a clear ripoff.  It is no wonder AirBnB is taking so much";1
This is not trying the service was not good and the rooms are pretty nasty. Not worth the price! The shower had no door the room was always hot and the check in check out staff was not friendly at all!;1
Watch out: it is shabby, dirty, noisy and everyone is truly unprofessional.   After two months, we still do not know what we were exactly charged for. Isn't it our right?  NO, AT HOTEL EMPIRE, YOU GUESTS HAVE NO RIGHTS.   We were a group and reserved in March for October.  Each one of us was shocked upon arrival to see that the rooms were completely different from the ones showed in photos. One of the guests left to go to another hotel. Rooms were dirty to the point that they had to change many of us. Black water was coming from the sink. The AC was loud and either too cold or humid.There is no place  The reception was a true mess.

The front desk agents, Natalya & Sandra, were the worst people in hotel business I have ever met. They were very good in making people feel very uncomfortable and dissatisfied. Every question that we asked was answered rudely and unprofessionally. Just a friendly suggestion to the management: Please replace those two staffs or do something about it. It's a shame that you are in a hospitality business but your staffs know nothing about hospitality.;1
I was a guest at the Empire Hotel in New York about a week ago and I can honestly say: NEVER AGAIN! There were several issues with my room that I was extremely unhappy with and which I addressed right at the first night at the Hotel but I did not receive any help from the staff. I asked to speak with a Manager in charge more than once and they found excuses for me not to talk to someone. The room I was staying in had bugs all over the place, in my bed, my bathroom, on the window shelfs, my desk, etc. They were everywhere! The room itself was small, VERY dirty and old. The tiles in the bathroom were  coming off the wall, coding on walls and doors were coming off, etc. My sheets were also dirty and even though I asked for them to get changed, that did not happen.  I booked a king;1
I was in a bind and chose this hotel out of desperation and regret it.  I knew nothing of it's reputation as a place that has appeared in TV shows and movies. The decor is 20 years out of date. The lobby is basically a night club after 5pm and the furnishing show lot of wear and tear.  My room was on the interior side so dark that even at midday it felt like midnight. The furniture, carpet and drapes looked just as old as those in the lobby and was torn and stained.  The bathroom was ridiculous. The sink faucet was so low that it nearly touched the bottom of the sink making basic functions like brushing your teeth or washing your hands nearly impossible.  This new trend in hotels to do away with shower curtain in favor of the half-glass wall and some water saving shower head;1
The information on the website is inaccurate: pictures are created by putting together pictures of beds and furniture!! Contrary to the website, there is no 24-hour service reception (desk closes at midnight), there is no security guard, no public or separate sitting areas - the only public space is in front of the Inn where lodgers talk until past midnight (front rooms very noisy as a result!!). The kitchen is not adequately equipped and the cleaning service is DISASTROUS: our sheets and towels were not changed for over 5 days, the trash was never emptied, while the floor carpet is worn out and spotted!! No need to mention that complaining to the staff is unnecessary as customer satisfaction seems to be their lowest priority... To conclude: it is a cheap place to stay, but the;1

My daughter had a NYC night included in an airfare-this was 2 stars-but unbelievably ragged, unkempt, noisy neighbors, minus a 1 star. One can find a much healthier accomodation. Front desk person, however, was very good.;1
We would have rated this 3 but the maid used lots of my partners Lamer cream which is rather expensive. Appalling.   Positive. Good location. Time square ten minutes walk.   The room we had was tiny. Paid $25 per night for a room with a view but the window was so filthy it kind of ruined it.   Obviously an old hotel but been refurbished. The room is okay but the bathroom is poor and very cramped.   If all you want is somewhere just to sleep itâs okay and weâll located. Just donât leave anything valuable in your room.;1
Unless you plan on living in the lobby -which is truly gorgeous) (and love the bad 80s music), don't stay here. The rooms are super overpriced for what you get. I am from NYC and was blown away by the nastiness of the rooms. The room amenities are literally falling apart. The beds are uncomfortable, the wallpaper is peeling off the walls, the bathroom frosted door was drawn on and covered in mold not to mention the handle broken and toilet runs constantly. The a/c rattled and was covered in water and mold, the coffee make didnt work, the carpet was shredding and had crazy sticky stuff on it that stuck to your feet like gum. The internet also when in and out and was as fast as old skool dial up.   I know the hotel is old and that is fine but for over $400 a night, the rooms;1

The food at the little restaurant was awful and over priced. The service at the hotel you would feel they had a full house, but there were literally 6 of us sitting around... I had to get up and get the attention of the staff EVERY time I needed something. We did not eat there again. I was given a food voucher after complaining. Which wasn't helpful really because we did not want to eat there again. Then when we went to use the voucher at the cafeteria, they still charged my Visa for the voucher. I told the front desk lady when I checked out that I had a food voucher and to remove the charge. She did not. I had to call a 1-800 # and wait 10 days to see the credit on my card.  Over priced for what it's worth. Stay elsewhere and use uber. I had better service and value in 2 star;1

In early September, I contacted the Empire Hotel directly to book two adjoining rooms.  Normally I would book online via Expedia or through the hotel's website.   I called the hotel directly to ensure that the two rooms I was booking would be adjoining.  My family of four with two kids would be staying the two nights in New York and I wanted the two adjoining rooms.  I didn't see a way to do this online.  I requested a king and a double room that connected.  The reservations person said they could do that and include a common living room between the two rooms.  That sounded great.  The first price quoted per night for both was over $700.  I was offered a lower price for the king and double room at $600 if I went non-refundable.  I took that and paid for it.  The total came to;1
After doing a lot of research i was pleasently suprised to find a hotel at such good value in such a good location but there was good reason for this!

The pictures show you the back of the hotel the front is a dive and very poor the room was absolutely frozen in the evenings.

Ten minute waits for elevators (in a high-rise hotel) because 3-out-of-5 elevators were out of service. You can imagine how aggravated the people in that line are (and pray your kid doesn't press the buttons for every floor -- that was one of the ugliest sights I've ever witnessed).   If you're a Hilton Honors member traveling on business, you should know that this is a hotel that caters more to families than to business travelers. If you're like me, you're looking for something clean, efficient, with minimum hassle. Unfortunately, this property is not up to normal Hilton standards.;1
The rude staff was awful. Nobody could even use a kind tone. They were short and spoke to adults as though they are children and nobody smiled. They could not be bothered. The place was dingy and the area wasnât so much desirable. We wonât come back to this hotel.;1

"We had confirmed reservations for 3 nights but when we arrived, we were supposedly on a ""waiting list"". They accommodated us in not one but 2 separate rooms because the newly trained staff did not have the authority to have a roll-away bed put into our room for the 3rd person. We ended up paying $100 for each room. They made us check out the next morning so they could put us in one room, but then again made us check out and check back in the 3rd day. All this was very inconvenient especially when we had plans to tour the city. The nightmare began when we came back at 4:30pm the 3rd day to check back in. There were no rooms available, except for 2 rooms that were recently fumigated for an infestation of ants. We asked to view the rooms and decided the first room smelt too";1

The hotel have basically attempted to keep my deposit.

When we arrived on this past Friday to check-in we were placed in a ADA room. When I asked why, the front desk clerk informed me that this is what I had requested. I would have absolutely no reason to request an ADA room and told him so. He then said ""well sir, you booked through a third party, and this is the room they placed you in"".

Hotel is listed as a Hollywood property but its on the way end of Hollywood and not such a great part of town.   Parking is excessive at $15 - plenty of street parking.  Breakfast is a joke.  Rooms were small.  Elevators? - plan on waiting 3-5 minutes to get to your room and there are no stairways as an option to the super slow elevators.  Only positive thing to mention is the free internet service and maid service and room was clean.  ok for 1 night, but not beyond that.;1

I made a reservation for a suite at least a month in advance to have two beds in the same room but a place to get away after our 5 year old went to sleep.

Elevators are not enough. One of the days there were only 1 out of the 4 of them working. Ridiculous. Really in bad state, needing an urgent renovation.

We were in the 12th floor out of 13, and the traffic was so loud we thought the windows were open.  The air conditioner left a funny smell, really bad.

We travel all over the world with the family and I would have to say this stay was the worst experience ever.  Fist the hotel is over rated, honestly it doesnt deserve more than 2 stars and it has a rating of 4 stars. The service was awful overall.  The pictures on the website do not do justice to this place. $60 for valet per night which we had agreed on turned out to be $60 every time you exited and reentered the parking which means if you had to go out and come back for three times during that day you would end up paying $180 for that night and thats what exactly happened with us. Rooms are extremely small. theres a lot more to complain about but I think this is enough for anyone reading this review;1

"Couldn't take it anymore...you have a right to know.  The loud music beyond midnight (12:30 am Thursday was the last time I had awakened from the noise) from the club downstairs was the last straw.  So here's my laundry list of why this hotel gets a FAT ""F""!:  Loud music beyond midnight (why put me on the 1st floor directly above a club - com'n, it's not that hard) Dirty carpet Stinky rooms (switched rooms and chose the lesser of 2 evils) Broke phone (the only preprogrammed button that worked was the emergency button) Dirty walls (various stains and dirt marks) Dirty mattress (just plain nasty) Flies (one really aggressive one too) Inoperable light (2 working lights - the bathroom and the nightstand light) Broken remote ( had to stand next to the tv to change channels with the";1
"What started as a fun trip to the city quickly turned bad when we checked into Morningside Inn. After driving through the night and going all day around NYC we were looking forward to getting to our ""hotel"" to relax at 2pm check-in. As soon as we walked into the building we were greeting by questionable people milling about and or yelling, and the less than friendly receptionist. We handed over the room fee of $155 in cash along with a credit card to hold as a ""safety deposit"" and we were pointed to our room with the exact words ""just go through that door over there"", an unmarked door that led to a sketch narrow and short hallway. By this point when we even opened the room to the door we were not in any surprise to what we found. The radiator appeared to have been leaking for";1
We are a family of four and stayed for 4 nights last week.  We had been travelling for a month and I had printed the website for each hotel before travelling to recall expectations and confirm advance payment, etc.    The room photos on the website are nothing at all like the rooms on offer.  After checking our room, we asked why the rooms were not those advertised.  Front desk advised that only the modern, renovated rooms were on the website.  We asked to move to one but found out that less than 1% of the rooms were renovated and those were in use.  We were stuck with the remaining run-down, very dirty, run-down rooms.  Very disappointing.  Front desk staff advised that we could raise this issue with management in a narrow set timeframe the next day but the time was too;1

"I was very dissapointed with the staff at the Empire Hotel. The staff in general were rude and immensely unhelpf to assist with any queries or concerns I had. On numerous occasions I asked for assistance with various matters and was always met with a frank and unhelpful ""No"".  On one evening, the hotel boiler broke. Meaning a complete lack of hot water. I find this unacceptable for such a highly graded hotel. I called reception to enquire about the remedy time and was told ""it will be fixed when it's fixed!"" No alternative was offered and a very unconvincing apology was offered.  Each evening we visited the lobby bar, however the bar staff always refused to serve us. We was always rudely told it was waitress serivce only. However, there was only a single waitress, who was hard";1
Visited NYC with 2 kids for spring break and wanted a room with a living area. I initially booked a one bedroom, the next day I called and was âupgradedâ to a business suit.  Oh boy, that unit looked like someone had just lost all their belongings. Then picked up a few furniture from the dumpster. The head board fell off when I was trying to lay down. It took them about one hour for someone to come look at it.  At that point, I requested another room, and that took another while. All this time, none of the staff apologized for the inconvenience, they felt bothered. There was one guy who cared a little bit but I was too frustrated to get his name!  Donât get me started on the view, the view from both room are of huge dumpsters. Donât be deceived by the fake pictures of a;1
It was a great stay until it wasnât. On the last day of our stay, we requested and paid for valet parking for an extra night while we explored the city so that our car would be in a secure facility. That night, we texted to retrieve our car at 7:47 and when we arrived in the lobby at 7:54 our car was already out front. Seems fast right? Wrong. Turns out our car in itâs âsecure facilityâ had been sitting in the road for more than an hour because they had supposedly had a call about it. But the room number and ticket provided by the valet did not match our ticket, even though it was our car. On top of that, the valet didnât even initially ask for our ticket, they just handed us keys to the car because we said it was ours. There was nothing to prevent them from giving the keys to;1

I entered my room to find a large BEDBUG crawling across the top of the bedspread.  I killed the critter, brought it down to the front desk, and asked for a refund.  I was told that the manager had left for the night, and that I would be given a refund if I called the next day.  Fortunately, I was able to find another hotel with a room vacancy that night.  But despite calling the Days Inn several times in the days and weeks that followed, I have yet to receive a refund...;1
Maybe I am one of the few to say this but it was pretty gross. Not only was there mold in the toilet and shower but hair from previous visitors.

We arrived on a Friday evening at 2200hrs after a long train journey from Toronto. We were tired & hungry. The receptionist was not at all helpful & just 'went through the motions' - demanding our passport & credit card details, issuing our room key & pointing to a space saying 'Elevator that way!' The corridors & lifts were shabby & not very clean & our room was little more than a shoe box in size with a shower over the bath which was difficult to control! As we left, 2 days later, we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay. When we explained our problems we were told we should have asked for a different room. Why? We were tired & hungry & couldn't they have provided a better room anyway? Or do they magically provide better rooms on demand!;1

My family and I recently stayed at the recently renovated Empire Hotel in NYC  directly across the street from Lincoln Center. We were looking forward to a family reunion with several out of town relatives also staying at the Empire. The dÃ©cor upon entering was lovely but the service at check in was frustrating due to woefully undertrained help. The rooms were small reminding me of European hotels but tastefully appointed and comfortable.  Once problem was finding room on surfaces to put things as the room was overstocked with outrageously overpriced snacks which  covered most services. When using the bathroom the back of the door was totally unfinished with bare splintered wood ,peeling paint and dirt in the corners.  The heating/cooling system was tastefully covered hiding an;1

I believe you just need to look at a hotels towels to tell you everything you need to know.  Their bath towels are tea towel size and mean.  No shower gel just soap - tells you everything.  $389 a night.  Cramped damp, or too hot, ugly, battered and unpleasant.  The bathroom looks like it was last renovated in the 70's and the shower is a basic scalding or freezing mixer.  The bedroom is cheap and dated.  The staff are pleasant.    Just don't.  The holiday inn is down the road and would be much better.;1
WOOGO is a sham company. They go by at least three different names and are just a bunch of random people who have bought some apartments over NY trying to make a buck. They don't clean or service the apartments during your stay and they KNOWINGLY DOUBLE BOOK PEOPLE AND DON'T TELL YOU UNTIL YOU ARRIVE AND PUT YOU IN ONE OF THEIR CRAPPIER APARTMENTS. THEY STUFFED US AROUND AND MADE OUR VACATION A COMPLETE MESS. ABSOLUTELY AVOID THESE PEOPLE AT ALL COSTS - NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.   Central Park House was tidy but dirty, the air conditioner and fridge were broken and it was 95 degrees. The toilet was also constantly refilling and leaking all over the bathroom floor. I phoned to get them attended to - they said they would come the following day but never did. The apartment wasn't;1

This place is misrepresented both in the hotel website pictures and the suspiciously glowing reviews. Does not look like this! Itâs in a bad part of town, is run down, noisy and dirty. Little flying bugs landed on me every time I lay down. The floor was dirty. I felt uncomfortable and vulnerable and did not stay the night. I checked out early, forfeiting that nightâs fee, but the manager kindly refunded my last 2 nights.   This is the second time Iâve been misled by suspiciously glowing reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor. I am no longer using this as a resource for lodging.;1
Let me start by saying this was an amazing trip especially being from Orange County CA, it's a great city, very different from our hometown. My boyfriend and I decided to spend 4 nights and 5 days at Woogo and for the price why not? The only thing I found great about Woogo was the location. It was very close to central park and times square not to mention in a safe area. now where do I begin with my bad review.. First of all the people in the front desk on the first floor are very unfriendly when u go in to the check in the office is a dump. The elevators are pretty old then just when u think the worst is over you walk into your room and find the windows don't close, there is a very bad smell in the sheets the restroom is small and dirty, no cable, the towels are so rough and;1
Room was damp smelling, airconditioner was noisy and dripping. The fridge looked like it had been salvaged from the local rubbish tip.  On our first night, we saw security officers patrolling the corridors and saw Police Officers at one room.  Breakfast was awful with no cereal for our children apart from bran flakes ... that was the ONLY cereal they had.  From a hotel chain like the Ramada, you expect more.  We had been travelling across America on Route 66 staying mostly in Best Westerns and only booked this hotel as we couldn't get a Best Western. The rate was pricey for what we got.  Breakfast restaurant was hotel prices for awful food, our waffles were rock hard. Probably re-heated.  We would have been better going to Dennys.  There appeared to be some unsavoury people;1

So disappointed. Reserved for 2 rooms together and after being assured we had 2 together, even after it showed on paperwork, they gave our 2nd room away and we had to have 2 rooms on 2 different floors. Very frustrating as we were sharing items. Not an apology, nothing, they just blamed someone else who of course was not there. After being told they would look into it of course I never heard a word back on it. I think front desk has issues as we had key problems, the checking guy never bothered giving us any info about hotel, wireless, nothing. I actually felt like I bothered them. would not stay there again. Also loud area and loud hotel as bar is busy.;1

We arrived at the apartment and checked in and paid for the accomodation (the full balance)  This was approx 4 p.m. On entering the apartment we firstly noticed the cleanliness, or lack of.  There was a dirty floor, a mouldy bathroom, a discarded pant liner on one of the bedroom floors, a light fitting in the kitchen which was not fit for use.  We later discovered holes in the towels provided and a stain on the bedding which could only be desribed as either dried blood or excrement.  There was insufficient bedding for the fold down bed.  I contacted the sales office to complain and requested to be moved to an alternative accomodation, howver they did not have availability due to the holiday season.

Frankly one of the worst hotels Iâve stayed in ever. Upon arrival the hotel staff almost seemed put out to check us in. Our room was spacious but not the cleanest - we found a pair of socks from a previous owner under the table and the bathroom was looking pretty shabby. Breakfast was included so donât be conned by buying rooms with breakfast as extra. Unfortunately the breakfast wasnât up to scratch and the staff were the rudest people around. In particular the chef who had something against anyone who asked for anything despite it being his job! The worst thing of the whole stay was coming back to find, what looked like an ecstasy tablet on my 6-yr olds bed. Luckily he didnât put it in his mouth but this made us feel extremely uncomfortable and the attitude of the staff was,;1

I stayed here for three nights and while the location is great and the hotel is ok, not great, the service was very good. However, on checking out, they charged me $37.10 per night for a âfacility feeâ. Thatâs for wi-if and gym and business centre. I objected and told them the features had said free wi-fi and I hadnât used anything else but the desk manager said that this charge stated on my booking. We searched and sure enough there it was, buried on the third page, below all of the bits that said I had paid everything in full already. This was a sneaky âstealthâ fee and I will never book this hotel ever again. The booking was already expensive - â¬717.28 for just me for 3 nights - but this is just punitive and if I had known Iâd have to pay another $120 Iâd have found somewhere;1
This was the worst hotel Ive ever visited in LA. The picture that is shown is false advertisement as it is actually the back of the hotel. My first night of sleep I woke up in the middle of the night itching like a maniac. My shower didnt drain so that was a major issue as well. I reported it to the front desk and they allegedly sent someone to check my room and bed but didnt move me. Ive never experience bed bugs so I thought maybe I had an allergic reaction to something. The next nite, same thing and I reported it again. They didnt want to move me but I insisted because I showed them the bites on my ankles. They finally moved me. I returned home only to learn I packed bed bugs with me back from this hotel. Parking fees were ridiculous too!;1
First - not an occasional globetrotter, have tons of experience with tons of hotels. The only good thing about it is the location. Not in the congested lower Manhattan area and yet minutes from it by subway, or an hour walk. Do not let yourself to be lured in by the photos of the old-NY style reception area. There is bad, worse, worst. And after that comes Days Inn. The room was stinky, moldy, dirty, clogged toilet, questionable power outlets (I was afraid something would happen every time I had to use them). The door served only as a visual blocking board between the room and the guests in the hallways, gaps all over, shaky. Moldy stinky old AC unit on the window. The room was facing the back side so every time we wanted to open the windows for some fresh air the only thing we;1
This place is awful. Dirty, noisy, possibly dangerous by the looks of some people hanging out in the lobby. Rough. The carpets are so dirty I never walked on them without shoes or slippers and socks. As I type I am washing all my stuff and planning what to do with what I can't wash - is suitcase- because I'm scared of bed bugs. Do yourself a favour and stay away. Well away.;1
"The list of this hotel's vices is so long it almost seems made up: There's an acrid stench that permeates the entire floor I'm on, the carpet is so stained and disgusting that I'm afraid to walk on it barefoot, there's no mini-fridge or complimentary bottles of water, the 7th floor vending machine charged my card but vended nothing, the shower takes 5-10 minutes to warm up, the elevators are painfully slow, the smoke alarm in the hallway began bleeping a few minutes ago, the floors are a maze of claustrophobically narrow hallways, there's no breakfast (not even continental)... I'm in the hotel as I type this. I'm not a picky hotel guest by any means, but this experience is so unpleasant that I've asked to check out early. The front desk has denied my request citing ""policy."" I";1
We came from crown plaza and stayed here to finish our holiday for 2 nights god what a horrible dark smelling hotel this is and very very small rooms and even smaller bathroom we had a long day out and someone knocked our room at 12 at night I was asleep so I didnât answer 10 mins later the phone rang in our room ð¡ð¡ if I wanted to answer I would of answered the door the receptionist said did you want a toothbrush no I bloody donât I want sleep Iâd say it was the worst hotel Iâve stayed in;1
This hotel is the epitome of  American Greed.  Imagine a dump like this demanding rates of $289.00 for my first night, and yes, $490.00 for my 2nd and 3rd Nights stay. The carpets are so filthy you don't want to even put your feet down, and you are afraid to touch everything else. The Furniture is overused, filthy, and just despicable and they pay absolutely no attention to details beyond swiping your C/C, engaging Usury practices based on the greed of increasing Reservations as they choose to forget that they are RENTING you a room, and unconcerned as to WHAT one is paying for as they prey on the vulnerable traveler.;1
dishonest terrible service hotel beautiful service worst experienced, took 1 1/2 hours check, length time couples went room preoccupied, office hour straightened, morning check-out took 1 hour, desk said paid rooms owed room, booked online said no record online booking, duplicate paperwork took check-in able prove paid 3 rooms, said not charge 3rd room arrived home vacation charged credit card used incidentals 700 unlawful charges, charges credit card placed authorization signature, contacted literally took 3 days straightened, wells fargo said charges illegally did not contain reference number, hotels explanation similar came checked week later accidently charged wrong credit card, funny thing did n't credit card supposedly couple checked, cancel credit card afraid charging, scary situation, stay, feel disgusting dishonest everyway,  ;1
"Completely overprized and unlike the rest of Hotels in this century, is still asking to pay each device for Wireless.

"We chose this hotel,solely because of the location;only to discover it was absolutely horrible.One of the main reasons was the dishonesty of the hotel staff.We booked a non smoking room,only to discover it was fully booked.The staff told us we should upgrade the room in order to get a non smoking one.They showed us what a smoking room looked like (Absolutely horrible room,with terrible smell) and what a 50 dollar upgrade looked like (on the 11th floor.Only floor that was remodeled).We later discovered that there were plenty of non smoking rooms in the hotel,which means they basically conned us into paying 50$ for a upgrade.  We decided to look for another hotel online only to discover the wifi broke down.We called reception (which put us on hold for 10 minutes),and they told us";1

Good location in a nice neighbourhood. That's pretty much it. The rooms were average musty mold in the bathroom. The housekeeping service was what made it absolutely appalling. We were woken up early 8 or 9am (on a Sunday morning i think its all a blur what with the noise of the rooftop also till late into the night) by the housekeeping staff banging on our door everyday. Mind you, the day of check out so why was it necessary to make up the room??? Once again at 11.15am, someone banged on our door asking us what time we were leaving. Hello.. isn't check out time at 12pm?????? The smiles stopped at the front door. when we made requests with the front desk agent for towels it took forever.  Im sure we had the same linen on our bed as the same mark was on the sheet for 4 days even;1
"We (2 single business women) were a little uneasy when we entered the hotel, but front desk person said our rooms were clean.  It wasn't. Mold in the shower, no towels, no soap etc... bed is on the floor and the walls look like they haven't been cleaned or painted in years.  I asked for another room and it was the same - dump! We felt unsafe in the hotel and had to leave. The hotel manager was always gone and the only one who could give us back our money.  We had Hotels.com contact them and they were never able to reach the ""manager"".  So, even though we left and never spent one night, the rip-off hotel kept our money for 2 nights for both rooms. Never, ever stay here.";1
This hotel price gouges in a way that is disturbing. For example $10 per day per device for wi-fi access and $3 for having a cup of coffee in the room you paid big bucks is simply unacceptable. Also had problems with the TV and it took a day before they were resolved. I won't be staying there again. Apart from a nice location it has nothing to commend it really.;1
"We have just returned from a 7 night stay at Astor on the Park.  I too had read differing reviews but as one person said ""you will only need it for sleeping""  The first room we were given was on the ground floor at the back off the building overlooking a concrete pit!!  We asked to be moved as as the hotel suggests it looks over Central Park!!  We were offered a change for an additional rate of $25 dollars per night, declined this offer but were then given room 501 again at the back of the hotel but at least we could hardly hear the subway.  This room was ok but in the smoking part of the hotel so was a bit smelly!!  The windows did not lock so as there were 3 women on our own we were slightly concerned, the maintenance guy fixed it with super glue so just as well there was no";1
We stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise. The hotel has a good location for getting around Manhattan but that is the only good thing to say. The room was tiny you had to open the suitcase on the bed as there was no room on the floor. I have been to New York 4 times before but this was the only hotel with no coffee maker in the room and I was told Iâd have to pay 28 dollars plus tax for the use of one. Also as we arrived early it was $50 to get the room even though it was available. The room was on the 36th floor and the soundproofing from the windows was appalling. The area around penn station is also not very nice. We have stayed in much better super 8 motels with better facilities. There are so many nicer hotels in New York than this one that are also much cheaper. Had;1
"Rooms are old, feels like they don't actually clean but just tighten the bed. Rooms are heated with AC so you can't sleep well.

The room had an odour and the bathoom old and rusty panels were seen above the bath. Everywhere that you looked warning and threatening signs abounded  with the appropriate penalty for each  particular offence.This was more like third world government offices  or army barracks than an hotel. The car park displayed signs about skate boarding, dogs on leash and the penalty for parking in the wrong place. The lift carried a sign ""NO SMOKING. VIOLATERS WILL BE PROSECUTED"". The bathroom displayed a notice that if any towels, pillows or bedding were to be removed what fee will be";1
We had a very unhappy experience at the Days Hotel in Broadway.  Front desk service was problematic (slow and surly).  The room was almost uninhabitable.   You know it is a problem when your wife sleeps in her clothes because the cleanliness is so suspect.   The radiator was loudly hissing throughout the night, the tub was either dirty or without enamel.  The furniture was cracked and peeling.  The room reeked of mold.   The left over box of condoms in the room I guess was an amenity?;1

I had a bad experience with the hotel rate at The New Yorker Hotel in New York City, a Wyndham Hotel...  I booked this through Expedia.  Two weeks before the trip, I called the hotel to confirm our rooms and the rate.  We had two rooms.  The hotel told me it was $488.00.  I asked if that was for both rooms?  $244.00 per room.  The hotel said yes.  Then we got the bill.....$488.00 per room.   I called Wyndham Hotel Group in Parsippany, NJ and thought I could maybe get a small refund ( not unreasonable)on both rooms to ease the pain but they reused.  I thought this was unfair.;1
We are your everyday average people. Very blue collar, and don't expect a ton of glitz and glamour. But what we do expect is politeness, courteousness and some quiet when we trying to sleep. This we didn't get at this hotel. To start off, it's NOT in a good part of town, very scary! We tried to check in an hour early, which we have been able to do at every other hotel we've stayed in, and they rudely told us checkin was at 3:00! Not before! Then upon checkin, my husband asked where the pool was located and they gave him a piece of paper that was supposed to tell him. It wasn't even on there and when we found it ourselves, it wasn't heated. Information they could have shared at checkin. The first night we were in bed by 9:00 and were woke up by vaccuming in the hall and actually;1
Staff aren't helpful and neither are they pleasant.  There is a charge for internet use and for bottled water so it feels like a very budget experience but the room rate is not budget.  Fortunately I only had to stay for one night - the rest of my trip was spent in another hotel which was far more pleasant and much better value;1
"Let me start off by saying that this hotel is awful.  There is this weird hippie guy that checks you in.  The ""office"" is a room full of space with a broke down counter in the center of the room.  So, we check in and he takes us to the elevator (3' x 4' box) which is very old.  The first thing you notice as you get off the elevator is the stains on the carpet, the rips on the carpet and as you walk along you see parts of the wall that look like they are going to fall apart.  We get to our room and there is a hole in our door, a hole the size of a tennis ball, but for our ""protection"" it has been stuffed with some type of foam that can be poked out with a finger.

Stayed Friday 3rd June - Sunday 5th June 2016 Room was cramped, no bedside light and had a musky smell either from damp or poor ventilation. I was overcharged on my room and placed in room 22 which had a window on the ground floor over looking the communal smoking area. I arrived late on the Friday evening around 2am and from the moment I arrived until 6.30 am there were drunk revellers outside smoking, drinking and taking drugs in the smoking area. The noise kept me awake all night until I finally couldn't take anymore, dressed and went and complained. Only then did the staff do something and remove the guests. Worst nights sleep in a long time. Sheets were poorly fitting to bed and kept coming off the mattress and I found a number of hairs in the bedding. The room looked;1
I have just returned from an amazing 4 night trip in New York but unfortunately the hotel was a huge disappointment!  The main issue at this hotel being rude front of desk staff! From the moment we arrived we had various issues which were made 10 x worse than they needed to be by the front desk & how they spoke to us. The hotel isnât cheap so I would expect a basic level of service but it simply did not exist. The only 2 members of staff that actually made a difference was Herbert & Miss Henry (& we thank you for that!)  The rooms were old, dated & the first room we was given was so small you could hardly move, we asked to move room which we did after lots of heated discussions & managed to get a better room. The straw that broke the camels back was the fact the hotel charged us;1
Terrible Service.  They have 1990 style credit card machines and were not able to process an EU chip and pin card. If you are looking for a hotel at the airport and you are from Europe be aware that you could end up stuck with all sorts of money held on your card and without a room just due to the lack of chip and pin card functionality! When something goes wrong they also make no effort to help provide a better experience.;1
We booked on Hotels.com as an affordable stay in New York City.  The hotel seemed close to everything. However, on arrival we were completely shocked by the lack of accommodations.  The lady at the front desk was nice but that was all that was nice about this hotel.  This is not a hotel.  It's like an old rooming house from the 1920's that has never been renovated.  We were nervous from the minute we entered the building and actually happy to hear we would be on the first floor for fear of entering the old fashion elevator.  We were stunned to find that our horrible room did not have a toilet or shower.  Apparently, all of the rooms on the floor share a single bathroom.  Even more shocking was the window in the shower was opened to an old elevator shaft.  We knew immediately we;1

"We decided to stay over one night at NYC after the Opera at Lincoln Center.  We picked Empire hotel because it's only about 20 steps from the Metropolitan Opera House.  I reserved a room at Empire Hotel via Hotels.com with their last minute special deal.  So, we checked in around 4pm before our dinner reservation just to drop off a small over-night bag.  We noticed there's no water coming out of the sink.  And, the drape over the window was very dirty with lots of stains.  And, also noticed very old brownish stains on the shower tub (no, it's not the natural color of the tub). But the bed was clean.

A Terrible place to stay. My girlfriend and I booked Morningside Inn for July 10 to the 18th and during that time we've experienced the electricity going out, the toilet stop working and the television glitching. The hotel advertises a large screen   television and certainly provides it, however it complements the tv with antennas that are barely able to catch a signal, let alone hold one. At the same time majority of the channels the antenna was able to hold was in Spanish. The service was okay, although on the last night there we found a mystery stain on one of the towels. The main light didn't work, it flickered on and off like a horror film. The room itself was quite tight and contained broken pieces of furniture (the loose dresser drawer, the cracked tiles on the bathroom;1

I traveled on wed May 29 to NYC, with the company owner. He had booked this piece of crap on line based on the price and people dishonest reviews. We get there and there is a guy outside (seemed upset and did not even greet us), we checked in and proceeded to go to the rooms. The first rooom was on the 3rd when the door opened you would think you were in a ash tray. Mine was on the 7th floor, first sign super dirty carpet with an inch of dust build up around the carpet. A strange man was rooming the halls which were like a maze and only had room for one person to walk since it was super narrow. I finally found my room and the strange man was still rooming the floor with his head down (very creepy, made me feel very unsafe). The ROOM, was dirty and smelled like smoke. The covers;1

I booked this 3-day stay on the phone (local number).  At that time I explained that I was paying for two days and I would have a voucher from Kaiser for one day.  The reservation person said that would be no problem and I was given a room rate for the stay.   When I checked in, I reminded the person at the front desk that I would bring the voucher in as soon as I got it from Kaiser.   I received the voucher from Kaiser on the second day and brought it to the front desk.  I was told that since I was paying for one day with a voucher, I would have to pay a much higher room rate.  When I complained, the reservation manager was summoned.  He told me that it didn't matter what I told him, he was going to tell me the way it was going to be.  Meanwhile the counter personnel were;1
This hotel is not tailored to families with children, but to big business interests and corporate drones.  Families stay away!  Was quoted one price.  Arrived only to find out the price was $50 more a night than I was quoted and that my Visa card would be charged an additional $150 bucks + tax + their fees + their tips.  This hotel constantly tries to rip you off.  I asked about transportation to the nearby Hollywood bowl.  A robotic female staff member said you can hire one of their taxis @ $40 + tip each way.  My jaw dropped.  Are they kidding?  No,  they weren't.   That is $80 total for a ride that lasts no more than 10 minutes each way.  The Bowl is just down the street, but a little too far for a family with kids to walk.  We ended up taking the Hollywood Bowl shuttle for;1
The hotel, a relic from an earlier age, needs to be retrofitted for the 21st century.  It has only two ancient elevators that are very slow.  There was no tv control on our arrival in our room.  It should not be necessary to slam the door to your room as we had to during our stay.  The hotel's location on the Upper Westside is its most positive point.;1
We would have rated this 3 but the maid used lots of my partners Lamer cream which is rather expensive. Appalling.   Positive. Good location. Time square ten minutes walk.   The room we had was tiny. Paid $25 per night for a room with a view but the window was so filthy it kind of ruined it.   Obviously an old hotel but been refurbished. The room is okay but the bathroom is poor and very cramped.   If all you want is somewhere just to sleep itâs okay and weâll located. Just donât leave anything valuable in your room.;1

Room very small.  Bathroom is so outdated and in dire need of a makeover.   All renovation was in the lobby to impress, but once you got to the room gosh beware.  Will never stay there again.  Hotel staff was friendly enough though.  Restaurant adjourning hotel makes it very convenient.;1
I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Ramada Hollywood.  Neighborhood is on the dodgy side, I wouldn't feel too safe walking around there at night.  Hotel is close to the subway and close to the bus system, but those are the only things it's near.  Nothing else is within walking distance.  I forgot to pack a comb and asked the front desk staff if there might be a comb there.  The gentleman behind the counter asked if it could be used and if it was okay if it had dandruff in it.  He directed me to a 7-11 that was 5 blocks away.  Continental breakfast was awful, with soggy croissants and signs all over saying that nothing could be taken up to the rooms.  I booked this on hotwire, which claimed this was a 3 star hotel.  I'd give it 2 stars, and that's being kind.;1

We needed a place to stay for one night because we had reservations closer to Times square but it did not include our first night in the city. It was reasonably priced online and the pics looked ok.  We are pretty modest people and don't need a fancy place nor do I generally write bad reviews. But be warned.This was a terrible place to stay and was not worth the price we paid. It really looked, smelled and felt like a homeless/drug shelter. I could write about how terrible everything was but not enough space. Don't be fooled by the price or the pics.;1

Please do not stay at this hotel. I was verbally abused by the manager, Patrick, who is a bully and a terrible hotel manager. When I spoke to him he became angry very quickly and at one stage he rose to his feet and threatened me. I suspect that he either has mental problems or is just very screwed up. Nobody has ever spoken to me that, never mind a hotel manager who is supposed to be serving you.   This all happened on Christmas morning which almost ruined my Christmas day and my experience of New York. At the time I wondered whether I had made some cultural faux pas, but after reading other reviews I realise now that he was looking for an excuse to get into a fight and abuse somebody so that he could feel superior. I am actually quite concerned for anybody who stays here that;1

I am lying on a rock hard bed in the Hollywood Hotel right now. No sleep due to noise and concrete mattress and pot smoke filling up my room. People are allowed to smoke pot in front of the building, right outside the front door in the carriage drive. They are not on the public sidewalk but fully on the property of the hotel, and so the hotel could legally forbid this. I did complain but was told by front desk staff that I would just have to live with it. This place is like a homeless hotel. Drunk men singing ballads in the street at 3 AM, men yelling âMa! Open upâ and pounding on doors at all hours. Babies crying and dogs barking. The lights donât work right in my room. Neither does the refrigerator or the thermostat.

We booked in February for a stay in July. With COVID our flights were cancelled and we asked for a refund for the hotel stay in March. It has been months and countless emails that just tell me they are waiting on the approval from upper management.  Literally, probably 15 emails back and forth asking for status updates and refunds. The hotel was not even open for the stay we had paid for in July!! I am very disappointed. Completely ridiculous that they will not refund our money when they werenât even open. To me, thatâs stealing... I have paid for a service and it was not given to me.;1
"When we arrived to our room, it was probably close to, if not exceeding 90 degrees... I checked the (very old) heating unit and the heat was turned up all the way. So I tuned it to cool and turned down the temp all the way, thinking it would be cool when we returned from our day.  We get back about 7 hours later at 11pm and it was still sweltering. I asked the front desk if there were any other rooms as it was unbearing in ours. They said they were booked, but they would send a mechanic. One of them recommends we try opening a window (it was 20 degrees out and our room was ON broadway, so not an option) Mechanic comes up and can't figure the problem so just turns it off completely. Apparently they don't use AC in winter, because in his words ""it's already cold out"".   The night";1

Don't be duped by the good location and nice decor. This may be the last hotel in the Village (or NYC) to give guests keys to a room without warning them of the all-night heavy bass music playing from the club downstairs. Pity, for the person paying the bill would surely want to know that a night of sleep is as impossible as the staff are inept.;1
this was ranked 3 * stars??????? This was a half star hotel. Filthy. Tiny. Old. Shabby. No coffee maker. Disgusting. Nowhere on the planet would this dump get more than half a star. Shame on you !! I will never ever  ever use your services again paid over $200 for a zero dump;1
Overall the room location, type, and view was good. The bed was good and the size of the corner suite was good. We had a great view of universal as we celebrated our 14 year wedding anniversary. On the second day we noticed some ants in the bathroom. One or two ants are no biggie. But we woke up with more than twenty+ ants crawling all over our stuff in the bathroom by the sink. Room 1469. We brought this up to the staff upon checkout and nothing was really done, other thanâ¦ âweâll look into it.â Hopefully the next person staying in that room will not have the same ant problem as us.;1
It is such a terrible experience for me and my family as we have missing items after our stay at this hotel.   First one bracelet went missing which I left at my night stand. I thought I simply dropped somewhere did not think someone would steal it as I also have iPads charging in the room. But it would be too obvious to make an iPad or a bag disappear.  Then the day we are checking out my mom noticed one of her watches went missing then I started to think maybe this is too much for a coincidence reoccurring again.   I was going to make a complaint but my mom wanted to check her bag once again. As we could not find it, we simply called the hotel. I spoke to an agent from lost and found but the issue is there is nothing you can do.  I will never ever step into this hotel or let;1

The hotel is nice... and nicely located.  The service was absolutely horrible.  It took three trips to the front desk to get the billing right (after being assured it was fixed).  I stood around for 20 minutes waiting for the bellhop to get my bag out of the back room.  They gave me a smoking room saying that was all they had -- and then gave me a non-smoking when I balked.  There was an overall crappy attitude by the front desk -- something I would expect from a Motel 6 in Compton.  I stayed at the Beverly Hilton a few weeks ago and it was 180 degrees opposite.  I travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels, and I would avoid this place like the plague.;1
"Within moments of walking in to this hotel, it becomes clear that the owners are gouging this place for every penny it is worth, while spending as close to nothing on the upkeep as possible.    This hotel is riddled with what a surveyor would call ""wants of repair"".  Not a single item in the room was unscathed.  Cracked bathroom tiles, a bath which had lost its enamel and gone rusty at the bottom (needs to be seen to be believed), smell of cigarette smoke throughout, 3 out of 4 elevators broken at any one time, stiflingly hot atmosphere, chipped and broken furniture, holes in the walls, peeling wallpaper, cigarette and sundry other burns on the carpets; I could go on.  If this hotel were $50 a night then the condition might have been okay, but it wasn't.  We paid $200 a night";1
It's not very often I agree with all the bad reviews there are for hotels, but this place lives up to them all.  The hall ways are falling apart, the staff are EXTREMELY rude, and the room was in the worst condition I've ever seen.  I've travelled most of the world backpacking, stayed in some low budget hostels and hotels but they have always given me a bed worth sleeping in, but not this hotel. The bed dipped in the middle and the bed clothes were torn.  I can honestly say I was disgusted, never again!;1
"...because there was an air conditioner.  We have travelled to many cities and stayed in many hotels from cheap to not so cheap but this place was, undeniably, the worst.

Stayed just one at the Hilton Universal, but that was enough. Originally we had two nights booked in, however our flight was delayed 24 hours. The room was pre paid, so I contacted the hotel, and the booking agency, informing them that I will be 24 hours late. All parties reassured me that a room will be waiting for us when we arrive. So I arrive at 10:30 am, THEY inform me that I'm late, and that we DON'T have a room ready. I tell them that I phoned ahead, they don't have any record of this. Getting a little irritated after a 13 hour flight, so after about 10 minutes of scrambling, they find a room , a twin, not a double, on the 2nd floor.  I have no choice to take it. When we arrive, the key / door is not working. After going up to reception three times, security arrive to;1

Woogo Apartments on 72nd Upper West Side, New York City,  The name sounds harmless, and to an extent, appealing. I must warn you now that this is only because it is located in New York City. The scam that is Woogo is apparently a worldwide phenomenon that has plagued the western world for some time. I was not the person to book the accommodation for my New York holiday that I had been anxious about for the final two years of high school. I had seen one review of Woogo Apartments, and I was not impressed. But as I finally had an opportunity to go to New York, USA. I would brush it off my shoulder as I would stay almost anywhere to get to New York.  We arrived and upon seeing the sites of the Manhattan skyline pass me by on the windows of the taxi.

Please heed my advice, believe me, you do not want to stay here. Our room (108) is probably where staff members crash or someone uses when they want to pay hourly. It absolutely was a large storage closet. The towels were stained, the sheets were cheap and we found hair on them, the beds were hard and uncomfortable. You could say we got what we paid for, but we actually paid over $250 for each room (other friends were on 3rd floor). We all put something on the pillows so we wouldn't have contact directly to the pillowcases, none of us took a shower because we couldn't dream of using the towels to dry off. Not worth the 'low' price for NYC. Do some more research and pass this place by.;1

The manager had mistaken me for one of their guest that stays long term under the homeless persons NY housing program. I was rather offended after paying US $1392. The hotel staff was amazed we  were staying that long, other than the residents as they call them.

Do not stay here unless you like being ignored by the staff and charged the wrong amount repeatedly throughout your stay.;1
We spend a night at Days Inn by Wyndham New York City Broadway and it was one of the worst hotels I ever stayed at. The hotel is dirty from the entrance to the room. Front desk service is terrible with not pleasant employees. Employees donât help clients opening the doors even if they are caring lots of suitcases. We were 4 people and they tried to charge us US 10,00 to keep the fourth luggage while we waited for check-in I donât recommend this place for anybody.;1
My boyfriend and I cancelled our stay here because of the awful service we recieved from the manager Patrick and lost Â£55.  We booked through hostel bookers, a triple private ensuite room. As I normally do, I called up the hostel to confirm our booking, I was told we were booked into a triple shared room, at which I was passed on to the Manager Patrick who informed me he would email me about the issue. 2 days later I didn't recieve that email so I called back again to speak to Patrick who again shrugged me off and said he would call me back. Needless to say he didn't.   My boyfriend called him the following day to find out if they were sorting things out as all I was being told was that someone would contact me.

I dont know where to start!  First of all I am a travel agent, and love to experience different hotels for my clients!

I need to let you know about our experience with this hotel, and I am absolutely will NEVER EVER suggest this hotel to my clients EVER!  First of all I was given an early check in with my choice of room.  When we checked in that room was not available, however we were happy with getting into a room of the same category on a lower floor.  Upon check in the staff was kind and helpful!  No complaints!

My girlfriend and I booked a vacation package through Expedia and stayed at the Hollywood Hotel for 6 nights in July. We were very excited, as we had read generally positive and favorable reviews about the hotel, and it was our first time in LA.  To be blunt, we were startled at the disappointing and negative experience we had at the Hollywood Hotel. A warning to fellow travelers - STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.  The Hotel Manager, Cecile Augenia, and the Hotel Director, Jeff Zarrinnam were both completely negligent.     I've never complained at a hotel or posted on a public site before, but this experience needed to be shared -  Â·         The exterior of the hotel is NOT accurately represented in the online photos. The outside of the hotel is run-down, dated and unkempt.  The hotel;1

Problem is The Jane decides that ""handsy"" bouncers should run the hotel after a certain hour.  If you use to friendly front doormen who are happy to help you out, this hotel is not your place.  On two separate occasions the same bouncer laid his hand on me which is considered assault in most quarters as I attempted to access the hotel.  The first time I had run to my car to get my wife her items, since she was still in the room and in order to make the lights work you have to leave your key in the wall, I didn't have that 1 pound key with me.  I went to the car and on return this bouncer rudely stopped me and at first wouldn't allow me to enter.  Luckily";1
There were cockroaches in our first room !!!!  In the bathroom , on the pillows it was awful , thankfully we were  given a new room which had been slightly updated, there was a new bathroom fitted.

do not recommend this hotel. I stayed there for two nights. As soon as I got into my room, I was so excited to finally get some rest. I tried to turn on the tv and it didnât work so I called downstairs for someone to come fix it. While I was waiting I decided to go wash my face and freshen up a little in the bathroom when I hear someone opening my door. Iâm thinking maybe itâs the tv guy but why would he be opening my door instead of knocking? I walk out of the bathroom scared and I see a stranger walking in my room with his luggage. Apparently the front desk gave another hotel guest a key to my room at check in. I donât understand how this hotel can make a mistake that big. Thank god I wasnât in the shower or changing!

The air conditioner however was right in front of my bed and for whatever reason we woke up each morning with the edge of the bed extremely moist or wet. When I called the front desk to explain the situation their response to me was.. ""You should had let us know earlier"". I also mentioned the fact that our air conditioner was extremely loud. It would make a loud engine-like sound all throughout the night as we kept it on. Again, when I mentioned this to the receptionist she insisted that I should had informed them earlier. I ended up sleeping on the floor in the hotel for 3 nights because of";1
I was unable to make my check-in for my hotel due to my flight being heavily delayed due to weather. I called the hotel to notify them that I would not be checking in.  I've reached out to the hotel and Expedia who I made the reservation with and to no avail did Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport agree to at least give me a credit to stay in the future with my paid hotel visit I was unable to use.  This is poor customer service and shame on you for not extending your services to customers that had uncontrollable circumstances that actually notified you in more than one way.   I will never stay at a Hyatt Regency again. Your lack of customer service shows me exactly who you are as a business.;1

I had a chance to stay 1 night in Hotel Riverside Studios and I know it was my last visit at this hotel. The interior of the building is very old fashioned and I would recommend you to go through the dark corridors to your room only if you want to feel like in a horror movie. There are shared toilets as well as dirty bathrooms. Maybe it could be a good hotel for drunk people returning from the pub, who don't care about where they will sleep in next 5 hours. On the other side, the courtyard view rooms are quiet.;1
This place is a joke!!! I could not believe my eyes when I saw the TripAdvisor owl sticker in the lobby window!! Iâm not kidding when I say it was filthy... the âspareâ blankets had BIG chunking holes missing out of them... the halls reeked of cigarettes even though âno smokingâ signs are posted everywhere!!! The sheer curtains were torn in half on one window, the drapes hanging off their racks... one roll of toilet paper the whole stay and no maid service what so everð¤¢some kind of ooozzzie stuff on the walls and hair and other âthingsâ from the previous guests in the bathroom...no extras (travel shampoo, conditioner...), no microwave...no coffee maker....;1
If you like extra firm mattresses, in room coffee which you have to pay for, no delivery of newspaper, absence of robes, and no bathtub, then this is the hotel for you. For the same price we prefer the Beacon Hotel;1

The front desk staff were courteous but you had to wait 25 minutes for an elevator or you could use the E bank of elevators which had a pronounced bounce everytime it stopped making me violently ill with motion sickness. The 9th floor stank of damp and the signage to the rooms is terrible. The key did not work reliably. The room itself had no running hot water for 2 days with no explanation and no compensation. The water that came out was cold and the shower mixer tap had no signage on it as to which way to turn for hot and cold- potential scalding! The air-conditioner was so loud that it could not be run during the night.The wifi did not work in my room- could only access it in the corridors. After 2 terrible nights I left to find other accomodation in New York City.;1
Worst experience ever and would not recommend this hotel to family and friends. Had to wait a long time to check in and when I got to the front desk the receptionist was extremely rude and thought she was doing me a great favor, only to find out that the manager was cancelling reservations without informing the guests. Rooms are extremely outdated and not worth the money. Time square is also quite a distance from the hotel. Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your room card which is quite annoying. Thereâs many nicer hotels then the New Yorker Wyndham on the same road.;1
We have stayed at the Empire Hotel for the last five years. We have also taken 3-4 additional rooms for clients as we attend a conference at the Lincoln Center. It is extremely convenient.   We were in Washington DC on business and called the hotel at 7:30 PM to let them know we were coming by train and we would arrive between 11-midnight and not to give our room away... Upon arrival at 11:30pm, the front desk clerk shuffled uncomfortably and we knew something was wrong. Finally about midnight he gave us a key with no explanation. We went to the room to find a beautiful suite. We tried all the doors and could not find a bed. We called the front desk, no answer. We went downstairs to find we only had a living room. There was a pullout couch if we wanted a bed. And if we wanted;1
Check in went smoothly, but it was downhill from there. There are 2 very slow elevators serving 13 floors and after coming out of the elevator I was greeted with the strong aroma of food being cooked.and found my room was located in a stairway. The room itself was small as expected for New York and furnished with a double bed, two night stands with lamps, a desk with lamp and a chair and a combined TV console/ 3 drawer dresser. The desk extended into the room somewhat blocking one of the night stands and was so close to the bed that it was very awkward to be seated which meant that most people ended up sitting on the bed. Enough people had done this that the top of the mattress had shifted about 5 inches from the bottom of the mattress creating a mattress with an overhang on one;1
The bed was great and super comfy, though it's a little faded for the price and it could do with a refit fairly soon. The staff were warm if a little bit too busy and confused by my booking on check in.   The first thing that concerned me was when staff moved my bags to another room and my rather expensive camera went missing and was later found in my old room and returned...I thought it a a little strange that the rest was moved other than this large camera bay on top of my luggage.  But most worrying was the security and lack of interest when my phone was stolen in the mezzanine toilet as it was beside me as I did my business...Staff seemed unconcerned as if it was a normal occurrence. There was no security on the door and it seemed anyone could enter the lobby and the;1
"I booked this hotel for a friend and myself to stay in for 3 days.  I booked the trip through Travelocity and thought I had found a real ""steal"" in the hotel as it was described.  The only steal was my money because we left 15 minutes after we got there and they have refused to refund the money.  It is by far the most disgusting hotel I have ever set foot in.  I actually lived in a homeless shelter for 4 months and that was cleaner.";1
"I stayed in room 2174, which was the size of a postage stamp. the shower head was leaking and pushing water up on the ceiling, the bed was really a hammock and the TV did work right. On top of that there is NO room service, no refrigerator in the room, and they charge you a ""RESORT FEE"" of $34 a day!!! The hotel is in need of a major upgrade! I was there for a conference so I did not select it but I would not go back to the conference if they choose this hotel.  Avoid this property because you will be disappointed.";1

I found this hotel through a Groupon offer.  BIG Mistake!  We could not change and had to endure.  It greatly detracted from our entire vacation.  I anticipated old and small, but had no idea how drastic the neglect of this building turned out to be.

The Empire Hotel is well located, which is about all it has going for it. The bathrooms were the most surprising I have seen in decades of travel and certainly at this price. The water never got hot.  Every single shower was freezing cold. I tested the temperature 3-4 times a day over our 4 day stay and never got a hot shower, or even hot water to wash up. The junior suite had a tiny bath with a crazy shower.  One ceiling bulb (shower light broken). The railing was for a normal sliding shower door, but had the near side anchored and the far side removed. This makes it hard to turn on the cold shower, and leads to water all over the floor (see photos).  What were they thinking?  Also why put a soap dish to jab into your thigh?  They put faucets on the sink too low to wash, but;1
I stayed at the hotel in April. A copple of months later I was going through my credit card statements and discovered the hotel had charged my credit card 120 dollar. I had no idea what it was for so I emailed the hotel. I got a quick response from Ryan and he informed me it was probably for the valet parking or a charger. I told him I didn't use valet parking nor a charger. Now, two weeks later I still haven't heard from him what the 120 dollar was for.  As much as I enjoyed my stay there, I don't appreciate it when they charge my credit card with stuff I didn't use. So I'll think twice before booking a room at the Empire again.;1

I really don't know where to begin.   There are two big pros for this hotel. Location (I can see Lincoln Center from my window), and the patio/pool area on the top of the hotel.  I had the following experiences:  The room I was offered on checking in was on the 4th floor. When I entered the room it smelled heavily of tobacco, and the were earplugs on the night stand because even the air conditioner put on high could not mask the outside noise. When I returned to the front desk, they were astonished that there was the smell of tobacco in the room because it was a non-smoking hotel. I was switched to a room on the 10th floor.  This room had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. It was so small that there was no room in it for even a tiny trash bin. Shaving was a;1

When we got there I cried. Seriously. Every horrible thing you read about this place is 100% true.   The air conditioning that was supposed to be in the ""suite"" was not installed. The tiny rooms were stifling and cramped. My sister and I shared half of the ""suite"" on a pull out bed. She and I both had itchy, watery eyes after the first night. One of my eyes became extremely red and irritated after the second night. I decided to stop using the pillow (even tho I had covered it with a ""clean"" towel from the bathroom), and instead used a balled up t-shirt to sleep on. My eyes";1

This was our first trip to New York, and my daughter and I were very excited. The travel agent booked this hotel for us, but after reading the previous reviews  I was a bit hesitant about staying here, but thought hey it can't be too bad. Well, it was! Without a doubt it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was old, dark and dingy, we had a lovely view of the alley. The bathroom old and gross. The hallway carpet was covered in bits of plaster, looked like it had been there a while. So much for housekeeping. If they can't keep a hallway clean then what does it say about the room cleaning standards. Actually we never felt 'clean' during our 4 day stay. The sheets were also old and thin. Apparently, they have been renovating for years. Didn't look like they achieved;1
"Having had to suffer this hotel for my past visit, some of the previous reviews are indeed true. However one thing I will say straight away there was NO EVIDENCE OF bed bugs at all.   The lobby is great, and alas that's where it all ends. It seems that any money spent on the ""renovation"" is only done in the lobby area. The lifts are okay and small, however one of them I was in constantly kept self adjusting its self and took longer than normal to get up to my floor. So I used the stairs. The stairs are tacky and unclean. Complete with tumbleweed on them, I kid you not.  The so called Gym, is just three machines. 1 Bike, 1 treadmill (that wasn't working) and another machine.

I came down to the front desk. The guy at the front desk looked very unpleasant and was clearly showing no interest in making an apology. He made me a new key.

The real problem came at checkout. I was confronted with a bill for $91 for ""residency fees"" of over $22 a night. I had not been informed of this fee when I checked in.

I'll preface by saying that the following complaints were reported to hotel management to which they attempted to rectify but not satisfactorily.  Due to the scary health hazard I felt obliged to warn other regardless of the 'compensation' we were offered.  We opened the door to our first room and almost fell backward from the amazingly strong odor or mold and mildew.  Our clothes stunk within 2 hours.  Mold climbing up the back of the bathroom door and I can only imagine what may have permeated the walls.  The odor was so strong it took me over an hour to fall asleep and I woke up with sinus congestion.  This room is a mold lawsuit waiting to happen.

When we arrived at the hotel we had trouble getting into the reception due to lots of people outside presumably waiting to get into the hotel for partying. We finally got to reception and to be honest the attitude of the staff left alot to be desired. We got our room key for a room on the first floor and struggled with our two cases into the dirty lift, no one offered any help at all.

"My wife and I - mid 30's - stayed in a bunk bed room at the Jane while we had a two day layover in NY. After booking I read some of the reviews on this site and I told my wife, ""lower your expectations; maybe it's not as good as it seems on the web site.""   However, I can report that our stay was great, we really liked the Jane. It was clean, even the shared bathrooms. My wife is a clean freak, and even she said it was very clean.  Yes, the room is SUPER small, but for that price what do you expect? The room is a place to sleep, not lounge around in all day on a honeymoon! We didn't find any ""bedbugs"" at all, like a previous reviewer said. The staff was quite friendly and helpful in every way.  We have zero complaints from our stay. In fact, it will be my hotel of choice when";1
"I stayed here with my sister on November 30 in one of the rooms with bunk beds. We had originally booked 2 nights but our trip got cut short after I got eaten alive by bedbugs in 2 of the rooms. After discovering bites around 2 a.m., I got suspicious and googled ""bedbugs jane hotel"" on my phone and found this: http://bedbugregistry.com/location/NY/10014-1700/New-York/113-Jane-St/. I called the front desk and told them that I was getting bitten and asked if we could switch rooms. I wanted to leave but since it was the middle of the night I figured we could try another room. The concierge asked if I had seen any actual bugs and I said no. They said they would move us but to wait on the bellhop because there was a ""process"". The bellhop finally showed up after I called twice and in";1

Aircondition not working properly and if on, so loud you cant sleep with it on (even on low. In fact, changing fan speed didnt do anything). 3. Toilet is running and flushes by itself for some reason.. so loud. 4. Fridge is humming like crazy. Even on lowest setting. I am a heavy sleeper and i can usually fall asleep even with noiseâ¦ but not here. This is next level.

The room instantly smelt of stagnant smoke! We got one towel between 2 of us. The sink leaked onto the bathroom floor.   The bedding had holes in it and also smelt.  You're better off staying in a crack den!;1
This is my second time staying at The Jane and it was disappointing. I was given room 537A which is a corner room with great views of The Hudson River and Statue of Liberty. The room was small but it's nothing new to me and I loved that I get a little breeze coming in since it was a bit warm. You also get a view of a busy highway and can hear cars going by night and day, which is also not a problem with me since I'm not a light sleeper. What I have a problem with on this trip however is the cleanliness of my room and the shared bathrooms down the hall. To be fair, this is my second time at The Jane, so what I had encountered here are nothing new. My room gets a lot of visits from pigeons and they do a lot of things by my window. They eat, sleep and of course relieved themselves.;1
The hotel is dated. The room has dirty, chipped furniture. The wall near the air conditioner is stained black. Two drawers and the fridge were open when I got to my room. The fan sounds like a used car. The tub needs resealing. The soap dish is stained. The glass table is filthy. The lobby and bar area are straight up early 90s. And the front desk couldnât figure out how to change my reservation, made through Hilton, to 2 nights instead of 3.;1

Our room was supposed to be on the VIP floor(according to the check in agent). Our shower leaked all over. The floor for 2 days and the toilet was broken.  While someone came to fix it , it was 2 days after our check in. When I asked housekeeping to come clean the floor because I just had rotator cuff surgery and was afraid of falling, they cleaned the floor but refused to come back to clean the room.;1
I have stayed here previously and it was pretty good...but this time it was horrible.  I heard they shut down over the pandemic and then couldn't hire their regular staff back...so the service was dreadful.  We booked a jr. suite..expecting an adjoining room with a fold out couch...and it was just a regular room with a couch uncomfortably plopped in ... not acceptable at all.  We had to take an additonal room...the room we had smelled of cigarette smoke...despite the hotel claiming to be smoke free...we complained and they offered to come up and spray...so I'm guessing we are not the first.  We declined as that seemed like it would make it worse...the room was really unpleasant..the decor shabby...and the people working the front desk were not helpful at all.  We asked for a;1
"On check in we were charged $5000 ""accidentally"" which essentially left us penniless whilst in New York. We complained to the service manager who kindly agreed to waive our resort fee. 3 days after check out this was recharged to one of our two rooms despite this verbal agreement. Her response was to deny that this was even tabled. Our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings, solely at the responsibility of Wyndham New Yorker.  The occurrence of  initial error, the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns, the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check- out is the reason for this.   Clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority.";1
Room was poorly equipped: no refrigerator, no coffee maker or hot water access. Towels rod falls with a touch. Water temp. in the shower is hard to adjust and inconsistent. Staff is cold to requests. Fee of $100 is charged without warning for ever not needed things.;1
My partner and I had been staying in another New York hotel on holiday when our flight was cancelled due to the volcanic ash from Iceland.  We needed cheaper accommodation than we had and the Hotel Riverside Studios was fairly close by and looked clean and was very reasonably priced.  I had not read the reviews as we were in a hurry to get somewhere at a cheaper price.  Initially this hotel looked better than I expected but it became clear that first impressions were deceptive.  The room we had (a double) was absolutely freezing due to the fact that the shutters on either side of the air-conditioning unit, which is fitted underneath the window, did not shut completely so the window is effectively open all the time.  I told the man on reception who looked at me like this was one;1
Dear Reader, This hotel was the dumps. When my family of 4 turned the street corner towards the hotel, we immediately knew that we were in a nasty part of town. After all we had been through (a delayed flight, rain, and a late shuttle bus) all we wanted was a nice hotel room. When we stepped inside the hotel it looked charming enough, and the staff was kind. After checking in we walked to the elevator and what we witnessed was shocking, dirty air vents, peeling tile, peeling wallpaper, dust & debris everywhere. While stepping out of the elevator we encountered a nasty, dirty, dusty, and just plain unclean lobby. It looked as if a tornado of renovation (that had been there for 20 decades) went through it. Opening the door to our hotel room was like opening the gates to another;1
"The rude unprofessional staff and lack of security!! My friend and I had left our room key with reception while we went out. When we came back to the hotel and went to collect the key, we were told by reception that it had already been collected earlier. Confused, we had a member of staff escort us to the room to find an unwelcome person sleeping in our bed. Understandably shocked we asked reception how they let this happen. They did NOT check for ID when handing the key to this person. The staff member who escorted us upstairs laughed at the situation, and I asked if he found this funny to which he replied ""yes, I do"". This put our personal security at risk, not to mention the risk of our belongings being stolen. It is unbelievable that this hotel FAILS to check ID when handing";1
I have stayed at this hotel various times and have always loved it!  Unfortunately, I will never stay there again, because I do not trust the staff.  My credit card information was used to make purchases in the local area using my name and credit card information!  When I contacted the Hotel Manager, I was promised a return call.  Never happened! They get a zero for customer service!  Clearly do not want my business back.  Warning!  Do not stay here!;1

Disgusting. Just purely unbearable. Unbelievably dirty. Canât believe this city keeping these places remain open and calling them hotels. Canât believe this. Extremely dirty.

Opened curtains to find men outside working on the scaffolding and absolutely no view! Off to early dinner in restaurant - dirty wine glass. Coffee served before dessert ???? We had a meal deal ( handed in the voucher!) they tried to charge us for the whole meal not just coffee. We had heard other people having the same conversation about being charged twice.

I had much higher expectations for a Hilton.  I am at a conference here that continues on at this location approximately once a month.  I checked in tonight and I was expecting a really nice room based upon some of the pictures represented on their site, my rate was $175 a night and I was given a room on the 2nd floor.  Everything in the room is warn and dated, the dresser is scratched up, the carpet looks like something from 1970, the drapes are old and are just not pleasant.  The light switch to the bathroom is outside of the bathroom itself.  I am stuck here for the night and I unlikely have time to change rooms tomorrow but the combination of no view, and a dated ugly worn our room will not have me coming back here.  I am dissapointed.;1
The room service is very terrible! I stayed here for 3 nights. I have called the room service for getting the hair dryer at the first night,and asked for some spoons at the last night. The staff said they will deliver to my room very shortly. But NO ONE COME at all!! especially the last night, I need the spoons for the meal, I have waited 30 minutes, and finally I went down to the cafe at the lobby to get it by myself. My family ate the cold meal at that night. NO Staff come to our room and no any response from them for the whole night. I was so angry and called them again before i slept, they just said they DONT KNOW WHY NO ONE COME, and no apology!THE WORST HOTEL SERVICE EVER. I suggest the hotel cancel the'room service' phone call line. Because this hotel NO SERVICE AT ALL.;1

Place was a total dump. I wouldnt put farm animals in it.  I asked for a quiet room AWAY from lifts...so they put me right next to one. Theres no soundproofing, no carpets so you hear every little noise.   All the facilities are communal. Reception staff were nonchalont. Uninterested. They took all personal info without good reason. Place is totally grim.   The room was disgusting. Old cheap ass furniture, no carpet, dirt and grubby marks on the walls and flaking paint.  Showers and pipework were disgusting. Dirty. Like a rugby club bath house. I didnt use any of the facilities. There were communal kitchens and some crockery and room fridge provided. Obviously i used nothing.  Noisy. Impossible to sleep. Avoid at all costs. Only reason i stayed was because of the temporary bus;1
First off I have to say the pictures they provided are totally misleading! My room looked nothing like the rooms depicted in the listing. My wall paper was peeling, there were water damage spots on the ceiling, loose footing under the carpet, and just plain dated looking. It was like a scene from a movie where the bad guy had to find a place to hide out, complete with the small tube tv and sirens outside every hour. 2 of the elevators didn't work, and it was quite a good wait for the other two elevators being that they are the older model, cramp elevators, and we're not hiking from the 8th floor everytime we want to get into the city. The cleaning staff wants to work on their own schedule, never mind that you're still occupying the room because it's 9am, and you're not ready to;1
I checked in at 10pm with my 2 kids and the hotel gave me room 209 in the basement next to the laundry.  There was an extremely loud thumping noise when we entered the room.  When I called to complain, they said they were fully booked but would sent maintenance to look at it.  The loud thumping did stop but the washing machines continued until 11:15pm at night.  When I called to complain again, no one answered the phone.  Then the machines started again at 6am!  The whole room vibrated.  I immediately went to the front desk and they moved us for the next night.  But who in the world sells a room next to the laundry?  And to top if off, there was no compensation for the truly awful night of sleep.  Just a paltry, âIâm sorry.â  Poor job by Hilton;1
Won't be staying there again. The rooms are very small. They had a small TV that did not work (they kept saying it was getting fixed that day). We had to wait over 5 mins to get on the elevator (only has 1 elevator). They advertised free parking which is not true! Your parking options are driving around 60+mins to find street parking or pay $20/day at the nearest parking lot. Overall, disappointed.;1
I booked a standard room, then messaged them asking to upgrade to a double bed room. They took 24+ hours to respond and didnât change my reservation so I lost out on the upgrade (which I was willing and agreed to pay for the additional cost). I then asked for a rollaway bed, which was confirmed by them but when I got the room, there was no tollway bed AND IT WAS TINY. You could barely walk in it, it was so small!  A rollaway bed would have NEVER fit in there, which they should have advised. They were apparently completely booked so recommending to me that the room would be too small for what I needed wouldnât have hurt them.  I was literally in the hotel for no more than 15 mins from check in to leaving. I saw the room, booked another hotel, and turned in my keys to the front;1
We spent 6 nights at Days Inn last week. Our travel agent had booked it for us and we had paid Aus $1994 in advance so were âlocked inâ. We had no idea what to expect from hotels in New York. We were shown a corner room on 9th floor with duct tape around the two windows. Very shabby and noisy. When we complained we got another room on 8th floor in a similar state however there was only one window so it was a bit quieter. The floorboards dipped outside the bathroom door, no plug in sink, just a hole, toilet seat peeling, carpet sticky, furniture badly scuffed, window filthy.  On the very small positive side, bedding was clean and room was serviced each day. Staff on desk were helpful. If Iâd paid a hostel rate I  would have accepted this but at Aus $332 per night, I expect way;1
"Ok so... just horrible service all around. There wasn't one time it wasn't bad. They booked us twice and we spent hours transferring around departments to get refunded the superfluous charge. The night of, they gave away the room with a view we paid for, so we had a sucky room the first night with no apology but a $10 voucher to the diner (our view-room cost a bit more than that thank you). Every interaction with the staff, whether via phone or in person was shockingly rude, curt, and put off. I'm talking like basic hospitality common sense was totally absent. Oh yeah one time we were stuck in the lobby waiting for our bags. It was Christmas and the lobby was packed. There was no where to sit down and my mom was tired, so she sat in one of the two chairs in front of the ""Wyndham";1

wow.....really a terrible experience!!!! I would definitely never recommend this hotel.  Location is ok and the outside of the hotel looks pretty grand.  But then....the room was the size of a shoebox. The bathroom was so small that one could not sit on the toilet without having the knees knocking on the wall. The faucet is so close to the bottom of the sink that you can not wash your hands without having to wiggle them around to wash them! The blanket is so thin that you will need to ask for another one if you want to avoid turning on the (extremely old and noisy) heater.  Checkin staff is grouchy and really not nice.  The business center offers printers at a cost but expect to be charged for a defective printer!  A terrible experience.;1
The room smelled, plastic broken blinds on window, radiator held up with a piece of wood, safe in closet didn't work, very thin non matching towels in bathroom. Tan tub had white porcelain paint for repair. Save your money and stay somewhere else!;1
A room that was grubby, in need of a good clean and a shower that was not working properly.We would never recommend this hotel based on our room, to anyone and would look else where for our next trip.;1
Broken AC in two different rooms. 1st room it didnât work, the room was 81 degrees when we got in there. It took a call, waiting 15min for a handyman that never showed and then going down to the desk to resolve another 15min. 2nd room the AC stopped working in the middle of the night. Unbelievable. Try sleeping in a humid 83 degrees room. It was awful.;1
I booked a single room for a 3 night holiday in NY. the good thing was it's a safe/ peaceful area, not far from the station and close to Broadway. The hotel itself was fairly quiet.  I didn't expect much cause it was probably cheaper than most in Manhattan, so the size and shared bathroom didnt bother me. however, it had a funny smell, the hallways were filthy, the carpeting torn in places. The worst is the itch I am suffering from now, found a bedbug on the towel they gave me and though i used my personal towel, i have got spots all over, my right eye is swollen and i itch all over. guess i got bitten plus some allergic reaction. I think I would have nearly died if I had booked a longer stay.  Hotel is quiet, but saw one or two shady characters that made me very conscious going;1
The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The elevator is scary feels like it will break at any moment. Room was so old feeling. Musty smell.

Spent a week at this hotel and was really disappointed so much so one of the first things I did was to email the manager but not even had an acknowledgment from her.  I also completed the online survey early yesterday.     Anyway, here is my honest review.  We arrived early, as our original flights had been cancelled, when I say early it was a maximum of two hours earlier than we would have got our rooms.   I had asked for two rooms together via email before we left the Uk and was told they would try and arrange it.  We arrived only to find nothing had been done about my request.  The receptionist informed me we could have one room but would have to pay $25 plus taxes to have it two hours earlier.  After a very long 24 hours I agreed.   He then managed to swap this room with;1
Really poor service. Here with family of 5 and attempted for over 1 hour to contact front desk, concierge, valet - anyone so that we could get covers for pull out coach for kids. 10pm. 11pm. Nothing. Finally around midnight someone delivered sheets. You get what you pay for.;1
Yes, its a small room and bathroom but that is expected in NY.  The problem was, as others have stated, its impossible to get anyone on the phone when you have an issue with your room - and I had many.  The aircon was SO LOUD and even though it looked like you could change the temperature, the controls had no effect.  The shower was made really cheaply and sprayed all over the place.  Also very low pressure what little water did manage to go in the right direction.  They gave me the wrong Wifi password and I had to sit on the phone for 20 minutes to get the right one.  Case goods were falling apart, for example the drawer of my luggage stand kept opening up of its own will and I was worried I would bang into it in the middle of the night.  When I notified the front desk agent he;1

The hotel is obviously a bit battered when you arrive but the state of some of the rooms is awful. In my first room: innumerable stains on the carpets and walls, windows and air-con damaged and held together with duct tape, indescribable stains on the tv cabinet, the door to the bathroom had been punched through and then very poorly patched. Hairs in the bath. After I complained they moved me to a 'better' room - that by the standards of any other hotel would have been miserable - cigarette burns in all the furniture, torn shade on the lamp but I was just grateful it was marginally less of a fleapit. Hope to  never return.;1

Manager Cecile Eugenio  was the best thing as well as an agent by the name of Diana .  âCecile listened and seemed genuinely  concerned for our family and making our stay nice.  It was not a great stay though as the first night the hot water in the bathtub did not work and that was a huge reason for us staying here.  Next day maintenance couldn't fix the issue so we had to move,  in the next room the Refrigerator was not working or on, maintenance was able to get that working but it was later in the morning and all our refrigerated items became too warm and we had to throw perishable items away.  The 3rd day my husband was alone at the motel and he could not find his way to the room and the attendant that evening treated him like he was homeless and then called me to ask what;1

When I called the front desk the person who answered hardly spoke English told me ""come down here and get a cup if you want one"" which was strange. When I went down he was only willing to give me one small cheap Styrofoam cup, I had to plead to get two. Later, when I couldn't find the icemaker, I called again to ask what floor it was on, and the guy told me that ""they don't have one"". This dump should be torn down. Run like the plague!!!!!!";1

"I booked two rooms for one night at ""The New Yorker"" using a trip advisor link. One room for my wife and I and one room for our friends from Zambia who we were taking into NYC to see a play and do some sightseeing. I chose the New Yorker for three reasons: 1. Price; 2. Location; and 3. the advertised fact that the hotel had a bar/lounge on one of the upper floors with a great view.  What a rip off. I was quoted with my triple AAA discount a rate of $359.16 for both rooms with free wifi. The actual cost we paid was $597.04. In addition to the NY sales tax and NY city hotel tax which I expected there was an occupancy tax, a NYC hotel unit fee, a mandatory $29 Facility fee ( so you could have the ""FREE"" wifi), a Non-Room Tax NY state sales tax fee,  and a Non-Room Tax NYC sales";1

This was our first visit to New York, I wished we had researched this hotel a little more before booking. When we booked the accommodation it clearly stated check in available from 3pm, we arrived at around 3.30pm. Waited in line only to be told that our room wasnât ready. No problem if you would like to pay for a room upgrade. So we received the up selling routine.  We were tired from travelling so agreed the added fee over $100. Once my credit card had be swiped the guy on reception informed us that the previous guests had only just left, so that room wasnât ready either. No problem you can leave your suitcases in the luggage room, and return in one hour. Once we got to the luggage room it was $5.00 per case, we refused to pay out anymore money for one hour. (If we had arrived;1
We arrived very late, past midnight to check into our pre-paid 2 night stay. We were tired and in need of a good nights rest. We arrived to a busy valet check in. We wanted to self park and for some reason was told our standard Expedition would not fit in the self park area and instead of the 28$ self park fee it would be 50 a night. We arrived into a hot, muggy hotel room and the pungent odor was like a smack in the face. We assumed turning the AC all the way down and going to bed would solve the problem but instead found ourselves waking up a few hours later sweaty and miserable. We were forced to change rooms and that took us time and energy we did not have. They gave us a complimentary breakfast for our struggles and it was honestly the worst food Iâve ever eaten in my 40;1

Even though the price was reasonable, it was not worth it.  We knew this was a budget priced hotel and did not attempt to compare it to the high end, luxury hotels we usually frequent.  However, terrible is terrible.  We had booked a queen suite.  The bed was not a queen, but a full size.  For two adults, it was extremely tight.

This was the third time we have stayed at the empire hotel over a number of years. Despite a good location in upper manhattan and near  Central Park, the hotel needs a good clean and restoration and they urgently need to improve  the decor and their service, from installing free wifi to cleaning the carpets. We encountered problems with check in, where a pre-booking at not been received, and the room rate had been increased. Staff were brusque and rude. It all feels mass market and impersonal now, with shoddy decor and some exorbitantly priced commodities such as the bottles water in the room at $7.50.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Cleanliness not great. Paint chipping off the tub. Stains on window treatments. Elevators slow and dirty. I believe the location was fine and there is a Starbucks right around the corner. They charge $3 for the coffee in the room. I never really had hot water in the shower- it was so cool I had chill bumps. Lincoln Center is right across the street and they do have a cute park to have your breakfast and enjoy a cup of coffee. I wouldn't recommend .;1
When checked in all seemed ok apart from dated rooms and tiny bathroom and awful WiFi (had to sit in bathroom to get bars of wifi) 2 nights later I checked my bank account to see they had taken out over Â£400 even though I had already paid, went to reception who advised me this was just taxes... seemed excessive so I called British airways who I booked through who told me it wasnât right as I had already paid everything, BA then kindly phoned the empire and when they called me back said everything would be reveresed and I would get my money back. When we went to reception to ask when I would get it, they said when I check out, not really convenient but at least I was getting it back. Didnât really get much of an apology and just got offered a breakfast and drinks token, least;1
after staying the weekend at this hotel, I should have never been accused of loitering or asked to leave the premises by security.

This is the first review I have ever written, and this is because I feel that it would be unfair not to share the bad experience we had. When we checked in the room (on floor 3) looked reasonable. We went out and returned to our room at around midnight. As we turned the light on we saw cockroaches flittering away from it. We approached staff at reception who at first tried to say that we were liars, and that there were no cockroaches. We asked them to come up and showed them one that was still hiding in a corner. They then informed us that the hotel was fully booked and that we couldn't change rooms. They sprayed the cockroach with a poison spray thing and left it in our room to slowly die. We weren't happy to stay in the room but we didn't have choice as we had nowhere else to;1
"Pool was out of action for weeks but Hotel management did not advise us, so we didm't have any opportunity to change hotel  Then they thought it acceptable to cut holes in our ceiling at 7pm whilst we were in the room to install wifi (which isn't free by the way); yes we were not charged for that night nut the compemsation goes little way to fixing a bad experience";1

"I booked what I believed to be a suitable room for a lot of money for a 7 night stay. It was a shoebox, with a window that looked straight onto a brick wall, no light, and no where to even put down our suitcases. The bathroom required scraping your side against the door edge to get in or out. We had to step over our suitcase to get to the bed. It turns out it was an ""express room"".... I did not know this until we arrived. Couldn't someone have mentioned that this is not appropriate for a 7 night stay? We had to spend a whole lot more money upgrading it after 2 awful nights in this terrible room. Had I known that I would have stayed eksewhere. The staff never smile and the atmosphere overall is not really pleasant. I would never go back.";1
"Awful quality in general. Lifts took about 20 minutes every time you wanted to go up and down, including just to get ice on the floor below as they have no fridges. Lots of things were broken old or just plain dirty. The top of the wardrobe was caked in dust. The traffic on the street below can be heard super loudly on any floor (we stayed on two different floors) as they have no double glazing. The shuttle service is also dangerous. We watched a couple panic and have to take a taxi to get there plane on time as the taxi was so late and both the driver and the concierge were super rude replying ""you are lucky it was only half an hour late"" and the driver had no idea how long the journey to other hotels would take. Also I think a roller coaster is more comfortable the van had";1
Poor customer service and poor quality of rooms. The trip started off with a room that had a smelly odor, dirty tub and towels, and dirty linen. I went down to tell the front desk (after waiting 10 minutes for an elevator). They moved me to a new room that at least didn't smell bad (still dirty though). For price of this hotel, it is absolutely unacceptable to be exposed to this low level of quality in the rooms. The customer service is also horrible. When I wanted to checkout there was a long line so I called to see if there was anything else I needed to do to check out. The lady on the phone was very rude and yelled at me when I said that I had already left the room without letting them know (which doesn't make any sense to me - since I was calling to LET THEM KNOW).

After a long flight and with a big headache all I wanted was a cool quiet room to lay down in... Thanks for the big disappointment and addition to my headache, particularly from the customer service staff who were not only unhelpful but also only offered a single trite and insincere apology and of course no compensation whatsoever (even a free bottle of water or a breakfast coupon would have been more than enough). They obviously didn't care and run the hotel to absolute maximum capacity with insufficient maintenance or ability to properly resolve issues. I found their;1

This Hotel was filthy, the service was horrible and someone tried to break down our door. There is no security here whatsoever, doors and hallway windows are left open and fireprotection is poor!!!

Many of the reviews about this hotel rave about its location.  Well the location aint great.  The Hotel is situated around about 105th street.  So thats atleast a 1 hour walk from Times Sq (60 blocks away).  The subway station might not be far, but there are no bars/restaurants around this hotel, so you will spend every morning and every evening on the metro.  That said, when i got to this hotel, i did not even stay here.  I booked a twin room (travelling with my father) and on arrival was given a small double room.  The bed was not even a double bed.  The woman at reception had the cheek to send us up to the room, knowing it was not a twin room.  The room was dark, and looked pretty unclean.  My father did say the bathroom was ok, but i never looked at it.  I was straight down;1

I made a reservation over the phone at the Ameritania. After 2 days of not receiving a confirmation email or my credit card being charged, I called to check.  Maria told me that they could not honor my reservation because it was booked as part of a room block. This was explained to me when I made the reservation and told that it's not a problem. I was told numerous times that it's fine, the rate would be honored and I didn't need to participate in any of the events.  I am beyond annoyed at this hotel and their complete lack of professionalism and absolute lack of customer service.   Be warned, I can only imagine how terrible the service is at the hotel if they can't even hire competent employees to do the booking.;1
Very good service. Hotel is in desperate need of renovation. Location is excellent. Staff is very good. The condition of the hotel is deteriorating. They no longer have coffee pots in the rooms which is totally unacceptable.;1
Our family of 4 stayed for 3 nights at Empire hotel. On the 3rd night, the hotel had an electrical problem and lost power in the middle of the night. With the elevators not working, and fire trucks in front of the hotel, an announcement was made at 1:00am telling guests that there was an electrical problem but not to worry. We followed other guests down 8 flights of stairs only to wait in the lobby for another hour before we were told we could return to our rooms via the stairs. We returned to a room without power or water. The power was still out in the morning and with no working washrooms, we left as soon as possible. I was told at the front desk that the hotel would follow up when I asked for a refund for the night's stay but I have yet to receive a reply to my emails. The;1
I rarely write reviews, but this place is so bad that I feel the need to warn others.  I'll start by saying that the pictures are not in any way, shape or form an accurate depiction of this place. Filthy bathrooms, tiny, dirty bedrooms with doors that don't close properly, as well as other guests that appear to be using the place as a half-way house would be much closer to the truth. While we did pay less than what other places in Manhattan are charging, the price that we were charged did not give us any indication that we would be staying in a dump. I was traveling with my two daughters, and because we arrived at 3 am, we stayed until 9 the same morning. We slept in our street clothes, with a table jammed against the door and prayed that in the event of a fire, we could find;1
We knew we could not expect much for this price, but even then it was very disappointing. Everything was just old, dirty and decrepit. Airconditioning did not work, making the room very hot at night. Wifi did not work either. The shared bathroom was very dirty. Towels and bed sheets had holes in them. It is just a very dirty and depressing place.;1

This is a filthy, scary hotel, definitely not for families or the faint hearted!  BEDROOM (Fifth Floor):- Carpets were filthy and hadn't been hovered in some time.  The skirting boards were thick with dust, the blinds were snapped off, the air con didn't work, wallpaper was hanging off in several places, with an attempt in one area to stick it back down using a drawing pin, furniture scratched and missing handles off some of the drawers and the TV was from the 70's.  The beds were surprisingly comfy and looked like they had fresh bedding on them, but unfortunately, also had bed bugs!  BATHROOM - Tiled floor was cracked and sharp underfoot, taps broken, had grime round them and there was no hot water, shower, bath and floor were all filthy and had no place to put any toiletries;1
The hotel is in an excellent location:  very close to the Lincoln Centre, Central Park and subways. The doormen are very helpful.  The entrance to the hotel is like going into a nightclub.  The dÃ©cor is as you see it in the photos advertising the place, but you do not appreciate how dark it is in there.  In fact the whole hotel is in half light.    Our room was the standard queen bed size.  There was space around the bed, but very little hanging space (4 hangers) or space for our two suitcases and hand luggage.  The desk provided was loaded with items for sale - including a $76 bottle of wine.   The shower room was very small.  Shelves for cosmetics are provided, but these are not big enough for toilet bags etc. The bed was comfortable.  Our room was at the back and our view was;1

October 2013 we booked 7 nights (November) by budgetplaces.com at the Morningside Inn in New York City. We paid budgetplaces.com 99,14 Euro in advance for one night. On arrival on 9th. November the room we were given was not in accordance with the specifications in our reservation. We informed the manager that the room did not meet our expectations, but apparently it was not possible to have the room we had originally booked. In order to be given another more suitable room it was necessary to pay a surcharge to which we consented having no other option and paid for the seven nights. When we had finally got to our room we became aware that the 99,14 euros we had already paid to the booking site had not been deducted from the bill. We immediately informed the manager of this;1

Was very disappoint on the hotel all together. Very small lobby the manager was friendly but the rest of the staff you feel like you were bothering them. The one elevator they have we never knew if it was going to make it to the next floor. Only 3 people could fit in it without carrying any luggage. The room was very small , bathroom was clean but a joke b/c we had to call downstairs to ask how the shower works. They told us that everyone has to ask abt it. Does that not tell you it needs to change? Last straw is that the manager call us a cab but it ended up being a towncar and was twice the amount we paid to get to the hotel. The manager had to be making some  money of this some how.;1
the stay was okay, the room was small and damp. My main problem was after the stay I got a notification that they had charged us double. My family didn't find out until we got to the airport on the way home. So i called to ask to get my money back. they asked me to send back statements which I did then they proceeded to tell me I was lying and refused to give me my money back. After weeks of punishing calls and emails, they finally sent me an amount of the full total of money which was even the full amount. I still haven't got the full amount. If you're looking for a great hotel to stay at this is not the one.;1

Worst NY Hotel stay ever. I was promised an early check in and a view. For this, I had to upgrade and pay an extra fee each night. Since we didn't get the early check in, and had tickets to a show at 2:45, we had to preregister where we were told that we would automatically get the room we wanted. When we returned at 7:00, there was no view and the room upgrade that we were supposed to get was either not done at all, or the worst ever. The top of the line executive rooms are so small that a dresser won't fit into the room and so there is none, I'm not sure that it wasn't a full instead of a queen sized bed and bathroom is VERY small with no water pressure. When I complained, I was told the manager would return my call and the upgrade fee would be returned. Not only was the fee;1

This hotel tries to compete with its central park neighbors.  From the 'fee attached' inroom coffee to the malfunctioning a/c and low class 'I don't care attitude' the Empire Hotel was a horrid disappointment!  I would not recommend this hotel.

"We were expecting the hotel to be nicer due to the price. The first room we got had a ""locked"" window that was broken and wouldn't close.

This is quite the worst hotel we've ever been allocated. The foyer is shabby, crammed with hampers of linen, decor well past it's best. The lift was disgusting, dirty and smelly. The room was not clean, stained windows, dirty and tattered curtains. The single seat was stained and unuseable, the room phone did not work and thebedding looked suspect. We stayed one night, sleeping fully dressed on top of the bed. Reception staff did not seem surprised at our departure.

I asked every day and the receptionist were not helpful at all. They didn't want to refund me, they didn't buy a new one for me. I wanted to speak to the manager but at the appointment he was not present.  To make me shut up they asked for my contact details, saying they were going to phone call me. I never received a phone call. They ask for your money the first day you go there, and later they don't mind about you. Respect for people is completely missing. Never back again.;1

Then we said we wold like to reserve a new room for tomorrow and he agreed. On the next day, we went to front desk and asked for a change, but another shift of staff showed up and refused our request cuz they didn't get anything from previous day. The story continued for the following days and they refused the change and never fixed the hairdryer with all kind of excuses.

"The rooms were too small.  There is a night club below the hotel and on the second night we stayed there a band was playing music so loud you could hear it throughout the entire hotel.

We cancelled our last night there and went somewhere else because it was so bad.  I will not ever stay at another Ramada again.";1
This was are first visit and it was very disturbing. We were very unsatisfied, we had to keep requestings things to be fixed, and there was supposed to be 2 beds and a rollaway bed for 3 adults we got nothing and had to share the little beds which was very uncomfortable.To add insult they took us 2 a suite that had 1 bed and a let out couch as if we were stupid and didn't know are measurements. The tub look like it had been walk on with black tar, toilet kept messing up, door would not stay secured and had to keep slamming it, had to keep asking for towels and wash rags and for 300.00$ a night we did not have a refrig or micro and when they gave us the frig it was dirty and set on the floor and the blding was under some kind of construction the elevators was scary and we would;1
The staff on duty when we checked in was pleasant, and the room, although small, seemed adequate - until we discovered dirty sheets as we're getting into bed at 4am. Other room problems: a dirty coffee pot, cockroaches in the bathroom, multiple non-functioning electrical outlets, and what appeared to be pubic hair on supposedly clean towels.  The security lock on the door was broken. There was no functioning ice machine on our floor, nor the floor above or below. After check-in, the front desk seemed to be understaffed, unpleasant, and frequently did not answer the phone. They were not helpful with arranging transportation. The bed was comfortable, and the location is good, but find another place with clean sheets, and electricity.;1
I am a travel agent and recently had 2 clients come and stay in this hotel. They are very laid back clients. But they called me at 6:00 AM to explain to me that they were in the middle of a disaster. While they paid for an extra night to be able to check in early, they were denied early check in. Even though they had bought the room for that night. They were denied because it was still an 'early check in' which they couldn't do. They were finally let into their room hours later. Only to discover it was the wrong room. And even  though it was not the room on the reservation, they still had to pay $275 to upgrade rooms. And not to mention, he had to deal with the rudest staff ever. They then charged him twice (on 2 different cards somehow!) for his meal at the restaurant. Then;1
This is one of the worst hotels I've visited in New York city... Incredibly dirty (both in the hall and in the rooms), terribly noisy, and also the service is terrible. No one to welcome you and help you at check in. And there is no room wi-fi or people to help you with it.;1
Iâve stayed in budget hotels that are better than this 4*  You could forgive the tired and shabbiness of the rooms perhaps if the staff were friendly and accommodating but unfortunately they are as rude and unhelpful as Iâve ever come across.    I pride myself on being a polite and respectful guest â I was in a room that was clearly one of their worsts and I put up with it without complaint for almost the whole week until it became unbearableâ¦ the heater was old and to say it was noisy was an understatement â it rattled and growled, cranked and honestly sounded like someone in painâ¦ Iâve never heard anything like it.  They did come to fix it but to be honest I noticed little improvement.  I also had one day where my room was freezing and the heater appeared to have stooped all;1
We checked into this hotel on Saturday the 3rd of September. My boyfriend had to attend an event at Universal Studios on Monday so we came up early. We called the night before to make a reservation and mentioned that we had rooms under a particular reservation. First they said they didn't have the reservation. We figured we'd sort it out when we got to the hotel and just booked a room.  We got there and of course they charged us the more expensive rate. We had to get the manager on duty to come out and explain what the deal was. We gave up trying and just checked in. The hotel is kinda old and musty. Definitely bring a travel candle to get rid of the smell. We had a non smoking room but it still had this weird smell.  So Sunday morning we called down to the front desk and asked;1
Ok, there are flowers in the lobby, but that, my friends is the closest this hellhole gets to being a four star hotel. We chose this hotel because it was very close to where we have to be in the morning. We got there at 5, they said our room wasn't ready yet but they had one on the executive floor, so we said great. The view is of a dumpster between two buildings, the key has already stopped working and we had to go get a new one, when I flushed the toilet, my husband starting laughing his head off... he said it sounded like an airplane was taking off behind his head. The beds are tiny doubles, and it sounds like the person above me is relentlessly pushing a very large office desk on a cement floor from one side of the room to the other just about every five minutes, just as I'm;1
- The lifts were out of order. (which I have now noticed on reviews that they have been like that for some time.)Â   - Wallpaper in the room was filthy and hanging of wall.  - Carpet was filthy. (we had to wear socks or shoes at all times.)  - Floor was uneven. (Stepping from the bathroom you felt like you were falling down.)  - Stains on sheet.  - Noise. (Four youths from a ballet group in the room next door alone and security were unable to contact their team leader, they were banging on our walls at midnight.)  - Could not see out of windows with the dirt.  - Wardrobe unusable with dirt.  - Pictures on websites not a representative of hotels rooms or the exterior whatsoever.  - Reception were kicking up a fuss because I didn't have the debit card that I used to pay for the;1
I can't express enough how furious I am! i have booked 2 rooms at Days Inn Hotel New York City for a trip that i planned with my family in August. I did my booking through booking.com and got a confirmation email stating that the cancellation fee would not be charged if cancelled one day prior the arrival date. I specifically chose this option as i was not quite sure about the dates my family gets to the US, so that just in case i could change or cancel reservation. Although i was charged immediately 250$ out of 800$ that i'm supposed to pay on arrival. I immediately cancelled everything in order to get the money that i had no intention to spend before arrival. I called the hotel and in a very rude way they told me that they meant it, and this is how their business works;1

I got Confirmation of the booking with an arrival time of 3.00pm. I arrived at 3.15pm and was told I had no reservation. I was told by reception staff to go downstairs and rebook the reservation but you will have to pay an additional $3.00 to do so. I went down stairs to go to the bathroom and walked past the computers. The Rest room and downstairs public areas were very dirty and had a strange smell everywhere. I went back upstairs and told the reception to contact his office to find out what happened to my booking this he did with no fuss and put me through to the head office they told me my booking had;1

We paid for 4 nights for  a double room with a private bathroom. From the outside it looks ok, but once inside its dark and dirty.   Upon checking in the first think you notice is the reception lady clearly didn't want to be there and was miserable. We were given the keys for room 602, we had 2 cases and went to use the lift but found it full of cleaning supplies and cleaner made us wait while she went up to a higher floor. Eventually we squeezed us and our cases in as it was still full of cleaning trolley and other supplies.   Once in the room the first thing we noticed was the bed was on an incline, it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned in weeks with thick dust on the skirting boards, windows sills, etc. Tried to plug in a charger and the wall socket fell forward;1
I stayed at Abercorn House for a night just over two weeks ago, with my son. When we first arrived we were pleased to find friendly staff, a good sized room, and the hostel seemed very clean. However, lying in bed reading that night, I noticed an insect on my pillow. When I squashed it, to my horror blood squited out. I few minutes later I noticed another. When I lifted my pillow, three more were crawling along the edge of my mattress (the sheet didn't quite reach).I went down to reception and asked to change rooms. I was told that there were none free, but was offered an extra sheet! Obviously I didn't sleep. I spent the night squashing bugs as they approached me. Most were filled with blood. In the morning, exhausted and horrified, I went back to reception (with some;1
This hotel was a true nigthmare.  We booked this hotel last minute for a graduation and we liked the location.  When we arrived, we checked in and went to our room. The room was dark, dingy, with old nasty carpet and a nasty smell to it.  The mini fridge in the room was broken.   After taking showers to freshen up (the showers had low pressure and not great).  We decided to deal with the room and just enjoy the city.  The location of the hotel was the only thing about this hotel that is a plus.  Right in the Upper West Side at Broadway and right next to the subway.    We arrived  back to our room late at night and got ready for bed.......and this is when the real disaster begins.  The toilet started overflowing and overflowing and overflowing, we could NOT get it to stop, it;1

Staying at The Empire Hotel was so noisy, it felt like you were sleeping on the street, we did ask to move to a quieter part of the hotel but the staff weren't very helpful or accommodating at all even though the housekeeping told us other rooms were available in the quieter part of the hotel. The bathroom was unclean with mould on the shower screen and bath, there were toiletries for only 1 person even though there were 3 people in the room. the curtains were badly stained as was the bedsheet and my daughter was bitten after sleeping in one of the beds. I also noticed they over charged us as we have a food bill for the lounge which we never ordered, so overall very poor. Lastly we had problems as we couldn't get wifi in our room, we wasted a lot of our time having to wait in;1
I posted a review about my poor experience. The manager responded and indicated that I was offered a new room. Completely untrue. Notes were made on the file apparently, but no offer was communicated.  A new room wasnât mentioned until I checked out. Terrible experience all around.;1
Well maintained Art Deco hotel. Queen room on 27th floor was larger and better laid out than many higher price red venues. Booked a week in advance for $285. Taxes pushed daily rate to $360/d.

Paid full price, received no service. After arriving last night from a 12 hour flight, the check in process  was fluid. Room is noisy, shower is terrible (takes ages for hit water), and breakfast is expensive for the quality. After a long day in the office, I want to have dinner at the bar/restaurant they have. Terrible service, slow, grumpy, and very arrogant style. I go to my room, and for my surprise, the room was not serviced! I call reception and all they said was âwe apologize, we are short on staff, if you want your room serviced, you need to let us know in the morningâ.  Strange attitude for 250$ a nightâ¦;1
My husband and I went to American when i was 4 months pregnant. When we arrived in New York at the Hotel it was 9am. We asked if there was any rooms to check into as we had just gotten off a red eye flight. I was really happy when they said yes and gave us the keys to a room. When i opened the door, i was so enraged! The room was as big as a double bed, with about 1/2 a meter all the way around. The bathroom was a matchbox. It was horrible. My husband went down to speak with the staff. They said all they could do is put us in a bigger room, but we would have to pay extra per night. We ended up moving a floor up to a bigger room (average size) and paying and extra $120 a night. So annoyed. I hated my stay at this Hotel. It was awful. The only good thing was that is was so close;1
I'm sitting at airport now three hours before my flight just to be away from this horrible hotel. We stayed in roomed 501 and last night was a night mare. There's a guy who was in 511 right in front of the elevator that partied from ten pm to four am with women and men doing drugs drinking running up and down the halls and God knows what else. We called the front desk five times and  erickas lazy self did nothing at  all to assist. This is a rooming house part hotel with no award winning stickers or service. We practically begged for wash  cloths but were provided with towels. Front desk is no help at all and I'm telling everyone i know to never stay here no matter the price.

Considering the Empire Hotel's Rooftop Lounge is my favorite place to go in the city, I'm shocked to have had such a terrible experience staying there as a hotel guest for the first time. I stayed this past weekend (October 2015) for one night.  Pros: The location is great. The hotel is on the Upper West Side with a short walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, and pretty much anything else you would want to see while visiting NYC. Additionally, the interior design and structure of the hotel are gorgeous. The rooftop lounge, as I mentioned, is so much fun! It's always pretty crowded with good music and fun people. Even though the drinks are very expensive, it's a good time up there.  Cons: The lighting throughout the entire hotel is awful. This goes far beyond the;1
It's true that the price is good for NYC, but if you make some effort and look for early bird or last minute deals you could find something so much better with only a little bit more. I got a quiet, cleaner, newer room with a private bathroom and subway only a block away with only 18 euros more per night. The Jane claims to be a hotel, but it's just a hostel with fancy staff uniforms. It only good for people who party until 4 am and don't care about the terrible noise coming from the club, and I guess there was a private party in the upper floor too. I was dead tired because I hadn't slept in a night bus, but still couldn't sleep (with ear plugs) because of the noise and heat. The room was terribly hot. It doesn't have A/C, just a fan that really makes it feel authentically like;1

we arrived at this hotel on the afternoon and we checked out again 1 hour after arriving.  The location was terrible, it was bordering on Harlem and did not look great for venturing out after dark.  The room was tiny, the fabric around the bed looked as though a cat has been clawing at it, the carpet was threadbare, the furniture did not match and when it did the doors did not close.  You could not get a picture on the tv, and the subway went past every few minutes and rattled the furniture.  I have compained to Flexible Trips about this hotel and the quality and I am currently in discpute with them to get my money back, we were only officially there 1 hour and I am not willing to be out of pocklet for over Â£600.;1
I picked this Hilton for its location as this was our first trip to Universal so I wanted all to be nice and less stressful. However after long days of fun I dreaded coming back to this hotel. Dark, room stinks, wallpaper coming off, things look like cheap workmanship, and the $300 per night room looked like a Days Inn or maybe Motel 6 room. I checked-in and was put in a room where it looked like someone ran out in the middle of their bath because they knew I was coming or something. The outside is beautiful but the inside needs a complete remodel. It didn't feel nowhere near a Hilton. Actually the Hilton Garden Inn just 2 miles away looked much nicer. It was so bad we stayed away until we were so tired and it was time to sleep. Soon as we woke up, we got breakfast and left the;1

Please read all the reviews and think very hard before you book this hotel.  The internet pictures look nice but beware.  The bathrooms have mold around the tub  You cannot turn around in the bathroom.  The water pressure is like someone is spitting on you.  The main room was dirty.  Coffee maker but no coffee pot.  We had a mircowave and sink but no stove like the picture.  The straw mat that they call a rug was dirty.  The hardwood floors were sticky so make sure you don't go barefoot.  The hide a bed was broken, the sheets were dingy, pillows were so old that they were flat like apiece of paper.  Take your OWN towels!!  The air condition kind of worked.  The main hallways were filthy.  The ONLY good thing about this place was that the elevator worked.  Please don't stay here;1

I've never written anything bad about a hotel before to fair other hotels I have stayed I. Have been what I had expected but this hotel omg! The rooms are small even though we were upgraded to a king! The air conditioning unit makes a squeak and bang every time it turns on and off. The bathroom size wasn't bad but there was mould on the tiles in shower area, there's was a sweet wrapper under the bedside table when we arrived and was still there 4days later when we left. They have biscuits, coffee maker etc in the room but everything is very expensive for example a small (500ml) bottle of water is $7.50 same water but bigger 2ltr size is sold in the shop around the corner for $2.00. The porters and doormen very friendly, helpful and happy. The reception isn't a happy one. There;1
I want to warn you about this hotel:  Stay Away!   I am not disparaging the Ramada chain -- I've stayed at Ramadas around the world, and they are generally more than adequate.  But this Ramada is in a class by itself -- it's HORRIBLE.  In fact, the defects of this hotel are so deeply-ingrained and pervasive that I don't think anything can be done to fix it, apart from firing the entire staff and getting new ownership and managers.  Clear the decks!!  First of all, this Ramada is on the eastern OUTSKIRTS of Hollywood -- VERY inconvenient if you want to be in the midst of the Hollwyood action.  It's on the edge of Hollywood in a DANGEROUS, extremely sketchy neighborhood and you're literally taking your life into your hands if you walk around these streets at night.  Secondly, the;1
So you've read the majority of the reviews and they all say it was a little sparse but good value for money and you think ok why not give it a go? Well don't that is exactly what I did and it ruined my trip to New York, I've personally stayed in quite a few different places including YHA's and tents as well as some gorgeous place this is a -- hole in comparison to all of them!  I decided that the Riverside wouldn't be a bad choice for a short trip to New York, seen as it was my 21st not long a go and I just graduated. We arrived at about 6pm absolutley exhausted to a hotel that from the outside looked bad, at the desk we were given our room key and sent in the death trap lift.  The problems with our room: it was dirty the blind was broken there were live wires wrapped around the;1

Two nights in the city, you expect to pay top dollar for a hotel. However, top dollar and water damage is unfair.  Who knows how long the ceiling has been damaged, how much black mold is living there and worst of all if your going to get wet while laying directly underneath the damage.   In addition, Iï¸ asked to speak to a supervisor/manager and they were apparently never scheduled on and Iï¸ called 3 times after my stay and they never got back to me.   While staying in the hotel, Iï¸ asked about a new room and the front desk staff told the hotel was sold out.   Interesting part, they claim they had no idea about the damage, but one of the cleaning staff members was standing next to the front desk and was well aware of the damage and couldnât believe we were put in that room.

Booked in this hotel for 9 nights but decided to stay elsewhere for 3 nights even after paying for 9. Booked for 2 adults and 2 kids (8 and 1). The room had only 1 queen bed. We were told that this is what we booked. However, that was not the worse. The robotic receptionist Micheal (who actually behaves like America's tourism minister) at the reception told me that I was trying to 'cut corners' (his exact words) by booking for 2 people and asking for space for 4 when my booking stated 4 people. He was beyond sarcastic and he said he couldn't believe that someone would book without checking the room specifications. Pathetic way to deal with a tired customer who travelled with 2 little kids on a 11 hour flight plus 4 hours at the airport. Another receptionist Nancy was just a;1
The hotel authorised my credit card to hold more money than the actual cost of the accommodation. This was never made clear to me, and had major implications on my holiday.  The accommodation cost me $899.00USD + $150.00USD authorisation that is refunded.  The hotel authorised my card the above costs, plus another $150.00USD + $899.00USD.  Further, I had to use my own time and money to resolve this issue with international phone calls and 4G data to email the property.   I've lodged a complaint, to which I've heard nothing thus far. I'm not surprised however as the service I've received to date has been very poor. I will never return nor recommend.;1

"OMG!  What a dump.  No elevator whatsoever, four flights of stairs to our room.  The room was microscopic, about the size of a broom closet, smallest ""hotel"" room I've ever seen.  The end of the bed was JAMMED against the far wall, meaning you could not walk around to the far side of the bed, the only access was to climb over the other person sleeping there.  There was barely any place to even stand on the other side of the bed.  The only sink was at the side of the bed.  No closet whatsoever.  No room to open a suitcase except on top of the bed...literally not enough floor space to even open it up on the floor.  Once you're done with your even small suitcases there's no place to put them except against the door...so when you go to leave you need to stack them on top of the bed";1

Stay away from this dump. I was in room 206 and there were flys and ants. The bathroom was dirty and the light had rust in the bathroom. One of the table lights did not work because it did not have a light bulb. Paid over $300 for this room and sure could have found a much better hotel. When I checked out they asked how my stay was and they could care less about my opinion. Stay Away!;1

HOTEL made our experience that was supposed to be a fun family getaway for an 11yr old bday her worst bday ever. from not having rooms provided AS PER BOOKED IN THE BEGINNING. but than tried to charge MORE MONEY to accommodate the way they were originally booked is so poor to treat honor members. As a parent you never want your child to experience that let alone say it. how sad that they still haven't tried to help us..;1
"When checking in we were offered a higher floor room but warned that it was a much smaller room. With that in mind we declined the offer. What we were given was a room barely large enough to fit the bed in. Thinking we had been mistakenly given a lower grade room we contacted reception twice to confirm and were told this was indeed correct. What size the smaller room was is anybodyâs guess but this room was not large enough for both of us to get dressed in at once. Only one side of the bed had enough room left over for a table.   There were six taps in the bathroom; two in the sink, four in the bath servicing both the bath and the shower. All of them dispensed piping hot water. Upon request the hotel tried to address this and eventually we were able to get a reasonable shower";1

The rooms are too hot and the air con too noisy the bathrooms are dirty and smell very bad also the carpet is very worn and sticky. The bed creeked. the rooms where in need of a clean and a paint. Many older people live here and they leave a smell when they move around to the bathrooms. If you like the above and enjoy the smell of wee then go for it !!!;1

This hotel is not worth considering.  Horrible customer service.  The only favorable factor is that it is close to Universal Studio. The information at the hotel is not synchronized with Hilton corporate site, which creates total confusion when you make reservations through Hilton direct numbers.  I will not stay here again.;1

I have complained twice and nothing has changed. I'm going to move heaven and earth to get my money back. It's pathetic that thwir excuse is that the room service manager isn't available right now.";1
The rudest and most condescending customer service I had ever worked with. They insisted that a change I had placed on my reservation through Chase Travel to a later date was canceled in their system instead of changed, resulting in me losing the money paid. I had only found out when I called to confirm the change that it was never put on their records correctly. Infuriating experience and will for sure never engage with these criminals again. Atrocious business practices.;1
Worst hotel ever! Front dest staff were rude and unhelpful. The hotel NEVER answers the phone. I had corporate customer service try 5 times and they couldn't get through and said they never can!  I checked out after one night. Rooms are gross. Shower leaked and beds were itchy.;1
I was traveling with my wife and made the mistake of waiting to find a hotel until the last minute.  We ended up paying $230 for this hotel.  If it was anywhere other than NYC, I would equate it to at <$50 hotel.  You can view the attached photos to see the overall quality of the room.  When we arrived, we were not greeted and waited at least 10 minutes while the one person in front of us was being transferred to another hotel.  We were almost given a smoking room, but then they were able to find a non-smoking room with two doubles.  The BAD: Glitter, ink stains, and a tear in the bed sheets, mildew on the shower curtain, loud AC unit (had to turn it off to sleep), stains on the carpet and walls, an old chipped desk (caused by the tv cabinet which swung open against the desk;1
"First of all, its a stretch to call this Hollywood.  This is a VERY funky part of the west part of downtown.  You can get better deals just looking for a hotel downtown.  I woud not walk to this Metro station.  Its not a 3 star hotel - -its a converted motor court.  It has no on-site restaurant and you should NOT venture out at night.  It has a breakfast that you should really skip - little squares of powdered eggs with toast is not breakfast.  The coffee tasted like it was filtered through nicotine.  But maybe thats because the stench of nicotine covered me in my ""non-smoking"" room.  The sheets and pillows were saturated with cigarette smell.  Perhaps the most delightful feature was the flickering blue flourescent light found outside your barred window at night that was";1
Great location, nice room. As a whole, the hotel is a very nice Hilton location.  At the end of our trip we left with no complaints, but we also left behind two jackets in the closet. From Hollywood we arrived in Monterey and realized that we had left the two items behind. I called the hotel to let them know, and to please contact me if they find it. 2 days went by without any word. So, I called back and they had no reference to my previous call. Nothing was left behind, or found since then. I asked them to please call me again, but the LP staff was less than helpful again and it seems like a chore to take down my information. I would imagine the cleaning staff would be able to find left behind items? I would hope that their integrity would allow them to hand left behind items;1
I stayed in this hotel in August 2012 for one night and have over 150 bed bug bites on my body!  I have spent over $600 in medication, medical attention, throwing out my luggage and clothes, throwing out gifts I had purchased in my travels and throwing out my infested hand bag!  My body has welts and sores all over it and it will take many months to look normal again.  Management does not return call and gives out a false contact phone number.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILTHY HOLE.  Report them to phone number 311 in New York City and file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau if you have problems with them.;1
The Hotel location is terrific, across from Lincoln Center. All the good ends there.  The hotel information and reception is so horrible.  They are nasty, unhelpful and down right rude.  There is no return information.  Impossible to speak to a person.  Everything is voicrmail.   The Departments do not speak to each other.  If you have a problem billing if off sight so they send you back to the hotel where it is only voicemail.   Ed's Chowder House is worth a try but the hotel book elsewhere.;1

This hotel was AWFUL!!!  Management did NOT do anything service-wise to fix the situation. And they make you sign something when you check in that says no refunds.  The room was dirty - used cigarette butts in the corner of the room. Dirty, dirty carpeting in the narrow dingy hallway that smelled like gas and urine at the same time.  The shared bathroom was DISGUSTING!! There were bugs crawling on the sink and cockroaches on the shower curtain. When we asked the front desk about the bugs and the gas smell, they rolled their eyes and then said they'd take care of it. Yeah, right!! They DID NOTHING!!!  That night when we returned, the sink bugs were gone but the cockroaches were still partying!  We had NO heat in our room but figured why complain, they hadn't done anything yet re;1
This hotel has great trimming but underneath it leaves much to be desired.  The rooms and bathrooms are SMALL, the amenities are lacking and the up keep hasn't been kept up. Looking for a plug for your phone you'll look all over, and there is NO counter space anywhere. For the money you are paying go to another hotel.;1
Pretty much as  described in all reviews.  I just donât understand how Hotels.Com has it listed on their website. Horrible check in, $50 2 hour early check in fee even though room was ready. Located above a pot shop and everywhere  smells of weed. Mattress is beyond worn out.  No one answering the phone and goes to voicemail, not sure how they would address an emergency as no one is here.  I donât know how a building code allows the toilet to be partially under the bathroom sink.  Hopefully they sanitize as you canât sit on the toilet without touching something.   See photos and what appears to be a large blood stain on the wall.  There appears to be a large blood stain on the wall, see photos.;1

"This hotel is a nightmare. In the ""value for money"" scale, this place scores negative. Where to start... It's an old ruin. The fact that besides the lobby, everything is broken and smells weird. Wi-Fi couldn't be worse and it doesn't reach the ""business center"" where people are expected to work (which, on the other hand, it's just a tiny 70's-like office with 3 desks). But the worst of all are probably the lifts. So few of them for such a big hotel with hundreds of rooms. I was in floor 29 and in rush hour it could easily take 15-20 minutes to get to the lobby. There was a fire at the hotel during my stay and nobody was able to provide any information on what was happening.

I had the misfortune to stay at this grisily hotel in November for my 50th birthday.  This hotel was absolutely disgusting. This hotel was booked through a travel agent and was not a cheap package.  The rooms were nothing like advertised on the web they were very small with single beds.  The carpets were dirty as was everything else in the room.  I was also bitten on my arms and legs.  I had to sleep on bath towels because the beds were so dirty.  They left 2 plastic vending cups for coffe but I could not drink or eat anthing in that disgusting room.  To top all this off there were cockroches in this room.  All this made for a unhappy 50th birthday. DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL.  It is hell.;1
The Empire is in a great location. That is its only redeeming quality and one that the hotel staff seem to rely on to cover up a multitude of other sins. This was my second time staying at the Empire. The first time I encountered a very large cockroach in my shower (while I was showering). That was two  years ago and I was hopeful that things had improved. Not so much. The Empire has very small rooms, which is not surprising, given that it's in NYC. What is ridiculous are the bathrooms. They are microscopic, even by NYC standards. A normal size person cannot sit comfortably on the toilet. The shower has a fixed half glass wall, for what effect, I do not know, since, as a result of only a half door, water spills out all over the floor every time you take a shower. There is no;1

Refunds are non negotiable, i was forced to stay at this place for a whole week and I'm telling you if you go there you will either get sick like i did or you'll have something stolen from you. There are no lockers to lock valuables up in. The whole place has this smell to it...  aah forget it you go there its wonderful! best time i ever had...lol;1
We stayed so many hotels in the States and the Europe. And we are sure you are one of the worst 3.    Most staffs were so arrogant and haughty, and they were so impolite. Unluckily, it rained hard in the afternoon of the day we stayed in the hotel. We checked in 10:00p.m. and went to bathroom to wash hands. At that time we realized that the supply of water stopped. I went to the front desk to ask the reason. A staff was so arrogant and said âIt is not our fault. It is due to today's rain. If you want to use water, go to another hotel!â     Oh, dear!  Go to another hotel?!  When we checked in, you  had already known the situation, I'm sure. Why you didn't inform it to us?  We couldn't understand.  So I asked him to change to the other rooms. Only he said was NO. I myself and the;1
This weekend I booked a room and accidently made two reservations. I contacted the hotel and the 3rd party multiple times too get help with this issue. To no avail Nobody would help me undo this disaster. A few days prior i was released from ICU from a stroke. IM 29, and this is all new too me medically.I booked the room in the first place bevciause I needed somewhere to stay close to my rehab center for the stroke. As soon as i realized that I had two hotels i immediately started chat/calls to try to elevate one but Wyndham refused as well as refused to even alter the dates. I take my health seriously and although im learning the side effects of a stroke. I would have thought that a company would take that into consideration as oppose to kicking me down agin and losing close;1
This hotel was horrible.  I travel to NY occassionally and have stayed in various locations.  This one was by far the worst ever!!  I have stayed in places with shared baths, etc. before so I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means.  I checked in and was taken to my room.  I was shown several bathrooms I could chose from.  Only was even half way usable.  The others had huge brown rust stains and the ceramic/paint was peeling off.  It was gross.  The hallway was dark, big trash cans in the hallway and the floor was completely uneven.  I already felt like I was in a horror movie.  I am taken to my room.  No light switch - just a bulb with a string in the middle of the room.  No phone, no refrigerator, no heat!  There was a huge waterstain that covered one wall from floor to;1
American Airlines cancelled our first and second flights (separate days).  The airline is refunding our money, but Gisel at Hollywood Hotel said absolutely no credit or refund will be given.  She even agreed that this was out of our control, but still would not even work with us.  If I could give 0 stars I would.  We are rebooking our trip and it definitely won't be with this hotel and I will make sure my friends and family know how this hotel treats it's customers.  Karma will get you in the end.;1
I was unfortunate to have my flight cancelled at LAX, I went to the hotel at 3 am to get some sleep and wait out the 24 hour delay for my next flight.  Worst experience I have had, I am a globalist with Hyatt, stay 60 plus times a year with them around the world.  I can only image the experience if you were not a globalist. never again for me.;1
"Horrible place. It's false advertising, pictures on website do not reflect the realiy of it. It's filthy, dingy, falling apart, and there were cocroaches in the bathroom.

I have never felt so cheated on a hotel stay, definitely stay away.";1

My family of 4 booked a 2 queen family terrace suite. While the view from the terrace is stunning our actually family suite is 290 sq Ft while the description states varies between 420 and 460. The front desk knows they have to soften the blow of âyes we know but your view is the bestâ I know some of the reviews state that they have been given different rooms that are bigger so I know they have different size rooms available in the same room category. I get that this hotel is old but how about being honest. Biggest pet peeve of mine. Offer discounts for the smaller rooms. I paid a premium for this room for my family. My husband and sons birthday celebration on the nice room was a bust. We have 3 more nights of sleeping in this tiny room. Incredibly disappointed.   The lady that;1
Claims of refurbished rooms, but only the top floors are updated. The other stories are disgusting. No wi-fi, ice machines are broken, and the bath towels are paper-thin. I felt sorry for the impeccably dressed front desk staff that had to apologize for lousy management. The first night we paid $353 for an old room with peeling wallpaper, dirty carpet that turned your socks brown, and with minimal furniture that looked like it had been rescued from a trash bin. The room had an old box TV that was at least 20-years-old and did not have a clear picture. While the bed was supposed to be a king, we are convinced that it was only a queen turned sideways as our feet hung off the end of it. After complaining to the front desk staff, we were moved to a slightly better room. The rooms;1

This hotel has one elevator for all of their guests and one night while we were there the elevator broke down while we were in it. Also, they had no ice machine so basically we had make do without ice. There are no local places to eat other than a small cafe a few blokes down and an Exon station. Don't even think about cable because they only get a few select channels and wireless internet is not even possible. The hotel staff is not very helpful at all and we never got clean towels for the entire three days we were there. The maids left their cleaning supplies in the hall ways all weekend long and never moved them, there were times we had to walk around the cleaning supplies in order to get down the hall way. The one and only elevator they have you share with the staff so half;1
"Good gosh... Where do I begin?!?!  ""Parking Available"" in advertised in this hotel's on-line description, but it is not an actual amenity of the hotel.  The front desk referred us down the road to the Hertz Parking Lot on Broadway & 95th only to be told by the most rudest and condescending of parking attendees that the lot is full; and then be told by the hotel's front desk staff when we came back to the hotel that we have to find (AND PAY) for our own parking since the Hertz Lot is full!  Also, the hotel NEEDS to fix the elevators.  The paying guests of this hotel should not have to line up 10 people deep like cattle just to take the only working elevator to get up to our rooms.  (We decided waiting for 30 minutes to get on the only working elevator was a waste of our time, so";1

Checked my credit card again and there was a pending charge for the night at the hotel.  Room did not have an iron, called housekeeping but they never came.  Dirty towels in bathroom.  No info given at time of check-in about restaurants in the hotel.  Went out for morning coffee.  Location is great but not worth the hassles.";1
Never again! This is by far the worst hilton property i have EVER stayed at! Me and my girlfriend came from south florida all the way to LA to celebrate my birthday for 3 nights and what a mistake that was! when we first arrived & checked in to the hotel it was around 8pm we made sure to put my girlfriends name on the room just incase her key got deactivated or she lost it and wasnt with me she could be issued a new one. So of course we needed to shower & start getting ready for the night so as soon as we walked in the room we started undressing while my shirt was off and my girlfriend was ONLY wearing her underwear we were walked in on by another guest & as mad and upset as we were we didnt even fight for our room to be credited (which is what anyone else would have done) we;1
Not enough words in the review to explain my disappointment with this hotel so I have screenshot my Google review. Staff unfriendly, elevators an absolutely nightmare. 20 mins to wait for one as only 3 out of 6 or 7 were working. No signs to say some were not working and I was there for a full week. Had to take the staff elevator or take the stairs as there were no covid restrictions. Staff too bothered about showing your hotel card to get to the elevator then to be helpful of any kind. Tick tock diner was a nightmare in the end. Ignorant rude staff. I was thrown a check at me and told to pay at the counter which is absolutely not protocol. I always thought the people in the UK(as a UK resident)  were generally rude people but experiencing the new yorker, wow my opinion has;1
I have actually stayed here a few times and enjoyed it.  This time was not good! Impossible Wifi which is a real problem for work. No solution offered except to say they'll fix tomorrow.

If you are on business this is not the place for you.   Great location for tourists though.;1

My husband and myself stayed here just after Christmas 2013 for 5 days. We had visited NY three times before and were very happy with our hotels. Unfortunately, we didn't like anything about the Empire Hotel except the location which is very good.  There are two restaurants across the road and another right beside the hotel which we enjoyed meals in.  The staff in the Empire Hotel reception in particular were unwelcoming, unfriendly and generally indifferent to their guests needs. When we were checking out the lady who looked after us didn't even ask if we had enjoyed our stay and never once made eye contact when we were paying our bill.  The bathroom in our room was the smallest I have ever encountered in any hotel I have ever stayed in.  We were told when we booked the hotel;1

Terrible Hotel. They can't borrow you scissors. That is their policy. You can walk into hotel with gun, but the won't borrow you scissors, because you can hurt someone.   When asking the manager for help, he turns away and starts to walk away from you to elevator. In the middle of your sentence. Very rude language and behavior.  I was charged for minibar use which was false. When i pointed out that mistake and wrote a ticket to resolve the issue, nothing happened. Still didn't get any response after 3 e-mails and two weeks of time.;1
Was coming back from Canada and chose to stay at this place at NYC. It is centrally located and very close to the train station and convenience stores. Now coming to the quality of the hotel.  Once you enter and reach the reception area, one will realize that this is a very very dated property.  The moment I entered the elevators with my luggage, realized that booking and paying for stay here was a BIG MISTAKE. The elevator had a very strong nauseating odour of rotten fish+ stale air . Room was on the seventh floor and coming via the elevator  was a torture during the course of stay. Also, the whole 7th floor had this strong strong smokey cigarette smell as if someone is burning a whole box of it by the hour. Not aware if other floors had the same smell but requested the;1

This hotel room must have last been redecorated during Prohibition! I could not believe the degradation in this room. It had an overpowering odour of stale, decaying and very old furnishings. I felt I was being punished for past indiscretions in my life by having to sleep in this dump. It was awful and a nightmare! On entering the room, which took time some doing because of the magnetic card malfunctions, I was taken aback by the broken furniture, decaying carpet and the bathroom.....something from a period of long ago. The tiles are cracked like they have been forced apart by a pipe poking through the wall. In all my life and in staying in hotels in third world countries, nothing compared with this utter and absolute disaster  of a hotel room. DO  NOT STAY THERE!!!;1

We booked in and paid in advance for three nights and stayed only one. The basic problem is that this is a workman's, contractors or backpackers hotel being sold on many UK websites as a tourist hotel! The hotel is dirty with very cheap broken furniture, broken televisions and no facilities beside a quirky vending machine and a one dollar for five minutes internet service that crashes every two minutes. I could list many things during the short time we stayed. The room heating was either off or on with whistling kettle noise from the rad. We had wet lime green paint throughout the corridors which made the rooms very smelly. The admittedly clean bathroom had either very scalding hot or freezing water and blocked drains. We were given the choice of three rooms and turned them all;1
Where should I start, we arrived at the hotel early in hoping we can leave our suitcases there before heading out for lunch with our friends. No one from the valet team assisted us with our luggage and we had to take care of ourselves, carrying everything to the front desk.  The first lady who checked us in when we arrived early at 2pm before the hotelâs standard check-in time have a very bad attitude, was very rude, no smile on her face. I tried my best to take a deep breath and ignore her poor behavior and go out for lunch with my friends.  We returned to the hotel after lunch around 6 pm to complete our check-in and get settled in our room. The second man who helped us was very rude, with no smile on his face and no simple greeting words such as âGood afternoonâ He seems to;1

My boyfriend and I were very interested in making a one week booking and before doing so had a few questions to be answered. We phoned the hotel and got through to the reservations who couldn't answer our questions so passed us through to the Front Office. The transfer wasn't made properly so we got disconnected and had to call again (have in mind that we are calling fron Switzerland...).  When we finally manage to get through to the reception, we spoke to a woman who got aggitated because she too could apparently not answer our very straight forward question. She wanted to transfer us to Revenue Management but after waiting about 7mins on the line she picked up again and had no answer. She then got agitated and used an extreamely unfriendly tone and started accusing me of;1
As Iâm writing this review I donât even know where to start.  It started on the day of our arrival our reservation was canceled while on the plane. So we arrived early evening with a very big surprise. The reception told us it wasnât a problem and checked us in.. and guess what the price just went up the fees went up and till our surprise we had to pay more and more.. about $1200 more than the original booking price. Surprised, super tired and annoyed we checked In and decided to take this up with the manager the next morning and paid 2/3 of our stay.. Next morning we noticed the blankets we slept under (too tired to check everything cause you donât expect that) had (blood) stains to us thatâs pretty unforgivable and disgusting for a 4 star rated hotel.. as everything wasnât bad;1

We arrived at this hotel on 15/11/19 for 3 nights after an 18 hour journey from the UK, we were checked in and shown our room which was basically a large box room no bigger than 4m x 4m, add the furniture and there was very little room to move although the bathroom was a decent size, the views was just the inside of four tall walls with windows.. After such a long journey a nice shower was the order, NO hot water, rang reception, informed no hot water in the hotel due to a boiler problem but would be sorted soon. Got up next morning for a shower, still no hot water, told by reception same problem will be sorted soon. So had a cold strip wash, took my medication and went out for the morning.

We booked and paid to stay 3 nights, but we stayed only 1 as this place was so bad.

With the covid pandemic and flight issues during this holiday season, your hotel should be more flexible with the cancellation policy.

I have stayed here before and had a wonderful time. This time was horrible. The first night our hotel key didnât work. Instead of changing the cards like the security guy said they made us change rooms. They told us we would be upgraded. Our room was the exact same with a worse view. Second night, keys donât work again. Third night, keys donât work again. Absolutely ridiculous when you are paying a âresort fee,â plus $70 for parking per night. Will not be staying here again.;1
We booked this hotel almost two months prior to our upcoming visit after researching hotels that could accommodate families of 5. TEN DAYS before our trip we received a message that the hotel overbooked by 200 rooms! We were given two choices: a room at a nearby hotel with two twin beds or the option to cancel without penalty and receive 25% off for a future stay at the New Yorker. We called for clarification and were told the same story. Offering two twin beds at a lower level hotel when we're a family of five?! Absurd. And what good is 25% off a future stay when we're traveling from out of state? After this fiasco, they think we'd even consider visiting their hotel? Not a chance. We travel frequently - at least once a month. We have never had this happen and can't imagine any;1
There was an awful moldy/mildew smell in the room the entire time we stayed. The in room heating cooling unit blew hot air even on cool making the room incredibly uncomfortable. We were traveling with a large group and many people including ourselves got sick during the stay. Itâs clear this hotel is not well maintained but the location is excellent.;1
My husband and I were staying for our anniversary I work at the inn at the cove and I am a manger ,also my husband is law enforcement, so I know how hotels run .When I checked in the front desk lady was nice and everything was nice. I checked into the room and it had been recently remolded. The hotel itself was very nice, the beds are a little to hard and the street noise keep me up all night. That is fine because I know that is not the hotels fault. After checking out we went to universal studios and we received a phone call from the front desk manger explaining that there were two robes missing from the  room and that they were charging our card. When we checked in there were no robes in the room, I was not  even aware that they had robes. When I tried to explain this to the;1

I donât know where those 4 and 5 stars are coming from!! Has to be paid reviews. Smdh.  I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this antiquated Hotel recently. When I arrived, there was NOBODY manning the desk and I had to call out SEVERAL times before someone came out AND with attitude.  He couldnât find my reservation, although I had my confirmation email and said he would have to check HIS email to see and proceeded to help ANOTHER patron who was waiting in line. WTH?!!!  AFTER assisting that customer he came back to me. Checked his email and then passed me off to another coworker. Mind you his badge said manager. So now this other worker named Samira, who was UBER RUDE, was booking me in and asking if there are any rooms although I had a CONFIRMED booking.  Now whilst;1
"Where to begin?? This hotel had horrible service. The manager ""Nicole"" was non-existent during our 5 day stay. We were shuffled around rooms, and called liars when we pointed out the things that weren't working. The windows are taped shut with duct tape. The walls had mould and blood, it was horribly creepy. We stayed in winter and the radiator in the room was very noisy, clicking and hissing. Bring earplugs. The hallways were so small my bag kept hitting the walls as I walked.   The only good point is that it's not TOO expensive if you shop around for a deal. also, it's near a subway station which is on the express route so getting downtown is quick and easy.  I would not recommend this hotel and I would not go back. All we wanted was a place to sleep and shower while traveling";1

I stayed here on the recommendation of a family member, as it was near to the Opera. Despite the great location, the Hotel itself is dated and has horrible service. On my first stay, about a month ago, the room I was checked into was AWFUL: it had trash literally on the floor, and the heater was stuck at 80 degrees. Called the front desk 3 times with no answer, finally went downstairs and spoke to them, and they changed the room, informing me that half the hotel had their heaters stuck at 80! We were given a better room, only for the maid to ignore the Do Not Disturb sign very early in the morning-- there were a lot of unhappy patrons on our floor, and you could hear them all (thin walls?). Later, when we got home, we saw that they'd charged us for the coffee they'd left in the;1
"This place is a fraud, their website should win an award for best animated fiction of the year.  The place has terrible service, the elevators seem to be on strike only one appears to function, their fitness room was designed by the same folks who run the North Korean work camps. The elevator to the basement does not work and you need to walk through sewage stank filthy hallways to even access the ""fitness"" room,  the only thing fit about the place is if you make it out alive your some what fit.  Our hot tube at Home is twice the size of their ""pool"" and their are no where near enough chairs for guests to use.  The downstairs bar has zero serivice and they have little in the way of offerings. But no matter you will die of thrust before you get to order something they don't have.";1
What a dive! They have awards on the wall, probably picked them up at a souvenir shop on Hollywood Blvd. This hotel needs to lift it's game. Short staffed and those that work there really don't care. It is a high turn-over hotel, so they don't need to serve. Bathroom was dirty Everything costs money. $12 bucks for parking plus tax, what a rort! Yet another unhappy customer.;1
The room we had was dirty,smelly,and the bath leaked all over the floor.We swapped rooms but it was smaller only the shower was better.  The luggage handlers were great but thats all,i wouldnt let my cat sleep there.;1
I really hate to write a negative review.  There are many nice hotels in New York City.  The Empire Hotel is NOT one of them.  I cannot believe I paid money to stay in this hotel. This hotel is trying to be upscale, but it falls short in many ways.    Heating (or lack thereof):  Our room was very, very cold.  It was cold outside and the building and windows are old. I called the front desk twice, and after more than 30 minutes, a housekeeper brought us one blanket. It was really, really cold in the room.  The room was so cold I could not sleep.  After one night, and several calls to the front desk, they sent a maintenance man to the room. The maintenance man was able to fix one heating unit, the other required a fan, and it was never fixed.  The room was less than 60 degrees.  I;1

If I could rate this hotel less than a 1 star I would. This has to be the worst hotel in NY got  here sat 21st October had to wait till 4pm to get into a dirty room. Mould in the bathroom, shower that didnât work aircon that sounds like a truck in the room, peeling paint and damaged doors, cleaners that donât know how to clean. Front of house manager has no clue how to run a Hotel and keep customers happy!!! Told I was lying by the manager for a dnd sign being on my door, wasnât even a sign to use in the room. Absolute disgrace.  Just how you want to be treated on your honeymoon !! NOT;1
Booked the hotel in may 2021 and since then I have emailed the hotel 11 times to not get a response. From the moment we checked in it as been a nightmare.the rooms are very small,dirty,out dated and extremely uncomfortable,the staff are very abrupt and rude and have zero customer service skills,the lifts are an absolute joke where was waiting on average 20 mins for one to arrive and only 3 out of the 6 are working I have stayed in NYC many times at many hotels of all different ratings but this is by far the worst I have ever encountered I would not recommend or return here and if you have any sense you will book elsewhere,they may give you a good price online but that will change when you arrive and to be honest if they was to pay me â¬300 a night I still wouldnât stay never in;1
Just to give a heads up - they have bed bugs , the rooms are filthy and smell like cigarettes / weed from the people smoking outside waiting to get into the club. Over priced and totally awful.   If you are under the impression that this is a cheap but clean no frills version of the Bowery hotel/ marlton/ chateau marmont vibe it is NOT,  I implore you to spend more money and have a better time , our night rate was also massively overinflated , paying around Â£300 a night for this dump due to the city being busy. The whole experience was very upsetting and a total waste of my time.  We had to switch hotels because of the bed bugs , obviously very difficult in New York at late notice, especially over a weekend. Figuring this out took a whole evening and morning off our trip.

This hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed in. The staff were very unhelpful it took days to get the problems fixed. Staff on front desk just didnât want to know at one point we were locked in the hotel room as the door wouldnât open because of broken lock and it still wasnât fixed when we left.;1
This hotel has a great location and is right opposite Madison sq garden and penn station ...10 minute walk from Times square and lots of shopping close by . The staff at the New yorker are hit and miss - Rachel on reception desk [on the right] is a delight and its very security concious ....we have stayed here 3 times as we come each year but after our recent stay last month we wont be staying here again . After booking i emailed to request a room with 2 beds [no reply to the email] when we arrived after 12 hour journey we were given a room with 1 bed which was designed for 1 disabled person and had no bedside table , no view and was grubby with black peeling grout around the bath and dirty bathroom floor and a musty smell . When I immediately asked to be moved I was told there;1

This place is in dire need of renovations....not just a coat of paint.;1
"Where do I start?  We had a ""renovated"" room.  If that was a ""renovated"" room then I would hate to see a non ""renovated"" room.  The bathrooms are very small - I'm talking 5x7.  I know this is NY but this was ridiculous.  Every other hotel that I have stayed in NY had larger bathrooms.  The A/C did not work properly the first night and we had to switch rooms on the second day.  (Our first night price was reduced by half price).  They also have an attendant by the elevator that you must show your room card every time upon entering the elevators.  I thought this was a very cheesy gesture.   I have never stayed at any hotel where you have to show your room key.   Last time I was in NY, I stayed at the Waldorf - Do you think you have to show your room card there??  Not hardly.  The";1
Sorry to tell you this but I would like to recommend to avoid this hotel if you are planning to make a reservation here. I left a long review after my stay but the system erased it and I am not feeling like to write again. It's your money and your time. I gently suggest if I were you, to avoid this hotel. The breakfast is great! Don't get me wrong. Hotel is nice and clean. Felt safe and secure during the stay but the staff including the duty manager was very unprofessional and even rude. You will enjoy this hotel if you don't have to deal with them. Again, I recommend the breakfast though.;1
"I stayed at the Jane Hotel Sept/2011. Woke up to find bedbugs crawling under my pillowcase and all over me! I was bit at least 40 times. I had a severe allergic reaction and had to go to the Hospital. The man working the desk that night was very blase, he didn't even call a cab for me. He said "" well, it would be faster if you walked up the street"" REALLY? I'm covered in swollen welts and you tell me i can ""walk up the street? They had taken all my belongings to their "" onsite"" fumigator to try to disinfect my belonging..Well, you know you have a problem when you keep the solution on site!

Very good price, and you get exactly what you pay for. Cramped, dirty room with the previous guests dirty socks under the bed. The entire floor smelled horribly of bleach. On Saturday night, we stood outside the hotel for an hour because the doorman wouldnât let us in. We couldnât prove we stayed at the hotel because we left the key at the desk and our phones in the room. Not a nice hotel.;1
They should pay you for staying there. My first impression was that they didn't change anything there for 40 years. They have shared bathroom, not very clean. Room is very small. There are holes in stained sheets. Naked bulbs. No internet access. Tv has a 5 channels all of them has some disturbance so you can't really watch it. And I found two mouses in my room and insects. I received 10% discount from the manager.;1

Although the hotel is nice and conveniently located near LAX, please beware of the parking situation. Both the valet and self serve parking are run by an offsite company and their customer service is no where near Hyatt quality.The special fees for our parking for our conference were not clearly explained when purchased and I ended up having to pay quite a bit more than promised. The manager was helpful but did not resolve my problem with the parking company. The parking company customer service was horrible. I am a worldwide traveler and customer service is important to me. The hotel itself is comfortable and clean, but due to not resolving my issue, I will not be staying here again.;1
Stayed for 6 nights, location is very good and close to central park. Rooms are a little warn down, but otherwise okay. So why the bad rating? I have stayed in many hotels, both on business trips and during vacation with family - this one is so badly managed you would not believe it. We stayed for 6 nights and this is the impressive list of just some of the things that the hotel could not manage:  - On arrival at agreed check-in time, we got a room that was not made up. Feels like walking into someone else's room :-) Well, it happens I guess. Back to the reception again.  - We got a new room, but keys did not work this time. Again, it happens no problem. Back to the reception again.  - New keys are working, yeeees! Oh no, they forgot to make up the extra sofa bed, so we;1
"After flying in from Australia via Seoul (24 + hours) we arrived at the hotel with vouchers in hand, eager for a bath and bed, only to be told that our reservations had been cancelled! When questioned, the staff member said 'someone' had called and cancelled our rooms twice, first on the 8th then 11th December. We did no such thing. And who would call twice to cancel? Dodgy hotel! When we asked if they could call a taxi for us the non-English speaking staff kept saying ""hotel full, you go find other hotel"" Never returning here!";1

We handled the outdated rooms but the loud âchantingâ, cussing, and banging on the doors was horrible.  Not sure what type of company this place keeps!

They didnât seem at all concerned that we slept on blood- kept referring to it as an âinconvenience!!â I wish we had checked here/yelp before we booked as it turns out bed bugs and maintenance have been a huge issue in these recent months. Lessons learned the hard way :(;1

The hotel is very nicely appointed, with charming rooms and a very nice staff for the most part. The problem is that both the downstairs lounge and the rooftop bar were rented out for private parties each of the three nights that I was there with a group of friends. The parties were actually a nightclub venue that was run by an outside vendor. We stayed in four rooms on the second floor. We couldn't get in to either bar and the lobby and sidewalk were packed with people all night. Music blasted until 4:00 am. The hotel manager was not sympathetic at all and although it was not her fault, we felt we had been mislead about the atmosphere. We wanted a nice hotel, not a nightclub, and we couldn't even get in to one of the bars for a drink ourselves.;1

I stayed at the Days Hotel because i had to be near West 93 St.  The bed was okay but there was no excuse for the state of the bathroom.  Both the bath and the toilet were stuffed up and I had to shower in a foot of dirty water and had a non-working toilet the next day until someone came up in the afternoon to unstuff everything.  The rates were cheap and the amenities were non-existent.  The TV only had a few channels and I couldn't get what they had.  The only amenity offered was soap.  The hotel obviously can't bring in enough business to maintain the hotel at an adequate level.  If you can afford to spend more than $95 for a room in New York, then don't stay at this hotel.;1
"This place is beyond horrible. I understood that I was renting an apartment, not a hotel, but I was not expecting filth and danger. Beyond the tricked out lobby, the place was a slum.

The walls and carpeting were filthy. The furniture was stained and the bed linens looked slept in. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom and I had to get the night watchman (they don't have actual hotel employees at night) to get me a roll from the employees' bathroom. Worst of all: the only lock on the door was a twist lock in the doorknob itself. There wasn't even a security chain! As a woman travelling alone,";1

The place was infested with mice, I complained to Patrick working at the front desk and instead of him helping out or be kind he started swearing and accused me of disrespecting him by saying that the room had mice. And he proceeded to tell me that there is nothing he can or will do about it. The bathrooms were filthy, overflowing with filth.  Hair on beds, fridge and all over the bathrooms. I stayed there a week and it was the most uncomfortable week I have ever spent.  My suggestion, save yourself a lot of trouble and money. The place is not worth the money they charge. And also there is no 24 hour security, only on the weekends.;1
We were travelling with friends when we booked this hotel.  This place was so bad, we only stayed for 2 hours!   Our plane was delayed, so we didn't get to the hotel until 4am.  We rang the hotel from the plane and found out that there wouldn't be anyone there to check us in.  After explaining our situation to the lady at reception, she was kind enough to stay and wait for us.  When we got there, we were very dubious about this place (even from the outside).   We had originally booked this place for the week, but decided once we got there, that we would find something else.  The lady tried to get us to pay for the week up front, but we told her we'd changed our minds, so we had to pay for the night (which was almost over) & we lost our booking fee, so all up it cost us about;1

My sister and I checked in around 9pm. Upon entering our room we saw the thermostat set to 78 degrees. We each had our sons with us (8 months and 3). It was entirely too hot. I lowered the temp to 66 to try and get it to come down - waited an hour and it still was 78. Called the front desk and they said theyâd send someone up. Waited an hour and no one came. At this point itâs almost midnight and we have to babies who are sweaty refusing to sleep being uncomfortable. I call again. The maintenance man comes and attempts to fix. He sets it to 60 and said to move it back up once it gets too cold. I wait another 25 minutes - itâs still 78! At this point Iâm furious. I call down again and they offer me a fan.

We were running an event in NY. We've used the Jane a number of times for staff hotels and indeed guest hotels.  Although they don't do group bookings, you can book individually for people and put it under the same bank card.  Every time we've tried to do this it's been a disaster:  They've lost the guests' information a number of times to the point that people couldn't check-in. They lost our credit card information a number of times. We've resent three times and physically visited the hotel to go through it all with them too. Anything more than one person booking their own room seems completely beyond the staff.  It's like running a hotel is a sideline job rather than their actual business.

Not only are the rooms outdated and less than spectacular, the air conditioning didn't even work. Reported the issue and nothing was done about it. You have to pay $28 just to self-park a day and pay if you want to use the wifi. The room doesn't have a microwave if you want one you have to pay $10 a day to use it. Came back to the room around 2:30pm for a nap and break from Universal studios only to find our room hasn't even been cleaned. The food is way overpriced and less than mediocre. I've stayed at nicer places that were motels.;1
"I booked a ""Queen Room"" for two nights. When we checked in I was charged an additional $45 per night and had to hand over my credit card for that charge. I assumed it was to cover any mini bar charges. However, when I got to the room there was no mini bar. I was told by the desk staff that it was for the ""Free WiFi and unlimited international calling"" I did not need international calling and the ""Free"" WiFi that cost me $45 per night was an unsecured network. Additionally, when we retired to bed we realized that the bed was a double and not a queen bed. When I complained to the manager on Duty I was told that ""all"" of the Queen rooms had double beds. I tried to explain that beds have names based on specific sizes and that you can not call a double a queen bed but I was told";1

Her response was to deny that this was even tabled. Our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings, solely at the responsibility of Wyndham New Yorker.  The occurrence of  initial error, the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns, the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check- out is the reason for this.

We went to the Jane on the 4th for some drinks. We were told to wait in line which was odd because there was no line and the place did not seem overly busy ( usually you can hear the music and the crowd from the st). We waited for about 10 minutes while the bouncer and his friend (possibly another bouncer) casually chatted.   After about ten minutes they looked at us surprisingly and asked âcan we help you,â as if they had just noticed us. When we said we would like to come in, they informed us that to get in tonight you had to be on a âreserve listâ  As patrons who frequent the bar and hotel regularly, we called management and asked if reservations were needed and he informed us none were needed and anyone could walk in. We explained to him what had happened and the manager;1
"I was stunned at how poor this hotel was. It's the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and can certainly be classified as a dive. It had two things going for it. It's very inexpensive (my room was $50 a night), and the front desk staff were friendly enough. Other than that, my single room was tiny, with a small single bed. The walls were in desperate need of a paint job (there were black streaks all over the place, not to mention dried mucus); the dresser had 3 missing handles (plus one that was dangling down, as it was missing a screw); stains on the sheets and on the chair in the room; noisy radiator. The room door had a small lock on it and the door seemed like it was ready to fall off. The shared bathroom seemed okay, but on the first evening was missing a lock. (The following";1

The hotel is located in the busiest part of Manhattan. Very noisy and unsafe. The pictures from the hotel are not what you see at the hotel. The lobby has almost no furniture and the rooms are a lot tinier than the pictures. The hallways are very very old. The carpets are ripped and smelly. The bathroom is super old and rusty. The front desk staff was the rudest people ever. Very unhelpful with even the simplest of questions such as direction or suggestion. The location is very unsafe specially at night. There was a person stabbed right outside of the hotel when we stayed there.;1
The heat didn't work, so the room was quite cold.  I wanted to call the front desk, but the phone in the room didn't work.  So I had to go down to the front desk, even though it was late at night and I had already gone to bed.  The front desk told me the heat wouldn't come on until the temperature dropped below 50 degrees.  That is too cold to sleep!  Eventually the manager gave me a space heater so I could sleep.;1

This was the worst hotel room, in size and appearance, we have ever stayed in for the last 50 years.

I was extremely disappointed with your staff during my stay at your hotel. Before I made a reservation I called to enquire if I could leave my luggage overnight and was informed we could.   My family and I were planning to stay in NY from the 18 Aug â 24 Aug, but we were going to Woodbury for a night (on the  21 Aug), thus we wanted to leave some of our luggage at the hotel for one night. Since we were informed we could, we made the booking to stay at your hotel.   When I checked in on the 18 Aug, I confirmed again and asked if I could if I could leave my luggage over night as I was checking out on the  21 Aug and will be returning to stay at Days Inn on the 22 Aug until 24 Aug. The staff at the reception  (Stephan) said no problem.   When I checked out on the morning of 21 Aug,;1

This hotel charged me twice on my credit card and I had a reservation for 3 nights, I stayed just for one night and they charged me for all 3 nights.   I have been patiently trying to call them and get them to refund my money, they have been dodging my calls and emails.   Their customer service department is HORRIBLE as they keep saying we cannot do anything you have to call the hotel for the refund! Are you kidding me? What is the use of a customer department ?   I am going to sue this hotel for wrongful charges and scam.;1
Arrived with my daughter for a night in the city what a disaster!  Lobby strangely arranged . The desk clerk had me sign a statement about the smoking policy . First of all I have never done this in the many places weâve stayed . Long and short our room was on the 2nd floor . Dirty , small and creepy. That night we went to a show and came back to smoking smelling , marijuana smelling floor . Besides the fact we had some one playing trumpet sporadically through the night along with creepy clown sounds . We never slept all night long  . We get going in the morning early as we shut the door we heard a mans voice shouting obscenities and screaming . He must of watched us leave through the view from his door .

Booked last month on this hotel for 1 room 2 double beds for 2 nights. When we checked in at about 9pm, the front desk said that they are fully booked and that the room that we paid for is no longer available. The only room available is a single room which we don't like because it's not the room that we paid for and it's just too small. Anyway we viewed the room and it looks dirty. So beware with this hotel because your reservation is not 100% guaranteed. They'll give it away to someone else...it's not guaranteed. They did not even gave us a call at least to inform us the room is no longer available. We came from Washington DC and tried to check in about 8pm and this is the kind of situation they gave us when we arrived. We're just lucky that we had a relative who lives in New;1
Called them back and try to explain situation. Check in 16 and out 18 in the EARLY like 7am for flight to Hawaii. They said the lobby bar has made on apr18 @ 6pm. How possible the hotel charge the bill after I checked out! They insisted it was me under my name and room no was right with signature. I asked the accounting if they want to see my boarding pass? However, I threw away my boarding pass. I still have evidence that I spent my credit card in Hawaii before 6pm on Apr18.  Sent them all evidence to prove that I am right, actually it should not happened this way. Very disappointed that my info was used by somebody else.;1
Do yourself a huge favor and DO NOT STAY HERE! I don't even know where to begin. The vast majority of the rooms are TINY, SMELLY, OUTDATED, and UNHEALTHY. We had two rooms, one was too hot, the other too cold, regardless of the thermostat setting. The heating/air conditioning system itself is extremely NOISY, and the windows are very cheap and drafty, so if you value any sort of tranquility, definitely look elsewhere. In addition to all this, half of the elevators don't work at any given time, the staff are extremely unprofessional and nasty, and the management is completely unresponsive. There are so many other hotels in NY that are so much better, where you can at least get a good night's sleep, that there is absolutely no reason to stay here. You'll most likely have an;1
We had reserved a âDeluxe Kingâ...  Seriously? A room that looks at a brick wall passageway is not the best start. Room and bathroom fittings loose or broken - oh dear... Room safe doesnât work... the list gets longer (Room 215 if I remember correctly)...  But to really finish it off - the hotel laundry is just below with machinery and an incredible noise all night.  At 00:30 unable to sleep the night time front desk turns up and admits the noise is impossible.  No worry - we can change rooms ... repack... take luggage ... room 806 (?)... a room that is obviously not a âdeluxe kingâ as we had to coordinate movements to be able to move around the room - and no weâre not overweight...

Do not get me wrong...the rooms are comfortable and clean, the breakfast offers great selection, but the attitude of the front desk employee, as well as the front desk manager, Romin Baranov, is the worst I have ever encountered in my many trips around the world.  Both were extremely rude to us, and the worst is that when Mr. Baranov realized that they were wrong, he barely admitted to it and never apologized.  We tried over and over to explain to them the situation, but he/they wouldn't hear us, eventhough we were in our rights to request our invoice, since the room wasn't booked online, but directly at the desk.

DO NOT STAY HERE!!! The manager Patrick became verbally aggressive when we simply asked to be moved to a room with a private ensuite, as we had booked online.  When we first arrived at the hotel we were told by the receptionist they did not have our booking and we had to move to a different hotel for the night where we had to pay more for the room. When we arrived back the next day the manager, Patrick, informed us that the staff member  we spoke to the previous day was stupid and doesn't know how to do her job, and  they did in fact have our booking. We were then given a room but were not able to check in until the afternoon. When we arrived back in the evening we discovered our room did not have an ensuite as booked online. When we asked the receptionist about this she said;1
Absolute nightmare with this hotel with the communication side. I originally booked this hotel in may 2020, had to cancel due to covid as we where not allowed to fly from the uk. They would not give me a refund and was offered a voucher which i had to accept. spoke to nice lady called Neida who said let me know when you want to rebook. I emailed Neida and let her know that we want to stay December 2022 and gave the dates for when we will arrive. I was given the price as was told that i was pencilled in. Several emails later and several phone calls with no reply as i keep getting fobbed off by the phone saying send a email. I have done this several times with no joy. The customer service is very poor on this occasion. Still do not know whether we will be staying at this hotel as;1

I have stayed in this hotel several times because the location is perfect for Lincoln Center. Some of the rooms are ok but there too many to count that need major renovations. The Standard Room is the size of a large closet - you can not put a suitcase on the floor and walk around the bed small. The bed was hard as a rock with flat worn pillows. The cranky heater could not be shut off - even when you turned it off it mysteriously turned back on every 20 minutes all night long. The bathroom was tiny which was fine but there was mold on the rotten wood door frame. The bath products were nice. The WIFI costs $15 a day for in room use and is spotty at best. They charge for Keurig pods for coffee in the room. There is free WIFI in the lobby and the roof deck area is quite nice.;1

We should have left when the guy at the front desk checked us into a double full size room instead of the single queen we had requested. He said it was an âupgrade.â We didnât fit into a bed together, so we slept separately. The walls and light switches were dirty...speaking of lights the lamps near our bed went out! We stayed there only one night but it was long enough for my husband and I to get bedbug bites! I had to throw away my suitcase and call an exterminator! We left without taking a shower because the shower had mold and the mat provided was atrocious. The room needs to be updated from the floor up. We should have paid a little more to avoid having the added cost of pest control. I wish we could get our money back because pest control for bedbugs is expensive!;1
Beware when they offer you a room on the 11th floor.  I'm writing this at 2.50am and the party in the rooftop bar is still going on. I rang down 20 minutes ago to ask how much longer it would be going on and was told he would 'ring up and ask them to turn it down' and that 'it would be ending soon'.  Fat chance it would appear on both counts.  I always travel with earplugs but here they are useless, so if you want a room where you stand no chance of sleeping, choose the 11th floor of the Empire Hotel, New York.;1

The Empire Hotel NY is a very hip and trendy location, but they tried a little too hard with the design of their showers!  We stayed on the 5th floor for a weekend and with the first attempt to shower, we noticed that there was no shower door, so the bathroom floor gets water everywhere while people shower!  I am in construction/real estate for a living and said there is no way that was supposed to be designed that way, but we were there for a fun trip, so I didn't think much of it.  The second night, we came back to our room and while laying in bed noticed that part of the ceiling had been painted with primer to cover a water leak from the bathroom in the room above us!

We stayed at this hotel while visiting NYC in Nov. 2017.   We had stayed there in the past but were quite disappointed at how run down it has become and will not be returning.  To balance this review, first the positives:  Great location, close to subway, restaurants, Central Park.  Safe.  Nice reception area and staff were ok.  The negatives: THE ROOMS WERE A DISASTER.  We actually requested a room change and the 2nd room was worse than the first.  Mould on the walls/ceiling, wallpaper ripped, carpet was filthy and threadbare.  No bedding other than 1 blanket and sheet.  No hot water, the towel rack fell apart in our hands, as did the clothes chest in the first room.  The second room didn't even have one.

Everything sucks at this hotel... rooms are dirty, beds are very uncomfortable plus they make a lot of noise,  electricity outlets didn't work, furniture is extremely old and dirty.  There were hairs on pillows, towels and on the floor.  Front desk people were rude and didn't seem to care about my concerns.  And to top it off their chef is rude and racist and he discriminates.  Elevators are extremely slow and the halls are dirty, carpet looks filthy and the room had a terrible smell.  Their location is ghetto and their 22dlls a day parking lot spaces are designed for compact cars only... overall this hotel has been the ugliest hotel I've ever been into.  Pictures on Website are just a bunch of lies.  Plus they ended up with extra fees during check out after I was given a price;1
"I returned yesterday from a break with my daughter and mother and unfortunately stayed here. At the front door they have 2 security guards, one on an external door and one on an internal door, with a space in the middle.  They have a system with people queuing to get in/out. There was a revolving door, but of course that was out of order. The lady at check in was impersonal to the point of rudeness.  She typed stuff into the computer and said, ""credit card"". I asked how much security was to be taken and she said 4 nights, $140.  I felt as though I shouldn't have asked her. We waited for around 15 mins for an escalator as only half worked. They said they are due to refurbish them sometime never. We were in one room, two queen sized beds.  I know New York rooms are small but this";1

Hotel is not equipped to handle a little bit of rain, and a continual hum from the walls and dripping water from window made it impossible to sleep without the use of my head phones on. When I walk down into the lobby there are buckets everywhere to catch all the leaks that had sprung throughout the night. When I step outside it was hardly even raining. I do not recommend going here if it is going to be raining even in the least.;1
Arrived at the hotel and was notified that I was charged $100 cancellation fee which in their website ( hotel website ) it says if you cancel your reservation theyâll charge you $100 and my booking was through a third party Booking.com which didnât happen to say anything in that regard as well, Keep in mind that this is different than $100 incidental fee. Anyways we agreed to pay the amount they asked for on top of the cancellation fee that they already held and incidental fee. We asked if we can get a room at 1pm. Hotel policy Checkin at 3pm and if you check in before theyâll charge you another $100.  The lady at the front desk Ashley said  that she doesnât have a room in the same category at that time. We did ask for a different category her answer was I can get you a room;1
"My husband and i stayed in room 236 on Dec 2nd, 2015, for one night and we DO NOT recommend this hotel!!!   I have to say that the location is relatively central and the lobby entrance and the room itself initially looked nice, but when I went into the bathroom there were cockroaches (both in the evening and in the morning...).  We reported this to housekeeping, but the best they could say was ""we'll send someone in the morning."". Unfortunately, no one showed up in the morning.  Immediately after we checked out, I started to get terrible itchy legs and now have about 20 bed bug bites that are very itchy and infected.  I have been to seen my doctor twice and he has prescribed me 3 medications which I am now taking.  Also, there is an EXTREMELY loud generator at about the 5th or";1
our stay this time was pretty awful.  The room wasn't cleaned or serviced at all during our 3 day stay.  The housekeeping staff was rude when I asked for extra blanket and pillow- which took one hour to arrive.

DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!  After being foolish enough and staying at this hotel for MANY YEARS, I can honestly tell you to avoid this place at all costs. Spend a little more for a better place.  I have learn my lesson the hard way. (stubbornly learned) Keep in mind I travel to NYC roughly 6-8 times over the summer months and have given these people thousands of dollars in business. I book WAY in advance, usually in January.  THE GOOD: First of all, its a great location, close to the subway, plenty of places to get food, Duane Reade around the corner.  Its generally very quiet.  I don't think I have ever had to wait for one of the shared a bathrooms.  THE BAD:  Most importantly..... YOU MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A ROOM WHEN YOU SHOW UP!!!  The people who own and work at this place don't;1

I would have preferred a timely check in ! Fast forward 20 hours later and now my key card is not working. The front line check in mentioned it was too probably located close to my cell phone.

I'm not the most seasoned traveller, but I've managed to stay in quite a wide spectrum of places, from Youth Hostels in the Australian Outback, through ex-Soviet apartment blocks in Ukraine, through to Â£350 per night Cotswold Hotels in the UK, and I can safely say that the Empire Hotel has given me the worse two nights sleep in my entire history of travelling.  My room was on the first floor, and fronted the busy Columbus Avenue. The window might as well not have been there - I heard everything, to people shouting, to bins being emptied, to cars accelerating from the junctions. No peace was found when the outside noise stopped for a few seconds, as the walls in the hotel are so thin one would assume rubbing a hummingbird feather on one side of a wall would be audible on the;1
We made a reservation weeks ahead for a family event, arrived at 9 am and left our bags because our room wasn't ready--which is understandable, but they would not check us in. When we came back later we were given an awful room literally in a stairwell. The manager would not change our room, saying they were full. But we were there at 9 am! And they would not check us in.

Summary: A few things about this hotel were acceptable, but most of our stay was nightmarish.  Tiny room, dirty, broken bathroom, treated like a criminal at check-in for using Priceline.  I've never received service this bad, even from the DMV or homeland security.  If they promise you something (like a room) over the phone, make sure you keep a recording.  Background ( Summary:  we got the hotel room for a few hours on a Saturday morning.  The booking was for the night before.  I called them to ensure that this would be acceptable.  I should have recorded the call.) We had a rough red-eye coming into JFK at 6AM on a Saturday (the weekend before memorial day weekend), and I wanted to give my in-laws a chance to take a nap.  Our hotel didn't have check-in until 4pm, so I went on;1
Had a confirmed booking but when I showed up the front desk said the hotel was sold out and in the negative for rooms.  Did not offer solutions or assistance or walk me to another hotel they are partnered with.  Called the company I booked with and in 20 minutes they had me booked at another property.  I would seriously consider not going to this hotel if they oversell online.  It was a busy night in the city so I am lucky I had another option.;1
We made a reservation for 3 rooms and kindly asked for lower floor rooms by email a few weeks before our arriving.   Lisa confirmed by email that we will get lower floor rooms so I confirmed our reservation.   Unfortunately upon arriving and despite showing a copy of the email confirming our request we were told that it will not be possible to access to our demand.   I explained that my booking was linked to this demand and should have I known that we would not receive lower floor rooms I wouldnât have confirmed.   I request to speak to a manager and he explained me that we should not worry as it will be easy to change of room in the coming days which never happened in spite of my multiple reminders to the staff.   Moreover,the air conditioning was from another time, so noisy;1

The only good thing about this hotel is the distance from the park but itâs still not worth staying there now a days you can uber anywhere for a decent price.  The front desk was not welcoming or friendly.  The room smells are bad.  I was moved from my original room because of it and the second room had the same ordor of mildew.  Very dissapointed when traveling with kids you want something comfortable and decent especially at the costly price this hotel is.  We didnât let that ruin our vacay we had a great time an universal studios and were thankful that we didnât spend much time in that hotel room.;1
First the good: thereâs no hotel more convenient to Universal Studios. That said, I wouldnât stay again. I paid for 2 queen beds but was given 2 doubles. When I complained the manager gaslighted me White Lotus style, even though I measured the beds at 52â wide, saying that there are a wide range of queen sizes. Itâs frustrating when someone lies to your face instead of admitting a mistake even when itâs funny on HBO.;1
I reserved 2 nights recently *and prepaid* so that after arriving via red-eye in NY at 7am, I would get to hotel at 8am and sleep 3 hours before my noon meeting.  I called the day ahead to ensure there was a room for me when I arrived at 8.  When I arrived ... no room.  They said 30 minutes, but it was more like an hour, to get a single room clean enough for me to sleep.  They did eventually comp me the night, but only after I made a fuss -- the default was I just had no room when I got there.;1
This hotel is in an ideal location - can't beat it. unfortunately, it has consistently bad service and puny, grimy accommodations where hot water doesn't work and pressure is low, faulty heating/ac and a front desk staff that could really care less about your comfort or that you've already paid for the room that doesn't have all services working. You get an eye roll and they look behind you at the next person line. My family and I have tried it 3 times in the past few years and each visit gets worse. Reserve at own risk.;1
When you walk into The New Yorker expect a 10-15 min wait to check in, not including the people who have been waiting even longer. No apologies offered just them in the back chatting. (March 5th 9:30 PM)  When you arrive at the elevator if youâre  on floor 20-40 expect there to be only 2 that actually work and are over crowded so you may end up waiting an additional 15 min to even get to your room. (March 5-9th ongoing)  When you arrive at your room at the 33rd floor have the expectations that your room will smell like kitty litter and cat peeâ¦ they chalk it up to âthe hotels hauntedâ yet those smells are USUALLY associated with meth soo.

"My fiancÃ©e and I booked this hotel for our annual NYC trip on Priceline. The rates were much better than similarly situated / rated hotels in the city and it was a last minute trip, so we thought we had gotten lucky...sadly we were sorely mistaken. Aside from the fact that this place seems thrown together (read other reviews about room size, bathroom design, etc...) the closing mechanism on our door did not function and our room was broken into on the first day we were there - and my iPad was stolen. Both my fiancee and I have traveled extensively and never had this happen so when we went to report this, we were surprised at how awful the experience turned out being.   Upon reporting our room was broken into, the ""security"" officer gave some vague excuse that he was too busy";1
Hello I have stayed at many hotels  and being in my mid forties I remember getting cheap rooms for 50 bucks to just party in as a kid.  This was the WORST room I ever stayed in.

Lamps falling apart , wall paper that they must have repaired something and did a poor job to patch it.

It seems to be - from the remnants of its previous life (an old AC unit, painted door jams) - to be a cheap slap some paint and put up some wallpaper reno of a dump. We were the victim of their bait and switch program - get a room through Hotwire, get put into a closet that overlooks the dumpster, complain and agree to an upgrade for $50 to $100 / nite, We saw the list when we changed rooms - there were a dozen others who got taken by this (and they screwed up the room";1

This hotel is not worth your money! They charge for EVERYTHING-including any extra pods you may need in your room for the Keurig machine.

This is my 2nd visit and my last. The hotel is dated and no work has been done on it since my last visit 5 years ago. There is a 15 minute wait to even use the elevators. The room was cold and really dated. Staff at reception were not the friendliest. The shower had 2 settings scalding hot or cold. They need to invest more money in this hotel or reduce prices to stay there. Only positive was the location which was the only reason I went back but I will find a different hotel next time.  They also charge you to store your bags for 1hr.;1
"What a trip this has been. We're only on day 2 and I can't think of anything else that could possibly go wrong. When we arrived, the room was barely big enough to accommodate the 3 of us. One of the women in my room is 5'6"" and could turn the TV on with her toes by just laying on her bed. The bathroom conditions were abhorrent. Mold on the ceiling, the bath tub looks like it hasn't been touched in days. The most disturbing thing is the crawlspaces in the bathroom-- I have no idea what they're doing there but any guest can open the makeshift door (thing) and there's this empty chute filled with plaster and dead bugs. It's disgusting. We requested a room move. The excuse from the front desk was ""Well, my housekeeper told me that room was sellable"" The LAST thing an unhappy guest";1

We booked this hotel based on its mid-town location (corner of W 30th and 8th) and the excellent description and photos of the rooms. What a DECEPTION !!! It was basically fraudulent advertising. The room could barely fit a full-size bed and you could not walk around the bed. It had no closet or desk and not even a chair. It was so small it could not have fitted anything!  The bathroom was incredibly tiny as well. The sink was outside the bathroom since the toilet and tiny shower took up the entire bathroom. They even advertised that all the rooms have a city view.... We'll this was also false!  There is no elevator so rooms on the upper floors are difficult to reach and you have to drag the luggage. Don't go near this place!;1

I visit a lot of hotels per year and this one is the worst I've ever experienced! Do NOT stay in this hotel! I'll explain why:  First of all the staff was extremely unfriendly and unwilling to help. Our sheets were dirty upon arrival, so we asked for new ones. After asking four (4!!!!!) times, one of the staffmember arrived, but we had to help him changing the sheets. When I'm paying that much per night, I, first of all, expect clean sheets and, secondly, if they are not clean I expect the hotel to take care of it. We wanted two beds, in stead of one small queen bed (as we requested during the bookingproces months prior to our stay). But the hotelmanager just didn't care about it. If we payed $ 120 extra they would place a roll-over in the room. But then there was no room at all;1
I was very displeased with a security issue and would like to discuss further with hotel management. There was a fight in my hallway 1 evening. I called the front desk and received little comfort and assistance. Same can be said when I checked out the next morning. I was brushed aside quickly. Very disappointing.;1
Worst hotel ever. After 2 days I started to get red spots all over me, and soon it started to itch like c r a z y! If you do not want 92 (true story) bedbug bites, you should stay far away from this place.  The manager, Patrick, promised us before we left that he at least would pay our dry cleaning bill (and ointment against the itching), since we had to laundry all our clothes in 60+ degrees celsius before entering our apartment at home. (Expensive!!) He answered our first e-mail that he would compensate us, but then nothing happened and after 3 more e-mails with no response we gave up.  Now we want to warn others not to do the same mistake as we did.  We never saw the bedbugs in the room or the mattress, but our bags was on the floor near the bed, and when we came home we saw;1
There was nothing quality about the Quality Hotel Broadway. On arrival the first thing was the smell of unclean and the tatty appearance. But never mind I was there to do the marathon. There were men sat about drinking beer from cans which was a little off putting. The staff appeared bored and irritated by my presence. I had to climb over a beer drinking man who was on the floor propped up against the wall in the hall way smoking, who happened to be outside my room. On entering the room it smelt stale and unclean and the abstract pattern on the duvet was not a pattern, but was in fact hundreds of cigerette burns. There was no security as the lock had been busted off the door and was not repaired. on returning to reception with my obvious concerns the only question asked, or;1
When we checked in our reservation was lost. The desk clerk found us a room on the lowest floor with a window that looked out on debris at the bottom of a narrow light shaft. The room was impossibly small. All the candy, nuts, and $7 bottled water covered much of the limited counter space, and the bathroom was worse. There were no bathrobes as advertised, no room to dry off after a shower without leaving the door open.   The halls and lobby are dirty and dingy. When we arrived in the hotel the hot water was off throughout the building. On the final day two of the elevators broke down and a third with us in it got stuck between floors.;1
We arrived to find out that the hotel controls the air conditioning. They had it set to heater.  We couldnât do anything about it. Terrible service terrible hotel!!!! Rooms are hot, restrooms clogged! They refused to accommodate us because I voiced my dislike for this hotel. Only stayed one night we rented another hotel the second night.;1
My friend and I stayed here last spring break. We wanted something central and on the cheaper side, and that's what we got!   The rooms were fairly clean, we were on the second floor, on the back side, so quite quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast great!  But, a huge negative part of our trip was the neighborhood this hotel is located in. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so you must leave the hotel in the evening to eat... of our 4 nights, there was not one time that we were not followed, whistled at, yelled at, sneered at by locals. It was awful. We made the mistake of taking the subway, it was scary, sketchy and awful. We did not feel safe while staying here and dreaded coming and going.   We ended up blowing most of our budget on having a trusted cab driver;1

This hotel is not clean. Rooms are old, dirty, and outdated. The beds are not comfortable and all room amenities (shampoo, sheets, blankets, towels) are old and musty. This hotel is in need of serious help. I am a Hilton Diamond Member and had a very regrettable time there with my family. Even one of the valet car employees, named Ariel was very loud and rude with me accusing me of lying when I told him I was never provided a ticket when I parked my car the day prior. He was loud, insulting, unprofessional in front of my family and other customers. The hotel didnât do a thing when I brought this to their attention. This hotel is run down and customer service is not a priority for them. Take your business somewhere else.;1

I stayed at this hotel for two nights as I was attending Women in the World at Lincoln Centre.  Proximity and the fact that Women in the World recommended this hotel for its speakers was the only reason I stayed there.  It's been a very long time since I stayed in a hotel this bad.  I changed rooms three times and still ended up with a lousy room.  The walls are paper thin, the windows are not insulated for noise, and the doors also allow for full noise from the hallway.  If you are a light sleeper, stay elsewhere.  The decor was tired, lots of chipped paint in the bathroom and stains on the window blinds.  You only got the first 4 K-cups complementary in the room, and then they charge you - classy! The real treat was that my shower did not work.  I notified the hotel on the;1

Private wedding party..... if you are considering this venue, GET A CONTRACT or find another place. This place is sketchy at best unless you prefer to be treated like cattle. Detailed complaints were logged and ignored. $6K later and multiple hours of my time, nothing but aggravation. These managers are not in touch with their customers. The ownership is unresponsive. Buyer beware!;1
I stayed at this hotel with my family and wish i had never booked to stay there it is the only hotel you wipe your feet on the way out!!!! it is basically filthy terrible staff only spoke english when money was involved, the heating was wrong the bed was filthty the bathroom you had to see it to belive it  the sprinkler system was jammed with paper, i could go on and on, but my travel agent refunded all of my money on return to the uk as the hotel would not answer their requests, my advice DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY OR STAY IN NEW YORK HERE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!ITS APAULING!!! I know they have changed the name of this dump but do not even go there take my advice.;1
Stayed at one of their properties on the east side about ten years ago. Had booked 3 nights, stayed one. When we arrived, cleaning personnel were heating rice in our microwave. They just left the room, didn't bother cleaning up the rice. Room was filthy, no shades on lights, toilet wobbled etc. Runaround from the staff getting the key. According to NYC, they were illegally renting out apartments per diem. Was very lucky to get our money back for the two unused nights.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.;1
The pillows weren't clean, my face broke out, the AC didnt work, the heat wouldn't come off ,the staff wasn't very helpful. The hotel was far from the main attractions. The internet was horrible......;1
"I'll start by admitting I'm a bit of a hotel snob, and proud of it. I spent over 20 years in the hospitality industry and I have a saying ""you spend 50 weeks a year catering to others needs, your job, your family.. why be cheap with yourself the 2 weeks that others serve you""?  You have a right to expect the best. Yes, I've stayed in many 5 star resorts, I've even stayed at a Motel 6 in my youth, and some in between. I don't expect 5 star amenities at 3 star places, but 5 star service should be automatic. The marketing staff of this hotel are either geniuses or con-artists because they shot the entrance which appears elegant, and little more. We laughed while unpacking our SUV when we saw a ""Thai-Massage"" place across the street, harkening I can't imagine who with pink neon";1
We will not be staying here again for several reasons! The guests tend to be loud party animals intent on waking every other guest up each night! The rooms very brown, tatty and smell of smoke (most of the hotel does).  We tried to move rooms and were shown to a room only marginally bigger than the suite we had booked , however the insult was that there was no bed in the room, just a sofa bed! This really boiled my blood.  We consequently moved to the soho grand.......  Enough said!;1
"Okay, if you're like me, you're thinking, ""How bad could this place be? Decent location, great price...I can handle it for a night.""  WRONG.  This is a welfare hotel, run by a slum lord who is trying to forcibly evict the poor tenant who's squatting in the room (make that hovel) next to your room.  Literally!  We passed an open door and saw what we thought was a utility closet, but on further inspection was someone's garbage-strewn apartment.  There, sitting naked in front of a fan, was an old man who we would have taken for a corpse if the corridor wasn't echoing with his hacking coughs as he tried in vain to cough up a lung.  AAAHH!  We didn't actually see a rat, but one would feel right at home here.  At first glance, our room seemed okay, until we found a used Q-Tip next to";1
"The Windsor hotel is in a sweet spot, only 100 yards for the Grand Subway station facing the park. But that's about it. Do not expect the ""good bed and clean towels"" kind of two-star hotel. The sheets and towels are filthy. During the 4 days we stayed here the towels had blood stains and sheets and pillow cases were yellow-ish every single day. And when asked for changing them it got no better! The hallways and the elevator have plaster stains from a distant renovation. If you can stand this kind of place for US$200 per night, then this is your place. Otherwise, don't even think about getting close to this hotel.";1
"The name is Windsor ""Hotel"" but I've been to far more pleasant motels in the past. The room I booked had 2 double beds which took up most of the space. When I called to reserve a room, they told me to do it online instead. The pillows, blankets, and bedding all had stains. The bathtub and shower curtains seem like they were never cleaned. My 5 year old was grossed out. The only perks they had were the child-friendly toothbrushes and bathroom amenities and the location near the heart of Chinatown NYC.";1
We stayed in this hotel for one week and it was just awful! There were cockroaches in our room and we were on the 12th floor! The place must have been plagued with the things. I even found one floating in the coffee! The staff were unhelpful and the lifts were awful. Calling it the Quality Hotel is a complete farce. Fawlty Towers would be more apt. It reminded us of some cruddy Youth Hostel in a third world country.  It ruined our visit to New York and we couldn't wait to leave and go home. It is, without any doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I would gladly have paid more to stay in something decent but that will teach me to trust a travel agent, never again! I agree with the person who said take your tent and put it up in Central Park, you'll be much more comfortable!;1
"Horrible. Booked this for my sons 20th Birthday gift. Read all rules and they clearly said ""someone 18 would have to take all responsibility for the room at check in"" then it said you need a credit card or cash for incidentals on same page (no mention of a different age required).  I called the hotel to confirm he would be allowed to check in with his credit card, they said as long as card was in his name (it was). Room was completely paid for, this was just for incidentals.  My son arrived on his Birthday and went to check in to the paid room.  The very rude lady at the desk said, we cant take your credit card from you unless you are 21. No where on the hotel site or orbitz said anything about that.  He called me to ask how to handle, since I booked it. :( I am 8 hours away.";1
Stayed in june, 7am in the morning workers on the roof, leakage in the room because of the rain, dirty toilet, showers and on top of all bugs crawling all over the place.

So beware of going in business with this unorganized company!!! see photos to se the bugs and dirt yourself!;1

Unfortunately, this hotel had absolutely ruined our first family holiday. The hotel and room does not look like it does in the pictures advertised on the website. The staff were not only rude, but unprofessional from management through to the front of house staff. As with any place, not all staff were rude, some did help us with the misfortune we had encountered. One of the issues that stood out was the manager said that if we complained to Budgetplace that they would kick us out of the hotel. How a manager can call a tourist a liar when there is video evidence of us paying them the price they quoted to us?  I really will not be recommending this place to anyone as I feel they way we were treated, it would and has happened to many others. whether distant or local visitors to the;1
Walked into my room to find sleeping people.  Asked for another room, another person sleeping.  Asked for another room and escort to the room, luckily wasn't shot.  Management never apologized, simply said nobody should have been in the room.  Delightful.;1
Iâve just finished a 10 nights stay at this hotel and I decided to write a full review in English language so that itâs understandable to everyone. If you think you can sleep in this place you are wrong, the temperature of the room is either too hot or too cold. It is impossible to open the windows by yourself so when you die of heat at three o'clock in the morning you will have to call someone who comes to open it with a chisel, going up with their feet on the heating every single time. That happened to us. The temperature problem is solved by switching off the radiator and getting dressed a lot but it's not the biggest problem!  The hugest problem is that there isnât any chance of sleeping at night because as written in other reviews thereâre hot water pipes that produce;1
I wanted to like the place, due to it's excellent location, but couldn't. The positive things were Ed's Chowder House restaurant within the hotel, A+ food and service (waiter Luis). Also noteworthy is the black female bartender in the lobby's bar (makes a mean Cosmo). Other than that the facility does not have a professional staff nor are the staff attending to details like assisting with hailing a cab or opening the front door in bad weather.  Accommodations were not what was promised. Pull-out sofa bed had a badly stained mattress.  The staff is disorganized and the Concierge can't be a professional due to his condescending nature, in the long run wasn't helpful at all.;1

I have to say that the Experience we had on this hotel was really bad, we expected a completely different service, the room was way too small, when we did the check in the lines were so long and they took so much time just to give us our room The location and the cleaness are the best things of the hotel. So if you are coming to the New Yorker, you better think it twice, because the relation between price of staying here and the true experience you will receive will never worth it;1
i went there with my friend hoping to have a memorable trip in nyc, well trust me it was because of this hotel. This is the worst place you could go to, we were first set in a bedroom that was nothing like the ones we reserved. The bathroom was DISGUSTING there was literally something that looked like  excrements in the bath, mold on the celling and no locks on the doors. They moved us to a new one after we complained about it. The new one was a bit better, but the AC wasnât working, and the heater was placed right next to one of the bed, making it super hot. Impossible to sleep during the night, the AC that wasnât working was still making some weird noises and the heater sounded like it was about to explode and we couldnât turn it off/down. We had to find a new hotel after one;1
Stay as a guest for the first time with my daughter. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Reasons being the housekeeping standards are extremely poor.....we arrived to our room with visible stained toiled seat, noticible cobweb above our bed, peeling wallpaper throughout. Even when upgraded the standards were not much iimproved. The images on the website are truly misleading. Our concerns were reported immediately upon arriveable and there is no malice in this review.  Alot of work to be done to raise standards!!!  Forgot to mention our room was right next to where the hotel held parties for the public.;1
Hotel in marginal location, next to a nightclub. Lobby and elevator was dirty with trash on the floors.  Room reeked and you couldn't open the windows. Stains on the carpet and drapes hanging off the rods.  Motel 6 was better than this place and the gall to charge $225 a night.  They asked for your driver's license at check-in to input your DL# and birthdate. They charged your entire stay when you check in.  If this place was the last hotel in New York City, I still would not stay there.;1
We arrived at the hotel at 3:45pm and were informed that our room wasn't ready (even though the check in is after 3pm)! They took our cell and told us they would call us back when the room was available. No complementary drink was offered while we waited. We went to wait on the roof terrace (btw the pool is the size of a large bath so don't book the hotel for this!) i decided to have a hotdog and chips, this cost $16 and is served on stale bread and presented on a paper plate with a small pack of chip (easily found in a store for $1)! Not 5* standard Several times we called for ice and tall glasses to the room. It takes at least 30 mins for the ice to arrive and the glass is the size of an eggcup, another 30 min wait for a tall glass! We asked for an umbrella and were told there;1

All of the staff could not do enough to help make our stay as comfortable as possible. However the hotel thwarted all their attempts. The hotel was dark and dismal inside with an uninteresting lounge area. The room was very small and cramped, but gave a great insight into the statement that New York never sleeps. One either stayed awake because of the awful noise of the air conditioning, or the extreme heat because it was turned off. It is the only hotel I have ever visited that makes a charge for using coffee facilities in the room.  It was very convenient for Central park, and there was a bread shop a few yards away that was excellent for breakfast. Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity   Not however a place I would be excited about visiting again;1
Made reservation via a 'third party'. How dare I. Treated like a cheap 2nd class citizen at every stage during lead up to the stay and during the stay itself. I've been a diamond member with the Hilton brand for 7 years running now and never experienced this type of engagement before. If the hotel has a problem with you booking via a 3rd party then why do they offer the rooms out to these areas. Management unresponsive to feedback. At least we enjoyed our day at the park!;1

Firstly, the location of this place is great. And thatâs where the positive comments end. Upon arrival we were greeted by a receptionist with an awful attitude problem. The hotel was booked for 5 people, however we were only given a room with 2 double beds.. when we asked the receptionist to sort this out, she went on to blame Booking.com for the error, stating it was their fault and we should contact them. Sorry but this hotel is trusting Booking.com to make bookings on their behalf, therefore itâs up to the hotel to resolve any issues.  The room was spacious however very poorly maintained (see attached photo). There was rust leaking down the wall into the bath (disgusting). The room cleaner must notice this every day when cleaning the bath but still no one has been sent out to;1
I made a reservation for a suite at least a month in advance to have two beds in the same room but a place to get away after our 5 year old went to sleep. Instead, I was told repeatedly how much I would love the room with a queen bed in one room and a pull out sofa in the other. I didnât love it and the room was horrible. Iâll never book here again!;1
I stayed in many hotels in my life time and many in NYC this hotel by far has to be one of the worst in Manhattan!

Had contacted the hotel on several occasions to request a high floor looking towards the Empire state building. I also requested a fridge in the room which I paid for.

There was pieces of old paper hiding cracks in the bathroom door!!!.

Location is a dump. The rooms smell the elevators are uncomfortable and smelly. The door was falling apart when we got there. Overall it was a very Nasty experience. There is a hotel in time square that was $50 cheaper and we received a larger room and it was a much much nicer facility. I do not reccomended this days inn.;1
We booked a room for 4 days in December, 3 month before arrival. After 13 hours travel from Germany we arrived and the impertinent lady in the desk just meant: âSorry, your room is broken and there is no ohne left.â No help to find a new hotel. She was just hanging on the phone. Dirty, undriendly, canât beliebe that. I hope she will be fired soon.;1
The bad experience began with the shuttle driver who was driving like a maniac and whom I think was drunk. He ran after a women for a tip and left my bags. Check-in was good and simple. The next day, I noticed I'd been charged twice and that was 3 days ago. I'm still dealing with the problem and no one is even taking accountablility or apologizing for the inconvenience it has caused me. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, if you expect a helpful, attentive staff, go to a boutique hotel where you'll get personalized attention and not have to deal with robots.;1

We have booked 100+ hotels online and this was the first time that we were charged a âresidence feeâ after we had paid the âfull priceâ online. When we asked the front desk staff about it, she said âit was clearly stated in the confirmation email.â I asked âBut the confirmation email comes after the booking. So you only told me about it after I had booked, and you changed the price subsequently?â âYes.â âSo maybe on my next visit you can charge me a thousand dollars extra?â âIt depends.â Beare before booking this hotel online.;1

In general the experience was fine, nice views and the room was nice. I think they should fix the toilet, because it looks really old. But the employees are rude, mostly on the reception. It is very sad that in a nice hotel, the people working there, don't respect you as they have to.;1
If you are a loyal Hilton customer and have Diamond (or Gold for that matter) status, this hotel did not show any appreciation for their most loyal customers. I checked in without any issues, but their Honors check-in section was in the corner and with a small sign that was barely visible. I had to request an upgrade even though the website said they would try to do it after online check-in but that wasn't the case. It appeared they had rooms but needed to ask at check-in for them to give you one. At other Hilton hotels, as long as I had reserved a room 24 hours in advanced, they would already provide me with an upgraded room upon check-in.   Upon checking into the room, it was cold and when I tried to turn on the heater it didn't work. All it released was cold air. The bed was;1
This was the worst experience ever, we lasted 2 hours.  There was drug use  which the management did not care about, the rooms were extremely dirty, toilet seat broken, dark and dingy.  Staff did not have any manners - customer service did not exist. I was with my son and friend - we did not feel safe. My poor husband spent 2 hours trying to get expedia to transfer us to another hotel, which finally happened,  This place should be shut down. Strongly advise everyone not to book yourselves in.;1
I only stayed for the day, a couple of hours to be exact, while I waited for my next flight, but paid a full day rate (about US$500). I checked out in the afternoon to head to the airport and was told I will get my bill in my email. However, I have not received my bill so far, which I need to claim travel expenses with my company. To make matters worse, a few days after I left  I discovered in my bank account that I have been charged an extra day for no reason. I have written emails about this asking for clarification but have not received a reply so far. This is terrible customer service.;1
If your business meeting around LAX, then okay. But your business trip location is in downtown LA, please avoid this place. Terrible location. LAX has terrible traffic all day all night. Even this hotel has name value, I can't give good credit of valuation because of location.;1
Dark and dingy. The bed was a double, but seemed more like the length of a twin so I had to sleep diagonally. Also, the bed was not level so my head was lower than my feet. The air conditioning functioned reasonably most of the time, but was very loud and needed to keep running all night long. The wifi was unreliable and actually went down in the entire hotel for over 24 hours during our stay.;1

We were expecting to spend a nice week in this hotel.Upon arrival we realised the room was extremely small for the three of us. There is no storage space in rooms. 2 small drawers and you can hang your coat next to entrance... That's all about it.The carpet and curtain had stains and the towels smell weird. The air-conditioning system is probably 10-20 years old. If you want to switch it on or off you have to remove the lid which allows you to take a look inside and see how filthy it is. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Book a cheap motel and you'll have the same experience.;1
Good Service but Outdated property needs major work.  Room Key Failures, Elevators packed with people stopping on every floor (20+ minutes to get out every morning) and rust in the bathroom.  Not a good experience;1
"Firstly the good points about the hotel...the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable...also even though the hotel was at the upper end of central park a 5 minute walk and you could access the subway @ 103rd street..However our toilet clogged up once...but the worst thing about this hotel was the noise from the radiators...and i mean noise a constant clanging and banging all night long..i have never ever experienced any thing like this in any hotel i have stayed in the world over...for 2 of the 5 nights we stayed we did not sleep...it was if a brass band had decided to pitch up and play in your room...we complained and the staff informed us that this was ther norm as the ""building was old"".

Poor service for a well known brand. Staff not interested in assisting, just apologise and say out of our hands. Too many issues, toilet not working, small TV in room, no executive lounge, more geared toward conference facility than family friendly hotel.;1
If you want to sleep in this hostel you must wear ear plugs or you must be deaf. They are trying to keep it clean the common areas but  the cleaning stuff was extremely rude. Definitely I don't recommend it;1
I am a 5 year resident of NYC. We came as a large group of colleagues. The bouncer invited all the eight females in the group to the front, letting them all in at no charge. The five guys were told they could not get in without buying a $1200 table, and the front door management was extremely rude. There are many other places in midtown where you don't need to deal with such disrespectful people. I would strongly recommend avoiding this horrible establishment.;1
Stayed in Nov 2015, unless it has been updated the rooms were small and dingy.  The halls and rooms smelled mildewy.  Bath so small you couldn't really open or shut door.  The lobby was ok, but the second you get out of the elevator, you realize you made a mistake to book at the Empire.  Front desk staff was ok, but some security type person was beyond rude.  The location can't be beat, but the property itself is unacceptable.  Husband still complains about the place and it was a year ago.;1
This hotel although maybe centrally located and artistically designed is never the less a faired and disgrace to the great city of Manhattan.  I recently was a guest at this establishment and had the disturbing  and frightening experience of having my labtop amongst other items robbed as I lay asleep.. Somehow predators entered my room and stole my belongings as I lay lifeless to the world .. I could of been raped and killed If god forbid I awoke during this robbery.. The authorizes  and the hotel employees have not taken this disgusting reality seriously .. I am left with disgrace for the justice system of the city of New York ... For this matter is far beyond a missing laptop it is the severity of the security of an establishment that represents the great city of new York;1
The âcourtyard viewâ was a collection of air conditioner compressors and pipes.  And the rooms across the courtyard were too close to assure privacy.  Therefore, opening curtains was not an option. The room was dark with insufficient lighting. It felt like a dungeon. The âclosetâ was a bar over a safe with a curtain, the towel had a big hole in it, the frig didnât work, the sink had no drain plug, the bathroom moulding was disgusting, and the water dispenser in the gym was out of order. The decor in the room and corridors was dark, dingy and very outdated. It was a very unpleasant experience and I would never stay there again.;1

"My daugher and I were on a last returning trip to NYC as she was 4 and a half months pregnant. I called  the day before ahead to notify we would be arriving after 10:pm, and to ensure again there would be  separate beds in our room. When we arrived at 11:30pm we were informed our room was not available. They gave us "" all that was left"" which was a single room with a VERY VERY BAD pull out sofa, only in the room. When we went down to ask how they expect us to sleep on this broken down sofabed they said that is all they had. My daughter slept on the floor, after they gave one extra blanket and pillow. It was very cold and uncomfortable. Also they have a very popular roof top pool and when you try to get into your hotel in the evening the doorway is completely blocked. They have";1

This hotel is cute on arrival but that is where the fun ends.   I could have lived with the tiny cabin room if it was not for the noise of a disco til 4 am. We complained on 5 occasions but alas this made no difference. In the morning we found cockroaches in our room.  The bathrooms were clean, but after several showers in the morning, the floor was flooded and covered in bits of hair. We were offered 20% discount, but after some pressure had a complete refund. Seriously folks AVOID this place if you can.;1
"Stayed at this hotel in December 2004 & after reading several ""concerning"" reviews our fears were confirmed on arrival. The staff were very unfriendly & unhelpful apart from one porter.  The room we were given smelt of cigarette smoke & was shabby & unclean.  The curtains were full of dust & hadn't been cleaned in ages & the bedding had cigarette burns in it. After staying in the room for just one night, my friend woke the next morning to find that she was not alone in her bed!  There was a cockroach in it!  We immediately telephoned reception & were told that someone would be up shortly.  After 20 minutes someone came up & took the cockroach away & didn't seem very concerned about what we had found.  We weren't offered another room & had to go to reception at 5.30 in the";1
I made a reservation with Wyndham for a recent stay but never received any type of confirmation.  I called about 6 weeks before and was repeatedly told that I did not have a reservation at this hotel or any Wyndham hotel in Manhattan.  I gave them my name over and over and spelled it out multiple times, gave them my credit card information, check in and out dates, and still nothing.   I was forced to start my hotel shopping over again and ended up booking the Courtyard by Marriott, which happened to be on the next block.  This was a major inconvenience of my time of having to search prices and locations all over again, but I really had no choice.    When I checked my credit card after the check in date, there was a $614.14 charge from the hotel.  I called the number provided,;1

Do not waste your time staying at a Wyndham property in New York City. Of all my years of travel, the rudest experience was at Wyndham properties. We were supposed to stay at another Wyndham property that was overbooked. My Mother-in-law booked with points and all the reviews were correct we came in at 11:30 at night. No rooms even though she confirmed with them that day we had rooms. Then we went to their sister property which they said we had for two nights. not true only one. We ended up having to pay. The managers were all rude every one of them. They treated us like dirt. Had to argue to get our rooms, and keep our rooms. I am telling you to save your points, pay money and go to a Hilton or Marriot. Don't waste your time or money with any Wyndham property in  New York. The;1
I stayed there on Saturday August 18th, paid over $200 after using an app. on my phone.  They put us in a little corner, room was like a  janitors closet, it was tiny, the sheet had stains. Not much room to even move with our 1 bag on the floor. On our way to the room that night we can hear people having sex, we were even woken up at 8 a.m. because of loud moaning. Complained to management and we were told that they can't help us and we would have to stay and that they have the best hotel in NYC.  NOT TRUE!!! We go to NYC at least 1x a month and this was the worst.  The bathroom was tiny, not worth it at all!!!! We ended up checking out of the hotel and found a hotel that was nicer, bigger, cleaner and less expensive down the street. Save your money and go somewhere else!;1
I kind of like the Jane, I'll admit it. I like its quirkiness, price, and location. Why am I giving it a terrible rating, because in my six stays there I have never had a problem free stay. Problems have ranged from web site reservation problems, to noisy rooms, to being verbally told I had a 2 day reservation and showing up to find I had only a one day stay and my second day was sold out. Problem resolution has been grudging at best to downrite hostile. There are other quirky, inexpensive well located places to stay in NYC. For me it's no longer worth the hassle I have to put up with to stay here and I suggest you don't either.;1
I would suggest bypassing this hotel.  Checking in took forever.  My room was barely large enough for the bed and I could hardly walk around from one side to the other since the desk chair was in the way and there was no place else to put it.  Whatever, I dealt with it.  But when I woke up in the morning to take a shower before my meeting and had no hot water, that was unacceptable.  I let the water run for a full 20 minutes while standing there sticking my fingers in every few minutes all to no avail.  I ended up having to go to my meeting without taking a shower!  It was horrible.  Not the hotel's fault, but I also had someone try to come into my room.  Since the door was right next to the bed, it felt as though they were already in my room and incredibly intrusive.  Oh, and;1

First impressions of the lobby were nice. Pretty much downhill from there. We were in town and stayed for two nights. My family generously paid for this hotel,  but I saw the receipt and canât imagine that this place cost as much as it did. I would reiterate every other bad review of this place, overall it was very sketchy, barely clean, mold on the shower curtain and in the shower, the ceiling was cracking and falling onto my daughters bed, and it rained that night and left some of our floor wet. The staff was Not entirely helpful, and they only gave us one ratty bath towel to use when there were three of us staying in one room. The rooms are entirely small and have the absolute bare minimum â and poor quality at that. There are no amenities, you had to pay for Wi-Fi but even;1
If I could give negative stars I would.   This hotel is so condescending, sexist, and has some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered. After waiting 45 minutes in line, me and my 2 friends were allowed inside. Upon going in, we paused to call our friends who were already inside so we could go to the right place. We were asked for our ids to go in and said we just needed a minute. After we confirmed that they were in the ballroom, we step over to get into line and suddenly someone else comes over and asks us if we have a reservation. We said we did not but we were just let in, and they began forcing us to leave. As they are yelling at us, extremely hostile, another group walks past us and is allowed in. The man said âsome people have reservations and some donât who get in.â;1
where to start? they don't live up to half of the things they promised, the rooms are awfully small, the bathroom makes noises and the walls are so paper thin that you can actually hear the conversation in the other room. as soon as someone walks pass you door then you'll hear everything. the coffeemaker and microwave and all the other utilities that were promised in the room didn't exist.;1

I stayed 5 nights at Days Hotel on 94th St.  The location is good and I remember from previous years it was a good option.  However the hotel is taking advantage of a tight hotel market.  They charge top dollar ($193/per, had to be prepaid) and the amenities were zero.  I complained immediately as there was no dresser, one lone office chair, TV wasn't hooked up, ice machine broken, and the squirrel maze of rooms on the floor weren't clearly marked.  Only another desperate guest's pencil marks on the wall guided me to my room way in the back.  However you ARE in NY, there were no bugs, the rooms were cleaned every day, and the air conditioning worked.  They have a lot of nerve charging what they do for a room like that with carpeting in the room and throughout the halls from the;1

First and foremost, I would never write a horrible review for a business unless I am utterly and beyond expressions dissatisfied. My husband and I decided to take a long over due day or two to ourselves to enjoy a stress free possible couple of days, as we have 3 small children, both work, and are both students. We decided to book this hotel based on its reviews that we thought were pretty decent. We check in Friday May 19th 2017, leave our things and decide to go nightlife exploring. Upon our return around 2:30am, after getting ready to get into bed I remove the decorative runner placed at the foot of the bed and find a horrendous looking striped brown colored stain on the sheet covering the comforter. I called the front desk to request new linens, the operator told me she;1
The only goods -- great location, some friendly and helpful staff.  No door on shower, water all over bathroom so we kept piles of towels all over floors for our stay.  Dark, dreary, sketchy elevators, tiny uncom for table beds.  Fyi, definitely not Italian linens.  Needs to be gutted and renovated.  Of course when prime location is brought up to speed prices will soar....;1
The Days Inn is the proud owner of the biggest dump in New York!! i can only reiterate the previous writer's comments and add that we also experienced cockroaches in our room, the most unbelievably discusting stench on floor 2 that was so bad that you had to hold your hand over your nose whilst running from the (dangerous) lift to the room, electric shocks everytime we went to open a door, table lamp litterally snapped in half with exposed wires, hairs in the bath, shower not working, etc etc. I could go on and on. a final word of warning - if you arrange your transport back to the airport through the hotel, prepare to be ripped off. We were given a price to include toll and asked to leave a $10 deposit to be knocked off the fare, only the driver claimed not to know anything;1
Visited her in July with my husband and my two children (17 & 9) for four days. On arrival the receptionist made a big thing abou giving us a room with a view, we thought fantstic a view of the foutains, how wrong we were a view of the road! When making our way to our room on the sixth floor we noticed that all the rooms around us had 'Do not disturb' signs on them thought this was odd but carried on. On entering our rooms we struggled to all fit in and move around with our four large case (previoulsy spent the week at disney). First impressions it was very dated and tatty, plugs hanging and , aircon unit dented and hanging off the wall with wires hanging out. The bathroom door hit the toilet every time you opened it the bathroom was that small. There was a interconnecting door;1
New York is an amazing place with so much diversity, with this being said the way we were treated by check in staff in particular Ornelia, I nor anyone I know will ever stay here again. This in NY and so many places to stay just because she was having a bad day she took it out on us. Very unprofessional and very surprised she is in the hospitality service. Will say Calvin was very nice. Bad experiences always stick and are far more shared.;1
They say 'Don't judge a book by its cover' - so, ignoring but not sitting on the filthy reception furniture, we found our room - dirty, shower nozzle dangling from wall, windows NEVER cleaned, a cacophonous aircon system, bath tub patched up with white paint over the chips, a window when closed had at least an inch of space (the bottom of the frame had rotted away), and carpets that defy description. This place would never pass a health inspection. In the Astor's defence, the location is very good and the receptionist is friendly. Oh, good luck with the lift. Beware!;1
"Great location in NYC, but terrible hotel room! I had room number 206. First of all the window was almost blind (view on a very small and dark courtyard): no day light which is rather depressing especially when you're jet lagged. Second I had the pleasure to ""enjoy"" the noise of the air conditioning units (not even mine that I stopped) and was obliged to wear earplugs to be able to sleep.  The room was clean, but needs refurbishing and was definitely so dark!!!!  The front desk service was ok. The rooftop bar is great as it was warm. The breakfast was average - I think you can expect better for 26USD.";1

Worst place I've ever stayed, dirty, uncomfortable rooms and the toilets and shower were awful - the kitchen had no utensils, staff are useless and couldn't care less about anything - guests were too noisy and filthy, spend more money elsewhere and avoid here like the plague.;1
After probably hundreds of hotel stays, this hotel was the was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only redeeming factor is the proximity to the subway.  They rent most of the hotel out to a college for dorms or vacation stays. This means that the hotel is extremely loud and filled of drunk students. Every night I was woken up by kids screaming up and down the hallways.  As for the rooms, they are extremely small and filthy. I had to buy flip flops for the shower like a true college dorms. I had a leak in the bathroom that I complained about everyday and after day three nobody had come to look at.   Please please do yourself a favor and book at any of the other hotels. This hotel is listed at 3.5 stars but thatâs only because of its lobby. The rooms are not better than;1

We came as a large group of both guys and girls. The bouncer invited all the females to the front, letting them in with no issues. They then asked for $1200 for the 5 guys to be admitted, and did not allow them in without paying. This business does not treat their customers the same, even if they come within one group,;1
My first review on trip advisor.  Just wanted to warn about this hotel.  I was woken up at 4AM with bedbug bites and observed the bedbugs in my bed.  Room was also rather dingy and dirty.  Not a great place to stay.;1
First of all, THANK YOU to everyone's that's left a review for the Empire Hotel during the period of July 8th to July 14th, 2017.  We felt a LOT better knowing that we weren't the only one's having a rough go of it!  For those of you that left a complimentary review during this same period ... are you sure you have the right hotel?!  I will agree with most everyone that this hotel is situated in a great location (Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, easy access to subways, Broadway Ave, restaurants, etc.).  This made it very nice, because we really didn't want to hang out at the hotel.  I will also give a shout-out to the bell-men, who I also agree were the best folks to work with at the hotel.  These 2 items pretty much wrap up my positive comments.  I feel somewhat compelled to;1
We ended up getting this hotel as part of a Hotwire Hot Rate, and after reading several reviews were very worried but unfortunately couldn't cancel the reservation. The hotel was more spacious than other NY hotels and had great subway access and was surprisingly quiet, but those were the only pros. Upon arrival, there were left over beard shavings in the sink, some brown drip stains on the shower curtain and walls, tons of stains on the bed sheets, other people's hair everywhere, furniture that was shredded, gross carpet, key cards that never worked and had to be constantly reset....and the list goes on. After the second night I received 6 bites and we decided we should just take a loss and stay elsewhere. When we talked to the front desk they didn't seem surprised when I said I;1
People, you are better off saving up and staying somewhere where you can enjoy. Poor desk and room service. The best person I have encountered was the Maintennce guy. Also, if you need towels or  tissue be sure to call hours in advance, the clerks are very relaxed and laid back. Secondly, the beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable. There is a lingering odor of mildew and/or wet rot in the air . Not to mention the floor boards are so noisy you can hear every step from the room up stairs. The hot water will cause third degree burns so be cautious. A REAL NIGHTMARE!;1
This hotel has a great location, but unfortunately they seem to have cut corners with their staffing.   When I checked into the hotel, there were only two people at the Front Desk, and this was at 8pm!     The morning was a little better, with three people there to help out, but I still feel that they were skimping on service by not having at least four people to help hotel guests during a busy time.    The room service was quite good, and the attendants in that department were professional.    My only other issue was with the connecting doors between rooms.  I didn't request a connecting door, as I am traveling alone, but it didn't seem an inconvenience so long as the door lock was secure.    Boy, was I wrong!!   There seems to be absolutely no insulation or sound-proofing;1
Nightmare staff non existent room service the worlds noisiest air conditioning had no sleep in the four days stay there due to roof top nightclub worst hotel in new York would have slept better in central park!!! Refused to serve us a coffee at the bar saying they didn't serve coffee there then later witnessed a local patron being given a cappuccino on the house!!!! Please stay anywhere else but here.;1
most of the other poor reviews for this hotel are spot on. In it's defence, the noise level from the street (Broadway) is fairly quite for the location, and the room size is good for NY.  BUT, the hotel is unloved and falling apart. Last renovated in the late 1970s or early 1980s, there are handles missing off furniture, drawers missing,  wall paper peeling, ripped curtains, hair dryers are broken, cupboards full of old telephone directories, out of the four lifts, only one works. We had to keep moving rooms (every night) because of leaks from bathroom ceilings.  The worst part are the long term residents (over half of every floor - just look for the doors with keys instead of cards) who haunt the corridors and boil cabbage in their rooms stinking out the whole building.

Extremely noosy in the room given the noise coming from outside Aircon and broken window.Broken items in the bathroom. I would not recommend to pay such a high price for poor quality of the room atmosphere.;1
You can tell this hotel used to be some kind of apartment building. There was no hot water, the staff 90% of the time have no idea what theyâre doing & i tried to be understanding considering the circumstances. However, my sheets were filthy & when i asked for new sheets they told me I had to wait till morning. I went out bought my own sheets.  & itâs been 2 days and the sheets still havenât been changed. The card to open the door never works i had to have them fix it 3 times & there hardly is ever any hot water.;1

We had booked to stay for 5 nights and had to check out after 1. Woke up to multiple cockroaches in the bathroom and room. We went to reception and were not even apologized too. They were not shocked at all hinting that this must happen regularly. They were not bothered that this now left us without a room for the rest of our trip. Worst of all we were charged FULL PRICE for the night we stayed and we had to wait 15 days for the refund for the other nights.The room was very dark and dated, the photos have been takes years ago and are very edited. The pool is tiny and grubby, definitely wouldn't swim in it. The window was taped together and all the furniture was chipped. There was a tray and coffee machine but no coffee, tea or mugs. The corridors and lifts are all very dark and;1

The hotel is well situated and somewhat hipt, but I canât recommend it. Even if you might find a room for a decent price. Rooms are extremely small and in a very bad shape. The hotel is in general dirty and rundown, with a staff that are really great or complete idiot's???   There is a rooftop but the owner keeps it for himself and private parties, instead of making it available for the hotel guests.  The connected French restaurant (different management) is very arrogant French.;1

You are unable to take a shower that may produce any amount of steam. AS IT WILL SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM!!! Yes.. steam well set of the fire alarm.  Sadly there is zero amount of exaggeration to my statement.   Two nights in the hotel.. and the fire alarm went off BOTH nights. The first time.. after having just arrived and unpacked with two toddler aged children in tow.. gave us the scare of a lifetime!!! The second time.. we opened the windows as we were instructed by management.. and the fire alarm still went off.  Also.. the phones inside the room do not work. We found this out because when we tried calling the operator/front desk (using the dedicated operator/front desk button) the second time the fire alarm went off.. it would ring to another guest's room. We had to call the;1
Hotel requires Updating. Room looks uncleaned and bathroom unsanitary. Good Location with surrounding amenities including  Central Park, Lincoln Center, Theater and Restaurants. Early room access was denied and a late check out was an additional half an hour if needed . The staff onsite was somewhat helpful.;1
I stayed there for 3 months and it was Cheep and that is what most travelers look for when Traveling but it was Dirty and the Beds where full of bed Lise and the showers allways had Vomit in them and the showers where Gross we stayed there just to sleep and we where hardly there most of the time,There are Loads of Elegals there or it seems because whenever the Cops would Pitch up they would all run like Rats,There are also thieves living and i guess working there because 2 of our Laptops whent missing clothes and Phones so we had quite a [--] experiance and will not be returning there pretty soon.;1
We had problems with the WC and even I told them 2 times they must fix it, they did nothing and the toilet was spilled. The room was very small and they said they will give us another bigger one, but they did not do that either.  Also, you have to pay for wifi in the room.;1
Small rooms, with 1950s style showers and leaking windows, no hotel would decently rent rooms that have ânaturalâ air conditioned rooms with windows that leak in every room , and a heating system that can not overpower the cold air leaking intothe room.  This is truly horrible place to stay at. The bedding is so outdated and incomfortable. The bed linens and duvet are so thin, thanks to the natural leakage of every window, you just almost freeze for your entire stay duration at the new yoker Hotel. The fridge in the room is very noisy,  The air conditioning unit is working full time to try to prevent the room temp from falling below 40F at night with the wind blowing through the windows.  The hotel management is incapable of providing extra bedding or a stand alone heater unit.;1
During my stay here we noticed the hotel was very much outdated and absolutely needed a HUGE renovation to all rooms, beds, walls, phones, TV's, doors, hallways, amenities in the room, & etc. Elevators were extremely small and had to take the stairs (which was not a big deal). Definitely disappointed especially traveling from California but we realized that were paying for the location NOT for the room and that did not sit well with us. Got woken up one of the nights in the in the middle of the night by other drunk guest pounding on our room door which is out of the hotels control but thought they should know. Front Desk didn't accommodate us on a 1 pm late check-out which was very inconvenient for us. The parking garage that the hotel told us we can park at for a discounted;1
Turn away while you still can. Keep moving and look for another hotel. I was a guest here and I can assure you this is the worst 4 star hotel I've ever been to...and I've done a lot of traveling. I've uploaded photos of a broken shower, stained curtains and dirty sock in my room that does not belong to me! The doors are made of metal and they slam shut so loudly you'll never get peaceful rest. You can hear almost every door on your floor slamming shut and shaking your walls. The rooftop bar patrons whom many are not hotel guests are loud, rude, belligerent and get in your way when you enter the hotel. If you have kids, you don't want your kids to walk by these people as you enter the hotel. The staff will do nothing to help you and they will actually smile and think it's funny;1

The hotel is DANGEROUS, the staff is RUDE and the rooms are DINGY  I had booked two rooms for three weeks in July. Unfortunately we had the worst stay of our lives because someone broke-into our room.  1. On day one, although we had requested adjacent rooms months and then one week prior to our check-in date, they wouldn't give us rooms even on the same floor. We had to literally beg for rooms on the same floor which we eventually were able to have. 2. The hotel staff was completely ill-mannered toward us from the day we checked in. 3. The key to my room got demagnetized five times a day and they (very rudely) asked me to get in long lines at reception just so I could fix the key and enter my room. every. time. 4. There was no in-room safe although it's claimed all rooms have;1

For anyone who is considering to go to this dodgy place please be warned that beds may be plagued with vicious bed bugs.  The first night we slept there I had no problems but by the second day the itching started and did not stop!! We were on the 7th floor so bewarned anyone staying there.  The place looked like a run down sleazy hotel and the hallways were creepy exactly like the ones you see in the movies where someone gets murdered.  Bathrooms were ok and fairly clean but the window was always open and could not close making it very drafty when taking a shower.  The hallway leading from reception had a god awful smell - not sure how to describe it.  It's a block and half from the nearest subway so fairly convenient and close to broadway.  For those thinking is a hotel like;1
REGRETTABLE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYTHING.  I had a reservation for four nights, but I got sick the previous day and I couldn`t take my flight.

It was my dual birthday celebration with my best friend - we were a group of 8 and they refused to let us in because we werenât willing to get bottle service (2 bottle min). But any groups of 4 or less were able to get in without any having to do so. 2 more larger groups were declined entry after us. We asked why we couldnât enter as 2 groups of 4 and the hotel promoter just said yelled âthis is my partyâ and he makes the rules. My friend went down the line warning everyone of this threshold so they could say they were in smaller groups. They then threatened to call the cops because we were standing on the public sidewalk trying to figure out where to go instead. They probably need to rethink their customer service strategy... worst experience Iâve ever had at a Manhattan bar.;1
If I could rate this hotel with zero stars I would. My stay at the The New Yorker was by far one of the worst experiences I've had period. And as a frequent business traveler this says.   First, I tried to cancel my reservation a week in advance due to schedule changes. Commonly happens in business. To my surprise however The New Yorker would not issue a refund or a credit for a future stay or even allow me to reschedule. For this reason alone, I will never stay at The New Yorker or a Wyndham property ever again, for business or personal travel.   To matters worse, the hotel itself is a run down, dilapidated hotel. The elevators were incredibly slow. The hallways are dirty, in disrepair and have a moldy smell. The rooms are tiny, all the trim and door frames are all banged up;1
What a disappointment! This was the worst hotel we have stayed in! The photos online are unfortunately very misleading. They show some very modern, renovated rooms. The room we were given was totally outdated with mould in the old bathroom. When we complaint at reception we were told that these were the rooms for hotels.com, expedia.com etc. guests. Even when we showed them the beautiful photos they advertised they didn't want to give us the same room as displayed on the internet. The reception staff was very rude and just couldn't care less. The location of the hotel is in a very bad area of Hollywood. You can't go out after dark. No restaurants around anyway. The so called breakfast was absolutely inedible! You get a much better room, better service and food in low budget;1

Where do I start...? This Hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in. I had to request towels for the room as only one bathtowel was provided. The Bathroom in the room flooded. We moved to another room. Two nights later there was a mouse in the new room, which I killed in the bathroom and placed on the reception counter in a bag. The staff were ignorant and did not show any sign of concern for what happened. I checked out after the mouse incident and went to a Comfort Inn. Avoid this Hotel at all costs. It's a dump. I'd give it a no star rating. Iâd rather sleep in the alleyways of Harlem than to spend another vacation in this Hotel. Under existing management it can only devolve to the status of brothel.

Housekeeping was bad, decor was horrible, the wall paper was pealing, the elevators didn't work, I was denied entrance to the hotel by a bouncer at the hotel entrance since it is shared with the rooftop lounge, the showers didn't work properly (read explanation below).  The list goes on and on!!!  Unfortunately it was a last minute book during Fashion Week in NYC.  All other hotels were booked for the weekend so we decided to stay here because we were told it was a decent hotel at a good price.  Boy were they wrong.  Since it was a crazy weekend the price per night was close to $500, we were given a room on a lower floor because the only other room available on the 11th floor was going to be, as the women at the desk told us, loud due to all of;1
This is my first review, and I'm happily going out of my way to write it.   The Hollywood Hotel is absolutely nothing like what the photos show. My girlfriend and I were coming up to Hollywood for a wedding and were in a rush to get to our room and get dressed before leaving in our Uber. We had probably a total of 20-30 minutes in the room and immediately noticed how awful the quality was. Rust in the showers, stucco ceilings, paint chips all over, cramped room, and shared balconies. This is not a 4 Star Hotel.  Unfortunately we couldn't check out right away because we obviously had a wedding to run to.  Once we got back after the wedding we saw again how unsafe everything was, especially at night. The area is NOT a nice part of town and the whole lobby absolutely reeked of;1
Very disappointed with the hotel.  I thought I was booking a luxury hotel especially for the price of $500 per night.  When we got into our room, I was shocked by the small size particularly when the room was advertised as a superior.  Our view consisted of looking to a brick wall, and our AC didnât work.  To make matters worse, I booked the room in August 2018 and on the day of arrival it was advertised for $307.  Because of the disappoint in our dumpy $500 a night room, I asked for the advertised rate.  Still waiting to see if they will honor it and give me a credit.  I would recommend.  Lots of other hotels in NYC where you can get much better for your money.  One more thing, we arrived at 11:30 and check in wasnât until 3:00.  However the front desk informed us that they put;1
Do NOT book a reservation here. When we arrived in the middle of the night (had booked, payed deposit, and given notice), we were told that there were no rooms for us.

We booked this hotel based on bring  a 4 star hotel. We got very disappointed upon our arrival. We not even greeted properly by the staff and the reception. Our room was shockingly small and looked dirty and old. Our bedsheet and pillows were very uncomfortable. Bedsheets felt like toilet paper. Pillow were too uncomfortable and high that we had to take the ibuprofen on daily basis due to neck pain. I called the housekeeping and asked for a another type of problem pillow. She said this is our standard pillow and we do not have other options. We could hear the people next to us when they talked or even coughed. We also heard water running through the pipes. We approached the front desk with our concerns and the lady at the desk started with saying that she âhas 20 years of;1
We had a lousy stay...checked in w/reserv on 5/10 for a 3 night stay had asked for a king size bed, was told that was not a guarantee. No mgr on site until Wednesday.  Heater never worked...TV remote only worked if you stood right in front of the TV and no further than one foot in front of it.  Staff was inept, not customer friendly.  Breakfast was just OK.  Ya think you folks could spring for some decent food warmers with lids instead of using tin foil to cover the food???  Overall WE WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!!    Orbitz was not much better and we booked through them.  On our own we booked a room at a newer hotel a few blks away and got a larger room, king size bed and amenities for a lower price!!;1

During my stay, there was a loud party occurring all night.  I called multiple times to have the front desk or security staff resolve the situation or provide me an alternate room on a different floor.  For flight crew, sleep is so important as this hotel canât even provide an environment for decent sleep.  The security officers were rude and seemed to be buddies with the party room.  They didnât offer a room switch.  From literally 1-5AM, there was extremely loud noise, pot smoking, etc.  I got no sleep.  Hyatt canât control what guests do but they can control how they respond to the situation, and they failed miserably.  For anyone looking for a decent night of sleep or for professional and courteous staff, LOOK ELSEWHERE!;1
"I stayed here only one night. I was so disappointed. After a long travel day, I wanted to get into the shower, and then go down for some food and a beer. The shower had hair in it left from someone else. I rinsed it away, took a shower and was surprised that there was a hole in my towel. Ok, fine. I made some coffee and all there was in the room was the chemical, powdered non-dairy ""creamer"" -- no thanks. I got dressed and went down to the desk and asked for some creamer. They pointed at the market where I could buy some. This place was not worth the money and definitely feel that I paid to much. Are you kidding me, they can't even offer real creamer without charging me for it, a dirty room and towels with holes.";1

We checked in to the hotel Saturday afternoon and the air conditioning did not work.  When we went to dinner, we stopped at the front desk to let them know.  When we returned late, we had a fan!  The next morning we left early to Universal, when we returned mid day we still had no a/c.  I called the desk and a repairmen showed up, he confirmed the a/c does not work, but said it could not be repaired on Sunday.  On Monday at check out, at 11am, we complained about no a/c for the entire stay, the manager offered dinner!  Great option for Saturday or Sunday maybe, but we are leaving Los Angeles now.  He did not really seem to care.  The hotel looks nice, but they should have also upgraded the a/c and plumbing.  The faucet in the dirty bathtub leaked the entire time.  The hotel was;1
I've been in your facility for 9 days. I asked to change rooms because it was too noisy. as soon as I changed room I realized that I had forgotten an envelope with the jewels in the previous room and I notified the reception who told me that the room was already occupied and that he would ask the cleaning ladies. for the whole period of stay I asked all the reception staff news and they all replied that they would investigate and let me know. Nobody ever let me know anything. I asked for information every day. Result, lost the jewels. congratulations for the work done. I will certainly do a good publicity to your Hotel. Shame on you.;1
In December 2012 we booked a double room for March 2013, through Agoda.com and since it was a hot deal offer, we payed total amount in advance. Two weeks before our arrival, we sent an e-mail regarding our reservation to mr. Patrick and he confirmed that everything is fine. We also informed him that we will be arriving around 10 p.m. due to our flight schedule. We arrived to the hotel at Friday night and the receptionist told us that they are overbooked and they have no available rooms. She also told us that they had a system failure and she has been dealing with this kind of situations the whole day. We asked her to call the manager on the phone and she did. We were standing 2 meters away from her and we could hear him shouting at her. When she hung up the phone, she started;1
Rooms were very dirty, the rooms needed past due repairs. Sink faucet, blinds, reading light,AC unit, shower curtain. And after all that the pillows felt like rocks which made it very tough for good quality sleeping.;1
"First, a week before we stayed at the Empire I had done a web search to research the cool things about the area around the hotel and the hotel itself. As I was reading I came upon a great deal that was 130.00 less than I paid through the hotel website. I called the hotel to discuss this and suggested I cancel my reservation with them and rebook through this other internet site. The lady I spoke to on the phone was very nice and said no need, she would adjust it. Very nice and I thanked her. Weeeellllll, when I arrived they charged me the original price and when I explained, the lady at the front desk looked me straight in the eye and said, ""prove it"". I had no proof on me because the lady on the phone had assured me it was no problem at all. She said I could be lying and unless";1
We just got back from our trip to NYC. We waited too long to book our hotel and ended up short on affordable options. The only positive I can say is that it was at least a safe place to sleep in. Thatâs it. It was filthy. Our bed had hairs in it. The shower was dirty. The carpet was disgusting. My husband and I were given two towels and one wash cloth (like total) for our stay. We never did find an ice machine. The hallways were dark, dingy and VERY stinky. Overall it was a disappointing stay. BUT for a last minute booking and a pretty cheap rate I guess it did the job???;1

Let me start from the top. The young bell boy who helped us from the time we got out of the cab with our luggages is the most effective staff of this particular hotel.  Upon arrival at front desk, we inquire about upgrade. Lobby cost is triple the price to do it on my phone app. Worst. They can cancel your current check in so you can get the upgraded room for the lesser price on phone app. But it's pass cancellation period. Prior to asking if there is privileges for being a platinum tier of group: Not really. As explained. Guest should be wis enough to know that as per CSR. Main problem. Upon our entry to the room, it is cold. We turned on the a/c that goes to 85 degrees, still cold wind comes out for more than 30 mins. I'm not gonna go to detail but this is our complaint;1

This hotels saving grace is the staff who have been lovely.  It is close to the subway and Central Park.  The positives stop there.  The hotel stinks of cigarettes as some rooms are smoking rooms.  Our room was basic and very tired looking.  The worse part, it is absolutely freezing.  The bathroom is the coldest bathroom I have ever been in, socks are a must to cope with the tiles!! Wr have been cold in our very small bed at night.  We asked for more blankets which we were given but when you have window that is surrounded in black duck tape you worry, and the draft is more like a howling gale!!! When we arrived our room smelt of having been cleaned but with the over use of very strong air spray or product to the point it made us feel sick and had to open the windows.  Are door;1
My wife and I stayed one night and were charged for 2.  I requested a call back from the manager who is never there.  No call back.  Sheets had stains, TV whistled when on, very small room.  Good luck trying to get a refund if hotel makes a mistake checking you in!  Never again.  Terrible.;1

I recently stayed at Hotel Riverside, 342 West, 71st Street, New York.  It wasn't the most pleasant of stays.  I was staying there with my best friend and she also was not impressed.  We had a room with two single beds, the room really smelt, the window in the room would not even open.  There was no air conditioning in the room(which it states on thier web site).  We had to share bathrooms, which is ok but not when they are dirty and have cockroaches in them.  We had a wardrobe but with no coat hangers, also the room didn't even have a mirror.  The hotel was also supposed to be non-smoking, so why were there people staying smoking with thier doors open.  But apart from that the location is great, close to restaurants and four blocks from Central Park,  two blocks from the;1

Have just returned from a weeks holiday in New York. This holiday had been booked for a year and we were really loking forward to it, and this hotel almost ruined the experience!! We arrived late at night after a very long flight to find we were not allocated the rooms we booked, the receptionists answer was a shrug, and she got worse as the night went on.  Our room was tiny, could not fit our cases past the bed! The sheets had hairs and stains on them,(clean linen is a fairly basic requirement). I asked at reception for clean sheets, twenty minutes later a young man handed me sheets in order for me to change our own sheets, these sheets were wet!! In all we were moved three times that night.

Had an unfortunate series of events while I was on vacation here and had to return to NY on short notice when I went to check out PRIOR TO 11AM I was told my travel agency had a strict no cancellation refund and was ultimately told if I wanted my money back I'd have to contact the agency. I contact my agency and they never had a problem with it by the hotel manager (WHO NEVER SPOKE TO ME FACE TO FACE) denied it. Situation was handled highly unprofessional even when I woke up on a Tuesday morning to my entire room infested in Ant's. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS HOTEL!!!;1
We stayed from 1 Jan to 2 Jan 2020.  NEVER EVER book this hotel. It is FULL of additional charges. The staff members and managers are rude and condescending. The customer service is terrible.  First, they hit you with a $60 AUD amenity fee for the gym and pool. Erica, the manager on duty, simply did not care if you don't use these amenities and will not waive the $60.  Secondly, this nasty hotel will you charge you $7.50 AUD per day to store each bag, if your room is not ready for check-in.  Thirdly, this greedy hotel will charge you $5.00 AUD for a 300ml bottle of water. Don't touch it, go down stairs to Walgreens and get the same bottle for $1 AUD.  Finally, this stinky hotel has not changed nor steam cleaned the carpet since it was open in the 1930s. The stench of the carpet;1
When we got there at 9pm on a Friday night we were told there was only 1 room left. It was on the ground floor right on busy Vermont Ave. You could hear traffic and busses and honking day and night. What's worse is that we were right above the bar and you could hear loud music and people laughing till 2am every night. The bed was lumpy and the room had old, worn out, and stained curtains, matress, and bed coverings.  Even some of the towels had awful brown stains on them! Yuck! One night we came home late from the bar and there was no parking because they let anyone off the street visit their bar and park in the hotel guest parking lot taking up all the spots.(but they sure charge you $9/day 4 the parking). There were even 4 trucks parked in the parking lot that belonged to Out;1

I am not sure If i just ended up getting a horrible room because I price lined this hotel, but I got a double bed room for four people during New Years. First, the beds were a tad bit bigger than twin beds, smaller than fulls. My husband is a big guy so that it was very uncomfortable. What turned me off most about the hotel room was the bathrooms. They were disgusting. The toilet is a small, 1970's toilet. My husband and our friend joked that only one of their butt cheeks would fit on this. My husband isn't fat by any means, he's a body builder so he's buff. Second thing about the bathrooms, there isn't a space next to the sink (vanity). Its literally just the sink. So you can't put your makeup products/hair products, let alone get ready in the bathroom at all. The bathroom can;1

When we entered the room, we saw what is meant by a ""basic hotel"": dirty carpet, tiny room, no mirror in the bathroom, no towel hanger, mold on the bathroom walls and dito smell, whole in the bathroom door, airco shoved under the window, electric cable of the airco hanging loose along the wall,... see the pics.

We stayed here a while ago. It was a dump. I never reviewed it then. Checking hotels for a trip to NY next year, it came up on my screen. I recognised it straight away, although the place has had a bit of a face-lift. Think Jocelyn Wildenstein though if you are going to stay here. The room was so small that we almost fell on the bed when we walked into the room. The view from the window? A brick wall about a metre away. For some reason we paid more than the Canadians and Americans staying there. It is in a really nice part of NY, with some really good restaurants and a fantastic deli, Garden of Eden (had to google it) a few hundred metres away on Broadway, and a bus that goes to JFK just outside the door. Stay somewhere nearby.;1

If you try to ask them why they won't let you in, they refuse to answer. ""It's just a no, now leave!"" I tried to ask them if they had an event going on or some other valid reason for turning people away. Neither. One guy then tried to tell me that they were at capacity. I then asked if some people left the bar, would we then be able to get in? He then said ""no."" Makes absolutely no sense! Then I saw them let in numerous people behind us. All of the door men are incredible rude, aggressive, and disrespectful for no reason. I have never been to any other establishment that refused to answer";1

We booked our room through Priceline -- saving about $50/night.  However, they gave my family the smallest, ugliest room at this HILTON Universal.    The room was tiny, with 2 double-beds.  It was so small that the coffee machine was in the hallway.  No tub bath.  And we were the last room to get cleaned on the floor.  It's a nice hotel, with a lot of amenities -- but Hilton goes out of its way to treat Priceline users with LESS dignity and LESS important.

The receptionist was friendly & welcoming on our arrival. But the room was tiny & although overlooking Central Park we requested a larger room. This room was a little  larger, on the ground floor,  but was so dark & dingy. The window overlooked a dingy, dirty courtyard where old, broken furniture & other rubbish was stored.. The air conditioner  was so noisy & rattled all night. The only good point was that it was opposite Central Park!;1
Plumbing in first room wasn't good and so I moved.  Improvement in new room wasn't much better.  Front desk staff was great except I did not get my wake up call the morning that I departed.  Sorry that the Empire Hotel does not do better by its rooms.  It certainly maintains a great location.;1

And breakfast is 18$ not worth it at all!

I have enjoyed attending Lincoln Center across the street for many years. My routine would be having a cocktail in the lobby bar before the ballet would start.

Catering to patrons of Lincoln Center should also be a priority.;1
The price is way too expensive. Our room was not cleaned well. There was no attention to detail.

Our family had the unfortunate experience to stay at this Days Inn.  Several problems were present when we checked in.   Due to staffing problems with housekeeping, the room was not available until 2 hours later, around 5:00 pm.   TV reception was not available during the entire week.  According to the front desk, the TV cable provider was not notified of the problem until later in the week.  The device to code the room keys was malfunctioning, so multiple trips to the front desk were required to enter your room.   To get hot water, it was necessary to waste multiple gallons of water before hot water arrived.  The business center had a personal computer that was dead, so printing a return boarding was not possible.   Management informed the front desk staff that they were not;1
Just trust me on this. Pay a little extra and go somewhere else. First room we got put in smelled like smoke, was basically a box, smelled like smoke and had no hot water in the shower. Only window was looking at an ac unit.  Got moved to another room (shouldnât have had to move in the first place) was more like whats shown in the pictures for a King deluxe. Was for my wifes birthday which made me look like i am incompetent to plan a nice getaway.;1
No apology, no discount, nobody that cares. All I really wanted after a long day of moving was a shower, some tv, and sleep. I got non of the above. As they say, I prefer to be wined and dined before...;1
This is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed at.  They are upgrading?? the elevators so you have to wait a good 15 minutes or hike down 12 flights of stairs.  The elevators are overloaded due to the limited number running.  Staff was rude and uncaring when listening to my concerns of the concerns of other customers.  Stay somewhere else if possible.;1
"Booked 2 rooms with single bed in each with PRIVATE bathrooms....... ... .what we got 1 room with a smaller than double bed. Shared bathroom that wasn't big enough to swing a cat.  The manager is VERY cheeky and the staff don't have a clue.  Chared us DOUBLE THE PRICE! - BUGS everywhere!  I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy...its terrible.  Basically, we turned up. Logged straight online. Booked a hotel up the road ""Hotel Newton"" Chucked the morningside keys behind reception (As no one was ever there) and had the best stay ever.";1
"Our stay was awful. We reserved by phone and asked specifically about onsite parking. We were told the hotel had parking onsite and they quoted a price per day. This was a major factor in our deciding to stay here.  When we arrived, we found that the ""on site parking"" was actually a Hertz parking garage a block away and we had to carry our luggage. The front desk had one person on despite long lines and several employees behind the desk laughing and chatting.  Our TV didn't work, even after maintenance came. The wifi never worked.  The tub wouldn't drain, which made my shower a delight.  The front desk tried to bill me at $40 more a night than my confirmation email quoted. The elevators were tiny - 4-5 people at a time - and so the wait was VERY long. We will not return.";1
"We stayed here for a brief time while repairs were being made on our home.  My husband has also sent alot of business to this hotel, which will not be happening anymore since our stay.  I gave two stars because there were a couple of very sweet people here, but overall the hospitality and customer service was disappointing and rude even from the ""higher ups"".    The last straw for me came when I was BOMBARDED with marijuana smoke when the 5th floor opened.  I called downstairs to inform them of how pungent and offensive it was and the hotel operator told me ""well mam that is a smoking floor"" and I said, really, marijuana? and she said ""well yes if you have a license!""...no sorry!  For some people this may be okay, for me who is staying at the hotel with my 6 month old it is NOT!";1
"Don't book with HILTON !!! I booked this hotel because I needed to run the LA Marathon. The LA Marathon moved the date two weeks earlier. I called and emailed Hilton to see if I could change my reservaton.  Multiple calls and emails later, they still said No, sorry, can't modify or cancel your reservation even though it was a month ahead of time! Beware!  If you are staying in this ""caliber"" of hotel anyway, book with another chain, and avoid the Hilton chain and its affiliate hotels.  In the past I have had great cusomer service with Hyatt Regency.  In fact this is the worst service I have ever encountered even with less expensive hotels.";1
Overpriced for the small rooms and then since my room was to Shares between two adult males I needed a roll out bed and I was told that it would be $50 extra. I would have MAYBE paid it but there was no room for that in the already small room we had....pretty shocked...Iâve seen motels have bigger space for one third the price...;1
Hotel rooms not clean, really small. Had to move because sink was cracked. Some staff were really nice others rude. Bed clothes and towels were flithy. No space for cases once in the room. Lobby is the nicest part of hotel;1
I would have liked to have stayed here on july 19-20 as I had a prepaid reservation through world reservation (made via sidestep).  Front desk would not accept me and my group of 6 as they are feuding with World Reservations as they said that World reservations doesn't pay.  I think if Ramada Inn had refused a reservation they should notify the consumer.;1
I arrived to the hotel on December 30, 2019 on December 31, 2019 the housekeeping staff was changing the rollover bed because it was damaged. When they were opening the new bed the back part on it felt on my toe resulting in an injury I reported to Michael front desk manager he introduced me to Jack manager of security he brought me some ice packs and he said to me that any medical cost the hotel wasnât going to cover them if I wanted an EMS or some X-Rays I should pay for them. Apparently they made a report but they never provided it to me and I ask for it and they said it was confidential documents. I wasnât able to go to the Ball Drop because of the injury, tried to walk a little bit but it was imposible to do so. I asked for a wheelchair and I could move my self a little bit;1
Other than location, and perhaps a decent lobby bar, this hotel doesn't have much going for it. The rooms are run down, in need of refurbishment, and not very clean. The beds are horribly uncomfortable, including/especially the pillows, and good luck getting sheets! There are lots of extra amenities available for purchase (at absurd prices) in the room, however none of the necessities to actually utilize said amenities. For instance, wine (including warm white wine) but no wine glasses or ice bucket for chilling (you have to call the front desk to have them delivered.) So after overpaying for the mediocre wine, you need to tip the guy for delivering glasses and an ice bucket that can barely fit the wine bottle. Also, if you'd like to take advantage of the Keurig coffee maker and;1
We walked into the lobby to check-in and were concerned right away about the disrepair and odor of the lobby.  Motel was in horrible location, rooms were in much need of repair, dirty, stained bedding, carpets were filthy, bathroom was worse. One look and we gave the keys back, canceled our two nights stay and left!!    When we were pulling out of the parking lot, police officers had a group of 5-6 men, hands above their heads leaned up against the side of the motel.  Definetly a scary area of Hollywood.  We booked through Expedia and had already paid for our room but I would rather lose the money then stay there! I will never book another Ramada.;1
So ugly, unclean, plenty of noise. Never seen a room so ugly like that in my life. Garbage in the court and inside a trap for rats. Check-out immediately after one night there. Pay attention to the electricals broken!;1

I was scratching myself almost from the beginning of our holiday In Wyndham Hotel. I thought that it maybe was a mosquito bite, But then at the last day when I was packing my things I found a lice crawling into my luggage. I told the hotel about my experience, cuz I now knew why I had been scrathing all my holiday staying there. They told me that They would Get someone to look at it and then e-mail me, But I haven't heard from Them! See the pics In the comments.;1

Hotel was not really all that clean.  Also the room was extremely hot and the A/C wouldn't stay running (it kept cycling on and off). No exaggeration had to be 85 or more in room (Oct 2016).  Let the hotel know but they did nothing.  Priceline tried to get refund and the hotel claimed there was no note on my account and no refund.  We had to leave one day early and we wanted that night credited.;1
-Took nearly an hour to check in (with only four people ahead of me): Mutliple people kept coming back to the desk (ahead of me) for another room: my associate had to come back down because another of our associates had been assigned to the room he entered ...and that person was already on the toilet when he walked in!!)  Another associate of mine had to come back down and get another room because his room was being sprayed for roaches.  -big patches of mold along baseboards in my room  -sheets were of low quality and were rough  -bed was too firm  -no outlets in convenient locations  -front desk lacked technology to know what room I was calling from...small things like this are annoying...there should be no need for you to ask me my room number when I'm calling for a wake-up;1
The only good thing about this hotel was the location, but I would not stay here again. The front desk staff are clueless, at best. It took a long time checking in. Elevators at straight out of the 80âs- tiny, mirrors and lights. The hallways leading to the rooms are dark, confusing, and like a maze. And boy are you in for a treat when you see the rooms!!  So horrible that itâs hysterical! The beds light up- Austin Powers style...no lie. The carpets are gross, bathroom floor sticky, old fashioned clip lights on the beds, old lumpy mattresses, bedroom tables covered with contact paper- and had lumps all over them because even that wasnât applied correctly. Requested a fridge for the room- wasnât there. Called down twice to remind them, because apparently waiting 2 hours didnât;1
The Hilton Universal City was well below the quality offered by Hilton hotels. The room was clean and spacious but the towels were old and one was even torn. The bath tubs were old with peeling paint. The toilet did not flash well resulting in the toilet bowl filling up. There was nothing in the minibar. And worst of all they charged my credit card twice. On asking them they simply denied and now I have to wait for 90 days for the bank to resolve it. The limo to the airport was supposed to be US$91 dollars and they gave me receipt for US$91 BUT on checking my bank account they actually debited $131.  It is a pity because the loaction is fantastic.;1

Chose the New Yorker for its location as I was taking my son to NYC for his first trip. naturally he was super excited, as would any 13 year old boy. We stayed from the 26/8/18 to 31/8/18. The hotel is situated in a good location close to Macys and having a metro station on its doorstep so you can get around. Check in staff are friendly and have a pleasant manor as they welcome you and process your check in. We had two rooms booked and were given rooms over looking the Hudson next door to each other, which was convenient for meeting when going out. Rooms were a good size and everything worked as it should. Overall we had a great time during our stay and had no problems with the room. On the morning of checkout, there was then usual invoice under the door for the local taxes;1
What a disappointment, staff waking me up when signs on door, broken glass in hallway when getting ice, which I stepped on, and no help from staff, the place stinks of cannabis, and when I complained they couldn't give a bollox, I'm allergic to cannabis, what a horrible place,;1
Awful hotel. No amenities in the room. No tissues, note pad or pen, no hotel brochures etc. No microwave, no mini bar fridge, nothing. Room was not clean when I arrived, stained sheets, dirt, dust and crumbs on the floor, the air con unit was filthy, the towels were only slightly bigger than a tea-towel and some of them were stained (although I was told not dirty, just permanently stained!!!) I found a bug in the bed on arrival. TV channels were very limited and signal would cut out EVERY few minutes on EVERY channel EVERY day, not just once or twice. Service was terrible with no smile (except for one lovely lady). The young guy who checked me in had a cold and was sniffing and wiping his nose constantly then handled my passport and credit card (funny how I got the same cold a;1
I have never had such a bad experience in a hotel in NYC before. The hotel is old, dirty, dark and understaffed. The standard rooms are awful, more like a closet with noisy air conditioning which works sometimes. I had a hard time to get the phone answered by the front desk and when my ac didn't work their solution was to send someone to fix it three times and I ended up sleeping without it in the heat of the NYC summer!!! and do not think that they would even give you a tiny water bottle for free every day, because they charge you for it at the end of your stay.  Very poor hotel indeed.;1

We checked into the holllywood hotel on March 7th, we intended to stay 4 nights. Simply put, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.   We were given room 217, upon entrance we began to get settled in and noticed a trail of ants crawling along the wall near the ceiling. Not one to normally be overly concerned with insects, I disregarded them under the presumption that they were simply passing through.   Upon entry to the bathroom we noted clumps of hair on the shower tiles and what appeared to be blood stains on the towels.   I continued mistakenly give the hotel the benefit of the doubt.   Unfortunately this was a mistake, I woke up at 4am to the feeling of things crawling on me, I turned on my cell phone light and to my dismay the ants had invaded our bed.   I along with;1

I should have read the reviews.  Don't make my mistake. My sick husband and I stayed here for 2 nights this week.  No heat.  Let me repeat that, so it is plain to understand.  It is New York City, middle of November and we had NO HEAT.  All the bad stuff in the reviews is absolutely true.  It is dingy and dirty, although to their credit, our bathroom was clean and the shower had nice hot water. The prices on the website are slightly misleading, unless you are very careful to look at nightly prices, which appear to change with the tidal cycle.  But I digress.  The lock on the door was iffy.  You had to fumble around with the key cards and eventually, figure out how slowly to pull the card out so that you could get into the room.  I had to get news keys made twice, after the;1
Room was not ready at 1:30 pm when I arrived. Not ready at check in time of 3pm. Not ready at 4:00pm. Front desk staff were unhelpful and did not offer any solution. Not even an interim room whilst waiting for my 1 BR suite. Try the Hilton. Hopeless.;1

We booked this hotel as we thought there was parking - we had it marked as criteria upon one of the booking websites - no parking is available so we had to change our travel plans. The photos of the 'hotel' make the rooms look clean and presentable - they are not!!!   The walls were marked through use which is to be expected (but they were extremely marked - i& mho it needed redecorating) but the private bathroom was dirty, I didn't even want to stand in the shower and the chest of draws in the room had some weird brown stains in them that I didn't want to imagine what they were.  There was no tv in the room - just a communal tv room and although you are provided with cups and a fridge there was no kettle.  (After the state of the room I didn't dare look in the fridge itself and;1

My fiance and I live in Brooklyn, and we recently spent two nights at The Jane while the furnace in our building was being replaced and we had no heat/hot water. As former West Villagers, we have long been big fans of Cafe Gitane and we love the hotel bar. So it was especially disappointing to have such an unpleasant first (and last) stay in the hotel itself. We checked into room 205 on our first night. The room was perfectly fine, if a bit noisy, with nice river views. On night #2, we made our way back up to 205 and were completely confused to find another couple's belongings in our room. We went back down to the front desk where we were told that housekeeping had moved us to room 218, though no one could explain why, and we were told to speak with the manager the next morning.;1
"We checked into this hotel 22nd October for 5 nights the room we were given was really small and very dirty there was thick dust and grime.

We then told reception we were still not happy and we were then given another room to look. At the time this one had not been cleaned and really smelt. We decided to check out but unfortunately we could not get anywhere else to stay so had to go and ask if we could have a room against our wishes. The curtains were hanging down, the window didn't close, the carpets were disgusting the dust on the skirtings was appalling, there was something up the";1

Terrible experience considering this was my first time staying overnight in NYC! The rooms are very small and dingy. There was a stain next to the antiquated radiator that pumped out too much heat that made my room even more unbearable. My room was bare bones and for the amount we paid via Groupon, I expected more for my money.  The keys to my door didn't work and had to walk down 3 times to get the employee to come up and open the door for me.  The first night, I was jolted awake by people talking or walking loudly because the walls were so thin. I can hear the water drain inside the walls. My shower was a tad bit better than a friends bathroom where the mirror was cracked, mold in the bathroom and showerhead protruding from the wall. The elevators were ridiculously too;1
The desk clerks were not customer friendly.  Each person we talked to said they worked for the building and not the hotel.  Hotel personnel not available.  The rooms are exceptionally small.  When both beds are pulled out there is no walking room.   The person sleeping in the bed has to walk across the person sleeping on the converted chair/sleeper if you want to use the bathroom. The refrigerator was frozen over when we got there.  The bathroom had so much disgusting grout dirt and when we complained they said they would send someone up...no one ever came.  We asked for more towels, because some were missing - no one ever came!!!!  They have no guide pamphlets for tourist.  You'd better have your trip planned out, because they are no help.  Do not stay here!!!!!!!;1
My husband and I were on honeymoon and had booked a double with private bathroom. After a long flight, we got to our 'hotel', only to be told that our room was not available. If we could cope, they would give us another room, but with a shared bathroom for the night and then we'd move to our original room. We agreed. We got to the room, to find it half painted, with a mattress on the floor with dirty linen, the wardrobe door jammed open by the 'bed', a broken fridge, no wifi and toilet rolls thrown in the room for good measure. Needless to say, I wasn't very happy. The staff were incredibly unhelpful and we had to find another hotel at short notice, a day before new year. They didn't even refund our deposits. Do not go here. (We went 2012-2013);1

Even though our room (with private bath) was confirmed by the owner himself, we were given another room (with shared bath) for the night.

When we returned the same evening, they just stared at us and said: ""We didn't think you'd come back so we gave your room to somebody else"". And all this time our bags were in the storage room and they knew it !!! That' no way to treat anybody, especially not with a small child !";1

Rooms are really small. Two people can not walk by each other. The hotel is old and run down. Service is the worst I ever experienced! The hotel is run down. My major problem is on 5/10/2016 we never got room service. We had the do not disturb sign on the door until 12:15 pm and then remove it. At 3pm I came back they told me the do not disturb sign was on the door I told them it was not, either way, the room is not done and we have no toilet paper. he said we will send it right up and clean your room at 9 pm still nothing!

It was awful.  The heat was broken, there was no hot water, the internet worked at a snail's pace and the sauna was broken.  It was one of those cold LA nights, and I bundled in the blankets between calls to the front desk to try to get some maintenance.  The front desk people were curt and not helpful.  In the morning, I complained about this sub-par experience, the employees got more brusquely referred me to the general manager, Roman.   I called Roman, who told me his boss, Jeff, had to be the one to help me.  I called Jeff.  I called him again.  And again.  I called Roman again, who was amazingly rude, said he can't help and transferred me to Jeff's voicemail.  I have now left Roman four messages and Jeff six.  DO NOT GO HERE.  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

I highly suggest looking up the bed bug registry and seeing how many problems The Jane has with bed bugs.  The fourth floor seems especially infested.  I stayed at The Jane one night although I had reservations for 3 nights.  I was in a single room with shared bathroom and thought 99 dollars a night for NYC was a steal . My room was the size of a closet and  I had a very uncomfortable sleep because the bed was much smaller than a twin, it was more like a cot.  It was a futon type small cot but I am not a huge person so I thought it would be fine.  First of all, if you are claustrophobic, DO NOT stay at the Jane.  Secondly if you are tall or bigger this bed will never be big enough for you.  It was a very hot July night and I turned on the air conditioner, it was unbelievably;1
I've stayed at the Empire three times - first two were unremarkable and were over five years ago.  I don't know how a hotel goes downhill so fast, but this one has.  Paint is chipping, bedding torn and decor in common areas in very sad state.  The heat could not be adjusted or turned off and this even though the unit in the room was unplugged.  In the morning, due to problems with the elevators, many guests in the hallway discussed how truly comfortably hot their rooms had been, so I know it wasn't just ours.  As for those elevators, it took ten minutes to get down the lobby. To top things off, there was maintenance being done in the room next door -- starting at 8 am with power tools on full throttle.    One other note - upon checking in, we were greeted without eye contact,;1
"This Blast-from-the-Past ""4-star"" hotel across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden provided a stunning view of the Empire State Building and plenty of hot water, but in other respects was lacking: 1. 40-minute check-in. 2. 40 more minutes to buy an extra night. 3. Bed made but sheets not changed. 4. Room not cleaned, garbage not emptied. 5. 30-second minimum wait before elevator doors close. 6. 30-second ""temperature"" screening and mugshot every time you enter. 7. Desk clerk insists you confirm purchase by entering PIN number, but refuses to show you bill on screen or on paper--or even give you receipt for your payment. (!!)  The list goes on . . .";1
The lobby is very nice but that is the only part. The room and hallway is very dated! There is an old layer of filth that seems acceptable. It felt like  I went back in time or to another country. Everything is old and rusted. I didn't want to take of my shoes or put anything down. It was very uncomfortable. I felt like roaches would carry me away in my sleep. If you like nice things or not being disgusted try somewhere else!;1
the rooms of this hotel are very far from what the website describes. I was there with 2 collegues of mine and our rooms were old, the wallpaper was torn in several places and the bath was dirty. Air condition system was very noisy and the nights were terribly hot, but due to the noise it was not nice to sleep with the air condition system on. although all of this people working there were very nice and helpful.;1

If you don't mind cockroaches greeting you when entering the room or jumping at you when opening the closet, this hotel might be ok for you.  Otherwise, stay away from it.  I had to abandon the hotel after the first night because of this problem.  The a/c was in bad shape and dirty.;1
The worst place I ever stayed at! Abercorn House London is badly maintained, very loud and extremely filthy. Worst hygiene in bathroom. The toilets in Abercorn House London were constantly clogged. Poo in loo everywhere and dried urine stains on seat. The pictures below says it all. I also found that all the room (floor, ceiling, window sills, heater, table and curtains) had covered a thick layer of dust. Dirt stains on bed linen and stains on the walls that could easily be removed. I also noticed that a lot of long hairs were on the room floor and on the table. The bed was as hard as rock. There are no door knobs which makes it hard to close the doors without slamming so everyone pulls the door shut and it can be heard from all over. The walls were very thin, too. Towards the;1
I can't even review this hotel because they cancelled my reservation the day of arrival. Altough the reservation made through booking mentions the payment is at the hotel, they tried to get the first night out of my credit card before my arrival. Because it didn't work they've sent me an email to change credit card information which I didn't read because I was flying to NY. So the reservation made 5 months before was cancelled just like that. Upon check-in they informed me that they couldn't give any room because the hotel was overbooked. So this hotel allowed for my family with small children and an elderly person stayed in the street in a New York friday evening. I've never seen such thing before in my life. Fortunately I found online a better hotel for the same price just one;1
"The room was so small,at the ground floor, 40 degrees with no AC, bugs on the floor and bed, we had to leave the window opened and there were people smoking and shouting outside at all hours who could see us naked, a bird fell off in our room, the builders in front of us were refurbishing, starting at 7 am and waking us up and all the polluted air was coming through the window. The staff didn't care, I asked to check out after the first day and have the rest of the stay refunded; they just say they can't, without offering any solution. They were so rude to me, but flirting with my girlfriend when she went by herself to ask for some towels, can you believe that?!! The Housekeeping just came inside the room while we were sleeping, without apologising, claiming we HAD TO give them";1
Stayed at Ameritania during four nights and will never return! My computer was stolen out of my luggage while moved by hotel-personnel from one room to another. The change of room was requested by myself and I was told to leave my luggage packed in the room. Upon arrival later the same afternoon in my new room I discovered that the laptop computer had been removed from my luggage and missing.   Most annoying was the indifferent and almost arrogant attitude shown by the reception staff and management. They simply concluded that their staff was trustworthy since they had been employed for several years and therefor couldn't be responsible for the theft.   No formal apaloghy or compensation was offerred. I am stunned by the ignorance and unwillingness to satisfy their guests!;1

They need to improve in all the aspects. The cleaning is very bad, the beds are uncomfortable, the bathrooms are very small and the personal should be more kind about what deserve the guest. I will never recommend it.;1
My room was always cold, the bathroom window was broken and the wind constantly went in, the air conditioning did not heat and despite having made the comment never solved, the two days I did not have hot water in the shower. I travel more than 4 days to get to your hotel and the only thing I asked for was a pleasant break but apparently ruined my vacation, canceled my last day of Reservation and changed my hotel. The only one great Is the location;1
After attitude my colleague and I were accommodated again with attitude and it was not busy (no surprise). The room door opened and I we were smacked with stench, only to find a floating turd in the toilet. Cleanliness is a big deal and this was unreal. I truly still can't believe it. The staff googling about it was more disgusting than the poop. Staying here was my suggestion, we were tired from work and a long flight and had to gather our things, find and stay at another hotel. How embarrassing. To think we we're going to return in August. Never even got to see thrre rooftop. What a fail.;1
Will not spend my points to stay there again. Extremely dirty. Hair everywhere. Tiny bedroom. Not to mention only 1 person at front desk, and the longest line to check in. Very disappointed. Never again.;1
Three night stay - two mornings, no hot water, one morning, no water. When you could take a shower, the setup was such that you flooded the bathroom floor every time and had to use your towels as mops. Truly unfortunate because it is a great location and usually a pleasant stay. No compensation offered for the inconvenience, merely an apology. At close to $500/night, there are other options in the area.;1
"We paid in advance and were told ""no refunds"" or we would have relocated. The lower rate we paid ($125 night) was not worth the uncomfortable surroundings. Our bed sheets were too small & popped off when anyone came near the bed. We tied a washcloth around a pipe to soften the noise from the ""radiator"" so that we could attempt to sleep. The bathroom was gross with a ceiling covered in mold, (I took pictures) a hole in the wall, cracked wall tile, and broken toliet paper holder (the paper roll was placed on the edge of the bath tub.) We did not receive maid service until we requested it and were given two small bath towels, one of which had a unmissable mat of hair clumped in the center. We asked for extra towels and were given ONE extra. There was an ancient small television";1
Good location but the twin room we reserved turned out to consist of bunk beds and there was no room to put/open luggage or get dressed or do anything for that matter. Air con was rubbish and rooms weren't en suite. Might just be about OK if I was travelling solo.;1
"Sadly I was niave and unaware of trip Advisor before I booked my daughter & I into these apartments. Like others we found the place to be filthy; stained furniture/ carpets. Poorly laundered linen. Very unhelpful unfriendly staff. However after being refused my money back and trying to make the best of things, a live Rat in the bin within our apartment was totally unacceptable. Not to mention the cockroaches. I gained little reaction when I demanded that the offending rodent be removed, it seemed to be an every day occurrence to them. I ended up cleaning the place and buying bed linen on my first night in order to cope with the awfulness. I have returned home and have no help from Woogoo Staff, feel throughly depressed and disappointed having looked forward to this trip for such";1
"I intentionally booked this hotel amidst an overnight connection at LAX. Being that my flight left in the late afternoon on my date of departure, I booked one of the advertised ""stay late and play"" packages for a 2PM departure time. Beginning at approximately 11:45, housekeeping began knocking on my door and inquiring about my departure time. I explained the circumstances and returned to a conference call. Moments later, my conference call was then interrupted by the housekeeping supervisor who also inquired about my departure time. I called the front desk who assured me that my reservation was noted correctly in the system. Shortly thereafter, a housekeeper keyed into my room without knocking to discover me -- nude -- on the toilet.   I explained the circumstances to the front";1
We enjoyed our stay until we woke up and my husband and I were covered (literally covered in all parts of our bodies) with insect bites.  We are still severely impacted by these bites, which are red and swollen and extremely itchy. We appreciated that the Jane comped us the room in consideration of this but we are justifiably very concerned about the possibility that we may have brought bed bugs or fleas home with us, despite our best efforts to shower and launder all our possessions and clothing.  The extent of the infestation, as evidenced by the number of bites we received in a single night, tells us that this is not a new problem.   Unacceptable.;1
Hotel is in a good location and kept in good condition, the lounge in the rooftop was nice.  However, ladies at the reception desk were not very friendly or accommodating. We went when they were quite busy and rates where high, but customer service was extremely low. We paid about $400 a night to wait in the lobby after a tired trip, room was not ready until 1 hr check-in time. I guess they were double booking rooms since we paid upfront for a suite and got a standard room facing a wall and no refunds were offered. Since we booked thru a travel site all they can say is contact the travel site have them resolve your issue, we can do nothing.  So be ware of paying upfront or thru travel sites as you will be treated as second class citizens.;1
Not being a silver spoon kind of guy and not expecting the Ritz, my friends and i stayed at this hovel recently, all i was expecting was a clean and comfortable space to sleep. First thing i noticed was the filthy wet carpet in the hallway, battered walls and quite smelly, as i entered the room it smelt stronly of stale cigarette odours and carpets in our room were damp and filthy and your thongs stuck to the floor, curtains were stained and smelt very bad and the air conditioner carried these odours constantly through the room. WiFi was very slow, dial up speed i think, and only two out of four lifts worked, i overheard the lift mechanic saying that one lift had been out of order for two months. There was only tepid water available in shower.  I just am disgusted that places;1
Try another hotel for location of  the Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle.  Honestly, it seemed as though every employee was unhappy and did not want to be there.  The incredibly rude front desk and concierge ruined a birthday surprise for my husband.  Days before I called and asked for a bottle of wine to be waiting in our room for him.  I confirmed that again the morning of our stay.  No problem, they said.  When we arrived, 3 persons denied I had spoken with them.  With an attitude, their solution was to send a bottle up later in day for a charge of $86.00 or we could walk to 67th street and buy one!

Hotel is old and tired.  Air Conditioning does not work.  Rooms are dark and small.  Bathrooms are not updated.  Itâs a real pity as itâs a great location, but the hotel needs a major overhaul.  Just across from Lincoln Center.  So, should be much better.;1
This place is a complete dump. Horribly rude and lazy staff. Honestly, the only thing worse then the actual hotel is their nightclub. Itâs a real shame because I will never return and I will make sure none of my friends/family does either.;1
"I stayed in this hotel for 1 of the 4 nights I reserved(09/27/05). The sheets were filthy, the bathroom had bugs, the door didn't close all the way, the room did not come with the amenities it said it would (I.E. Cable. We barely got reception let alone HBO), no alarm clock.  This was vital to our stay since we were in town for a medical school interview. We had a light bulb out in our room so I went down to the front desk (our phone didn't work) and asked if someone could replace it. The desk staff called someone to change the bulb. A man walked in and said ""I ain't changing no lightbulbs. You do it."" Then walked out. Needless to say the light bulb was never replaced and there was no appology for the rudeness. I then asked if we could have a phonebook to look at. The man looked";1
Reception staff really need to work on customer service.  Just be nice to people and be happy to see them, no matter what the issue may be regarding their reservation. The rooms are indeed in bad condition as many reviews say. This would be less of an issue if guests felt welcomed.;1
"First, it's shabby, dirty, run down and my first room stank of mildew. Second, I wouldn't agree that the front desk people are extremely helpful--not rude, but didn't really go out of her way to help me. Third, the TV and the phone in the room didn't work. (I tried to use the room phone to call about the TV, but ended up using my cell phone). When I first spoke to the lobby about the TV, she said that my room TV directory was ""out of date"" and I'd need to come to the lobby and get an updated channel list. So, I waited on the very slow elevator to take me down to the lobby and got the updated channel list. On the updated channel list, fully half of the channels didn't work. Called lobby again, and she said ""well, I could put you in a different room, but I can't guarantee that the";1
I am use to expensive small hotels from trips to Paris.  This place is a complete rip off.  Our short term studio apartment was very expensive given its size and quality.  The towels smelled of mold (left in washer for a long time prior to being put in dryer?)  The comforter smelled of B.O.  The carpet and sofa where stained/damaged.  The dresser had a broken drawer.  The room did not fit the furniture (could not open night stand drawer as it jammed up against love seat.)  Bed sheets were clean but had black stains.  If security is a concern do not stay here.  No room safe and gap between door and jam means anyone could break into room while you are gone.  Deadbolt that only locks from inside will keep you safe, but not your stuff.  Somehow this place got 3 stars.  It is;1
Worst experience ever and would not recommend this hotel to family and friends. Had to wait a long time to check in and when I got to the front desk the receptionist was extremely rude and thought she was doing me a great favor, only to find out that the manager was cancelling reservations without informing the guests. Rooms are extremely outdated and not worth the money. Time square is also quite a distance from the hotel. Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your room card which is quite annoying. Thereâs many nicer hotels then the New Yorker Wyndham on the same road.;1
"The only thing good about this hotel is the location.  The staff here are rude, unhelpful and patronizing.  We had dinner one night on the rooftop restaurant and no one greeted us, no one bothered to say hello, welcome. Nothing.  It seems that you have to ""be someone"" or look a certain way otherwise they pay you no attention. I also asked for our air conditioning to be turned down (there are no controls to do it yourself) and this was never done, needless to say we all ended up with the flu. Worst hotel experience of my life and I travel a fair amount.";1
I made some plans to take a trip to Universal City Walk checking, I was bringing my dog along with me.  Since the Hilton is a pet friendly hotel, I thought it would be a good choice. I asked for a view of Los Angeles or SOMETHING DECENT! Instead I got a view of the maintance area. The room was so tiny, they put me on the 2nd floor right next to the stairs, I could hear stompping all night. They literally stuck me in the basement!! My room was underneath the lobby enterance. Since my dog wasn't allowed unattended in the room, I went down to get some breakfast to bring back up to my room......And the workers said that I wasn't allowed to do that. Then how am I suppose to have breakfast without leaving my dog in the room??? I work very hard and just wanted to get away from my crazy;1

Would not recommend to anyone.";1
This place is on the Hammersmith stop off of the Central or Picadilly line. My only issue with this place is the internet, you have to pay 1 lb for 1 hr continuous use or 5 lb for 5 hours can be used anytime. Our room was clean, bed was comfortable, and comforter kept us warm. Our room also had our own fridge that didnât smell, that was a plus. The bathroom had enough space to shower but not enough counter space for the bathroom sink. I understand the choice of flooring material they used but it didnât feel that great on the feet. The bathroom also smells, they need to air out the bathrooms better or use a different cleaning solution. Once you enter the lobby area, you immediately get the sense that it is very business oriented run establishment. The people were friendly and;1
I booked a stay at the Woogo in Central Park New York.  Woogo took the whole amount of my credit card immediately.  I had to cancel the booking, which I did the following day.  Woogo said they would refund me the money less $50 cancellation fee (I thought that was a bit steep, and most other hotels wouldn't charge as there was more than one month's notice). They kept stalling me about refunding the money and eventually said they couldn't refund it because they had changed credit card merchants.  I have approached my c/c company who are trying to get me a refund. I would be very wary with dealing with this company, as in my opinion, they are not reputable.;1

One of the worst things about this hotel besides the inadequate rooms, terrible bathrooms and depressing decor is the rude staff at the reception desk. Whenever you need to engage with them for anything they act as if youâre a bother. I asked about why our wifi said that we were only getting 200 mb of internet per day after paying an exorbitant $45 resort fees which states fast internet on their site. The person at reception said he didnât know, so he went to ask his manager and he didnât know either. So he gave me the number of the internet provider they use and said I could call them and ask if I want to! Unbelievable.  My sonâs suitcase was lost in LA but was found and was arriving in NY the next day. When I went to ask if it had arrived the disinterested reception worker;1
I recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and would never stay there again due to the standard of the bedrooms and the situation of the hotel. The rooms are very very dated and seem as if they have not been updated since the 1980âs. The corridors are very shabby. The area in which the hotel is situated is run down and not an area you want to be walking around on your own at night time. The positives about the hotel are the staff, every member of staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to assist you. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel.;1
I stayed for a week with my 6 yo. Walls are thin that we can hear inappropriate noises from the next room. Things were falling apart in the room. Shower holder came loose, shower hard to operate. Heater broke down on a very cold night. Thrash werent always taken out & towels not replaced. Concierges were very snotty & unhelpful;1
I prepaid for three nights but was unable to arrive timely due to hurricane, flash flood, and severe thunderstorm warnings in the area.  Despite the manager being totally lovely and understanding, corporate refused to refund the first night.;1
our first room was dirty and nothing was working properly and there was a huge gum on the exterior door of the bathroom they moved us to another room but the room was still dusty and dirty. No internet connection.;1
My boyfriend and I had booked for 5 nights here. When we walked in were totally disgusted by the place- I have stayed in $10 a night Hostels that are cleaner than this. Unfortunately, we had paid for 5 nights up front, ( a mistake I will not make again) so we would lose a portion of our money if we left. We decided to bear with it thinking that we would only be here to sleep, but after the second night we had to leave after waking up covered in bed bug bites. The worst thing was, when we went downstairs to tell them we were checking out and wanted our money refunded, the desk clerk was not the least bit surprised!! I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. I am no princess and have stayed and lived in some absolute hovels during my 4 years of travel and this is the;1
"We had a King room which had room for the bed and little else. The toilet hit my leg when I used the sink.We could not cool down the room even with the heat off and the window open.We were on the 11th floor and heard the,""beat"" from the club above us too clearly. Called the front desk at midnight to complain but there was no answer.  The room was clean and the front desk service was good.";1
DO NOT STAY HERE -   The staff was extremely rude and our reservations were completely screwed up.  I booked 1 night on line and the 2nd night I booked through the hotel directly for a non-smoking room.  I confirmed the reservation a week in advance.    When we got there at 9:30PM after reconfirming in the afternoon that we had a non-smoking room we were told we had reservations for only 1 night in a smoking room.  The staff was mad at me for booking on line eventhough I confirmed and changed my reservations with them.  IF you are going to Universal Studios STAY at Universal Studios.  We ended up in another Ramada in a neighborhood that I never would have booked and we had to pay for a taxi to get there.;1

We spent two nights at the Hilton beginning May 2nd.  As we got ready to leave my husband started turning over pillows to make sure we got everything and when he turned over one of the pillows it was covered in blood, and I am not talking about a little spot.  We called down to the front desk and told them about it.  After another phone call somebody finally came up and tried to tell us this had never happened before.  I felt like they thought we were responsible or it.  The worse part is we must have slept on that pillow for the whole trip!!!  They did not seem overly concerned,  we did not receive any apology, but we did receive 50,000 honors points.   I slept on blood for two nights and you think I will be using Hilton again?  It makes me question what else you don't change;1
well where do i start, the room was booked by my friends who flew in from overseas we arrive on 10/1/2011 love the vicinity it is located in but the lobby looks like a crack house that i have seen on tv, the elevator was so small that 2 adults with large handbags would not fit comfortaby, the rooms smelled strong of old ciggarettes and pee the bed sheets were marked and the heater was painted in an ugly pink the tv did not work, the view outside was so  crappy, this bldg should be shut down its horrible, we complained to the BBB cause these living conditions for anyone is not healthy, they did not take a cancellation fee cause they told us we will not find a hotel room on the upper west side this close to the city for 700$ but we did at the hampton inn on 6th avenue.i advise;1
Beware about staying at this property. They add new charges on top of a prepaid reservation. The clerk at the front desk has obviously dealt with many people like me who were surprised at the charge, so it is clear the company knows its marketing strategy involves deception and nevertheless stands by it. Also, after checking in, checking my reservation documents and such, and then calling the front dest to discuss, it is impossible to get anyone at the front desk and to get a return phone call.;1
I stayed at this hotel only one night. It was around $499 US. It was absolutely disgusting, the sofa bed and the room was horribly stained the bathroom was small and outdated. There was no View aside the top of a parking lot. In addition to this they have a very overpriced restaurant in the lobby, for instance two bottles of milk for my kids were $18. In addition to this they do not allow you to have room service brought up, for breakfast you have to go downstairs in order wait for your food to be prepared and bring it back to your room to eat or eat in the restaurant. With two kids itâs hard to wait on food being repaired, what would be more convenient would be if room service would bring it up to you. I was told the room service doesnât start until the evening. The fan in the;1

The rooms are dingy and the place is clearly a tourist trap when compared to Hilton hotels in other locations. My wife and I got into our bed only to find that there was no fitted sheet on the mattress. We called for housekeeping to bring us one, but they brought a top sheet. We said we already had a top sheet, but they did not understand what a fitted sheet was. We tried to explain that even when you purchase sheets that there is always a set: a top sheet and a fitted sheet that goes over the mattress. We have never been to hotel that didnât provide a fitted sheet or claimed that they didnât know what a fitted sheet is. It is unacceptable for guests to come and sleep on a mattress with just a top sheet. We are Hilton Honors Members and are very disappointed;1
By the photos this hotel looks amazing ... roof top bar.. roof top pool the lot. That's the exact reason we chose this hotel for our stay.  Our room was very VERY small and didn't have a light.. it had 2 lamps but no light ? And we were also a room facing another building .. so no day light came in either. When we wanted to go to the rooftop bar/pool it was closed ... we weren't told this .. we were rudely told by staff working up there after eventually finding it. ( very badly organised ) We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and not ONCE did we have our rooms cleaned or fresh towels. I am no slob I can clean my own room but fresh towels would have been nice.. and as I explained to the manager.. the money your paying you expect clean towels.. I stay in b&bs more than half the price;1

This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed ! To think they have some how gotten a 4 star rating is incredulous ! This place is a DUMP ! And they have the nerve to try to scam the poor souls who have unwittingly booked a room at this hotel of horrors with extra charges !! Literally the bathrooms have holes in the walls where the rats must live ! In this disgusting flea bag hotel they supply no coffee maker or fridge but tell you at check in that they will gladly supply one if asked. They don't mention its at an additional expense. Stay away. Far far away. This is a 2 star at;1
This is the worst accommodation I have ever stayed in (that is considering that I am used to staying in hostels). The room smelt bad, there was constant noise coming from the plumbing and the interior of the room was extremely old and a bit dirty. We paid 500 USD for 3 nights and were extremely disappointed.;1

First of all, i have never wrote a review for a hotel before but after returning from this hotel i felt that i need to vent my frustration!!!!! I was really looking forward to this trip for my parters 30th. I originaly booked another hotel, then decided to upgrade to the Empire- I needed not bother! the welcoming reception staff was rude to say the least.  Extremely unhelpful.  got the keys to a tiny room, a 'single' which apparently i ordered!! you couldnt even walk around the bed.  the window faced a brick wall not 1.5 metres away!! I went to reception to complain and she told me that they would give me a 'courtesy upgrade' - UPGRADE MY EYE!!

"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. I stayed in a suite thinking I would have all of the amenities. No wifi, no hot water (ever). Shower leaked on the floor and the room itself was dark and the layout was awkward. Service was terrible (except for the bartender, Andrea.. she was fantastic). The hotel front desk was blatantly rude to the patrons and me. The ""club"" brought in some interesting characters. Elevators hardly ever worked. The hotel was run down and I was not impressed at all. The hotel staff were unapologetic and frankly, the level of service I expected to see was just not there. I don't think anyone I witnessed during my stay were impressed with the hotel or the staff (sans Ricky at front desk, Andrea, and one other person working behind";1

"I had a truly terrible experience at this hotel, and I am not very picky.  Beyond the teeny tiny rooms and the pipe in the bathroom that was so hot that it literally burnt my skin, the radiator was making horrible noises during the early morning hours and when I asked the front desk to do something about it they told me that later that day their ""engineer"" was going to have a look at it.  I told them that they could have whomever they wanted check it out, but that I didn't want to have to be awoken to it again.  When I called the front desk again that evening to make sure that it had been taken care of they assured me that it had and sure enough the very next morning at 4:30 it started clanking SO loud that it woke me up, again.

We paid 434$ for one nights stay in what can only be described as a shabby hotel. The reception staff were rude and unhelpfull. The room was substandard, even for New York. The airconditioning unit was noisy, making for an uncomfortable night. The only advice I can give is look for somewhere else to stay!!!!;1
Dirty carpets, air conditioner not working, and we got stock in the elevator! After our arrival we quickly told the manager about the dirty old carpets but they said they can not do anything about it. 90% of time the elevators did not worked!;1
We stayed here for 4 nights. Itâs not what it looks in the pictures, the front desk staff are not helpful and rude. We found a COCKROACH in our room and when we called to ask for assistance the the housekeeper came with a insect repellent spray by which time the cockroach had disappeared not to mention that the spray can was almost empty. The lady also didnât speak english so we were unable to communicate with her. We called front desk immediately to ask to change rooms to which they said they were fully booked for the next few nights. After a few hours we went directly to the front desk and expressed how upset we were and immediately they gave us a different room. In the process of moving, we left a pair of trainer under the bed and the next morning we informed them of this and;1

DON'T DO IT  From sheets only on our bed, to a door that didn't seal, the hotel was a disappointment to begin with.  Our heat didn't work and our window A/C unit poured in the freezing cold winter air.  We had to call and beg for blankets, and the bed itself was basically a half a step better than sleeping on the floor.  The third night there, which was Christmas Eve, we were startled to hear the sound of rain coming from our bathroom.  When we went to investigate, we saw (and smelt) brown water dripping from the ceiling.  Luckily, they were kind enough to relocate us, but we were put in a room that had cigarette burns in the sheets and unfinished walls with no curtains or blinds.    DON'T DO IT.;1
First of all, the room we were given didn't match the booking and when we tried to explain the situation to the hotel manager, we had to deal with a very aggressive gentleman who was disrespectful and confrontational.  Avoid at all cost;1

The hotel was extremely overpiced for what it offered.  Pictures on the website are very decieving.  The rooms smell musty, carpets are dark and dirty and rooms are extremely small you cant even keep your suitcase on the floor.   You need to enter the bathroom sideways as the door does not open completely due to the sink.  The staff are also extremely unhelpful and standoffish.- except for the concierge who was very nice. Overall, i would not recommend this hotel.  There are many nice hotels in central NY for this price.;1
Arrived around 19:30 local times after what felt like a week travelling. Queued to get out room key and then was greeted by the receptionist, really not the greeting I was expecting, very little greet at all just a simple 'welcome'. I proceeded to explain that it was my wife and I 10 year anniversary and we had chosen their hotel for our stay (no response) the receptionist proceeded to talk with her colleague. After getting our keys we were collared over to join club Wyndham - thanks for the offer but honestly I'd been travelling for hours on end, wasn't exactly the right time for that.  We booked through a travel agent online and it was made clear on the booking that it was our 10th plus I contacted the hotel before we arrived - on to that, so I tweet at the hotel, waits a day;1

"A friend and I went up to Los Angeles to see ""Hamilton"" and decided we'd splurge and spend the night. I researched Trip Advisor for a nice hotel that was somewhat near the theater. We stayed one night, on October 14th. Our room was on the 2nd floor. Of the 4 lamps in the room, only 2 of them worked. The mini refrigerator was turned on but wasn't cold. There was a metal cover on the ceiling of the shower that was rusting. The room definitely needed to be refurbished. The next morning, we got up and there were ants in the bathroom, coming out from beneath the tub. To say the least, we packed as quickly as we could and got out of there. When I checked out, I mentioned all of these items to the clerk, who wrote them down. I don't understand why this hotel got such positive reviews";1

Do not waste your time staying at a Wyndham property in New York City. Of all my years of travel, the rudest experience was at Wyndham properties. We were supposed to stay at another Wyndham property that was overbooked. My Mother-in-law booked with points and all the reviews were correct we came in at 11:30 at night. No rooms even though she confirmed with them that day we had rooms. Then we went to their sister property which they said we had for two nights. not true only one. We ended up having to pay. The managers were all rude every one of them. They treated us like dirt. Had to argue to get our rooms, and keep our rooms.

This is at least the fourth time staying at Empire for Fashion Week and by far it was the worst experience yet. The ONLY reason to return is its stellar Lincoln Center location.  We had reserved a room with two double beds for 3 ladies and this is by far the largest room we've had at this location. We actually had a closet with a door this time! Alas, there were no luggage racks and zero robes were provided. I had to order down for both of these standard amenities and to receive sufficient towels/washcloths for three guests. It took a long time for housekeeping to deliver those items.   Meanwhile, the air conditioning stopped and the room, which was quite warm to begin with on an 88 degree day, began to heat up. I couldn't even get the fan to work so once again I had to call;1

This 4 starts hotel can not deliver fork & knife to your room. âIf you really want them you can get them from the restaurant at the lobbyâ, thatâs exactly what they told me. I have talked to the room service manager but unfortunately he also couldnât make my simple order happen. Besides that, the room is not equipped with a water kettle and you can not have a hot cup of water delivered to your room.;1

Was there for WOBI Conference across the street at Lincoln Center. Didnât sleep a wink as the street noise from the 7th floor was as if we were actually on Broadway and not in an expensive hotel. Woke up to shower and get ready for the big first day and there was no water! Called the front desk, but they never picked up the damn phone! Went down to complain and they said they had no idea as they hadnât received a complaint. No kidding! You didnât answer the phone! Had to go to battle with management to get refunded. No one wants to unpack and then change hotels, but that is exactly what we did. The place is small, dark, and in need of maintenance. Front desk and door staff were polished, but it seems like they know the place kind of stinks. Too bad as itâs a great location. The;1
Save your money. This hotel offers literally nothing except location. Zero amenities, rude staff, small and dirty rooms, no controlled heat or airâ¦ worst hotel I have stayed at and it is NOT cheap. 2-3 stars on its BEST day!  Parts of the room were broken , non working or non existent. To top it off they charge you a $150 fee up front for incidentals but when asked- it is in case you damage the room! The room was damaged upon arrival! They say they release the funds later but still- there is no mini bar, coffee, room service- nothing!  Awful hotel;1

I was scheduled to arrive Saturday from another place near Hollywood. I wanted something near the airport. So i chose Hyatt, but i that was a huge mistake. Biggest and main complaint is parking. No where during my booking was I ever informed about parking costing $50 dollars. I was going to be staying here for 12 hours and am subjected to pay $50 dollars for parking. Awful, would not recommend. Employees attitude were dry and when I mentioned my issue with the parking situation I was essentially ignored.  I would not recommend this place. Find some place where they donât try and price gouge you for every little thing.;1
I generally don't write a bad review about any business until they cross the line..  So first impression about the hotel, I enter the lobby and there are so many people waiting there it feels like an airport, where people are just waiting with nothing to do. It's just dirty. I stand in the line for check in. It was a long 25 minute wait. my problem was that I was moving from a hotel from Long island City to the new Yorker and I just needed to keep my bags and get out because I had an event booking at 4 pm in Randall island. I came in at 1 pm since I was in the area. I asked them if I could just bring the bags and you could give me the room later, I didn't even need to see the room. But the receptionist said that they charge 5$ a bag as luggage storage fees and 50$ for early;1
My fiancÃ©e and I booked this hotel through budgetplaces.com in May 2016. We specifically wanted an ensuite/private bathroom and paid extra for this. We paid our deposit and considered it sorted.  We arrived for our three night stay at the very end of September 2016.  We arrived in a hurry (because we had yankee tickets booked) and were told that they no longer had our room available. They offered us a room with a shared bathroom- shared with 6 other rooms. We were shown a tiny unmade up room on a dark corridor with a bathroom that looked like something out of a horror film. I am seriously not a major snob, but I would not have set foot in that disgusting hole. We were obviously distressed but kept being told that they had 'given our room away'!

The poor service I received started via email well prior to arrival and did not improve.   1. I emailed advising I was arriving from an international flight, and having already read on their website that the hotel did not offer a shuttle service, I noted this in my email to them and asked for their local knowledge for alternate options.   The reply was one line advising me the hotel does not provide a shuttle service. Argh!   2. Fridge was locked (not sure why because it was completely empty) and apparently it is only unlocked on request of the guest. 24hrs later it was still locked and I had to request once again.   3. Housekeeper wasnât a pleasant person at all - despite my attempted positive engagement and pleasantries.   4. No free daily water left in my room - although;1
Cockroaches in the bedroom, the bathroom door didn't lock (not good when you have kids!) and then we came to find that someone had removed all our bedding and not replaced it! When we complained, house keeping just handed us the sheets and did not make up the bed! Hot tap gave cold water and vice versa. This is not a $50/night motel so I was very disappointed by the service as it was expensive.;1
The whole hotel smells awful the place is dark and dinghy, the walls are dirty, the pillows are like rocks and the bed has a hole in the center. And we got an up grade! Checking out too awful to stay.;1
Where do we start?  Well seeing as the hotel cancelled the booking 2 hours before landing st JFK without telling you, this is probably setting themselves up for a fall.  Arrive at check in desk and they said no you haven't got a room. Hand the guy paperwork, show him the booking.com reservation and he says oh, we've cancelled it. Don't know why and we now have no rooms.  Pulls a rabbit out of the hat and says I'll find one.  Then charges me Â£425 more than the booking plus a bond on the room on top. Low floor, small, very cramped room, very dated. Think 1940's art deco.  Service terrible from reception, everyone else fairly good.  We emailed the manager 3 times when there, twice when we got back a week later and nobody has replied as apparently cancelling rooms is the norm at The;1
I stayed at the empire for 2 days. My room was very, very small. It felt like living in a closet. The view was very bad, almost non existing.   When you first enter your room you are greeted by the hundreds of things they want to charge you for. It's very irritating. It feels like there's price tags on everything in the room.  The rooftop is supposed to have a cool bar, but I couldn't go up there, even though I was a guest of the hotel. This is mainly why I'm giving the hotel 1 star. If it wasn't for this I'd give a better rating.  I strongly recommend you to book a room at another hotel. For the same price you can get a much better hotel. I recommend the New York palace, it may be more expensive, but it's a hell of a lot better.;1

The bedroom was decent but the sheets didn't seem very clean because we woke up itchy with bites every morning. The staff who was supposed to greet us seemed to be under the influence & acting extremely ""slow"" & ""lost"" for getting to give my phone back.

We've made a reservation months in advance and we've never been notified about the rooftop pool being out-of-use. We found that out when we actually tried to go to the pool.  Room furniture was rather old and squeeky. It didn't feel clean at all. Smelly and torn sheets, etc.  The A/C in the room was the loudest piece of machinery I've ever seen. Including a V8 engine. When we told this to the front desk, we were told that they will be transferring us to another room, so they told us to pack and they would transfer the luggage, however after we packed up and leave, we were told that there was a mistake and they won't transfer us to another room. Wo we basically spent 4 hours to pack-up and unpack again. The staff was not friendly at all. So, I regret every moment staying there.;1

"it's a funny thing visiting NYC.  There is an old Turkish saying ""even with all your money, your still shamed"" I think it suffered a little in the translation. Bottom line is this place is a dump. When I and my family visit NYC yearly every Christmas from California we usually stay 10-14 days. As you can imagine 10-14 days in NYC can be brutal on just the hotel expenses. So as such when the midtown hotel prices got to high for us we gave this filthy place a shot.  1 hour after check in we checked out.  And to be honest with you were done with NYC until there is some kind of commitment on the part of the city to clean up their act. Bed bugs, roaches, filthy bedding, high prices? come on. The one thing you expect from a hotel is cleanliness, and when they are as filthy as this one";1
The bed was comfortable and staff was friendly. Being near Lincoln Center is great but not if you are staying at the Hotel Empire. We stayed in Room 141, which we think was formerly the broom and mop closet. It was shockingly small as compared to similar hotels in NYC! The room had a small desk with a simple chair, bed and one bed side table (a second one would not fit in the room).There was a tad more than a foot from the bed to the wall resulting in my friend and I constantly banging our knees and toes.  Our average size luggage was on the desk chair and floor -there was no real space for our luggage and the luggage racks we requested never were delivered despite being requested. Loud noises from bathroom pipes were sporadic. Paint on the walls was chipping. The wallpaper was;1
So far not so good!  Just got to the hotel, there was no one at the front desk and not busy in the lobby!  I waited 5 min for someone to notice me at the desk and when I finally got someone's attention he wasn't costumer friendly!  We'll see, not impressed so far!;1

We were at Universal studios all day,  checked in later in the evening.  My daughter was having problems with asthma, so we were anxious to settle her in.  The lobby at first glimpse was very nice.  On the way up to our room we realized that the hotel was less than clean.  Huge stains on the ceiling and hall carpeting.  On entering the room, we very disappointed at how shabby and worn it was.  The carpet was soiled, and rippling.  The furnishings ""well used"".  The bed coverings were lumpy, bedding thin and well used. At first we thought the beds hadn't been changed.

I said ok . She handed over to the keys to me . I was shocked that she didn't explain anything to me about the hotel so I asked her : where is the breakfast area ?

Old, tired, dingy, dark badly lit hallways and rooms once you are off the ground floor. No ability to control air or heat in room, no drawers except for small 2 inch deep drawer in end tables, not even a coffee machine since there is no room service or restaurant. Paint is cracked and peeling in the bathrooms.  The roof top restaurant is not part of the hotel.  Great location but for the money...absolutely awful.  One caveat is the employees, both front desk and service personnel.  They were great, always smiling and happy to help if they could. Too bad they have so little to work with.  Next time I would give up the location for a decent room and a cup of coffee in the morning.;1

I stand between posts 6C and 6D to make sure I can easily go to 6C or 6D depending on where the shuttle stopped.  I then used my phone to call Hyatt to ask what color their shuttle was.  While on the phone, a shuttle labeled white and purple was on the far lane and did not even go to the curbside near 6C and was ready to past 6D until I had to run to the third lane to signal the driver to pick me up. By the way, I had three luggages with me. So you can imagine how hard it is to leave the;1

I always travel alone. Thatâs why I have to choose relatively cheaper hotel, in this case, Jane Hotel. The room was VERY small and had bad smell in the hallway. I typically donât mind size. But this one was really made me uncomfortable. And itâs so noisy at night. On top of those issue, I got bed bug bites. My left arm was swollen half of my stay, which was not acceptable. The one star was for friendly staffs. But over all, it was the most hotel experience EVER.;1

We stayed at the Astor on the Park for two days and found the facilities basic but acceptible for the budget end of the market. Rooms very small. Very far uptown though for almost any attractions. Our main problem came when we when we packed for checkout and found that a new bottle of cologne was missing from the room. At the reception desk the most they offered to do was question maintenance staff and the maids that had been in the room. We never got the impression that they took the stolen item as genuine. With the manager away I was told to call when I arrived back home in the UK. I did and the manager agreed to refund to my card but I still haven't received my money back. No in room safes so be sure to watch your valuables if you stay here. I would not take the risk.;1
Front desk staff are RUDE,  they just don't care. They have charged me for a service  that I did not have.

The Jane is very cheap- no doubt about that.  Location is good, lobby and bar are cute.  That's where the positive aspects end.    Stayed in a room with bunk beds and tiny doesn't even begin to describe the space.  It was about 4x9 and my friend and I could hardly be in the room at the same time except to sleep.  What little room there is happens to be very well designed.  Don't ask me how they got the bunk beds in there.  There are shared bathrooms, which is fine if you don't mind that kind of thing.  However, there are still semi-homeless people living there and the conversion from a single occupancy hotel (SRO) is still underway.    For the price, there really are other options.

I was supposed to stay there with my family this weekend. I got sick and was unfortunately not able to go. I could have gone anyway and gotten the other guests and hotel employees sick but I care about others. The hotel refused to refund my money. It's obvious they don't care about other's health and well being.;1
Spent a week at this hotel and was really disappointed so much so one of the first things I did was to email the manager but not even had an acknowledgment from her.  I also completed the online survey early yesterday.     Anyway, here is my honest review.  We arrived early, as our original flights had been cancelled, when I say early it was a maximum of two hours earlier than we would have got our rooms.   I had asked for two rooms together via email before we left the Uk and was told they would try and arrange it.  We arrived only to find nothing had been done about my request.  The receptionist informed me we could have one room but would have to pay $25 plus taxes to have it two hours earlier.  After a very long 24 hours I agreed.   He then managed to swap this room with;1
My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights. Loved the hotel, the room was even smaller than expected but still it had character. Shared washroom was clean and nice. Loved the location. However, I too encountered bed bags - I am covered in bites, at least 30. Never considered it could be bed bugs, spoke to the person at the desk when we checked out and he indicated they have had no cases for years so thought maybe it was something that came in the window. I have now been home for 4 nights and I can't sleep because of the itching!! I did some more research and realized that it has to be bed bugs. Luckily I suspected that so washed everything at home. Seriously hope I didn't bring any back with me because these bites are driving me crazy!! Unfortunately this has turned the trip of a;1

"I booked this hotel on their website for Dec. 2014. I received 2 confirmation emails, appearing that they had booked me twice. When I tried to cancel one of the rooms on the website, there is no way to do this. So I called the direct number, where I was placed on hold for over 20 minutes with the reservation department. So I called the 800 number, where they could not find either reservation, even with the confirmation numbers sent by the hotel! Back to the direct hotel number, where I chose the operator selection, finally got a live voice, and was able to cancel. Needless to say , I cancelled both rooms, no way am I going to stay at a hotel with this poor of ""Prestay"" service. I made sure I got the name of the person who cancelled for me, just in case I get charged in";1

Stayed in this hotel for a couple of days July 2012. I travel often and must say that i have never never experienced a hotel with such a bad service level. Will never stay there again and can only recommend to all of you to find another hotel. This is not because I compare to other hotels at the same level... this is much worse that any cheap motel/hotel you can find!;1

The attitude of the staff is very poor.  The transport desk girl is often away and cant be bothered to tell you when your taxi turns up because it comes early so she sends it away.  She cant be bothered to tell you so you hang around waiting for over half an hour needlessly.  Very sniffy attitude from the restaurant table booking.  Exceedingly expensive shop inside and a concession style jewellery salesman who targets every woman as they walk by.  Wet beds on arrival. Very dated hotel. Nice bathroom, awful shower.;1
- We were ignored by the staff several times. They were more interested in talking to eacother. At the end we gave up asking them anything. - They didn't want to call a restaurant for making a reservation for us. - Three times the staff laughed at us, they thought we asked stupid questions. - We didn't see a single smile all week. - The door to the room had a big gap all way around, so we could see people walking in the hallway from our bed. - The bed was old and made noises so it was difficult to sleep. - The high speed internet was not high speed, and there were no internett access in the room. - Four elevators, but still we had to wait about 10 min each time we were going to use one of them, and it always stopped in the wrong floor.;1
"Stayed four nights in February. The only reason to consider this hotel is that it is about three minutes walk from the Vermont-Wishire metro stop, which was convenient for our group with suitcases. And our rate was $100 per night + taxes.  But the front desk staff was not very excited about helping with questions, and seemed overworked.  Rooms were barely OK. Fairly big, but worn (the carpet was peeling up at the bathroom line, etc).  And if you are inclinded to worry about the supernatural, we were told that the hotel basement (where the breakfast is served) used to be a morgue! The more I considered this, the more I believed it. There are no readily visible stairways from the basement, and it is very gloomy.  Then there is the free ""Comedy Night"". I was one of only three sorry";1
Didnât know there was a fire on our floor until the firemen starting knocking on guest doors. Had to huddle in room until they got it out. No word or discount from management. At least we werenât physically injured.;1
We went because of the location but after a few days that wasn't enough to justify the hotel.  To start with only half the elevators worked at any time and the waits were 5 minutes or longer to get one.  We tried to take the stairs, but discovered the second floor is 4 stories up a dingy unmarked stairway.  The rooms are nice enough but be careful of the showers.  The rain shower head washes you and the bathroom floor, so be careful you don't slip.  Plus if you request turn down service don't expect to get towels for the morning, that happened to us twice. They took the wet towels and left the two of us with one towel for bathing and washing.  The rooms do not have coffee pots, we were told to go to the street vendors outside for our morning coffee. We went to Starbucks at the;1
Went to New York to celebrate my birthday. We booked a room for our 11 night stay, 6 months in advance, but when we arrived we were told the booking had been cancelled. Ms Kim who was working that evening did nothing to accomodate us, and insisted we send her our confirmation to prove we had made the booking and that it was still current.  Worst hotel staff -  they didn't appear interested, they were not friendly, and were all less than helpful. They would have personal conversations whilst you waited to be served.  Room rate -  was incorrect, we had to speak to various hotel staff members daily for 7 days before it was sorted out, and upon checking out the changes had not been saved, so we had to go through the whole invoice from scratch. Not a relaxing experience at all, and I;1
This was such a horrible experience . We came here for our baby moon. The pictures on the website showed images of a beautiful suite so I booked my suite for about 600 dollars a night. When we arrived the room looked nothing like the pictures. The room had a 1950s bathroom, was old, had no cable and did not have the amenities as deceptively depicted on their website.  I went to the front desk for assistance . They tried their best to place me in a better room however the rooms that were shown on the internet were unavailable . I was so dissapointed I called corporate for further assistance however they were absolutely useless I will never ever stay at a Wyndham hotel in my life. Poor business strategy overall on their part because they lose potential life long customers willing;1
"This may be the worst hotel I ever stayed in.  Since it is a Days Inn I had low expectations to begin with but they managed to not even live up to them.  The room they gave us was not on a hotel floor but was in an emergency stairwell.  I filed a complaint with the NYC Building Department as there is a question if that is even legal.  They advised that in 2014 this hotel had numerous safety violations including improper fire stops.  The room itself was terrible.  Nothing like the pictures.  When we showed the picture to the front desk clerk and asked, ""Where is this room?"" she laughed and said, ""Oh we don't have any rooms that look like that.""  The bed was horrible, towels in the bathroom were not clean, and the mold on the window blinds was disgusting.  The bathtub had an old";1

Room 2260: Everything was dirty and moldy in the bathroom! There weâre large stains on the carpet and on the chair. Absolutely disgusting!!    Facility fee: what was it for?! No one at the Front Desk could explain. They just said: âevery guest has to pay it.â No information at all about that before arriving at the hotel (reservation via Booking.com). We feel screwed!!  We asked for a Baby crib weeks before arriving - no answer at all! It seemed weâve been lucky that there was one available upon our arrival. Front Desk Staff tricked us with strange facility fee. Housekeeping staff seemed not to be operating at all. The whole floor in the room was a dirty mess.  Definitely will NOT recommend this place.

The hotel room was small, but the price was right.   As an AOL user, I left my computer on for hours, believing this Ramada offered free local calls, as most Ramada's do.  There was no announcement anywhere (by telephone, in hotel portfolio, or on contract at check-in) that there was a 10 cent per minute local phone charge.  The manager (Roman Baranov) could not have cared less about my situation, and actually said that I should have used the Internet the Ramada provides at a $10 per day charge instead.  He could have waived the charge ($220 for two local phone calls), but he refused.   The deceptive, hidden charges, and bad management,  make me never want to stay at another Ramada again!   Too many other hotel choices, anywhere in the world, to put up with Ramada's indiferrence;1

My room was disgusting -- filthy headboard, rusted towel racks in the bathroom, grime in the shower, and old/musty smell. I was really disappointed because the building is my style (art deco and vintage) and I do love the vintage fixtures, however my room was just so gross. The room had no amenities --  no fridge, no microwave, no coffee machine. The cups in the room are plastic. I felt like I was at a roadside motel in 1980.;1
Firstly on arrival we went to investigate the roof-top pool. It was closed. We asked the concierge why, who told us they had maintenance problems last week and didn't know when it would be open again. Very disappointing as we chose this hotel for the pool deck. And NO pre warning when we could have changed hotels. Seems pre existing per TripAdviser also in June. No apologies just fact sir it's closed.    We asked room service to send up some glasses to our room. Housekeeping told us they could only provide paper cups. Not glass. We have a minibar in our room and we are expected to drink wine and spirits out of paper cups?! I called again to ask for glasses and was told that room service would provide them at 6.15pm. My husband went to the bar and asked for the glasses and was;1
My fiancÃ© and I were staying at the Empire Hotel for an exciting first trip together in Nee York City. We were making love in the afternoon and even though we had a sign on the door for privacy, a male worker walked in. I was completely exposed and naked in the middle of our very intimate moment. I looked up, had eye contact and screamed at the man to get out. My fiancÃ© said the same. The worker closed the door and then my fiancÃ© got dressed and went downstairs to the front desk. I felt embarrassed, violated to be seen in such a naked and intimate, private moment. The hotel manager apologized to him, gave him a bottle of wine & 2 free drinks later at the bar. This did not make up for my emotional trauma. I would assume a hotel like this would at least offer a comp of a night or;1

The light fitting was hanging off the wall with no bulb in it, and had been connected loosely by a wire to a desk lamp which has been stuck to a mirror. It was a hazard waiting to happen. The bathroom also was not clean with hair in the shower tray. P2 offered me a cloth to clean the stray pubes from the shower tray. He also said that the customer yesterday had pulled the light bulb out and that was the reason for the dodgy work. Didnât believe a word of it and would bet money that dodgy;1
We have used Priceline for years and never had a problem with hotels.  This hotel was by the far The worse hotel we have ever stayed at.  After having trouble finding the room, after going thru hallway after hallway and having to smell this horrendous odor in the hall we finally found our room.  We opened  the door and couldn`t believe how disgusting this room was.  1st of all, it was the size of a big closet.  The furniture in there was so old that the wood was coming off it.  The rugs were disgustingly dirty and the dust on the carpet was inhabitable. There was no way we were going to spend a night in this disgusting room.  To the hotels credit, we immediately went down to the front desk and yes, they did change our room to a newly renovated king size room.  That room was very;1
We arrived at this hotel after a month of travelling the US. We had booked the hotel using a prepaid travel money card and when we arrived to check in the hotel advised they do not accept this as payment - depsite accepting it when we booked!!!!  I spoke to the Manager and his response was find another way to pay or go to another hotel!!!!! All our money was on the card and we had our very tired 18 month old son with us - after a screaming match payment was finally accepted. The front desk staff member laughed during the heated conversation and could not have cared less!!  The staff here are VERY RUDE, UNHELPFUL and I would not recommend anyone staying here.

Arrived to be given a basement room with one small window looking on to a grubby dirty void full of rubish. Room was dark, depressing and very very small. I asked to be moved but was told that it was not possible until the morning. Tired and fed up I went to bed only to be kept awake most of the night by a strange clanking noise  coming from pipework outside the window.  The next day I demanded to be moved and was given a room on the 4th floor. This room was bigger and had a view of the park, but the window frame was broken and the window had dropped and so did not fully close which meant apart from the fact that it was letting in the cold  (5 degrees F outside) it was also noisey from the traffic on the main road (even 4 floors up). Additionally the central heating did not;1
We pre-paid for a December NYC trip to see the city at Christmas and attend shows. BIG mistake. We were not allowed to check in until 8:30pm on our arrival day. We kept getting different stories from management about why this was, and one of the excuses was guests doing very late checkouts. (when I inquired about a late checkout on our departure day, they told us it was 1pm which is only an extra hour. so, New Yorker management, how late were these other guests allowed to stay...)It was incredibly inconvenient because we had dinner reservations but no place to change clothes, use the restroom etc. The worst part was that management made NO effort to remedy the situation or compensate us for our trouble. The rooms we were promised were not what was delivered. Not much of a view;1

They advertise a pool but check that it has water in it at the time you have booked for. Wasn't in use when I was there even though it was hot. All the staff that rely on tips are absolutely delightful.  The others are fair to woeful.  My new room's air-conditioning was hot in the night and freezing during the day.

"This hotel was booked for my sisters 40th Birthday. When we arrived at the hotel, we were upgraded to a ""penthouse"" room due to the occasion. Do not be fooled by booking a renovated room because it's not worth the price you pay. The rooms are very small, although very clean but are old rooms with noisy radiators that making hissing air noises all night and the heat out of the is unreal. Despite staying in January when some nights it was -7 degrees outside the room was far too warm. We contacted reception for the heating to be turned off. Lewis the engineer came to the room and advised us he has now turned the heating off so that no heat would be in the room and all noises would stop. Lewis did nothing, he had no tools with him. It took us 5 requests to get the heating to the";1
While the hotel overall is nice and located in a good area, we were dissatisfied with the size of the room and the air conditioning/heating.  The hotel is old and the pipes are old.  This is the excuse we heard from the front desk for our entire visit.  We even recorded how loud the noises were in our room from the pipes and we were told nothing could be done.  If you want a good night's rest after a busy day in New York, this is probably not the place for you.  When I say the rooms were small, it was the smallest room I've ever stayed in and it was supposedly a Deluxe King Room.  Won't be back to this hotel unfortunately.;1

We booked our stay at the Morningside Inn using Hostel Times.  The inn looked okay when we got there and we checked in using the reservation slip that we printed from Hostel Times.  The reservation slip specifically said that we had to pay whatever was outstanding minus the deposit we had made.  When we got to check in, we were told that the deposit was taken by Hostel Times and we had to pay tax on top of the deposit we had already paid.  Being newbies, we thought this was probably the case and paid everything as we were told.  BUT when we went to another hostel in Boston booked using the same hostel times, what we paid was what was listed in the reservation slip.  No additions.  No bull [--] about how hostel times takes MY deposit.  Geez.  Don't get conned.    When we finally;1
"Ridiculous. I booked a room and canceled it almost immediately using Booking.com and the charged me for the full price if the room.

My son and I stayed for two nights. Room 824, the beds and bathroom were clean and thatâs it. The carpets were sticky, dust and fluff under the beds, noisy air con which had the red light on indicating the filter was blocked, The basin in the bathroom was cracked and the whole place is very, very tired. The entrance is really on 94th street not Broadway which, as advertised, is a bit deceiving and itâs a long, long walk from all the sights.;1

Birthday celebration trip to New York were marred by poor service, noisy air con, tired hotel which claims to be 4 star but isnât. Itâs a great location but overpriced for what it has to offer.  Bathroom shower was poor & dilapidated, hot water was variable- breakfast at $25 was poor and much better available outside of the hotel.;1
What a missed opportunity by management to ensure customers are happy.  I am a long time traveler and can't believe how poorly we were treated after the NYC water department turned off the water in our hotel.  There was no offer of a free night, nor free anything--well except the manager said we he would not charge us for the bottled water we drank.  Wow, thank you...  As a side note, the housekeeper staff are awesome as were the bellhops.;1
This hotel has only one thing going for it . . . location.  Rooms were smelly, bathroom not attached or clean, and hallway felt like  I was living out a Hollywood B movie. Reminded me of a hotel in northern Uganda I stayed in a few years ago for $5 a night . . . and that was overpriced.;1

Good location, but the hotel is sadly in need of an overhaul. Chipping paint, doors that looks as though they have been bashed in, dark, lights were so dim I couldn't see in the bathroom.

The front desk staff were rude and very unhelpful. The television in our room did not work due to a poor internet connection and there was mold in the shower. Housekeeping was extremely slow to makeup the room daily.;1

I am a world traveler and this was honestly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie. I have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel. The lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent, but this is all a lie. As soon as you get off the elevator to your room, the hallway is dim, carpets are old, walls need painting, and it smells musty. The rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned. The bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay, there was hardly any counter space above the sink, and they;1
"The list of pros about this hotel is short: great location and fantastic breakfast.  As for the cons; The entire property is severely worn down, with dirty carpets, cracks in the ceilings and peeling wallpaper. When we first came into the room, we noticed how worn down it was, but half the outlets also did not work, so we had to go down to the reception who then fixed it. Not long after, we noticed that there were ants crawling EVERYWHERE. In the beds even!  When we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room, but since we felt it was simply just too disgusting to stay in, we were moved to a new room, that only had a couple of visible ants.  The entire time we were dealing with getting a new room, the employee of the hotel was extremely";1

I would normally not complain about a hotel experience but I think this one deserves a review.  My husband and I booked this hotel for two nights while we were in LA in March 2011 with intentions to book a few additional nights.  After our first night we realized that this hotel was not up to Hilton standards and the two night stay was more than enough.  When we arrived we began our check in process and found the front desk person to be really rude.  After waiting for almost a half hour to check to our room, which we booked online, we were advised that our room was not ready and to come back in an hour.  Once we returned we were assigned to our room and realized that we were given two double beds instead of the king that we requested in our original reservation.  We decided not;1

"I have stayed at the Empire many times over the years and have always been treated with kindness and respect.  This summer I was coming to New York for three full week, one of which I spent at the Belleclaire Hotel (which I would return to next time), a reservation booked by someone else.  I couldn't wait; I would be at the Empire for 13 days!  How wonderful that would be! I would be a two week resident! This time, my room was dark and wet,(a wall leak), the bathroom door wouldn't close, my wifi was ""iffy"" and the shower was not working well.  All of which I could overlook and did let staff know.  Staff was nice but I didn't check my bill when I checked out and something I didn't realize that the 2 cent Keurig cups were not complimentary.   I was charged over $32 for crappy";1
Came here hopig for nice vacations, but the hotel is just bad. Terrible shower temperature, very hot or very cold and constantly changing on it's own. There's an alarm that was set for 6 am, we never asked for that since it's a holiday trip, when I asked about that they just said that it must have been the previous guest (so how much do they check the rooms between guests?) But it was a lie since it happened again the next day. The worst part is that the bed has a SHARP broken spring that almost cut my leg, fortunately it was just a scratch. Would never come back;1
We stayed at his hotel for one night in november 2007.All the other hotels were booked for that night. This hotel(if we can call it an hotel??!!),is the most DISCUSTING, DIRTY, NOISY, UNPLEASANT, SCARY, HORRIBLE SERVICE, UNCONFORTABLE HOTEL we have ever experienced in our life. We are not picky travellers, we travel a lot  and in a very simple and cheap way. But, for the price you pay, seriously, that place is a real JOKE. It looks ok from the outside.But from the inside....It is another story. There was one bathroom, and very small and sooooo dirty, for ALL the rooms on our floor!!! That means one bathroom for around 15 rooms!!!! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, STAY AT A YOUTH HOSTEL if you are looking for something cheap. AND DON'T GO THERE if you wanna enjoy your trip to New-York city!!;1

Terrible location, in the Chinatown. Not a very safe area. Expedia had it listed as in SoHo (they have since corrected). The bedroom was small, smelly, had a TV that was at least 20 yrs old.

My name is Eddy Schoeters. I'm 58 years old. I've traveled extensively in Europe, Russia, Asia, Southern and Northern America. Since the US is one of our favorite destinations, we decided this year to revisit Philadelphia, Washington and to end the trip, as always, in NY. This is the first time - ever - that we'll be glad to leave NY. The reason for this is the hotel, The Jane. My wife and I stayed 4 nights: 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 May 2012. After our first day of visiting NY, we came back to room 214 and found the glasses we used the night before still standing dirty on the table, the bathtub wasn't cleaned and there were only two small towels left. We told the reception and they provided us with a clean set of towels. That night the music coming from the party-room below was so;1
I booked this hotel in November, taking the time to speak to someone on the phone and booking as such.  I made it clear that I needed a suite with 2 bathrooms and a kitchenette area.  We had 4 adults and a teenager in our party.  The room they gave us first, had one bathroom and hardly enough room to move around in.  I made it clear that this was NOT what I booked.  They then gave us a room with 2 bathrooms.  There was no kitchenette area - not even a coffee maker.  When the sofa was pulled out, it took up the entire sitting area.  The paint was chipping off of the doors and the hinges were all rusted.  The room was unbelievably drafty!  When I called to speak to a manager, he told me that I was already upgraded at no charge and there was nothing more he could do.  This was NOT;1

If youâre booking this hotel through a third party such as Expedia/Priceline expect hidden fees to be added. I was told I had to pay $100 a night at check in on top of the amount I already paid. Very frustrating as I had bags and wasnât easily able to switch hotels at that point. The rooms are small and outdated and unappealing. I ended up checking out early to move to another hotel.;1
No air conditioning first night, new room was being cleaned so we missed part of our show second night, broken outlet was not repaired, no hot water on morning of our departure. Camping in the city. I think they have done this before. I overheard someone being transferred out of our room from the first night for no air conditioning. Nice pictures online. And pool was out of order. That was reason we booked in first place.  Great location though.;1

Not enough words in the review to explain my disappointment with this hotel so I have screenshot my Google review. Staff unfriendly, elevators an absolutely nightmare. 20 mins to wait for one as only 3 out of 6 or 7 were working. No signs to say some were not working and I was there for a full week. Had to take the staff elevator or take the stairs as there were no covid restrictions. Staff too bothered about showing your hotel card to get to the elevator then to be helpful of any kind. Tick tock diner was a nightmare in the end. Ignorant rude staff. I was thrown a check at me and told to pay at the counter which is absolutely not protocol. I always thought the people in the UK(as a UK resident)  were generally rude people but experiencing the new yorker, wow my opinion has;1
I booked for three nights at Woogo Central Park Apartments. The first problem was that the staff didnÂ´t show up at the reception until 20 minutes after my arrival. When the lady on duty finished smoking a cigarrete outside in the street, I could make the check-in and see the terrible rooms they run. The first thing I noticed was that the doors donÂ´t have any lock, so it is easy to open them with a strong pushing.  Afterwards, the floor was full of bead scrumbs around the kitchenette and a group of ants were  around the mess. AWFUL. But the most disgusting thing was the toilet. Nobody had cleaned it before my arrival, so I found hairs over the shower floor, dirty washbasin, and the toilet hadnÂ´t been flushed since the last customer,.....ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. Then, I decided NOT;1

"After traveling over 36 hours via plane we arrived at Park West Hotel late Friday evening. I was looking forward to taking a nice hot shower and getting rest for the night. When we entered the building, I wouldnât say the front desk person was rude, it just felt like we inconvenienced him with our arrival. Getting simple questions like, âWhatâs the access code for WiFi?â seemed like a hassle. â I booked the hotel and paid for it (via hotels.com) prior to arriving. He asked for a credit card for incidentals; I noticed a sign on counter that mentioned a required $19.99 âresort feeâ per day for a mid day snack, international newspapers and 2 complimentary Fiji bottled water (which, might I add wasnât even in the room) none of which we wouldâve used with our mere midnight arrival so";1

Avoid this hotel at all costs.  It is shockingly bad and not remotely as advertised.  No bar, no restaurant so no room service or breakfast.  No coffee or tea facilities in the rooms.  Room as not cleaned once during 3 night stay.  When I requested a room clean I was informed that rooms don't get cleaned every day.  The entrance to the hotel is closed and under plastic wrapping and the reception is disgusting.  The reception staff don't care but i guess it isnt their fault.  Its not like the hotel is cheap either.  The pictures on the website are not a reflection of this hotel.  It's like a down market hostel.;1
Stay there for 1 night but itâs was my worst ever stay in a hotel. Itâs noisy and nasty. You can here the heater ,the water draining in the pipe and people walking and talking in the hallway. Itâs not worthy $40 a night. Terrible,terrible and terrible;1

I generally don't write a bad review about any business until they cross the line..  So first impression about the hotel, I enter the lobby and there are so many people waiting there it feels like an airport, where people are just waiting with nothing to do. It's just dirty. I stand in the line for check in. It was a long 25 minute wait. my problem was that I was moving from a hotel from Long island City to the new Yorker and I just needed to keep my bags and get out because I had an event booking at 4 pm in Randall island. I came in at 1 pm since I was in the area. I asked them if I could just bring the bags and you could give me the room later, I didn't even need to see the room. But the receptionist said that they charge 5$ a bag as luggage storage fees and 50$ for early;1
Have never experienced such a poor service. Were told that making the beds were not a part of the cleaning and the cleaning personel did not even enter our room to remove carbage or provide clean towels for four days.  Moreover, the pool was closed for a longer period, without warning or anything. I do not know why the personel was there. It was NOT to provide even the basic service expected from a hotel in this price range.;1
Finally decided to give this place a try after years of walking by.  Man oh man, what a mistake.  Yikes is the only word that comes to mind.  I do give them credit for attempting to create a chic modern look in lobby and other public spaces but without basic maintenance & proper upkeep what's the point?  For the excellent location & upmarket surrounding businesses there are simply no excuses for a dirty and indeed nasty interior.  I simply cannot believe the prices that this hotel charges for the subpar service and environment offered.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  Below picture is demonstrative of the condition of the entire property...;1

Do not choose this hotel if you require internet access.  I stay in 20-30 hotels a year in the US, Europe and Middle East and haven't encountered the phoney wifi problem in a couple of years.  That's when the hotel offers dial up dial speeds that are too slow even for email, while claiming to offer hi-speed Internet access. Apparently, the Empire Hotel still thinks they can get away with this scam. I'd add one other thing: Don't stay here if you need a bit of quiet. The mechanical systems are quite loud.   Regards, S;1
We made a last minute online booking for 1 night as our accommodation had fallen through after 29hrs in transit & needed somewhere to rest & make a plan. We paid USD$240. I would barely even give it 1 star.. worst hotel I have ever stayed in! Not worth $240. The only positive, was the bathroom was clean. The bed was awful, it was noisy from street/business noise. No blankets or heating (only aircon) - it was the coldest Iâve ever been, so we got no sleep. Body heat from my husband was the only way we kept warm. The free wifi was not working on our floor - & 2 calls to reception was no help. The room was so run down. Wallpaper peeling off. No curtains, only thin blinds which lit up the room with daylight early. The lobby looked ok, but was a whole different look in the room. The;1

It may be because we booked through a website for last minute travelers that we ended up in such a tiny dark room that looked out onto other hotel rooms across the way.  The size of the room didn't bother me - I'm used to NYC's small hotel rooms but the room was just very depressing. The poor lighting in the room contributed to the dungeon-like quality, the furniture was in need of updating.   The few open surfaces in the room were filled with items for sale - 2 $7 bottles of water and a tray of over-priced mini-bar items.  The in-room coffee that you expect to be free costs $3!  Worst of all the air conditioner was so noisy it kept me awake till I finally turned it off and then the room was uncomfortably warm.  When I turned the AC back on it seemed more tolerable - or maybe I;1
I am not sure how this hotel was rated as a three- or four-star hotel. They are clearly a two star hotel. This place is not what is shown in the pictures released by the hotel. This place is dilapidated. On top of that they have very, very bad customer service and they do not pickup the telephone. I had to call four times and each time the telephone continuously rang. The front desk staff all say they are the onsite manager to derail you from complaining to the manager. The housekeeping staff talk loudly in the halls as they clean.   I reserved a Queen bed and was vehemently told there were no rooms other that two double beds. I later asked a women who signed in after me an hour later if she had a queen bed and the women said yes.   They have very small rooms, not electrical;1
This hotel should be classified as a motel. They try to sell you false hope in the entry, but when you get up to the floors for the rooms they are in bad shape, dusty, paint peeling off walls, showers in poor condition, floors with dirt build up. The rooms smell of dust. Retraining for the housekeepers needs to done.   Their customer service at their front desk also needs to be improved, trying to double bill me for items I had already paid for and when I tried to explain it, I was yelled at and treated like a child and was not given an apology when they saw they made a mistake.    If you call housekeeping and no one answers donât call the front desk, it will take them forever to answer, but on top of that they can not connect you to housekeeping or assist, I was told to call;1

I called front desk to ask for more cream, he said he would send it right up, well I'm home and still waiting. Same with more coffee on Tuesday. Just to let you know their fridges are on timers so if you use them you should know they will shut off, so don't go and buy stuff that will spoil easily.

This hotel chain is a ripoff.  They overbook and then send you somewhere else (while this was happening to us, they sent other families elsewhere - which is ONE reason why it took so very long for them to sort it out).;1
The only positive I can describe about this hotel is the beds that were very big and comfy.   Cons:   - The area is awful, rough, scary, whatever you want to call it, very unsafe. When we checked in a junkie from the street made their way into the lobby screaming which was very unsettling. - The receptionist Gisele had a bad attitude, bearing in mind we're British tourists who had never been to America/LA and simply asked if the Subway was safe to use she went on the defence immediately for some reason and was also very snappy and unhelpful about explaining the deposit. There seems to be a lot of bad reviews about her particularly on here, lose the attitude, it doesn't look good. - Beautiful view from our room of a 'family clinic'... - Small pool which is next to the car park;1
"Stayed here on a one-night trip to NYC, 12/15/2011-12/16/2011. Basically this place has terrible climate and plumbing control, amounting to a huge hassle and disappointment.  1) Our first room was on the 11th (top) floor, and it didn't take long for us to realize it was SWELTERING in there! Despite pawing around for thermostat and other temperature controls, we could not find the control for the heating unit. Upon calling the front desk, we spoke with an engineer who came up to the room and explained that since we were on the top floor, we were getting all the radiant heat from ""all the steam pipes"" above us on the roof. He said there was nothing that could be done, except move us to another floor.  Our only other options were the 4th floor (designated ""SMOKING"" - really? in the";1
The room was tiny, the bathroom was impossible to use, complaine on linking toilet was not fixed for three days (the entire time I spend there), and the staff was indifferent. The only good thing was the proximity to Times Square ,but the surrounding area of the hotel was full of homeless and junkies.;1
Was supposed to stay five nights at this hotel, but after the first night found another hotel for the remaining four nights.  The rooms are dingy and small.  My room filled up with cigarette smoke which persisted most of the night.  In the morning there was no hot water in the shower no matter how long I ran it for.  Mercifully the water pressure was so poor I didn't get that wet anyway.  The location is good and the bed was small but comfortable.  If you are lucky with the location of your room, you get a good view of the Empire State Building.;1

First of all we got to the hotel in the evening  weekend of Columbus Day and although we had ordered a room in advance through booking.com the hotel claimed that we haven't booked a room at all, after we presented the order confirmation, they simply said that the order was canceled for this night. After we talked with booking.com, it  turned out that the hotel just made overbooking so we were stuck without a room for the night. t The reception was just disgusting and unprofessional, they do not even attempted to help us.  The next day we got the room, the first impressions of this hotel are that the decor is tired, the lobby furniture worn and the whole place looks like it needs brought up to date. The elevators barely worked and  we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes, each;1

Overpriced for the accommodations.  Staff was unfriendly (Wendy & Roslyn) and rude.  The room was very small and dirty.  When we initially made the reservations were told we could have a rollaway bed since it was three of us.  Upon arrival, we were told it was a fire hazard to have a rollaway in the room.  Sent us to another room with 1 standard bed and a pullout...the room was filty.  We declined that room and kept the initial room.  The refrigerator brought to our room was dirty.  The toilet was broken.  The tub looked like it had been walked in with black-soled shoes.  Our door would not lock unless slammed several times.  Had to keep requesting additional towels & washcloths.  Elevators were extremely small (the ones that actually worked)!  Hallways and stairs were filthy.;1

"When a hotel's in a great location, it's easy to overlook things like ridiculously slow elevators, room keys that consistently demagnetize (regardless of how close/far they were from my phone), dingy lighting and peeling paint, but cockroaches are a whole other story. I discovered two in my room -- on the 29th floor -- during my one night stay. Both were a healthy 2"", well beyond grabbing a piece of toilet paper and taking them out. I mentioned the cockroaches when I checked out and got a blank stare back from the receptionist, as if to say, ""Can I help you with anything else?""

"It was the smallest hotel ""room"" I have ever seen in my life.  We check in around midnight, which may explain why we put on the ground floor (my friend was along the corridor).  The room obviously hadn't been used for some time, the sheets were all musty (luckily I had bought my own pillowcase).  The TV didn't work, the subway appeared to run under the hotel (at first I thought it was a rock band practicing), couldn't get the shower to work (scalded my hand) - would have checked out straight away but my friend would have been upset and she couldn't afford to move.  We were moved to the 6th floor, her room was slightly larger, mine was the same tiny one (but at least no runway underneath) and relatively quiet.  Just enough room to lay the suitcase on the floor, but no storage";1
since we arrived everything has been wrong. first they gave us a room with everything dirty, the bathroom door super old and damaged and the most serious thing, an air conditioner with a noise that did not let us sleep. Terrible service, they have no solutions, they are rude and everything is always your fault. The second night we called to complain about the noise, they hung up the phone because there was nothing to do and it was my fault for not calling beforehand. That morning when we changed rooms we left our bags in the lobby and we had a gift (food) left in the fridge and last night they told us that they had no solution for the time and that it was our fault for not calling before and that it was thrown away, that we find out in the morning, I went down to find out in the;1

He couldnât find my reservation, although I had my confirmation email and said he would have to check HIS email to see and proceeded to help ANOTHER patron who was waiting in line. WTH?!!!  AFTER assisting that customer he came back to me. Checked his email and then passed me off to another coworker. Mind you his badge said manager. So now this other worker named Samira, who was UBER RUDE, was booking me in and asking if there are any rooms although I had a CONFIRMED booking.  Now whilst;1

The first day we came in the whole lobby was 15 degrees! The room was a cheap make over with peeling wall paper, a shower with no door, bathroom sink water shooting out so hard it will wet you! They put a cheap bottle of water on the night stand, and if you open it they charge you $8. They have cheap coffee, which they charge you for, the close has no hanging space because of the safe and mini fridge in it. Speaking of the mini fridge it has 20 different beers none alike.. that blows! The iron board was a crappy mini table top, we had trouble ironing our clothes and the heater was busted! No WiFi unless you paid for it. Most places I have been to have free WiFi, complementary coffee and a stand up iron board! Will not be back!!!;1
My husband and I really wanted to like this hotel. Our daughter goes to college in the immediate area and we loved the convenience however, enough is enough. With many stays behind us now, we will not return. The entire hotel and all of it's rooms are dark and dingy. The bathrooms are not well maintained and have visible dust, rust, and  damage on their doors and shower stalls. The sinks do not properly drain and the showers continually leak out onto the floor. We have stayed in several different rooms and have experienced the exact same thing in all! The heating/air conditioning units are filthy and barely work. (Again this has been true in all rooms.) The kicker this time is that we were put on the 11th floor. STAY AWAY from that on a Friday and/or Saturday night. On the 12th;1
If you booked this hotel through hotwire or expedia you better think twice to go here! We booked the hotel through hotwire, never had any problems until this time!

I showed them my confirmation of the reservation which was already paid for THREE persons! But instead of being helpfull and understanding and finding a solution they were extremely rude and very unpolite as it was our fault! One helpfull employee apologize for the rude treatment we received earlier from his collegue when checking in. He also provided us of an extra bed, which slept very uncomfortable, but anyway it was a solution. In;1

Location: The location is great. It's just a few minutes to the 72nd street subway, The Dakota where Lennon was shot, Central Park and Strawberry Fields. The neighborhood is very residential and in a no-honk zone which makes it quiet. This is about the only good thing about the hotel  Hotel: The hotel can't even really be called a hotel. It's a youth hostel without an age restriction. In each room you get a bed, a small TV a mirror and a sink. That's it! You have to leave a deposit at the front desk for sheets and they are not the cleanest in the world. The bathrooms are shared. Each bathroom has a toilet and a shower. Imagine how long it takes for you to wait to do your business in the morning! The lifts are ancient and slow. The front desk could really care less about you;1

Due to severity of the reaction during the course of the next week, we sought medical attention, and to our horror, the confirmation that we experienced an allergic reaction to bed bugs.  I will be lucky if my scars fade in a year.  I contacted the Hilton to tell them to check the room so no one else would need to go through the same ordeal.  It took over a week for someone to tell us that we will be contacted further.  After four weeks, they sent us a certificate for a one night stay at a Hilton.  Horribly insufficient response from this hotel.  Will;1
We were very disappointed with our room.  It was not clean with moldy brown spots in the bathroom and dirty marks on the walls.  The room generally looked pretty shabby and the hallways were dark and dated.  We were treated rudely at check-in.  The neighborhood is dirty and noisy.  The only advantage this hotel has is that it is convenient to the train station and subway.  Look for somewhere nicer in NY to stay!;1
not good hotel theb staff un-helpfull make remarks laugh, rooms not booked, bathroom smelt sewer, hotel desperate need decorating updating,  ;1
1THE HALL WHERE MY ROOM WAS SMELLED OF CHINESE FOOD..  The desk staff was not friendly. The floor I was assigned to smelled of Chinese food. The room had yellowed sheets and did not look clean. The front desk reported that they did not have a different room. The hotel's manager was curt and uncooperative. I asked for a cancellation for the week's reservation and for the night as I was only in the hotel for 1/2 hour and found it unclean and smelly.  He told me that he would take care of it but never did as it showed up on my visa card.  I thought the Wnydam hotel chain would be superb and so I thought I would try this hotel. If they know about the staff and lack of service resolution, they would cancel their name from this location. My experience almost ruined my visit. I hope;1

These rooms were too small.  The windows were horribly dirty and you could hear all the outside noise.  There was no bathroom door and no trash cans in the room.  The beds were extremely hard and the heaters did not work.;1
1.The size of room is incredibly small, and there is a confusing column in this tiny room(see the picture). 2.There is a AC roaming outside the window which makes equivalent  decibel as a lawn mower.  3.The front desk never smile and the  doorman wears a northface coat and nike sneaker to welcome us. 4.The wifi in room is not free and cost you much, so is any thing in the bar. We feel so lucky that we only booked this crab hotel for just one night.;1
booked it one day, tried to change days but they were full so was forced to cancel. I was charged the full amount because it was within the 48hr arrival period, but they could have sold this room to someone else, and probably did. Will not dream off using such money grabbers again.;1

Look elsewhere since this location seems to try to trap you into staying.  Looked to cancel multiple days prior and was told that cancelling would be a full charge.  Called to work out cancellation and was unable to get beyond the cancellation would be the full charge for the room.;1
very expensive for the standard. $100 ppp. Stayed here between Christmas and New Year, i wish i had looked here for reviews before booking it. if you arrive early dont expect to be able to get to your room until 3pm. our room had a slanting floor and beds with poor pillows and no space to unpack. the heating system bangs and clonks all night, windows dont lock leaving at the mercy of the easily accessible fire escape. the air con unit in propped in a window opening that is poorly masked off and very drafty. very dated in decor and needing TLC. the lift failed whilst i was in it. the staff are very helpfull though.;1

The ""good"" rooms have the purple under-bed prostitute lighting, pleather headboards, and enough toxic air freshener in the air to make you cough, and in all of the rooms I have stayed in I feel like I need sanitize everything that I own after staying there. This time was the final straw where the entire floor (stained carpet, bizarre dirty cubbies, and dark/dank/peeling paint aside) smelled intensely like vomit, so much so that I almost followed suit. My boyfriend went down a floor and said we should consider ourselves lucky based on the smell of the floor below us was of other bodily fluids that if possible was worse. TOTAL";1

This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in...  - The hotel was not clean - The room had the broken furniture (and fixed using the bandage and tape) - The linen was not clean...there were blood stains...yuk... - We were supposed to get queen bed but gave us the double-bed.  Only good thing about the hotel was that they allowed us early check-in (and that too after denying initially that there is no room and then another hotel personnel came over and asked about the what's the matter and then there was a room available out of the air)  I wouldn't stay at this hotel ever again and wouldn't recommend to others.;1
Booked my stay in early November for a stay in February - locked in my rate, which was expensive but albeit it was central to Lincoln Center for fashion week. Upon checking in was not given anything to sign or review for my rate - leaving me to assume the confirmation I received back in November would be somewhat accurate allowing for applicable taxes and fees. Room was extremely small for rate, wi-fi was outrageously expensive and did not work in my room and the free wi-fi downstairs did not work either. Upon checking out received a folio with charges for more than double what I was quoted on my initial reservation confirmation. Immediately asked the front desk clerk to speak with the front desk manager or general manager on my bill and was told neither were available and that;1
"We stayed at this hotel for just 2 nights and that was much too long!!! First off we asked for a non-smoking room. When we opened the door of a ""non-smoking room"" it smelled like a giant ash tray. I do have to say that they changed our room without any problems. Second, the beds/pillows/linens are horrid. I slept less than 6 hours in 2 nights. The mattresses are rock hard, the pillows were not plush, and the their was a curly dark hair in my blankets. (Clearly not mine since I'm blonde). The free breakfast was okay, the only real perk of the hotel. Oh and they should really mention the fact that you have to pay for parking (12 bucks/night).  The staff were not very friendly as well. We asked for directions one night, and the desk clerk seemed very annoyed, and placed a brochure";1
When we checked in at 3.00pm the room wasn't ready and the floor was wet.  Unhelpful & Rude Staff -The Housekeeping were shooting at each other at  8AM in the morning and people slamming doors through out the night. The noise kept us awake all night until we finally couldn't take anymore, dressed and went and complained and the receptionists were not helping at all, very rude and ignorant!  DON'T waste your time and money-AVOID!!;1
Stayed during 2nd week of October.  Waited for 45 minutes to check in.  Was overcharged, has been more than 2 weeks and hotel still have more than $400 hold on my debit card.  Went to the restaurant about 45 minutes before closing and was told by maitre'd that it would be better for me to go to the lounge because they weren't going to put any fresh food out.  I went to the lounge, and the chicken nachos I ordered had no cheese.  I ordered a slice of key lime pie, they brought it out and it was still frozen.  On the night before my flight, my neighbors were having an out of this world party.  One that was still going on at 3 am.  I called the front desk.  They said they would handle it.  The party continued, and I called again and was told that a manager would call back.  The;1
I just checked into the Hyatt Regency LAX on the concierge floor as I usually do, and to my surprise with no notice prior to booking, the Regency Club is now AWFUL and has been stripped down to the basics of a few drink choices and pay alcohol. I am very disappointed in Hyatt and have already been rethinking my choice of where to stay when I am in LA. What could make Hyatt want to reduce a customer experience so negatively?  Last week there was the typical Hyatt experience of Chicken Wings, soup, desserts, cheeses, meats...now all gone...  Too many LAX hotels to put up with this disgrace.;1
"First room was 85 degrees. Maintenance came in at 3am to fix it and said they couldn't. Second night we were moved to another room. Loud loud loud clicking noises all night!

It took three tries before the hotel gave me a room where the lock worked. The furniture was worn out, the lights difficult to turn on and the doorknobs/shower tap came off in my hands. I had to pay $10 per day for internet connection that still took a call to the help desk every time I connected and the connection was crap. The bar offered two for one drinks but then doubled the price of the drinks - so it wasn't two for one. I won't be staying again.;1
We have stayed at the Empire many times over the years. And until our last trip have never had any trouble. We were in NYC for our anniversary in late October and as usual booked a room at the Empire. Got there about 4PM, checked in quickly and then took off for dinner and a show. We were given an interior room on the 11th floor and our air conditioner didn't work a lick. Because the pool is also on that floor it was terribly humid and without being able to open the windows we were miserable all night.  We called and asked for maintenance.....they came and supposedly reset something in the unit but it didn't do anything. The night couldn't have been more uncomfortable...hot, humid, stuffy, not a breath of air. We couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning.  When we were;1

Unfortunatelly new york was our last destination and this hotel was very dissappointed!!;1
i rarely write bad reviews, but really need to warn other potential victims not to be attracted by the glamorous name and location of this appalling place. It is miles away from Hollywood, in Vermont, or Downtown LA. it is on a main road. The staff are surly and unhelpful. When I asked whether someone could help my 2 daughters and I with our luggage, I may as well have been speaking a different language. Rooms old fashioned, uncomfortable and over priced. When we encountered a cockroach in our room ( I kid you not), the manageress seemed put out at my request to go to another room ( it was too late to transfer), and argued with me about whether the rate/cost would be waived. We obviously checked out first thing the next day. PS Avoid the breakfast. indescribably bad.WE have re;1

This hotel just has a bad energy to it. It has loud irritating music playing...the rooms are small, tired and dirty. It is located in a great location and then it goes down hill from there. The food was decent. The prices for items in the mini-bar and room were ridiculous ...$7.50 for a small bottle of water.    The staff was uncaring and down right rude. They even called the police on my husband, who had his foot elevated on a piece of furniture in a common sitting area.  The elevator situation is laughable! You have to push two different buttons.   I could go on forever...but when I found that we could check-out and go to the Waldorf Astoria for the same price...we were gone.  We stayed the 2 nights for my husband's event, that was at the hotel, but moved for the last 2 nights;1

Stay here for one night for anniversary trip. About one week before the stay, I get in touch with the General Manager, Ann Peterson and Barry Rauch, Director of Operations to see if they can do anything such as an upgrade to a better view room. No reply from either of them. Even if the hotel is full or reject the request, they still should reply to the email.   When we get there, the lobby is very busy and we check-in to the hotel. The receptionist is OK not much going on. There is a special check-in for Wyndham Rewards but it seems that it is always close when I check-in and check-out. She just checks us in and gives us the key. The room is located at 27th floor. The room is very small like most reviewer mention and very old but it seems clean. The sit on the toilet bowl is;1

Where did it go?  Oh, in the ""cancelled"" tab?  That's weird.  Better give them a call.  Hilton has good customer service, right?  After I explained the situation to the booking representative at the Hilton, she said she could only book a new reservation for me, and that of course they had no more rooms such as the original one that I booked at the original rate.  Perhaps they overbooked and just cancelled my reservation without telling me? A bug in the app that cancelled my reservation without me having to input anything?  Hard to say.  But it was the Hilton's fault, and they neither owned the";1
To be frank, my husband and I had a completely terrible experience at the Jane, and I would NEVER come back to stay, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends/colleagues. We planned to stay for two nights, but we ended up moving after the 1st night. We even tried to move to another hotel at 2am on our first night, but we couldn't find availability.   Our room (a Captain's Cabin with a private bathroom) was on the 2nd floor directly above the club. We arrived home at midnight, and quickly found that there was no way we'd be sleeping if we stayed put in that room. The music sounded like it was being played inside our room, and our walls and floors were literally vibrating. When my husband first called down about the noise at 1am, the front desk attendant told him that all he;1

Iâll start with the positives-   1) Location of the hotel is fantastic, especially if youâre seeing a show at MSG.  Well, that was quick- letâs move on to the rest: 1) hotel is super old and outdated. Rooms, beds, bathrooms, etc.. 2) it will take forever to get an elevator up to your or down to your Room. It actually might be faster walking. Factor at least 10 -15 minutes one way into your travel time 3) housekeeping - I had a family suite with 4 people. There were two bath towels in the room. I called down at 3:30 pm for more. At 11 pm I called back down for additional towels as I hadnât received them and was told it might take a bit bc there was only one person on duty. By the time I get the towels Iâll be back home and able use my own.  4) biggest issue- I booked this room;1
This was not worth the money. The room was small and cramped, the air conditioner loud and it was difficult getting hot water for the shower. There were only two lifts working so it took a long time to get downstairs in the morning. The air temperature on the floor where we stayed was extremely uncomfortable. Overall, I would not recommend. It is a bit worn and needs a complete makeover.;1
there was a live baby cockroach in my bed & this was the noisiest hostel i've eve stayed in, world wide. when i told the front desk about the cockroach, they offered to clean the room or transfer me to another room. i just couldn't stay there, though. instead, i left the hostel and was told to ask the manager about a refund. i tried for days to contact him, 2 staff members guaranteeing that he'd take my call or email me back, which, to date, he has not. it's been over three weeks. DO NOT STAY HERE unless you like bugs and noise;1
this hotel is literally the worst thing ever! I'm not sure how its still allowed to operate. my dad and I went to new york during December of 2012 for 3 weeks and we stayed 3 nights in this hotel until we booked somewhere else because it was so bad. the staff were very unhelpful and unwelcoming considering we'd just been on a plane for close to 24 hours from Australia. 0/10 would not recommend to anyone, it might be cheap but its definitely not worth it.;1

"TL;DR â Very disappointing hotel response to safety and noise concerns, culminating in two distraught women screaming in the hallway for their incapacitated friend to be released from a sex party.  My wife and I stayed at this Hilton for 2 nights to visit Universal Studios. Throughout the 1st night, we were disrupted by men next door making extremely loud noises (yelling, banging on floor, etc). We tried dialing front desk several times in the night, but the lines were always busy. In the morning, I saw some other hotel reviews mention the phone doesnât work. We went to Universal Studios very tired but determined to make the most of our day.  The noise continued the 2nd night, and when it reached 10pm we tried calling the front desk again.

When I arrived from San Diego after a grueling drive, I was told that my resesrvation had been cancelled due to an invalid credit card and that there were no rooms. It was a snafu. My cards are fine but when I asked the dispassionate clerk why i wasn't notified so that I could rectify the issue, he said that wasn't their policy, that if the card is invalid they just automatically cancel. I was panicked and furious. He handed me a list and said that I could try the Comfort Inn or the Travel Lodge. I went to the Travel Lodge which was awful.;1

The heating and air units in this hotel are historic. You can't accurately set your temperature, so you're either freezing cold or sweltering hot. On top of that, when the unit comes on it makes the most horrendous noise that jolts you from your sleep. My counterparts traveling with me has similar experiences and comments.   Oh and the bathroom is TINY!!! If you're a female, good luck getting ready. No counter space or storage for your beauty items.;1

Spent the weekend in New York To celebrate Martin Luther King. Left our car with the valet. Upon checking out of the hotel we lift our bags with the doormen to have breakfast. Driving home we noticed that all the money in the glove compartment was gone and items from our bags were missing.     It truly is an elegant location but the staff turns it into a dive. They have absolutely no sense of propriety or style. They referred to me as Pal and Bud. I didn't spent seven years in medical school to be called bud. There really more like bouncers as opposed to The type of doorman or staff you would encounter at a real hotel.   Management has no control over this hotel. The staff are running wild, even commiting theft.;1

If they will Steal from you at the desk, they will steal from you when you are out of your room.  Terrible neighborhood.  Lots of sketchy people hanging around the hotel.  Looks like they rent some of the rooms by the hour.  There were holes in the walls, there were scuffs all over the walls that were painted.  Bathroom had holes in the walls.

Saw online reviews, thought it would be nice, so booked a stay for 6 nights.   Was put into a room which was so small, and worse than a 1-star motel and everything in the rooms is 20 years old.   Reasons for checking out of the hotel - Hotel is Dirty  Hallways are filthy and smell of smoke Rooms are cramped up and too small and no where same as pictured  Everything is old and musty.  My wifes allergies started to act up.  Feels as if we were scammed as we were showed great pictures and hotel was too shabby. No coffee machine  Couldnt spend any more time there and immediately checked out next morning on 29th Jan.

There is so much wrong with the quality of this hotel verses the amount of money charged.   What establishment doesn't have glasses for champagne or any drinks with room service?  More complaints to follow, I'm trying to enjoy my holiday and forget the money I spent on this place.;1
This hotel was awful.  It was so bad that we were booked for two nights, but left after just one.  It was so bad that we rebooked at a different hotel, at great personal expense.  It should be noted that we booked the nicest room at the Jane (called the Captain's Room).    Firstly, we arrived and they gave us a room that didn't have heat.  They then gave us another room that had heat (albeit very little).  Another important detail about this room: it was directly above their night club, which closes at 4 AM.  Between the thumping music and revelers in the street, I could not sleep one wink.    The hotel was extremely cold, which was worsened by the fact that their beds have very little when it comes to covers.  Our bed had only a thin blanket, which did not suffice for a 62;1
From the moment I pulled up to the front door employees had their hands out looking for tips. They have the car greeter, the valet and the luggage man between the time my car stopped and I got to the front desk.  The lady at the front desk told me my breakfasts would be free and pointed to the restaurant several times.  When I got to my room I found my superior view I had paid extra for consisted mostly of parking lots and the roads for the buses, trams and security vehicles used along with the entry for the retail area. I was told I had to pay an exorbitant fee to self park and was given a card to open the gate - the key did not work so I had to waste time getting one that worked.  The linens and room were filthy with mold/scum in most of the corners in the bathroom.  The;1
I stayed here one night before I left for a cruise the next day.  I paid $280 for a room hardly big enough to fit a queen size bed.  The bed was pushed between two walls with no way to walk around the bed.  There was no bed side lamp, only the overhead light which was switched on and off by the door.  There was no dresser or closet and no place to hang clothes.  The air conditioning unit did not seem to work very well and there were no instructions for it.  Beyond all of this, the room was right on a very busy New York street (8th Avenue) that was very noisy and the room did not have dark curtains to keep out the light.  I needed to listen to a recording of relaxing music on my i-phone in order to get any sleep.  This room was a rip off at the price.  The staff was fine, but;1
Hotel was not worth the money I paid. Room was hot & musty would not stay there again. Location was great for park & studios. Very central. Elevator service at check out time was too slow. Air conditioning did not work well;1
"Nightmarish decor in lobby, mezzanine and room;truly cheesy and vulgar. Dirty and shabby public ladies' room, chipped paint everywhere, plastic furniture in room, shower with no curtain or door. It's really a crummy motel. And even if it weren't as I've described it, it's offensive that they CHARGE for coffee made with the mini-Keurig in the room. Hundreds for this tacky room and not even a free cup of coffee in the morning?  I dread another night in the Empire, but at least the bed is decent.";1
Beware of the front desk staff, as all of them have different opinions and statement. I am still struggling to get the pre auth release on my credit card, even now I am back to my country. They don't respond to your emails, very unethical and unprofessional guest follow up approach from their side. Aside from this chef Hugo deserve thumbs up as he is always there every morning with a smile to cheer up your mood in the breakfast restaurant, and he even remembers your preferences, unlike the front desk agents they should learn something from him;1

"If you only read the first sentence of this review, simply DO NOT stay here. I travel to NYC once a year just to enjoy the city and get away for a weekend. This weekend I was traveling with my boyfriend for his birthday and it is wildly unfortunate that we booked our getaway weekend at this hotel. I'll start from the beginning, about a week before our trip I called to see if the hotel could put a bottle of champagne or something in the room to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday, I was quickly told ""no"" and provided no further assistance. I should have known then that the staff was going to be a problem.   The hotel itself is a neat building right on the river. Upon entering, however, it is clear how badly this hotel needs to be updated. It smells of dust and mildew as if it";1
Front desk interaction with guest was not a pleasant experience. Front desk was rude.  Room was clean and quiet. Breakfast has limited choices at the club lounge. Early evening lounge access provides very limited options.  There are many hotels in the area that offer better value for the money. This place is not the hotel you would want to stay.;1

I made a group booking and upon late check in (after a full day of flying) we were informed that the electricity would be shut off between midnight and 6am so the county could fix some power line issues.  Then they started handing out flashlights. Seriously.  Who manages this place and pulls a bait and switch like this? They should have advised all the reservations of this major issue and re-booked them in nearby hotels. I pitched a fit and got the rooms comped but this hotel should not have been open for the night!  Such an unethical, dumb and rude move.   Although it was a decent hotel from what I could see (while the lights were on), I will never book this place again.;1
This hotel is absolutely dreadful! I was so disappointed. On a positive note the reception is beautiful and the location is good. The furniture in the room is ok, but the decor is tired and worn, layers and layers of paint, broken plugs, thread bare carpets, dirty grouting in the bathroom and no tea and coffee making facilities. We had to change rooms three times in total, the first was all of the above, but small and oppressive with the window looking on to a brick wall. The second and third slightly bigger, however the third room didn't improve cosmetically, but the view was amazing - The Empire State building, this was the only positive. The iron blow up and the toilet overflowed, insufficient towels etc, I could go on and on. I found the staff with the exception of Kada,;1

We stayed at the Empire Hotel for our babymoon/anniversary and were incredibly disappointed. We booked the hotel because of the rooftop pool and were never made aware it was closed (indefinitely) for maintenance. No one told us upon check in, and we were never told upon booking. So disappointing. Although at this point I was very nice about it, because things happen and it's not necessarily the managers fault. Night 2. My husband and I are awoken to a flood in our room, coming from the bathroom ceiling. It took almost two hours for maintenance and housekeeping to deal with the issue and get our bathroom cleaned up. Meanwhile their only solution was to move us to another room. Mind you I am pregnant, and was asleep, and IT WAS MIDNIGHT. I refused to move rooms because we were;1

We booked this place 5 months ago.  When we arrived here yesterday afternoon we found that they had missed that we were a family and had placed the kids, 14 and 11, on a different floor from us.   This in itself is not acceptable.  They have promised we will be placed closer together tomorrow night. In the meantime we need to keep our belongings packed so they can move them whilst we are out. This means we can't fully relax.   No compensation or anything offered for the inconvenience.

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon after 12 hours of flight time and airport transfer. From the outside, all looked well. Check-in was quick and easy, the reception staff were very friendly and although the reception area looked a little tired, we could see nothing of any concern.  We had a double room on the 10th floor. On leaving the lift, we had to go in search of our room as there is no indication to its location but as its not a huge hotel, we found it after a short while.  Our room was one of two next to the stairway. We knew things were bad as soon as we opened the door. The room had a very musty smell, the carpets were filthy to the point I would not walk on them without footwear and there were a number of loose floorboards that made a loud clunk whenever you walked over;1
Would never go again. We were treated like the bumbs on the street corner. Our family were only in New York for one day and they ruined our whole day with their lengthy check in process. They then lied and said they were giving us a room with a view and pull out bed and we even had to switch rooms after 2 hours. This was the worse experience ever and hotel was gross!!!;1
I have been to NYC many times and have stayed at hotels in the city and in jersey. We stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend and it could not have been worse.  After a long train ride, we all wanted to have a shower. As the first one was showering, the water wouldn't drain so we called for maintenance to come up and have a look. He let himself into the room, then told us that he was done his shift in 15 mins so he couldn't snake the drain. We went down to the concierge to complain and they moved us to a new room after 30mins of me trying to convince him that the water wasn't draining. In the second room, there was significant mold (even on the portraits) and red smears on the bathroom wall. After complaining again, we were told that there were no rooms left and they would;1
The bathrooms are a joke--the room couldn't be any smaller and they pack the frig with alcohol and soft drinks so that you can't fit anything you prefer in it.  In order to have all this liquor and beer and wine removed costs a FIFY DOLLAR restocking fee.  After many phone calls and visits to the front desk, I got them to lock the frig and removed the tray of very unhealthy snacks from the room. Wasting my time on this nonsense.  By the way, if you make coffee in the room, it costs you $3.50 per --Starbucks is right around the corner--better off throwing on some clothes and going there. There is absolutely no reason to stay at this place.  Also the check-in person was not pleasant upon arrival..;1

I checked into the Empire hotel late in the evening. The staff at the front desk were friendly, however I found it odd that there were no doormen or staff present to assist with bags. I was quickly checked in and went up to my room. My room looked as though an adult movie was recently filmed inside. There were mysterious marks/stains on the headboard, walls, and furniture. Both bedside tables were filthy, not just covered in a film, but visibly sticky/dirty. The curtains and blinds were both filthy - very odd place to be dirty. The curtain in my room had a visible hand print on it. I'm not joking - a HAND PRINT. There were also questionable stains on the curtain. The bathroom was small but functional, and there was a toothpaste stain in the sink. Luckily the cups were;1

Dont book a place in there! our room was 3x3 square meters literally! Queen bad, was for hobbits! Not enough long to keep whole legs on it! Shared bathroom wasnt cleaned even one single time, during our 4 days stay!

They've never heard about something like that! One time when we came back to room, we realised that someone was messing in our stuff and using our perfums. Wi-fi only exists somewhere in the space, I mean there are two sources that u can try to connect but the stream is so weak makes it impossible to reach.

We are so shock and disappointment when arrived to late at night and the bathroom and toilet are dirty. The staff on the front desk said no room available. I was waiting on the morning and changed other room and I got a towels with all the blood drops on that. So scary to staying overnight in this place. No water to sale in Vendor machine. It is the worse place to staying. The picture on the website is total different then you are see on a real live. They try to renovation and fix the escalator.

Upon arrival we walked into a very dirty room with only one towel provided for two guests. This lasted for two days. The next evening I stood on GLASS on the floor of our room as to which we complained and subsequently had a âmistakenâ 6am wake up call from the alarm that had NOT gone off the night before.  Our room was disgusting and very unhygienic upon arrival and after 4 nights was still in an awful state. With dust everywhere and the bathroom tiles filthy it really does not provide the âsuperior guest facilitiesâ that was promised via their website.  We travel all over the world and this is the first time that we have not had a refill of our tea, coffees and bathroom products thus letting us down further.

This year was the third time I visited Morningside Inn after 2 good experiences.  I had a reservation made though the webpage and confirmed by phone to stay a few days in a room with private bathroom. I couldn't arrive the day I was supposed to because Manhattan was closed due to the visit of Hurricane Sandy. I called them to inform the situation and they told me that there was no problem to arrive 2 days after. When I finally got there they told me that my reservation was cancelled and that they didnÂ´t have any room available. After the shock I showed them the on-line reservation and only then they gave me a room that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. It was smelly, tiny, with no bathroom, no tv.

Booked to stay four nights as a pair. First off we were expected to pay in full on arrival prior to viewing the room. On pulling back the bed sheets we found pubic hair and nail clippings. The floors were sticky throughout and with hygiene standards well below par we returned to the reception to request a refund. The staff were extremely rude, dishonest and unhelpful. Several attempts were made to contact any kind of manager, we were given a time to return the following day but were met with the excuse that the manager was in fact out of the country. Exhausted and disheartened we accepted a 2 night refund, despite never actually staying.

In one morning a drog addicted come to our table to ask for food an nobody did nothing! Internet suppose to be for free but they charged us for this without to know. At home we discovered another 135 Dollars charge on the credit card, just like that, no idea for what. The room was very small with old furniture. In a windy night you can't really sleep, the windows are very old an making strong sounds. This Hotel is a 2 Star Hotel in Europe, for sure not a 4 Stars hotel. The Air conditionar  was very noisy, hard to sleep.;1

Bad hotel compared to its neighbors. I paid $179 for one night at king's room but they even did not provide me a bottle of water. The COVID prevention measures were okay, but all utilities in my room were old: the windows and sofa were dirty, the shower was bad for me to adjust temperature and I could hear a loud noise coming out every time when my upstairs flushed toilet.

"YOU MUST CONFIRM YOUR ROOM AT CHECK IN or you risk getting ""upgraded"" to the worst nights sleep ever. Long story (somewhat) short. I reserved a room with a King bed. When I checked in at 9 pm, I was given my keys and went to my room. I'll freely admit that I should have gone back to the front desk when I discovered that I had been placed in the living room area between two bedrooms with a sofa bed. I was so tired when I arrived I assumed that I must have screwed up my reservation. After all, had I been truly upgraded, the front desk staffer would have mentioned it. If I had been downgraded, they would have mentioned it as well.   The sofa bed was, as you might expect, horrible. Small, thin and seemingly designed with discomfort in mind - I managed to get 3 hours of sleep. The";1
Being a Hilton Honors member, it is rare for me to say anything negative about a Hilton hotel.  Having said that, I will never again stay at the Hilton Universal City hotel...  On our annual trip to California, we once again booked our stay at the Hilton Universal City hotel as it is conveniently located near all the Los Angeles movie studios that we like to tour.  We have had good stays at this hotel in the past and had been looking forward to checking in.  And this is where our stay at the hotel began to fall apart...  We arrived at the hotel at approximately 6 pm.  It took 10 minutes to speak to a member of the front desk team to get checked in.  We were then advised that our room was not ready and would not be ready for 30-40 minutes.  When we asked why the room was not;1

First off, cool digs.  The kind of place I would like to stay in when it's nice out and I don't have a job to do in town.  However, I was booked for a week in March and it was 25 with the windchill.    First strike: My room wasn't ready until 4:30  I waited in the cafe.  Second: The room was cold when I walked in.  No vents, no central heat, just a radiator on the outside wall.  I pulled back the cover to an inch of dust on the floor behind it, I turned both knobs to full on.  It never warmed up.  Room was around 65 the whole night.  All the windows leaked, no weather proofing, wind just gushing in.  Then there was the AC unit, they had covered over it with paper and painter's tape, cold, cold cold.  With a room this small it doesn't take much of leak to make it cold.  Third:;1

I decided to store my bags and avoid the fee, and found the hotel charges $5 PER BAG to store bags for their guests!  Finally, upon check-out I noticed a ~$35 ""resort"", or ""destination"" fee (can't remember exactly what they called it).  I know these added fees, which are not made clear at time of booking are becoming more common...but still a clear ripoff.  It is no wonder AirBnB is taking so much";1

So I called down and was told I'd be moved the next day, and I was relieved since my wife was coming in from out-of-state. Well, we ended up in Room 2238. Small, but that's okay. But the shower was four sprinkles with very little control over water temperature and the sink filled up with water the minute you ran the water (it was stopped up.)

After reading so many great reviews I figured I'd give this place a try.  I wanted to write this review to warn people about the potential nightmare they may face if they choose to stay here.  The Jane has bed bugs.  If I felt that this place actually treated the rooms properly to attempt to remove the problem then I wouldn't be so harsh, but I highly doubt that this place takes the steps necessary to rid its rooms of bed bugs.   I stayed here July 5-8.  I cut my stay by a night after finding bed bugs.  That's when my nightmare began and my trip took a turn for the worst.  I noticed the bites on my arm and a few on my legs.  After seeing a bug on my bed I went immediately to the front desk and told them.  They seemed to doubt that I had bed bugs even after I showed them my arm;1

Positives: close to metro. Awesome breakfast.. waffles and omlettes everyday! Nice courtyard. Friendly helpfull staff. Rental cars on site. Negatives: I specifically asked for a high courtyard renovated room. (From other comments on trip advisor) however they put us in a road room. I complained and told them but they had not kept my note on file. They moved us to courtyard room. However it was not renovated. They also charged us twice which put our account in overdraft. This took 12 days to refund us back... as they wouldnt put a credit through and we had to wait for the hold transaction to expire (useless). The areas a bit dodgey... a homeless man lives right outside. Rooms need renovated... they are a bit rough. Carpet in corridoors smells....  Ill let u decide but I wont be;1
I book a room at agoda.com for this hotel. But when I arrived there, the manager just told me there were no rooms. But the booking fees have already been taken. Then the manager recommended another hotel to me, which is 25 blocks away! The worse thing is when we departed for the recommended hotel, a man after us met the same problem with Morningside Inn. It seems the hotel sends guests to other hotels every day!!;1
I stayed at this hotel in December 2021. I paid for my stay upon arrival. On 31st January Park West Hotel took an unauthorised payment of over Â£270 from my debit card. I contacted the hotel to which Yajaira (from of house manager) promised me a refund. Following this I have now had a further Â£550 taken from my credit card and now the hotel have stopped communicating with me. The hotel stay itself was fine. However, the treatment I have received following multiple unauthorised payments and money being taken from me is disgusting. I will not be staying here again if I am ever in New York, and I am certainly still awaiting a response as to where my money is.;1
I had a terrible experience with the front desk personnel of this establishment. Never experienced such terrible customer service at a hotel. Management is just as bad - will not help you, if you decide to complain. When you have been treated rudely that spoils everything. Would never go back and would not recommend. Stay away!;1

I stayed at this hotel for one month during a working trip to New York.  The hotel was very unclean, dusty and the bed clothing was stained and some times to small for the bed.  The room was small, and certainly the room shown on the internet does not mirror the real thing.  The only thing that was tidy and clean was the bathroom area, sometimes I often wondered what the floor was like to sleep on as an alternative to the bed that made me feel dirty.  I would encourage you shop for a better hotel !;1
This is first review I have ever been bothered to write. But for a hotel experience this bad I felt it is necessary.   I stayed here for 12 nights with a friend of mine, visiting from Brisbane, Australia. We booked a superior double double room for US$2,900. Below is summary of our time at the hotel:  1. The rooms are very small, outdated and fairly beat up (chipped paint, no actual light fixture in the room, windows so dirty I was embarrassed to take a photo of the street view). We struggled to fit 2 suitcases in the room. The fridge in the cupboard was also full with mini bar options leaving no room to store your own food or drinks. The TV remote did not work. There was a huge air conditioner unit located on the floor near the window. We had no temperature control over this;1
Please do not stay here. The staff are very nice but the hotel is terrible. No services, the room I had smelt bad and was in desperate need of repair. There is nothing positive except the staff. No curtains in the windows, blinds that are broken;1
The elevator was filthy and very slow. When I opened the door to the room I was shocked at how small and dark the room was. The dÃ©cor is dark brown/black with a filthy rug that doesn't match. Un believable!!! Very depressing!!!!!!!!! The bed is so low it didn't even come up to my knees and the mattress is only abut 12 inches deep. The mattress is rock hard and lumpy. When I moved a pillow I found a hair on it. The hair was small and curled, probably pubic. Disgusting!! Across the bottom of the bed was a black throw. When I lifted it up there was hair under it. The bathroom was gross, mold in the shower, chipping porcelain. The towels were old and yellowed. There was one very small bar of soap. In the morning there was no hot water!!!!!! The front desk staff were not at all;1
The hotel was awful!  Dirty rooms (tried 2), not maintained, moldy ceilings and window, dirty wallpaper, bugs smashed on wall, clearly not renovated in years.  In desperate need of make over.  Not worth the price even for location.  Pool over sold.  Small and being by roof top bar not appropriate for family's including the acceptance of topless sunbathing.  Stay away!;1
"Pasqual is incredibly rude. They were not helpful when I needed to adjust the dates of my stay. Bellman put his finger up when I tried asking if they could hold my bags for the day and told me to ""hold on"" while he had a non-work related conversation with another employee. Rooms are TINY. Gym is tiny with no windows. TERRIBLE customer experience, especially given the price point. Super disappointing.";1
If you're going to Universal Studios, then it's conveniently located...less than 10 minute walk away.    The hotel and room itself was very average, considering how much you're paying.  They don't offer free wi-fi, they charge you $7.95 per day!  With so many hotels (ie. cheaper ones or ones even better than the Hilton) out there who offer free wi-fi, we were very surprised that The Hilton was still charging.    We had booked our room via Expedia 3 months before our stay.  Our flight was delayed and I called ahead to let The Hilton know that it would be a late check-in, they told us it was fine.  When we arrived at the hotel around midnight, they gave us our room...when we went in, we realized they had given us a room for handicapped guests...which meant the bathroom was just a;1
Booked the hotel in may 2021 and since then I have emailed the hotel 11 times to not get a response. From the moment we checked in it as been a nightmare.the rooms are very small,dirty,out dated and extremely uncomfortable,the staff are very abrupt and rude and have zero customer service skills,the lifts are an absolute joke where was waiting on average 20 mins for one to arrive and only 3 out of the 6 are working I have stayed in NYC many times at many hotels of all different ratings but this is by far the worst I have ever encountered I would not recommend or return here and if you have any sense you will book elsewhere,they may give you a good price online but that will change when you arrive and to be honest if they was to pay me â¬300 a night I still wouldnât stay never in;1
This is the type of place where everything is nice on the booking but it is pure disappointment when you arrive. First the receptionist is absolutely not friendly and you donât feel as a welcome customer, far away. A rooftop bar was announced when I booked, it is closed. I purchased high speed internet access for 9.99USD and multiple accesses as written on the purchase page but the second access is not allowed. Support told me the hotel policy has changed (would be fair to inform  before purchase) and they pushed me to the reception (same lady) who claimed they canât do anything. The only thing which is according to promise is the fitness room. The rest is below expectations for an Hyatt. There are other choices in LAX, so decide if service is something youâre looking for.;1
I stayed at the Jane hotel in Oct 13 and it was a terrible hotel. The staff weren't friendly at all and the rooms were tiny, I really do mean tiny. Only one person could get changed at a time while the other sat on the bed then we would have to change to allow the other to get ready. Noise rooms with a night club in the hotel and air con was very noisy as well. We had two choices no air con and roast all night or put the noisy air con on and not sleep all night, I suppose either way it was hard to get any sleep. When asking for a change in room so we were away from the night club we were told we could be moved at a $100 a night charge! The shared bathrooms were ok if you managed to get them first thing in the morning otherwise they weren't up to my standard. Would never;1
Extremely noisy rooms, extra small bathroom. Actually it is a 1-2 start hotel not as advertised. Room under-equipped not as advertised.  Bad attitude from staff and hotel manager. We left after the first night and manager refused to refund the additional 2 nights we paid for in advanced.;1

"It is old, run down, dirty and on the verge of collapse. Seriously our room was 2 floors above the subway, that rumbled through our room every few minutes 24/7. The floor in our room was so bad it had about a 4"" differential from one area to the next, like walking on an uneven trail, but covered with dirty 1960's carpet, so you could not even see the trip hazards hidden below, with a board or two here and there still at elevation and the rest having dropped inches. As young seniors we had to be very mindful to not trip and fall with each step. We notified the management, they did offer to put us up to the 3rd floor but this room, was tucked away without any light, so we declined, gave notice we were leaving and book another room, on a Sunday so we paid a premium, but at least we";1
The room was dirty, run down, the ice machine was broken, I swear they had the heat cranked up, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, wallpaper was peeling off the walls,the list goes on. the parking garage for $27 a Day was full so we had to pay $104 + tax =$125.00 for 2 days. Suppose to have a handicap room, not available when we got there (I had called prior to booking a month before). Granted the location is good, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Oh and we asked for wash clothes, got towels. I saw 1 cleaning lady in 2 days and her âcartâ was a vacuum-NOTHING ELSE!!;1
When calling down to reception to report that I ben bitten by bed bugs the front desk staff showed no surprise.  They even had a box of after bite right behind them in a draw. I do understand that it can happen anywhere in the city and there is an epidemic. But the blasÃ© way they delt with the situation felt to me that is was a more than regular occurrence.;1
Customer service horrible, my birthday vacation started by receptionist making me feel the most stupid person in the world. The world needs kindness and to share love but in this trip it was all backwards;1

Oh dear, this place needs a rip out or do the decent thing and just close down. There is no proper heating system. It's one thing having sleep in your coat but more of a challenge when you've been out in torrential rain and you can't get your coat dry enough to sleep in.  What little heating available, went off during the night so we woke up freezing cold.  Same story in both our rooms.  There was no heating at all in the two previous rooms inflicted on us the first night.  So the same criticisms actually apply to four rooms.   Dirty floors, old filthy carpets and wobbly showers with hot water only sometimes.  View of Central Park through grubby windows.  No safety deposit boxes so we had to cart our valuables around with us all the time.  Wobbly locks on rooms, electrics;1

"We chose this hotel based on location and proximity to Columbia University, as we were attending our son's graduation. The room rates seemed very high 350 USD/night for a hotel with a 3 star rating on all travel websites, but the room photos on the hotel website looked modern and fresh. What a mistake. The photos on the website were an outright lie. The first room we were shown stank of smoke, had dirty carpets and a dirty hideabed (we booked a Queen suite as our son was with us), and the tiny room with the bed had the bed shoved against the wall with no end tables or lamps. The second room we were shown was only marginally better; again, dank smoke smells, dirty carpets, peeling paint, dirty radiator. The hideabed was horrible, sank in the center and the mattress was thin and";1
Ok, so we chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in nyc but couldn't afford $500/night. We paid only $97/night here, but it was way worse than a budget hotel. The room was fairly clean, but nearly impossible to move around it. Tiny was not even the word for it, and we had a standard size room. The worst part of our experience were the beds. The room smelled like smoke which made our stay difficult enough, but the beds were the WORST beds I've EVER slept on. We booked two nights and only stayed for one. Don't bother wasting your $$ on this place. Stay somewhere in NJ where there are beautiful hotels and it's close enough to NYC that you can come and go as you please. Don't bother with this place.;1
Horrible hotel. To begin with the air con was either on or off, no in between, and to turn it off you had to pull the plug out of the wall where you would get a mini shock as you were not able to turn it off by a switch before unplugging, it also rattled very loud so I was unable to get any sleep. The room looked like it had not been cleaned it weeks, I bumped the lamp and a pile of dust fell on top of me. I went to have a shower, which was broken as well, and the shower floor had mould on it and I also had to pull someone elseâs hair out of the drain in the shower, which also didnât drain properly, along with the sink as well. The room smelt like chlorine 24/7 and there was dirt and marks everywhere. Worst hotel I have stayed in, you can get much better hotels for the same;1
If you want to live in squalor come here, it reminded me of the film Big with Tom Hanks where he moves out ay 12 years old and cries himself to sleep. Wallpaper peeling, stench of smoke in coridoors, area is a dive, carpet peeling and very strained, bathroom moudly, damp doors, TV was not a flat screen (I didn't know these still existed), bed broken, mattress like sleeping on the floor.  The only reason I am giving such a low rating is the photos are not an accurate representation of the actual hotel rooms. They are downright misleading, this is more like hostel quality and costs the earth!;1

We've booked rooms through Priceline many times and this was by far the worst hotel ever. The room was the size of a ealk in closet. The television did not work.

The room was ok. Big and comfortable. There was no fridge and it was below reception with the view of a skip bin and a car park. It was advertised at $250 per night to include WiFi and carparkng but as it turns out I was charged $296  and then on top of that charged for WiFi and carparkong. To add insult to injury I got another bill slipped under the door for $160. The lifts were Terribe taking 20 mins and a call to reception to get someone to assist  and I saw a family trapped and the firies had to come to let them out.    The staff were rude and dismissive and aplogiswd but never fixed anything.  Even after a phone call the lift did not come so I had to take the fire escape and leave my kids with our luggage in an attempt to get a lift down to our room.  All in all the most;1
"This hotel has everything you would expect to find in one of your worst nightmares: disgustingly dirty carpet, wallpaper falling apart, useless AC, extremely noisy and even... insects!

Besides the location this place is everything but a bargain.  For 330 $ a night without taxes you get either a room on the minuscule courtyard with a direct access to charming noise the condenser fans  of he air-conditioning system with windows resembling toilets opening. There is nothing to see anyway or a room with regular windows but so small there is absolutely no place to put your personal belonging except in your suitcase so try not to stay there more than a night. The first day when we came back there was no towel , the second day when we came back @ 1h30 the room was not clean,room service promised to send someone right away and @ 3pm when we came back the room was still not cleaned.

We stayed there 2 years ago and had no problem so we went back. The a/c was horrible this time.  We checked in in the evening as our room wasn't ready earlier. When unpacking the a/c went on then turned off after it was cool. Stayed off until it got stuffy.  We need cold air due to allergies and my husband set it down very low, but at night it goes on and off and stays off until it is warm and stuffy before turning back on.  We complained and next day they changed our room but we had to check in at the end of the day again.  Same thing a/c on and off. But  in the morning it stays on and at night it goes on and off. This second room was worse as it got more stuffy I was up all night checking the clock as to when this miserable night would be over so we can check out ...we were;1
The rooms are too small and very uncomfortable, you can barely move around in them. The bathroom ceiling leaked, and it creeped me out. Most of the staff was rude. This was the worse hotel experience I ever had!!!;1
On the plus side, the beds were comfortable and the room was clean.   Downside: it took 10 minutes of groaning water pipes to get hot water.  The temperature nozzle for the tub was very loose, so your choices were scalding hot or lukewarm.   The towels are threadbare.  Forget taking a bath, because the tub drain would not close.  Forget drying your hair because the blow dryer did not work.  Forget eating leftovers because there was not a refrigerator nor a microwave.  And plan on living our of your suitcase because there was no dresser in which to put your clothes.  The WORST thing, however, was when we asked the lady behind the desk to hail us a cab to JFK.   We had researched it and cabs are not allowed to charge more than $52 to take you from anywhere in Manhattan to JFK.;1
Shower water was cold and requests for service weren't responded to for hours. When we got our room serviced, coffee and toilet paper wasn't restocked. Also stayed 3 nights and they only gave us 2 of the Hilton honors credits.   I've stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels. I'll never stay at this one again.;1
No free Wifi In the room as we were   promised. We cheked in yesterday (Saturday 7th Oct) and were negativly suprised that there is NO free Wifi in the room we booked (or anywhere else in the hotel!) We where told by hotels.com, the room that we wished to book included free WifiI. I called hotels.com twice to be sure! Free Wifi was a priority when choosing hotel.  Its such a disapointment and not what we expected. we will for sure not pay $ 54,95 for 5 days, which is completely overprised.  The staff is nice but in this matter (not very understanding) they advised us to use the free Wifi at the nearest Starbucks. Well, we will for sure not be spending much time at the Belvedere Hotel the next 6 days we have booked.;1
My room was not cleaned. A used bandaid, crusted food remnants & hair covered the room. The hotel changed me rooms, which also had food remnants in it. The good news was, no used bandaids! I have never experienced such a dirty, gross hotel environment.;1

After reading glowing reviews for this supposedly 4-star art deco wonder, I stayed here for two nights. What a disappointment! The Wyndham New Yorker is simply awful. Dirty, old, musty, yellowed with age, inelegantly decorated, and not updated in decades.   I was given a room on the 20th floor, which on the face of it, altitude-wise, was great. But as I stepped off the elevator and traversed a couple hallways to my room, could not help noting the distress and filth along the marble base boards. My room was small, the bathroom tiny, and like the rest of floor, old, depressingly decorated (yellows and browns in my room). The door frames and moldings had so many layers of paint from cheap makeovers, they had acquired a distorted, misshapen, pimply aspect. The standalone porcelain;1

The rate was great! The room was a good size and the bathroom was acceptable. It was very dated, the elevators were very old and very small, the halls had no A/C and smelled and felt like the dryers were vented in to the hall. There were 3 lamps in the room and 1 worked, there were no plugs for phone chargers, they did not replace the coffee supplies after I used them the first day, the internet was free but never worked the 4 days i was there,I only got 2 very small towels, I had personal items thrown away. The hotel didn't care and the customers services absent. The MOD Joel, was the worst I have encountered along with his staff. Don't waste your money.;1
Signed my  family members up to Hilton Honors before I booked the hotel so we could use the benefits which included free wifi. On arrival was greeted at checkin by a very rude lady. She did not care that I was a Hilton honors member. Claimed my travel agent used Expedia to make my booking which they do not use so therefore couldnât validate my membership. I then asked if a rollaway was in the room, to which she rolled her eyes and said it wasnât in the booking, however i had paperwork confirming the rollaway from the hotel.

"This hotel is a nightmare. In the ""value for money"" scale, this place scores negative. Where to start... It's an old ruin. The fact that besides the lobby, everything is broken and smells weird. Wi-Fi couldn't be worse and it doesn't reach the ""business center"" where people are expected to work (which, on the other hand, it's just a tiny 70's-like office with 3 desks). But the worst of all are probably the lifts. So few of them for such a big hotel with hundreds of rooms. I was in floor 29 and in rush hour it could easily take 15-20 minutes to get to the lobby. There was a fire at the hotel during my stay and nobody was able to provide any information on what was happening. The key stopped working literally 5 times during the week and got to get it fixed everytime. Insane.";1

We were given a late checkout of 2pm complimentary which was much appreciated except on the day we were leaving the house keepers and cleaners moved into our room and completely stripped our room whilst we were at breakfast. They argued that they thought we had checked out despite the fact 2 suitcases, our passports and my straigtners were still in the room. I had also left my Â£279 michael kors watch in the bathroom which was gone. The management did nothing, we were made to leave the room at 10.45am and I did not get my watch back.

Well, not quite sure where to start. I took my wife, 10 year old child and mother in law, paid for a 2 room suite, when I arrived I was told there had been a leak and that I would not be able to stay in my room and I would have to stay in a double room for the first night.. This would of been fine if I was just with my wife, but for our 10 year old child and mother in law of 61 to sleep on a single chair that was apparently a double pull out bed was never going to work. However, after complaining they eventually gave us a room with 2 double beds, with an air condition that sounded like a Boeing 747 engine. So hot and stuffy we remained for the rest of the night. The next morning I asked if I could have the room we booked for. I was then told my bank card was declined and I never;1
"I am writing in regard of our stay earlier in November 2015. The hotel was okay, but we were very upset at the way the car rental place in the lobby worked.  They charged us $150 for some extra fee that we never agreed on. Asked them to email us a copy of the receipt and it never came through either.  The advertisement that said ""car rental $25/day"" is a big fat lie. After we signed some paper, they told us about a bunch of other hidden fees. Ended up paying heaps for one day worth of car rental.  Also, got scammed $150 without any explanation whatsoever. This is an absolute disgrace. Your hotel should discuss this with the car rental service you provided. I had a pleasant stay at the hotel, but would never recommend this to anyone.  0/10";1

I booked a room last night, was very tired to get to bed.  They didn't have my room, and neither did they have for the people in front of me.  The person in the front desk was very unintelligent, confused and this was horrible.  I waited 1 hour before deciding to book somewhere else, losing my $130, go somewhere else.  It is a run down, stinky place that is not worth it, for few dollars more you can book at an actual hotel, not this hostel/hotel/motel or whatever they are;1
If you are looking for a youth hostel - stay at the Jane, there is almost no justification in calling this place a hotel.

Worst hotel experience ever!  Rooms had no a/c.  Hotel pool has been broken for a year, even though it is advertised as a rooftop pool hotel.  Housekeeping is non-existent.  Rooms are dirty and moldy.  My room sounded like I was sitting on an airport runway with a 747.;1
I was utterly humiliated at the Jane in the Jane Hotel. Just because I am Mexican, the bouncer decided my fiance and I could not get in. As soon as I respecfully asked the reason, the bouncer agressively pulled me aside and said I was not getting in because of my race.;1
Was having a perfectly fine (albeit noisy) stay at this hotel, until the last night! I woke up at about 2pm due to jetlag, and not having many hours of daylight yet was in a rush to get out the door. In getting ready I left a few bits and pieces, clothes, hairbrush etc on the bed and in my rush, not wanting to take my ring out with me, took it off and left it on the bed. I don't like housekeeping to come if I've left the room untidy- mostly because I don't want to make extra work but also because I am paranoid about things going missing, so I left the do not disturb sign on the door. Well, I get back in the evening and housekeeping has completely disregarded the sign on the door, and let themselves in, and MY RING IS GONE!  Now I'm not saying the staff have sticking fingers,;1
WE stayed at the Empire hotel for 3 nights and I must say, this is probably one of the worst.  We have travelled all over the world and I think this one is at the bottom of the heap.  Other than the location, there is nothing to offer.  The room we had was tiny, no closet to put things only an alcove with a curtain.  The rod to hang clothes was so high up, you had to be 6 feet tall, at least,  to use it.  The room was small and dark.  The view was that of the wall of the other side of the building.  The air conditioner sounded like a plane taking off and landing all night long.  Needless to say, we were unable to sleep for  two nights. We informed the desk of the problem and they apparently sent the engineer in to fix it.  However, it did not improve the situation and the noise;1
DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTELl!   I booked FOUR rooms for our family and guest from Australia! The rooms were more than dirty. The carpet was so bad we didn't want to walk on it with our bare feet. When we showered, we placed a wash cloth on the shower tile floor so we woudn't catch anything. The furniture looked like it had been through a war. The beds were not bad which was the only nice thing. They have a main heater for the whole hotel so you must shut it off or you will fry during the night. The heater is set for the whole hotel. I had to open the patio door at midnight to let the room cool off. I couldn't leave the sliding glass door open because of the bad neighborhood of drugs. The poor continental breakfast consisted of square shaped spongy eggs, waffles (not bad) and;1

My boyfriend booked a room at your hotel for my birthday. He elected to stay at your hotel because your property had a pool, unlike some of your competitors with cheaper prices. He received an email prior to our stay stating the hours and information about the pool deck, so he had no reason to believe there would be any issues once we arrived. It was a surprise he planned for my birthday and it was ruined when we found out that the pool was not open like your website and the email he received stated it would be. The primary reason he book a room at your hotel (which was rather expensive) was because he was willing to pay extra to ensure we had access to a pool. Furthermore, we went to the front desk and added one of my friends to the reservation so she could access the room;1

The room was clean and we did check in 90 min early. Friendly reception and clean lobby. Elevator holds 2 people max. $18 breakfast didn't offer much. One wash rag for 3 people. We asked for more, but then received none the next day.  I was charged extra $50/night for our 9 year old child. WiFi was $10/day, but we were given 1 night for free.  Not close to dining or shopping really, but close to Central Park. Room lighting very dim.  Room got so warm we had to turn on A.C. at night to cool it down.  Room was 12Ã14. Small wardrobe. Bring your own pillow!  Renovation appears unfinished..no shades on hall sconces. NO smoke alarms in room or hallways! FDNY beware!  OK room for 1-2 people for sleeping only!  Price topped out at $215/night (incl. tax);1
Horrible experience. From the room to the staff to the elevators to the cleanliness everything is overpriced, overrated, and a basic lie. Staff including managers are rude. Never again. The overall experience traumatized me;1
No upgrade as a Globalist. Also, Bad room service. I called in to order food. Asked me to wait for 35 minutes. I waited more than 1hour. And I called again. Finally it was delivery with a bad mood from the waiter. And the food is freezing cold. When I called there restaurant supervisor. He just asked me: what do you want? And give me a breakfast buffet coupon. But I get the free access as a globalist!? Room is small and old. You can hear people slamming doors and talking in the hall way. Not a Hyatt regency level at alll!! It shouldâve be a 3 star or lower hotel.;1
I made the mistake of booking this hotel. When I arrived, they said they were sold out of rooms with private bathrooms (which is the room that I had a confirmed reservation for). They offered me a room with a shared bathroom or a refund with an attitude as if being sold out is a natural reason not to honor my existing confirmed reservation. There was no apology or reparation. I wrote to management, but received no reply. Unless you do not mind possibly spending a night on the street, do not book this hotel! The person at the reception told me they couldn't help me but that I was free to complain. Overall, the hotel is a dump. Other aspects are just as mismanaged as the reservation system. Rooms, furniture, and toilets are in disrepair (e.g., sign says don't put toilet paper in;1

Stayed here for 4 nights in May.  Rooms reasonable size for NY and showers not bad at all.  Position good too - near park and restaurants.  Plaudits end there however.  The interior of the hotel is one of those dark brown, dim light affairs - that are designed so to hide the age and grime and general tatt.   One morning no hot water in the hotel had to resort to a cold shower - ouch!  Internet access poor and expensive.  In the room is a plethora of goodies for sale - beer, wine, snacks etc.  But the price is a joke - small bottle of water $8.  Bottle of average red wine $75!!  Who buys this stuff? There are better hotels around.;1

We were able to move to a ""renovated"" room the second night which was much larger.  This room had an armoir that was already warped and broken,  There was a hole in the carpet and the bathmat looked like it was cut out by a 2 year old.  The sink had two ""cold"" knobs.

A high level of service has come to be expected if not demanded. I do appreciate this can be very hard on hotels trying hard to exceed expectation.  It is therefore surprising when service did not attempt to meet requested customer expectation.  I booked this hotel since it was meant to give early Universal Studios admission in the Universal site. Once I was at the hotel I was told that this really admission was only valid when I bought the tickets through them. There was nothing they could do despite my being a hotel guest AND having purchased tickets for the same price they were selling them. Had that been around specified ahead then I would not have missed entering the park late with my family in labor day weekend.  In addition my children wanted to watch a Harry Potter movie;1

I had originally planned to travel on my own so had booked a single room, but about 3 weeks out, my wife and her friend decided to join me so I wrote to the email provided on the Windsor website that I needed a larger room capable of including a rollaway. When we arrived we were booked in a single so I asked if they had received my email (of course no - or at least they said they had not) so they had us move to a double. When we asked to have the rollaway, they said that that room was too small and they gave us a larger room. Each time, we had to lug our own luggage and pay an upgrade cost including the cost of the rollaway.

To all Scandinavian and European tourists do not stay at The New Yorker hotel! They have over billed my stay with more than USD 1,100. I settled everything when I left the hotel and was according to the receipt handed out promised a refund of  USD 329. Instead, they invoiced me an additional USD 831 after I asked for the refund.  They do not write back and when calling there is no proper answer to get.   Please spread the message to anybody you know so they can avoid being over billed by The New Yorker Hotel.   Also, worthwhile having in mind The New Yorker Hotel is placed in a bad neighborhood with a lot of homeless junkies in the street so not a pleasant place to walk home with your family in the evening.;1
My husband and I and some friends visited LA and stayed at this hotel for one night.  It only took one night for us to find another hotel to stay at for the rest of our stay in California.  The building needs to be updated, it is very old, I have allergies and could smell the mold in this place.  The staff at the front desk was as impersonable as a wet mop, it is obvious when you do not like your job.  The greeter at the restaurant was another card, my husband asked to look at a menu to see what they offered and instead he received a dirty look, unwanted attitude and was told the price of the buffet they had.  On another note, the room was ok except for the very worn carpet and obvious dirt stains and a cockaroach climbing up the curtains.  Please do not stay here, the attitude;1

This place was actually terrible. My team had booked 4 rooms here and received a confirmation email, but they were going to pay in person. When they arrived, the front desk girl said they had no rooms for them, and so they had to book a new hotel on the spot. My boyfriend and I had already paid for our room so we went up, the room was so small that we couldn't even open the door fully because the bed was in the way. There are communal bathrooms, and only a sink in the bedroom. They had no way of turning off the heat, only a tiny ceiling fan and a window. We asked the front desk girl if she could turn off the heat and she said no just use the fan. Excuse me?!!?!? Even with the window open and fan running the heat was intolerable. Also the walls were paper thin. Like I mean paper;1
I booked on their website. When I needed to change the reservation, the front desk said I didn't have a valid confirmation # from the hotel, that it came from a 3rd party and they couldnât help me.  What a rip off.  I had to talk to two different phone centers before they even put me through to the front desk.  I booked on their web site, not Priceline, Kayak, Trivago, Orbitz or Expedia but The NEW YORKER HOTEL A WYDHAM PROPERTY.  Moral of the story?  Skip the website and call your reservation in if you donât want to get ripped off.  Or just plain skip the New Yorker - there are plenty of other hotels in the city with wonderful ambiance, great service, and web sites THAT DONâT RIP YOU OFF!!!!!!!;1

The staff left two thread-bare sheets, but no mattress pad or blanket for the sofa bed.  We asked for a blanket twice, but never received it.   My mother ended up sleeping with her coat on.  After two days, my son and his wife offered to stay a night so we could get a night's sleep --- luckily for us, they hadn't seen the apartment.

When I decided on this apartment in expedia,  I was planning to cook breakfast and snacks while I stayed in NY. That was the biggest reason I chose this apt. This apt. is expensive and without such a merit(cooking meals)why did I choose it??  It was impossible to do that, however, because I can't cook seeing tens of roaches crawling about. My family including me was almost about to vomit.I couldn't sleep well because more and more roaches would crawl in the room if I put off the light. This hotel was the most terrible hotel I have stayed.  I told the concierge about this and even asked him to pass my note to the manager. Didn't he give my message to the manager?

First, there is 1 good thing about these apartments -- we really liked the location. Half a block from the subway, lots of restaurants, quite perfect for a family. But expect some problems. The service is definitely 'take it or leave it'. They really don't care very much what problem you have. They get your money in advance and you will never ever get any of it back. One of the little surprises was that the price you get quoted is a 'cash' price. Once you read the fine print you'll see they'll stick you with another 2.5% to use a credit card. Our room was reasonably clean although once there, they will only clean it for you if you stay more than a week and request it. We only saw cockroaches once thank goodness. Most things functioned and all the pots, plates, etc. were present.;1
I was really excited for the opportunity to stay here. After staying at a B and B my first trip to ny (pleasure), and at the Martinique on Broadway (westminister dog show stay) I thought a 4 star a little closer to Madison and Times Square would be amazing. I had two free nights with my rewards and paid for the other two nights. When I made my reservations I asked them to note that we had a dog in the room that is a therapy dog, I was advised the dog would be exempt from cleaning fees if I provided proof (no problem! Got that from St. John ambulance). I asked for an accessible room for more space. With a dog you can only book a metro room. I wanted to make sure we could put up the large crate (48 inches long, 30 inch wide) and all reviews said the room were tiny. So a week after;1
I booked here for a 12 day stay. I think I was misinformed by all the reviews as most guests usually stay here for 1 or 2 days maximum. It is intolerable to stay here for so long as I did. Firstly, the photos of the rooms do not represent the real situation. The room was quite dusty, the floor boards squeak all night and you can actually hear when the guest one floor above you flush the toilet.   What really pissed me off was that they thought I was a homeless guy staying at the shelter since my stay was so long. I was so embarrassed and they even thought I was doing something illegal that they insisted I allow them into the room as I usually tidy up and sanitise everything especially when it comes to having a child.   The housekeeping staff wipes everything in the toilet with;1
This was my second time staying at the Empire and will be my last. I typically do not write reviews, but I feel obligated to share my terrible experience. Upon check-in, the staff did not offer to help with luggage. I was traveling with my mom and daughter and we were definitely overloaded. The staff was downright rude at the front desk and we were duped into our accommodations. We were placed in an interior room with a âcourtyardâ views. We were told the room was quiet. Hahaha... Well, the view was of major piping, clearly the empire needs to do some landscaping, and from 6:30-past midnight our room was loud with banging noises because it was next to the staff room! No guest should EVER be placed in this room.I also called the front desk 2-3x with no answer. I had to go;1
What a horrifying 'hotel'!! This not a hotel but a hostel, they advertised it as a hotel. Rude and unprofessional staff including the 'manager Trevor'. Take a course in customer service for you and your staff and dress and speak properly to your guests. And as you can see, I write my review. Your threats dont work. Pubic hair in the shared bathroom, no soap, no toiletpaper. We stayed 3 nights here and I believe they only cleaned it once. Stains and hair on sheets and pillow. There is only the smell of food and weed in the hallways. Wifi barely works. No mirror in the room, no place to store your luggage. The rooms are way too small. This was just overall a gross place to stay and definately not worth your money. Will never ever come back to this filthy place and wont advice this;1

I spent a week in New York for thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family in an apartment. On what I thought was our last day my boyfriend and I got engaged and he surprised me with an extra night in NYC just the two of us. In addition to this he surprised me with a stay at the empire hotel, knowing I was a major gossip girl fan in its heyday!! I could not contain my excitement on all levels.  Upon arrival to the hotel I was impressed  with the lobby area. We checked in and the receptionist made conservation by asking how our stay so far has been in NYC, obviously beaming with joy I advised her we had gotten engaged, the receptionist dismissed our news and gave us our room key and left us to it. Once we arrived to the room I was disappointed with the size given the price but;1
Disclaimer: this is not a review of the rooms or other accoutrements of the hotel, which are likely just fine. I attended a large business function at this facility. The parking was validated /included- included in the price negotiated for the event I am assume. However, their underground parking height max. is about 2 inches lower than the top of my truck (I do not have fancy wheels, lifts, or 4wd). So I needed to valet. Their valet lot is a couple of inches higher, so my truck fits. Had this same problem last year and my parking was covered by them with zero issues.   This year, they charged me and an associate in the same predicament $22. We were there for approx.  Three hours. I spoke to hotel manager Thomas Cook who was the absolute opposite of;1

We knew it wouldn't be luxury but we just wanted a bed to sleep in - we weren't going to spend our time in the room. We had booked a double room with shared toilet/shower facilities. The room itself was ok and equipped with a fridge. The bed was not good - the buttons in the mattress poked into our backs and legs. To get a hot shower you need to get up REALLY early or late in the evening. It was really difficult to get a good nights sleep because of people slamming the doors and as there are tile floors everywhere sound travels really easy.;1

On booking the apartments they looked excellent.  We were 4 girls on a trip to NYC and had specified this - they promised us 4 single beds in an apartment and were charged per person for the stay.  When we arrived there very tired and bedraggled from our flight from London, we were confronted with 2 double beds - 3 nights sharing a bed with people you don't know very well is not conducive to a good holiday!  When we complained we were told that there was no more rooms available - having paid via the internet, there was nothing we could do - nothing was done to help or assist us in being more comfortable - the company want nothing to do with the complaint and neither do the booking agents hotels.com.  Beware of this company!;1
This was an almost terrible experience.  The only thing I can say that was appreciated was when we first given a room on the first level facing the street I asked if my husband I could be moved to another floor and they were able to accommodate us and they were very kind.  However, upon entering the room it reeked of cigarette smoke, the A/C was off so it was pretty hot in the room-I turned the air on but it was an old machine so it did not cool the room down enough, I found hair on the hand towel, body towel (cluster of hair), and in the shower, in the basket of toiletries I noticed that some of the items were already used.  The bed was comfortable, however because of the many situations that disgusted my husband and I it was hard to feel comfortable in the room.  Had my;1
"Where do we even begin? The hotel in and of itself is beautiful. HOWEVER, the service is exactly the OPPOSITE. We reach the rooftop to hang out with friends and enjoy ourselves, only to have by far the slowest and most unprofessional service ever. I get it, its New York, people will be tough, but as a native New Yorker I am disgusted and quite frankly deeply disappointed by the level of treatment provided to us at the rooftop and the failure of any appropriate follow up or accomodations. The location is ideal, however if you can shop around for a better hotel PLEASE do so. Absolutely a true waste of money. Website is highly misleading, there is no spa available and the pool was ""under renovation."" Not worth it.";1

I am an avid traveler who does not need 5 star accomadations to be happy, but I do expect to get what I pay for, and this was not the case... They did not tell me that hotel was on the outskirts of Hollywood, hard to find, and it was not anywhere I would walk around outside at anytime of the day, all of the business around had bars up on the windows and doors.    We found old strawberries in our fridge in the room, the beds were awful, they left signs in the bathrooms stating exactly what you would be charged if you stole one their sand paper towels, and another sign next to the toilet saying not to call them if you pluged it up.     The fron desk was also no help, I asked on Saturday what time Universal was open until, they told me 8:00 ( with little confidence) and after;1
Stayed last minute for a night, purchased off a travel website, when my flight was cancelled.  This place has seen better days and is not worth even the discounted prices.  Literally everything it's worn and chipped and stained.  From the chipped front desk to tattered amd stained drapes in the lobby to the wrinkles in the carpet in the halls to the threadbare velvet chair in the room to the outdated tv.  No internet. Pay for everything including a cup of Keurig coffee in the room. Wobbling toilet. Two paper cups is all you get. No real welcome from staff. Clearly an iconic property in a great location that has been let go. Cant wait to leave.;1

Tiny room, minimal services, and a very unresponsive staff when heat and AC didn't work. When repaired, it made an earsplitting roar that made sleep impossible. Great location -- but not a nice experience at all. Definitely will not return!;1
Frustrating! Weird smell in rooms and lobby, dirty walls, doors and carpet. Broken elevator. Unfortunately I paid 5 nights in advance.  Good luck with internet!  Nice staff, thank you Graciela for your help.;1
This hotel was awful. I couldn't bear to pay $400 for all the other hotels in Manhattan, however, after seeing our room and the shared bathroom in the hall, we left. The hotel was non-refundable, so we wasted our money on this hotel, while spending the money for another hotel. The bed was small, and not big enough to fit 2 people comfortably, while there was no heat, and even if there was, the window was broke so all the heat would have gone outside. Spend the extra money for a nicer place.;1

I normally donât do reviews, but I had to in this case. During our stay, the power went out. No problem, except that all elevators and lights went out too, including the emergency stairs. Had this been a fire, this would be a death trap. The owner cheaped out on safety, which is an absolute no for families. No backup generators or power, even for emergency situations. If this were my home state, this would be a massive safety violation. The room itself is okay, but lacks some simple amenities (like a coffee machine). The bathroom fixtures are nice, but poorly thought out (the shower, for example, will splash water all over the floor due to poor design). It just screams amateur. The staff transferred us to another hotel of the same ownership (the Moderne), and similar problems;1

My family and I recently stayed at this hotel. What can I say apart from it is appalling! From the moment you arrive at the New Yorker all they are interested in is getting your money. We were early and told that we could pay a $50 early check in fee. I asked if there was a place we could leave our bags and was told, yes no problem but it will cost you $5 per bag (we had 8!) so I payed the $50. The room, tiny. I know rooms in New York are small but these are smaller than usual. The rooms are tired and dark. The bath was chipped and tiles in the bathroom were broken. The hotel lobbies are dirty and in need of fresh wining up. I booked a car to take me to the airport and was charged  $130 to La Guarda, which is a 30 minute journey! I was told to pay cash otherwise it would cost me;1

The hotel was a little old but well kept. But the staff especially managing the transport and tours was absolutely disappointing , to say the least. We wanted to go for a day tour of LA on Saturday after Thanksgiving and booked a tour under this LA LA land tours company , based on superb recommendation by a Hilton staff manning the concierge. He even denies he gets anything from such recommendation. There were other options but this man persisted and said reviews from other travellers were great. However, on the day of the tour , half an hour before the tour were to commence, I got a call in my room to say that the said tour was cancelled and will have to be replaced by another arrangement requiring us to pay $55 per person per hour ( $165 for 3 persons per hour ) and we will;1

If you are staying at this Hilton anytime soon, beware!! I booked a corner room thru Hotels.com using rewards. What a waste! I was on business and brought my ten year old with me so we could have a little fun after working hours. When I checked in, I was told that the water would be shut off everyday of my stay from approx. 11am-4pm, the swimming pool is closed for renovations and we could walk to a nearby hotel to use their pool if we would like.   Our first morning we woke up to loud banging, sawing, music and talking from the floors above us at 7:45am. This made for an interesting morning as I was trying to conduct a conference call with my board members.

We called the desk and were informed that the cleaning staff sometimes open the door to help the floor dry and had likely been open for 10 hours; no apology, no inquiry if anything was missing.

Given its handy proximity to the centre of New York I was going to err on the positive when it came to writing this review even though I have stayed in more impressive 2* hotel. So I had planned to emphasise that the fact that the public areas and  room were kept lovely and clean. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful. HOWEVER the additional unexpected charge of the equivalent to Â£20 PER DAY called a FACILITY FEE totally overshadowed the few positives. I had already pre paid in a package deal for my 5 night stay. I had no extras in the very small basic double room which had no mini bar or drink making facility but on check out got an equivalent to Â£100 bill. When I questioned this I was told in a very abrupt manner that this was a facility fee for use of the business;1
"After pushing our way through the crowd of 20-somethings that splled out the front door- complete with thumping, 'trendy' music- we checked in with a woman at the front desk who, when asked what the line of people was all about, became defensive and quite rude. (Apparently there's a club called The Rooftop on the rooftop-- open till 4am-- but thankfully we couldn't hear anything from our room.) Our Room: We were alloted one hand towel each for the duration of our 4 day stay- old handtowels were removed but never restocked. I don't blame housekeeping, they seem to be working with what they have. Washcloths, too, were a rare commodity; but perhaps the most frustrating, and even dangerous part-- ZERO bath mats. Not even one to sop up the water that sprayed all over the";1
I was told that there were no extra charges on checking out but then was emailed a bill for an extra $30 on my way home. Teas and coffees are apparently not complementary though this is not clearly advertised and the reception/customer service team will not overturn the bill. The bathroom door was rotten and the bathroom generally worn out. There was a chocolate peanut from a previous resident on our floor. The dust on the bedside light was thick. They do not provide hyperallergenic pillows as standard. The pool was still not operational. There were no bathrobes, as advertised on the website. The aircon unit was dirty and could not be controlled.  I stay regularly in New York and I won't be returning to this hotel.;1
I have to assume that this hotel is undergoing renovations so some get clean modern rooms and some get beat-up rooms with sad mismatched grandma furniture, carpet with mysterious stains, and the kind of bathroom that make you keep your shoes on.   My son and I got the second kind. It was probably meant to be the room designated for wheelchair users. It was big and had a roll-in shower with a plastic bench. The bathroom floor was so uneven that I'd be afraid a person with balance or mobility issues would go down.   The room smelled vaguely of smoke and air freshener. There was no wifi. The TV was the chunky kind.   The elevator smelled smoky enough that my clothes stank. There was wifi in the lobby. The employees at the desk were nice.   Based on my experience, two-and-a-half;1
Our travel agent booked this establishment for us. So disappointed as the place is filthy and had the noisiest box window aircon ever. We have since read other reviews and seems our troubled stay is mild in comparison but none the less horrible. I can't believe Wyndam can continue advertising this hotel. Other than a laundry right across the road there isn't much going for this hotel. It's dirty, run down and the majority of staff it's a bother to them if you interrupt their day. Do yourself a favor and pay approx $100 extra a night and stay at a gorgeous establishment closer to Time Square. You will easily spend that each day catching cabs to and from downtown if you stay here. Plus very few places to eat and no restaurant facilities in hotel. Very very basic amenities. Feels;1
This is by far one of the most terrible hotels I have stayed at.Customers concerns are not addressed and played down.I would not recommend this hotel.The laundry is permanently out of order...... We were sold a luxury room but given something other than luxury.Also there is no entertainment and the pool is not inviting.;1

"This hotel was recommended by friends who stay there a lot and have never had any problems.  We liked the price and loved the location.  The room on the 4th floor had no view but appeared clean (although it did have a heavy ""lemon cleaner"" smell)  with a renovated bathroom.  Pillows looked new, sheets were clean (and changed every day, which made it harder for us to recognize the problem that we had...read on).  Hot water was fine as was the TV.  And it was very quiet (although it was so hot at night that we had to turn on the AC).  Everything seemed okay until the bed bugs struck.  I didn't get bit but my partner was bit all over.  And it was so bad, that he had to go to the doctor when we returned home.  Needless to say, I would not stay there again - which is too bad because";1
It was a disappointing stay, a great location but the room was overpriced and really small. We needed a roll away - which cost $50 per night- and literally no space to put it in the room. Made a small request for the room & they either forgot itâll didnât care. I see other people on here commenting on the dated look of the hotel. That part at least to me isnât as big of a deal as customer service. And the New Yorker just didnât do well in that category. I definitely wouldnât stay there again.;1
Rooms are very old. Especially bathroom. Very noisy too. Never use valet parking.they charge additional 40% fee and they do not say. You learn when you are paying it. Beds are old small. Very good place though.;1
"I chose this hotel solely because of the ""free onsite parking"".  The parking was not onsite.  It was two blocks away. and it was also $124.26 for three days.  Hardly ""free"".  I even called ahead of time to check and make sure that parking was included. I was assured by the Hotel contact person that it was, and that I would be given a ""voucher"" for parking. Turns out, the so called ""voucher"" is only for a discounted rate at the parking garage two blocks over.  This is blatant false advertising. The front desk staff was apologetic. The lovely front desk staff member was kind and understanding.  But the Hotel Management really needs to address this blatant false advertising.  The hotel room itself was very clean, albeit dated and small.  Cannot complain about that, as space is";1

"Booked hotel for a week during Christmas 2017 and it was a complete disappointment. I booked and was charged for a non smoking ""double queen"" room because I needed two queen sized beds. When we arrived we were told that a double queen in ""hotel lingo"" means one queen sized bed only and that if I wanted two beds the price would go up $20 per night. I had never heard of that and explained it to the manager that my reservations were made and paid for a couple of months in advance.  After a lot of unpleasant discussion they agreed to give us a double ""full-size bed"" room for the same price.  When we opened the room it smelled of cigarette smoke, really strong. I had to go out and get air-freshener to be able to breathe there. Needless to say, after such a unpleasant experience I";1

"Stayed for 3 days in early March, when NY temperatures were around 46F (8C), typical for this time of year.  In the absence of any instructions in my room for the rather decrepit-looking air conditioner, I naively asked at reception how to work it.  ""Don't bother, you won't get any heat out of it"", was the cheery response, ""There's no heating on in the hotel as it's not cold enough"" (!)  And of course that meant no ventilation either, as it was too cold to sleep with the window open.  How a hotel can operate like this in the 21st century is beyond me.";1
Arrived at the property at 3:00 a.m. due to a complicated flight and was charged for overnight parking from the prevevious day eventhough I arrived a day later $28.

That would have been acceptable for the location of the property, but the room carpeting... eeew! The lobby carpeting looked allot cleaner, less stains for sure!  The bed, ugh! not comfortable probably left over from the last decade, not a pillow top. Just a plain old, really uncomfortable old bed. And to top if off, the toilet paper!

You donât get rooms cleaned in 5 day stay once. Excuse Covid rules. Asked them to clean the room left room for the whole day and no cleaning.

Instead of keeping it clean better then ever before that should be the rule. Asked for the copy of the policy they were not able to provide me with anything pretty sad and pathetic what you get now says, specially from the Hilton.

I really wanted to like this place because of the location-but dealing with  roaches as part of the vacation package is just too much.  Wish I would have read the other write-ups before booking.

"Mmmm where to begin. I was critical of New York's pod 51 for it's small rooms and even smaller beds but the Jane is on another level. The room size is just a joke. There is no room to get out of the tiny bed let alone open the door to get out of your hobbit hole. And the mattress is of such poor quality I still have severe back pain days after checking out (I have never had back pain before so I know this was caused by the bed here).  To add insult to injury due to a ""computer glitch"" my debit card was charged random payments several times during my 2 night stay leaving me out of pocket and financially inconvenienced yet despite reassurances that this money would be refunded immediately to date, some 5 days later, I still haven't received a cent.

I would like to lodge a complaint against the Morningside Inn 235 107th St New York, NY.

We were told there had been a mistake and they had no rooms.  We were told this happens frequently.

Unfortunately, the Jane has some permanent residents, and the rules regarding no smoking in rooms common to other hotels do not apply.  I found the small rooms fine, the shared bathrooms were clean though at the edge of their preserved life; the bed was comfortable; and the heater was more than sufficient, but I really could not deal with the smoke coming from the room directly opposite.

The rooms are too small, almost claustrophobic. It is a rundown building. Everything looks so bad and even I didn't find anything like rats or cockroaches  my impression that I would any time. The staff is nice. It is not their fault. I paid for three nights but I stayed only two. I moved to another hotel and pay for accommodation again. It is really bad!;1
If you want the true Gritty Urban Realism experience in New York, then this is the place for you.  All the thrills of a tenement house--no heat, no water, paper-thin walls, greasy overcooked food smells coming from the community kitchens, doors with questionable locks, a creaky ancient elevator with barely room for two, and non-responsive management that is sullen at best, belligerant and bullying at worst.  Want cable tv?  Go to the basement.  Want a washcloth?  Bring your own.  Make sure your credit card isn't charged until you check out.   Hotel it is not.  I wouldn't even kennel my dog here.  Do yourself a tremendous favor and book a room at the Days Inn down the road (about 8 blocks).  This dump doesn't even rate one circle on the experience scale.  I can't say this;1

Let's start with the positives and there are only two:  location and Rudy who I believe was an overnight manager.    I just returned from a one week stay and would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor will I ever think to return again.   Upon check-in I asked to be on a lower level floor simply because if I need to get out, I want out sooner than later.  I was placed in an interior room on the 1st floor.  Like others have said the room was small (not a big deal this time because I was alone).  But, the view was the interior of the building where all the air conditioning units in the entire building converged.   It sounded much like a Jet Blast the entire to night.  To make matters worse when I pulled down the sheets to inspect the bed (yes, I do this everywhere I go) there was;1
I want to preface this review by saying that I do not normally take the time to write reviews.  However, I am so disgusted that I feel compelled to share our experience with this hotel. We had a VIP event at Universal Studios as part of my daughter's  21st birthday celebration.  I booked two upgraded alcove king rooms on the 20th floor for the four of us to stay, the night prior to our Universal Studios event.  We booked this hotel based on the proximity of the hotel to Universal Studios.  When we arrived, only one room was available (which was fine), so we dropped our baggage off in the room that was available. The view was nice (windows filthy) but the room seemed tired. Being in a rush to leave to got to  Beverly Hills, we did not really look too closely at the entire room;1
The only thing good about this place is its location. Beautiful park around the corner, couple of pubs down the road for a pint and extremely close to the bus stop and underground station. However, everything else was appalling... Shocking service, crappy and dirty room, disorganized cafeteria and don't get me started on the wifi... Utterly ridiculous... Expensive and slow... Please find another place, don't stay here;1
"This place was kind of like staying in the Twilight Zone. My time here was pretty bizarre.   1.) They charge you for everything, like their overpriced parking lot and a lot of other random fees.  2.) The pictures make this place look A LOT nicer. I think they must have like one or two ""updated"" rooms, because this place is kind of scrubby and 80s feeling.   But, now to the ""bizarre"". Some of the staff members were lovely. But, I had a late check out time, since I was staying for work and wouldn't be available at the appropriate time. To which I got a, ""sure, no problem"".  Fast forward to 5 o'clock. I'm locked out of my room. They give me a temporary key to pack up my things. But, a few minutes later, they're banging on my door, SWAT team style, saying I have to leave like right";1
"It turns out (after getting glares from the actual tenants who live in this building) that tourists are not only unwelcome here, but being put into these rooms ILLEGALLY. In other words, the city could come in and shut down the illegal hotel at any minute and put all of the paying tourists out on the street. What then? Not to mention that it turned out the nasty glares we were getting from the residents were because the landlords had evicted low income elderly tenants in order to illegally rent their homes out to people like us, paying lots more money. The whole thing is a nasty, dirty scam that made me feel really badly that I helped reward these awful people for breaking the law and breaking up families.  And there there were the prostitutes doing ""business"" out of the rooms";1

"While we were not expecting deluxe accommodations, for $130 per night, we did expect a safe, comfortable room. Unfortunately, loosing our reservations was just the tip of the iceberg.The manager, Patrick, acted like he was doing us a favor to find us a room. His behavior was rude and disrespectful, telling me to leave him alone so he could get his work done. The spartan furnishings were tolerable, but many other shortcomings were unacceptable: the doors to the room barely latched; the smoke detector had no batteries; the blankets were lightweight and there was no heat to turn on; tepid water arrived only after leaving the water running for 20 minutes. Both my daughter and I were charged for the same room and the refund I was promised ""the next day"" was not forthcoming by the";1
Unless you think that sleeping on the streets is too good for you, then you should avoid this nightmare on Central Park West. Once you start looking, there is no end to the grime, the broken equipment, the dodgy repairs and the lack of fire safety measures... such as Exit Lighting or fire detection. On top of that, the service at the front desk was just dreadful and lacking any common sense. AVOID at all costs.  And generally speaking, make sure that your hotel booking is not firm - inspect your room and the amenities before you let anyone charge your credit card.;1
The hotel is in a convenient location for getting around the sights of New York and accessing public transport, even if the neighbourhood itself isn't the most appealing.  The hotel is rather run down and the rooms fairly small, albeit that is reflected in the price (generally cheaper than other central NY hotels).  All this would probably have given a 3 star rating. However about a week after I returned I checked my credit card statement to find they had taken a $60 charge from my account (which I had not authorised). Bizarrely the charge was dated a couple of days after we had checked out and was for valet parking (we didn't take a car). There was no mention of the charge at check out.  The money was refunded (or 'adjusted' to use their words) after some email correspondence,;1
We stayed at the Empire hotel between the 16 - 19 March 2012.  On our last night we ate a meal at the Ed's restraunt which is located within the hotel.  When it came to settling the bill we split the bill between ourselves and another couple.  Half the bill was paid in cash and we requested $80 be charged to our room.  When we checked out the following morning we noticed on our invoice that we had in fact been charged for the entire bill of $153.  We attempted to rectify this with recption upon checking out only to be told that their systems were down and there was nothing the could do to amend this at the time and we should send an email to them.  Immediately upon returning home we sent an email as directed.  This was never acknowledged in anyway.  We send follow up emails and;1
Seriously, I understand that New York is expensive and Jane's cheap price is what lured me into but if you can add extra $20-$30 a night please do and stay somewhere better. Pocket rooms and shared showers is its key so I'm not criticizing that but the whole hotel has a terribly unpleasant smell all through out and it's easy to notice that people staying there are simply weird or obviously on a budget. I feel bad for myself and wouldn't recommend anyone this experience.;1
"We paid extra money for a room with two queen-sized beds, but they put us in a room with two double beds instead.  When I politely mentioned this to the people at the front desk, they told me that ""hotel queen beds are actually smaller than real queen beds"" and acted like I didn't know what I was talking about.  They were rude, smug, and completely unprofessional, and refused to correct their error.  The elevators are very slow and work about half the time.";1

I don't like to give bad reviews but this time we have no choice. First, it's winter time, the weather was 14 Fahrenheit but still, you have the damn mobile A/C unit at the window, that keeps you from closing it. No need to say it was really cold inside the room. And the noise... horrible. We couldn't sleep. At one point, it was 4:00am and we just decided to pack and leave.  We will certainly never come back in here.;1
The rude staff was awful. Nobody could even use a kind tone. They were short and spoke to adults as though they are children and nobody smiled. They could not be bothered. The place was dingy and the area wasnât so much desirable. We wonât come back to this hotel.;1

Very unpleasant. The images placed online are very misleading. The rooms are tiny, bathroom is very old fashioned and lobby needs some major cleaning. Not to mention, my sheets had hair that did not belong to me nor my boyfriend. Seems like the housekeepers aren't doing their jobs very cautiously. I also had an incident in the lobby where as any other guest should go up to their room waiting in the elevator banks an employee,a middle aged African American lady, approached me. She asked me to pull out my state issued id as there were about 10 other people surrounding me. Then she also asked me to show her my hotel room key.

Myself and 3 friends stayed here for a big 30th celebrations! We couldnt have been more disappointed, after spending a long time looking forward to it.  We had a long journey over from the UK and spent a while getting through immigration and battling the traffic from JFK, so when we arrived we wanted to check in as quickly as possible and just relax. This wasn't meant to be. We were greeted by a member of staff at the front desk who asked me for my ID and a credit card to secure the booking, this was provided but unfortunately the card was not cleared. Instead of trying to find an alternative solution, the service given instantly changed to highly patronising and he made absolutely no attempt to fix our issue. Instead we suggested a solution to the problem which led to him;1

Every time I have stayed at this hotel (3 rooms total), I have not felt confident of the cleanliness.  There were stains on the couches in all 3 rooms, the shower had hair on the floor (not just one strand of hair) and the overall presentation of the room was unexceptional.  There wasn't even complimentary lotion on the bathroom counter, not that it's necessary to provide that, but it is generally anticipated at an establishment like this.  There was only one bath towel and the lamp glared on the television.  Overall, I felt very hesitant to touch anything from the elevator to the inside of my room.;1
At $140 a night, even in Manhattan, I would expect a reasonably comfortable bed and clean linens. Our bed had springs that cut into our backs, there was no mattress cover, and the towels and washcloths were stained. Euw. Hallways are narrow, dark, and a little smelly. The hotel advertised Internet service, but most of the time it could only be accessed in the lobby. People stand around in the lobby and sit all over the stairs to check their email, because the management apparently doesn't see fit to place chairs in the lobby. The front desk staff was not unfriendly, but not friendly either. They basically ignore the guests. We saw staff sleeping a couple of times. The hotel has minimal security, as the front door is always open, and the staff is not alert. What DOES this hotel;1
It was a disappointing stay, a great location but the room was overpriced and really small. We needed a roll away - which cost $50 per night- and literally no space to put it in the room. Made a small request for the room & they either forgot itâll didnât care. I see other people on here commenting on the dated look of the hotel. That part at least to me isnât as big of a deal as customer service. And the New Yorker just didnât do well in that category. I definitely wouldnât stay there again.;1

Currently staying at this hotel and would not recommend to anyone.  The rooms are tiny and very dirty. Myself and partner( who has asthma) are very irritated by the dust in the room. We expected a small room but there is nowhere to put your clothes apart from a disgusting set of drawers and tiny cupboard which I wouldnât dream of putting my belongings in.  The maids are extremely rude! with the amount of noise they make. They were talking very loudly outside our room at 8.30am this morning. We arenât usually long sleepers but we had an early start the day before and were hoping to sleep a little later this morning.

Let me start by saying that we rely on hotel reviews in selecting where to stay when travelling and we have been very grateful to all who have contributed.  The Hollywood hotel had reasonable reviews and we stayed there recently for 6 nights on our round the world trip.   We were given a ground floor room at the end of a corridor which was very noisey, the hard marble floor and main street outlook did not lend them selves to a peaceful sleep. We had recently stayed in a hotel in Union Square in San Francisco so the mix of homelss and night people was not a surprise.   Around the middle of our stay we returned to our room at approx 10pm to find that the ground floor sliding doors had been left open.  We had not opened them at all during our stay. We telephoned reception;1
I stayed here on two separate occasions, in two different rooms, in February. The first time I stayed on the 6th floor, I found a bed bug that had already sucked my blood and killed it. The second time I stayed on the 2nd floor, I got lucky and found it before it got me. The room itself seemed very dirty. The corners of the walls had white powder all over it. The powder was probably pesticide. The mattress itself had crusty brown spots from previous bed bug infestations. The carpet does not seemed to be vacuumed or steam cleaned in a long while. If you decide to stay here, remember to keep your luggage and clothes off the floor and chair as bed bugs can get into your luggage. Not the souvenir you want to take home with you as they can then infect your house/apt. The location of;1

Hopefully some reporter or NY city official will read this and do something about this company.   PLEASE, stay away or rather run away as fast as you can from this place.;1
I recently was visiting new york and decided to stay here, (HORRIBLE CHOICE) anyways as soon as i got there it smelled like a barbershop, the room was really small, and smelled of cigarette smoke. Also i found a COCKROACH on the nightable. I showed the people at the front desk, and demanded a refund, i checked out that night and stayed at different hotel. This hotel also wanted to keep $199 for the first night, and i was only at the hotel for literally 40 minutes.;1

Unfortunately, the negative reviews are right: this is a rather depressing place. The carpets are dirty and reek of smoke, the wall paper is stained and peeling down, and the plumbing seems to be in want of repair: In the adjacent room, the toilet was flushing every two minutes and then shutting down with a lout thud. Also, the mattress had a deep gap and the sheets were too small to cover them fully. The only good thing about this hotel is the location on the UWS.;1
"Like the people in the most recent reviews, I have also been trying to get a refund for my stay that I couldn't complete because the hotel was closed.  I booked a trip in March and have been going back and forth in emails for EIGHT MONTHS trying to get my refund. Each time, I am just told that my refund request has been sent to ""upper management"". At this point, I hesitate to believe any management exists at this property.  It is just a run-around with no resolution. These people have probably gotten away with taking dozens, if not more, people's money... during a pandemic when people need their money the most.   Horrible customer service, horrible policies, and most likely horrible people. I never leave bad reviews for places, but I felt like I should warn others. I have been";1
"This hotel is one of the worst hotels that  I have stayed in lately. ( I am a frequent traveler) I would not recommend it to anyone.  The area is a medical district. Not for tourism. Very seedy.  Far away from tourist areas.  Reception are very abrupt. Not at all helpful.  The building is old. Maintenance is ok.  What you expect for their ratings.  In the rooms you have soft plastic cups. And only one each, per stay.  No glasses available. I was told to go buy them at the nearby store!! Car parking is us$28.00 per night. (Compared to us$25 per day for our hire car) The last day, we returned to our room & found the housemaid had locked herself into our room. And when we entered, our bags had been searched!! Thankfully only a small amount of money was missing.  The only positive;";1
"Yes, I'm writing this a little late in the game, but being that Christmas is coming up, I thought I better warn people.  The Hilton is lovely to look at (the lobby).  However, what everyone else says is true - they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING - parking, internet, you name it.  Sad that such an ""established"" hotel must do this.  Yes, it is close to Universal, but so is the Sheraton.  In fact, if you have a car (most people do in LA - even a rental for vacation), stay somewhere else.  Universal is not that hard to get to from basically anywhere in LA.  Oh, and as for the ""fancy"" dining, there was none here.  At breakfast (which is not complimentary unless you're one of their members) in their restaurant, they serve a very large buffet.  You also have the option of choosing";1
LOVED NEW YORK, but hated everything about this dirty hole.  Being clean people, we didn't appreciate the filth, grime and general heavy traffic this place had to offer. We did make friends with a few roaches that came out from behind the so called cooking area but I would have prefered to have ferritted around the bins to prep a meal. We even ended up going out on the first day and buying cleaning stuff as it made us feel better about staying there because the staff shall we say 'didn't care, and hadn't got a clue.   Certainly won't be fooled by the 'stay in an appartment' vibe that we fell for and will ALWAYS book a reputable hotel chain from now on. Lesson learned!  My annoyance was that we had booked this for a special occasion - I was stuck in the dilema of kicking up a;1

On Saturday July 16, 2022, my family and I visited Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport for a two night stay. We had two rooms 1001 and 1002. Upon entering our room we noticed stains on the furniture. They were really noticeable to the point were my husband and I wouldnât sit on it. The other room were my other family members were in had the same exact problem with stains. We all went down to the front desk to complain and hopefully get another room. They gave us rooms 1050 and 1062. We went into those rooms and it was worse then our previous rooms. It had a weird smell, hand prints on the window and stains on the furniture. So went back to the front desk to see if there were other rooms and there werenât. So my Husband and I ask for our original room 1001 back and my;1
I stayed 5 nights at Days Inn Hotel on 94th St. The hotel, including lobby and rooms are badly in need of repair. Carpet and upholstery are so old and dirty it's creepy.  Owners are  taking advantage of a tight hotel market and their clientele Photos are deceiving. I paid an average of $343.00 per night. Amenities were zero. No place to put your clothes. - no dresser. Ice machine broken.  The hotel seemed full and the clientele was nice. Owners have no excuse to run a hotel like this. It's an open front door and anybody can walk in from the street and go up in the elevators. No security. Room phone did not work. This was a shock.;1
If you want to be able to sleep, don't stay here.  There's a nightclub in the building and it's open until 4:00 am. I have earplugs in and the music is so loud that I can still hear it. The room is cold and there's no way to control the heat. It's 1:45 am, guess I'll lie here shivering all night.;1

I arrived to the hotel on December 30, 2019 on December 31, 2019 the housekeeping staff was changing the rollover bed because it was damaged. When they were opening the new bed the back part on it felt on my toe resulting in an injury I reported to Michael front desk manager he introduced me to Jack manager of security he brought me some ice packs and he said to me that any medical cost the hotel wasnât going to cover them if I wanted an EMS or some X-Rays I should pay for them. Apparently they made a report but they never provided it to me and I ask for it and they said it was confidential documents. I wasnât able to go to the Ball Drop because of the injury, tried to walk a little bit but it was imposible to do so. I asked for a wheelchair and I could move my self a little bit;1

The room was very small with very poor harsh lighting. The closet couldn't be opened all the way because of the over sized desk, and there was no lighting in the closet for the safe, so had to use my phone's flashlight for that. The bathroom didn't close all the way and the glass shelf above the towels had calcified water stains on it.

This is my first ever review. It was booked based on a recommendation and we were really disappointed with the service. Check in was at 4, we checked our bags at lunchtime and arrived back at 5 to it still not ready. It was suggested we wait in another family member's room and it would be ready at 6 and given a breakfast coupon. 6.20 and still no word so I called reception to be told they had to check with housekeeping and call me straight back. We had travelled from Ireland and waiting in my mothers room who at this stage was really tired and we wanted to get out of the way. I called again in 20 minutes to be told same thing. I got annnoyed at this stage and was assured it was the Manager I was speaking to and she would get back to me. At 7pm we left the room to go down to;1
DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE - booked a 2 night stay and paid in full in advance.  Unable to use the first night as delayed with travelling, phoned and advised the hostel.  Arrived on Saturday at 11pm exhausted only to learn that room had been re-sold and was full.  The room had been paid for in ADVANCE... at 3am offered a disgusting room, a bed that had been slept in and sheets not changed, pants and socks in the bed already!!!!! NASTY - JUST NASTY - Not even worth the 1 star, sadly you can't post without it!!!   Oh and lots of comings and goings with single men and multiple different women - make of that what you will;1
For an airport hotel, this place blew me away. Very modern, clean, and spacious. Food was good too. The free airport shuttle runs frequently and our driver was probably the best person we encountered on this trip. If you use Silver Car, the pickup/drop off area is within walking distance from the hotel so that was a big plus for us. Service was horrendous from start to finish. Hyatt status was not recognized at check in and no upgrade offered until I asked for it and the girl checking me seemed annoyed that she had to redo my keys and find a better room. Restaurant servers were very curt and unfriendly. The waitress rudely informed us that there is no kids menu so just tell her what we want  and she'll see what they can do. At breakfast, we charged our food to the room and then;1
"I stayed here November 2004.  The location is absolutely amazing, though the hotel is gross!  The elevators are scary and very slow.  The room was dirty, ie stains on walls, dirty carpet, mold in bathroom, etc.  The most disturbing part of the stay was seeing a cockroach climbing up the wall next to the bed.  When I booked the room online through the hotel website, it stated that local calls were free.  Well, they weren't.  I was charged for every call and by the minute.  When I got back home I e-mailed ""Choice Hotels"" customer service and I was refunded the money for all the local calls.  All that I can say is I believe all the negativity in the reviews I read!";1

"I don't usually give poor reviews but I was utterly surprised at the lack of personal service and lack of amenities at the hotel.  Pricing was outrageous for what you receive.  I waited over 20 minutes to check in, even with Hilton honers check in.  I explained to Ariel that this was the longest check in I can remember given there were only two guests in front of me and two front desk staff.  He supposedly upgraded me to a room on the 9th floor.  The reservation I had originally reserved was overlooking Universal.  Instead I was ""upgraded"" to a freeway view and unkempt room with no trash can liners.  Most disappointing of all was the cost and lack of amenities.  I know its LA, but I live in California and travel often.  There were few options for dinner other than a $54/person";1

Right from the beginning, I did not get a good feel.  Walked in and the doorman was sleeping in the chair.  The receptionist was friendly, however, the desk area was a MESS and she was disorganized along with the cabinets and drawers.  Holes in the wall behind the desk.  No cards for room keys.  Elevator opened and it was stuffed with garbage bags - STINKING and a housekeeper. The lights in the halls don't even have shades.  Doors propped open with towels.  Case of water torn open and left on the floor.  Beds had hair in them along with stains on the comforter. Window air conditioners that were not professionally installed!  TERRIBLE!

We checked in to our suite, the couches were filthy and stained, the bar area had a garbage bin that was overflowing with trash that had probably been there for weeks.

This is my 3rd time in the hotel, and I had a very high regard for it, due to its great location and quality (that's why I kept coming back). I am currently in room 1114.   At the check-in, I paid and everything went very well.  In my 2nd day at the hotel, I came back at 10 pm, after a long day out in the city, just to realize that my room had not been cleaned.   At first, I thought this was a mistake, so I went to clarify this to the reception.   The host kept insisting that whomever had helped me with the check-in had told me that, due to COVID, rooms are being cleaned up every 3 days. I replied this was not true since, had I known that, I would not have stayed here!   I found this disrespectful and annoying, plus, I had never heard that lack of room hygiene is good to prevent;1

This is a completely rubbish hotel, despite all the assurances given by Curt, the front office mgr. about how hard they are striving to improve, in other reviews.  All of that is complete fiction.  Room 826 was filthy, the staff was completely indifferent, and if I could give it negative stars I would gladly do so.  There were burn marks in the carpet, hardened gum deposits in the carpeting, a ring of dust/dirt around the baseboards and the decades-old furniture was scratched beyond repair.  The room looks out on an air shaft, so it is hard to tell night from day.  The windows are filthy.  The elevators are creaky and slow.  At over $300/night including tax this is an insult to the word hotel.  Flop-house would be a more accurate description.  It is a great location across the;1

This place is absolute garbage. We paid several thousand dollars for a table on my birthday last night. At one point I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air with a friend. When I tried to go back in, the bouncer (apparently named Dionisio- the one with all of the other horrendous reviews) looked my friend and I up and down and just said no and told us to leave. This is outrageous. This man has absolutely no business telling me I wasn't worthy of entering back into his club. I can promise I will go out of my way to make it my life mission to make sure as many people as possible know to never ever waste their time going to this place. To treat someone who paid that amount of money the way to Jane did is unconscionable. Dionisio should be immediately fired and the Jane shut;1

I used to stay here frequently, but everything about WooGo has gone WAY downhill!   Stay away.    I made a reservation on-line with WooGo - they lost it.    I called and spoke to Amy at WooGo, she re-made the reservation, but when I arrived the desk couldn't find my reservation.    Guess what, the reservation of THREE other parties couldn't be found either as we all were stuck in the lobby.    WooGo's solution - put us in more expensive rooms.   The old BAIT AND SWITCH.    They lure you in with lower price rooms, then say they aren't available.    Everyone in the lobby had to pay more.   More bait and switch.    They charge 2.5% on credit cards and demanded cash payment - multiple hundreds of dollars since their credit card machine was 'not working'.    They made me fill out;1
"The negative comments regarding this 'hotel' are completely justified. My partner and I stayed for 9 hellish nights in late July 2014 dispite the mixed reviews.

We had no bedside lamps (even after asking we still had to buy our own to use for reading at night) the ""widescreen"" television was a tiny 28cm old box hanging losely on the wall with cables stuffed behind it and had very poor reception. The floor was filthy, the walls cracked and mildued - as were the shared bathrooms (warning to wear flip flops in shower). The room was so tiny the door almost hits the bed when you open it. There is no fresh air and the tiny view outside is of a dirty ally with a filthy stench. The bedroom doors have very poor security";1
The location on 71st Street, West is great.  It's only a 2 minute walk to the subway and you can coast all the way to mid- and down-town.  The area is residential and quiet, so you don't have honking cars, loud traffic or throngs of people and the west riverside front is nice to see.  We booked 1 room with 2 twin beds.  The man on the front desk gave us a choice of the 2nd or 7th floor.  I asked which was was better and he said the 2nd floor hallway had a funny smell.  The 7th floor was a [--] to get to, because of the slow old-school elevator.  The room was relatively clean.   There were no bed bugs, but I did see 1 or two imbedded stains on the clean towels and a random hair on the sheet that seemed to have been knotted during the laundry process.  The room included a tiny;1

This was the worst hotel Iâve stayed in in years yet one of the most expensive.  The room was run down, uncomfortable and felt overall dirty because of its state.  Even though we were on the 24th floor, the windows may have been the original and we could hear all street sounds.  The sheets were scratchy and beds felt like a brick.  I would not recommend-far better hotels in NYC for the same price.  I thought Wyndham had a standard but if this is it, I wonât stay at one again.;1
"DO NOT BELIEVE THE WEBSITE! There is NO air conditioning. Final warning. There is a ""thermostat"" on the wall in the room. However, this controls the fan only. There is NO setting for A/C or heat. The HVAC system utilized in this building is the old ""Water Type"", meaning that water tubes are ran throughout the building, instead of air ducts. The fans in each room blow air over the tubes. The temperature of the air is determined by the temperature of the water in the tubes. Heat rises. So in reality, the higher the floor, the hotter the air.

The staff are very friendly and try to be accomodating however I am sure they are challenged daily because there is alot wrong with the hotel in general, jarring elevators, no wifi or cable, the room is shabby and the housekeeping leaves alot to be desired.  As a native New Yorker I can tell you there is alot going on in this hotel that has less to do with business but more to do with pleasure.  I was unhappy with my room and received a full refund.;1
"I stayed here for my brothers wedding in April 2010. Travelling with a small baby we did have our reservations but nothing could prepare us for the nightmare that would follow. Arriving at the hotel at 7pm we were keen to get to our room and get our baby to sleep. We had emailed a request for a cot to be present in the room and also rang ahead to confirm this was the case. We were told that there was no record of this on the booking. However a cot would arrive straight away. 2 hours later following 10 visits to an empty front desk and having been repeatedly been told ""it's in the lift"" or even better ""they are in the corridor"" (whilst I walked around the corridor unable to spot the invisible cot). Eventually it arrived with a now hysterical child beyond comfort. We had booked a";1

I don't know who would give this hotel 4 stars. Staying in the Empire rooms is like sleeping on a smokey airplane. The website photos are completely misleading. This hotel is dirty. The walls and carpets reek of cigarette smoke. At night cigarette smoke leaks under your hotel door so much that we had to lay down towels to block the smoke from coming into the room. And every morning the bathroom stinks of cigarette smoke. Where is the cigarette smell coming from? The walls are paper thin. You can hear everything going on, on the other side of your door. The air units in the room are terribly old and do not function properly, blowing out dirty warm air, so the only thing to do is leave your screenless windows open and be forced to listen to the incredibly loud sounds of the city;1
This hotel misses the mark. There is no shortage of hotels in NY but the time it takes to select a quality hotel is daunting. We stayed in room #416 for 5 days and will never return. The room itself felt very dank and dreary. The front room looked like it had been pried open with a crowbar and slammed loudly each time it was closed. There is not adequate lighting in the bathroom which makes it very difficult to apply makeup, shave or groom your self. Our room had a TERRIBLE view which overlooked a disgusting alley and mangled outdoor building equipment. There also weren't enough outlets to plug electronics. The shower had mildew around the perimeter and the floor was always soaked because there isn't a shower door. The TV channels did not come in clearly and took about 5 minutes;1
"My husband and I stayed at the hotel, and on returning to the hotel for the night, while getting ready for bed, we discovered that my retainer was not in the bathroom where I left it - in a cup soaking, as I had done every night of our stay.

Martin? couldnât be bothered. Both refused to do anything claiming we had to talk to the daytime manager - I needed my medical appliance that night. The longer we waited, the more likely it would be unable to find. They claimed there was no night manager. I asked who they would call if they had a problem; apparently no one, which makes this an unsafe hotel. No one is in";1

I have been staying at The New Yorker since 1996.  I have stayed in excess of 30 times, and frequently as long as 3 weeks in duration.  I have been honored to have worked with Carola Peppe, Patricia Ryan and, best of all, Madeline Marte -- all excellent  reservation specialists who ALWAYS managed to secure Suite 4005 for me.  This suite is, in my opinion, the best in the building.  On the 40th floor south-east corner, it looks directly at the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from the east, and all the way down to the Statue of Liberty from the south: definitely the most spectacular New York City view I have seen, including from some of the famous landmarks.  Unfortunately, the hotel has gone steadily downhill since it was purchased by Wyndham.  Since I always got;1
The room was disgustingly dirty, as was the bathroom. The floors, walls, furniture.. EVERYTHING was crawling with filth. There was no security and we felt extremely unsafe. I would not wish this place upon anybody. We left first thing in the morning after the first night.;1

Me and my partner stayed in this hotel for 5 nights, first time in New York City! Hotel was very disappointing. Very old, bathrooms are awful- very small, old, mouldy. We had a room on 10th floor and facing the street, noise was unbearable from traffic, even that high it felt that it was right next to us, so no good night sleep at all. The only good thing was location, 15min walk to time square, and very close to Central Park. Staff was average, some friendly but some looked pretty missable. There are loads of better hotels in same area for same money so wouldnât recommend to stay in this hotel.;1
Our Fire Alarm beeped all night and the Hotel didn't send someone to change the battery. We had notified the front desk at 7 pm and at Midnight no one came. Didn't sleep all night due to the beeping from the low battery. Poor Customer Service.;1

I have deducted the sum  $179.15 for two packages that have been confirmed by USPS as  delivered to me at said address on Thursday may 4th, 2017 which I never received.  This is not the first time this has occurred. In the past two years three packages have been lost or misplaced. On a different occasion a certified piece mail that was signed for containing a $2,500 check was also lost. Because the check came from overseas, the sender was notified by me and someone from your office, and a immediately stopped payment was put on the check. I was issued a second check;1
Booked this hotel as it boasted itself as being near Universal Studios, yeh right $40 in a cab and in the middle of nowhere. Asked the reception was the restaurant open for lunch to be told no open at 6 for dinner and guess what at 6 no restaurant open and on Monday the same again and no bar open either. If you want an enjoyable holiday in California do not stay at this shoe string budget hotel. What a let down;1
tired and shabby.  Staff on reception were pleasant and the cleaner was pleasant.  Thats about it.  Bathroom in big need of a refit.   The sort of hotel you don't want to walk around in bare feet. Half the things in the room don't work.  Lamp doesnt work, we can't turn the aircon down or off, the phone doesnt work - which is a shame as we are paying a supplement for international calls!;1
I booked 10 nights at this hotel through a hotel website based in Thailand . After I read the reviews here, I tried to cancel but couldnt, the company had removed the WHOLE amount from my credit card immediately.  The hotel was as bad as the reviews had said. I arrived on a HOT night, and the aircon didnt work at all. I was unable to sleep. The television didnt work at all either. I dont even know why it was in the room. The next morning, I went to the reception desk and complained , the girl merely shrugged her shoulders. I asked for a better room, and she said I'd have to pay another $200 for a room with an aircon that worked.  When I gave her my credit card, she said if I paid cash it would only be 160, but that she couldnt give me a receipt for the money. Stupidly, I paid;1
"First impression of the lobby was good, but it all went downhill very quickly from there. Firstly, we requested a low floor upon booking (my gf is claustrophobic and cannot use lifts) but we had no response. We then emailed several times to confirm this, but still no response. Eventually we phoned ahead and they put our request down. On arrival, they put us on floor 21 - claiming they had no rooms lower down. Then, as if by magic, they find a 7th floor ""executive"" room which would cost us $50 per night to ""upgrade"" to. Not sure what the upgrade was - it was a smaller room with a tiny washroom (and only 1 bath robe). Probably made for a single occupant. I found this really opportunistic and callus of the hotel to get extra money from us. Next up, we had to locate the fire stairs";1
Donât be fooled by the pictures....This hotel is terrible. I booked a corner suite and checked out after 1 hr. The overall hotel I worn down, dirty and very bad maintained. Windows in rooms are so dirty you can hardly look through them.

"I was staying in NYC for only one night and wanted to avoid paying $300+ for a hotel room downtown.  Well, you get what you pay for.  The website made the Jane look like a chic boutique hotel with fancy amenities and small rooms.  What they don't tell you is that there are many residents still living there from the building's days as an SRO (rooming house for the poor).  I had no idea to expect this, as the website neglected to mention this.  Needless to say, there were many unsavory people roaming the halls, and when i arrived back at the hotel at 12:30am the front desk was empty.  This made me feel quite unsafe.  The ""communal"" bathroom is also CO-ED, so when you step out of the shower in a very small bathrobe, you don't know who might be standing there.  and the shower was";1
"It's NYC, so it's expensive, right? Well, how about an extra $3.50 for in-room do-it-yourself coffee, or $8.00 to drink the water left beside your bed? Or how about paying extra for internet after $500+ for the room? So, we were nickled and dimed, but it got worse. By 2:00 AM we realized the club on the roof was going to party all night. Boom, boom, boom... until 4:00 AM. Great night's sleep. Not. The manager apologized -- ""We should have warned you!"" and did reduce the bill. Still not going back.";1

Someone tried to break into our room whilst we were in there luckily we had the bar across they had got their foot in the gap my husband had to push hard on the door, we told reception again not intrested, no appology and certainly no security walking around.

This hotel need urgently to be renovated. The standard is not a 5 Star but less than a 3 Star Hotel. Service is bad and staff very unfriendly. All prices, i.e. room, bar and restaurant, to expensive. Cleanleness of room and public areas much below any expectation. Completely no value for the money we paid. This was my first and my last stay in this hotel.;1
Do not stay here!  We were there on a Saturday night. When we arrived, it had to have been over 80 degrees in the room and were told that the heat wasn't even on! Therefore, we were in for a very uncomfortable night of sleep - that was only the beginning...  The noise coming from the club/rooftop bar above us (we were on the 11th floor) from about 11pm-4am was unbearable. While I though the noise was bad, the pounding on our ceiling from the people above us dancing was even worse! We called the front desk around 2am and they told us they would bring ear plugs...those arrived at 4am once the club closed. Therefore we got 3 hours of sleep and had to host an event the next day half asleep. The next morning, all I wanted was a nice shower to wake me up but the water pressure was;1
Arrived last night, directly from my family home, one night of no sleep because of the nightclub. I was in room 461, they moved me today to another room, then found a bed bug. So, I had to be showered, whilst they waited for my clothes, which were then steamed, as was the rest of my things. A staff member had to go through everything I have. The process is necessary, but violating. I have now been in my room for nearly 4hrs, in the ribe provided, and still have to wait for another 2hrs. They have offered me a free drink to compensate!! A few of the staff are rude and arrogant, and not too helpful.  So, not even one day into my 3 week stay, and all I want to do is go home.  The Jane? Dont do it.;1
This is not at all what I expected! There is NO hot water in my room! I did the NYC half this morning - announced no hot water upon leaving for the race at 7am, when I got back there was still NO hot water! When asked for compensation the hotel staff are not accommodating for the inconvenience and loss of time caused, the customer is definitely NOT priority here! If I could give a Zero Rating I would!;1
Cockroaches, backed up sink, sticking handle on the toilet, wall paper peeling off the wall in about 5 places... that is a good start. The sheet had holes. Notice sheet is not plural because there was only one. That was for the bottom -  you're supposed to sleep with the comforter on you. You can only hope that's been laundered lately.   No door for the small shower so water will puddle on the floor. The bathroom door was awful - rotted away from being soaked with water for years.      I asked about the awful room condition - thinking, hoping I could be switched to a cleaner room - and was told that all of the rooms are like that.   Oh, and the keurig coffee in the room was $3.00 each!;1
We wanted to stay just one night in the hotel, and got a cheap price, but it wasn't worth it. After just two hours in the bed, my husband had eight bed bug bites! The place was totally infested. It's gross. Be careful!;1

I asked him was this a motel he said ""more like a hostal"". After going back and forth with the gentleman he finally gave me a key. I entered the room to find it extremely dirty and unkept.

My overall impression was that the hotel seems worn and dirty.  The entrance and the doormen are awful and hostile in appearance. The front desk is ridiculously impressed by their own self importance, ignoring the people standing in line to check in while they stared and studied their computer screens. They were mesmerized by it while we waited and just looked at them.  It was ridiculous. They then blamed me for the TWO room keys that did not work after I had to walk back down to the front desk to get new ones. I surely did nothing to them. That is the first time that has happened to me at any hotel anywhere. The room security locks were broken. Shower head was broken. We saw a large cockroach in the public area. The pool and roof top is dirty and just beat. Staff EVRYWHERE has;1

When I got home, I went to my doctor who prescribed me the appropriate SCABIES medication.    Let me tell you, there is no worthy trade-off for SCABIES.

I recently returned from a weekend in New York, and a very brief stay in the Riverside Studios.  As many have stated, the neighborhood was really nice. However, the hotel left a lot to be desired.  The room was relatively clean, but the the labyrinth of hallways were dark, dirty, and had strange fumes.  I was with a group of 5 and all were ready to checkout after having seen the bathrooms, which were absolutely filthy!!!!!!  We decided to checkout immediately, and upon shutting the room door to leave, a large piece of wood fell from above, and struck me on the head.  I would not recommend this hotel for solo female travelers given the dark hallways, and complete lack of security.;1
If you want just a roof over your head at a premium price, then this is your place. Our room was so hot the entire stay.  We complained each day.

Charged us full price for all other nights we stayed in the hot room with ants! The front desk staff denied that we complained  every single day about the air conditioning because there were no notes in the computer! The front desk staff was condescendingly sweet! Horrible!

This hotel needs a health warning due to the noise generated by the ventilation plant in the internal cores of the building. The lower the floor the worse the noise, I complained at 2.30 am on my first night and was moved to a lower spec room the next day which was 5 floors higher as this was the only room available. This still was unbearable and on the day of checkout I left at 7am to escape the noise after trying to sleep with noise cancellation headphones on. I think I managed to get less than 10 hours broken sleep in 3 days. The reception staff are polite but there is nothing they can do as the problem is out of their control, they just have to take the complaints as I heard a number of other guests having similar conversations with them. My complaints were registered;1
This is a well known hotel.  Good location, but one which could do with a bit of a re-fresh and a re- training of staff.  When we arrived there was no hot water in our bathroom - 22 hours later, still no hot water.  The staff on the reception couldn't be any more disinterested.  The room was ok, but noisey due to constant door banging of our neighbouring rooms.  The mini- bar was outrageously priced and WiFi extortionate. 33 dollars for 3 days.

Discovered no room service when I called because restaurant was closed for renovation (advance notice would have been nice.) Room did not have any of the normal items one might expect from a hotel like this or were listed on Hotels.com. No coffee maker, no mini bar, robes, turndown service and not even water for purchase in the room....front desk told me âif you call down we can bring you a cup of water.â WHAT??!! Apparently you only get coffeemaker above 4th floor which I only discovered upon checkout.  They tried to get me tea about ten PM but had âno teabagsâ and I couldnât use the Keurig pods with electric water kettle they brought.;1
"When a hotel's in a great location, it's easy to overlook things like ridiculously slow elevators, room keys that consistently demagnetize (regardless of how close/far they were from my phone), dingy lighting and peeling paint, but cockroaches are a whole other story. I discovered two in my room -- on the 29th floor -- during my one night stay. Both were a healthy 2"", well beyond grabbing a piece of toilet paper and taking them out. I mentioned the cockroaches when I checked out and got a blank stare back from the receptionist, as if to say, ""Can I help you with anything else?""

Clearly, that's lost on everyone I encountered but for one housekeeper who wished me a";1

Morningside Inn was the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. Sure it was not a five stare hotel and at the time of check in we had to wait for our rooms to be cleaned. Sure it was weird we did not get clean towels everyday and they did not have wash towels. also out of the three rooms we reserved one had no lights. Only one had T.V reception. I also dealt with the bill being close to four hundred dollars more due to additional taxes.  A few people in my party had noticed how rude the manager was to the arriving guest. my room was on the third floor and I was busy keeping the kids entertained,so I had not witnessed this. But unpronounced to me I would become an involuntary victim to his rudeness. One morning I noticed the manager watching T.V and asked the manager if the;1

I just tried to contact this hotel in order to reserve a block of rooms for two nights in May.  When I followed the instructions on the automated attendant, the extension I was instructed to press was not a working extension.  I then pressed 0 to go back to the operator.  When I explained to the person who answered what I was looking for -- and it took three tries to get him to understand that I wanted to reserve a block of 20 rooms -- he transferred me to reservations.  When I told the woman there what I wanted, she said I had to go back to the operator.  I then tried to tell her I had gone through that already, she hung up on me.  I guess this hotel is so successful they can just throw away the chance at 40 room nights.  I have booked meetings and room blocks all over the;1

My friend and I stayed at the hotel a few days ago and we left two of our hoodies in the closet. We called on the day itself but was told that the manager had left for the day and was advised to call the next day which we did. We called and they asked us to leave a number and said that they will call back once they've checked. We waited for 3 days and no news. Called back and on the first call they hung up on us, and when we called again the person on the phone told us that they didn't find anything.  First of all, we are very sure that we left our hoodies in the closet, thus I'm sure someone from the hotel must have taken it.  Secondly, they didn't even bother to call us back which they said they would!  Terrible service!!;1

My husband and I were getting married May 31st, and upon booking they NEVER told us the TV's were all out, and granted we booked online, however I have worked for hotels for 10yrs, and even when our POOL wasn't working we took it upon ourselves to call guests ahead of time to let them know!  Then we got put in a room seriously the size of a CLOSET!  On a good note, my husband told the front desk we were getting married, and the girl upgraded us to a better room, crappy view lol But it was better than the last room. For a hotel to look like it did in such a beautiful place such as New York, the owners really need to get their act together and make this place priceless!;1
My wife and I recently had the extreme misfortune of staying at the Morningside Inn. During our stay, we encountered a house of horrors the likes of which we had never encountered before. Rat infestations in the kitchens. Drug dealing downstairs in the lobby. Round the clock violence on the upper floors with the result that four rooms had to be cordoned off and placed under surveillance. A nasty, sadistic staff who evicted tenants in the late evening hours who had the temerity to complain about the armies of rats and about the incessant noise.  After four nights of this, we checked out and found a very satisfactory hotel down the block and our vacation in the Big Apple became a joy.;1

This looked like a great hotel, but when I went to bed a cockcroach joined me I was shocked. I was on level 8 and very disappointed that the hotel hadn't sprayed effectively to avoid such an incident. I was able to squash it but was too scared to then sleep with the light off in case there were more. The response from the hotel when I complained was poor. They didn't offer a refund but gave one to me after I complained, but since the Hyatt has made no attempt to actually process this and after a few email and calls, still no response. The hotel pool was beautiful, gym in the penthouse was great and the location to the airport is extremely convenient - but because of the cockcroach incident, I wasn't able to sleep and would not stay there again.

I visited this hotel's website to inquire about rates/availability. I found a room available for our vacation dates in NYC and proceeded to reserve the room. At no point did it say that my credit card would be billed immediately. I thought I was reserving a room as you do at any other hotel and we would pay upon check-in/check-out. I then received a confirmation from RESAVER that my room was paid in full, checked my bank transactions, and had already been charged $1829 by GETAROOM, obviously redirected there by the hotel site. I called GETAROOM and explained what happened and they agreed to CANCEL the transaction and told me I would not be charged. Well, that was three days ago, the charge did process and GETAROOM has refused to complete the form for my bank to release funds.;1
This is my 2nd visit and my last. The hotel is dated and no work has been done on it since my last visit 5 years ago. There is a 15 minute wait to even use the elevators. The room was cold and really dated. Staff at reception were not the friendliest. The shower had 2 settings scalding hot or cold. They need to invest more money in this hotel or reduce prices to stay there. Only positive was the location which was the only reason I went back but I will find a different hotel next time.  They also charge you to store your bags for 1hr.;1
Stay here at your own peril! Thought it was far too expensive for a shabby run down and out of date establishment! Not worth the money! The wall paper was blistered and peeling! The TV was from 1992 and to top it off their were charges made on my credit card that I did not authorise and the same to my sisters card by some scam holdings company! And we are with different banks! So not hard to work out what was going on there!;1
To describe this place as a dump is being generous. I agree with all of the negative comments. The carpets are filthy. Not sure the last time they were even vacuumed. When we arrived there were no face cloths. I had to ask for them. We stayed 2 nights. No one cleaned our room after the 1st night. I had to obtain clean towels. The front desk girl said she would tell her manager. Not sure what he will do. Probably nothing based upon everything else. Also I originally called the hotel to make reservations and they would not take them. They referred me to an online service such as Priceline. Thanks to ensure they are paid. I've stayed in cheaper hotels that were MUCH cleaner, larger and had better service. I will NEVER stay there again and I wouldn't advise anyone to stay there. The;1
You are unable to take a shower that may produce any amount of steam. AS IT WILL SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM!!! Yes.. steam well set of the fire alarm.  Sadly there is zero amount of exaggeration to my statement.   Two nights in the hotel.. and the fire alarm went off BOTH nights. The first time.. after having just arrived and unpacked with two toddler aged children in tow.. gave us the scare of a lifetime!!! The second time.. we opened the windows as we were instructed by management.. and the fire alarm still went off.  Also.. the phones inside the room do not work. We found this out because when we tried calling the operator/front desk (using the dedicated operator/front desk button) the second time the fire alarm went off.. it would ring to another guest's room. We had to call the;1
This was our second stay at this hotel. We should have learnt from our last stay not to stay here again. Never ever again. If you're hoping to get some (if any) sleep, forget about it. The first time we stayed here we had a room just under their rooftop club, and heard the music, and stomping of feet/dancing most of the night. This time, we asked for a room on a lower level to avoid the noise, however we were kept up all night due to road works - surely this is something that should be disclosed!? Now add hotel staff walking around 24/7 with loud walkie talkies, and you can imagine how little sleep we managed to get. I literally hate this hotel. They should have closed down when Gossip Girl did!;1

"My travel partner and I booked this hotel because of the price and location. Be warned: the management  moved us to different rooms twice. The first time was because of a leaking radiator (puddle on the floor that took the staff two days to get to), and the second room had bugs and a bed so close to the radiator that the sheets smelled burned. We had to check out two days early when the toilets were all clogged due to a broken pipe! GROSS!  WE TOOK PICTURES of garbage in the halls and all of the other problems that we had during our stay, but Travelocity did NOT refund the cost of the three days that we we stayed while waiting for the management to find a decent room in the hotel. As I said, we finally had to check out two days early. The management said, ""We're still waiting";1
"If you enjoy staying in a run down room that looks nothing like the rooms on their website. Ours was 9' x 12.""

If you don't mind not having a mini fridge, a microwave oven or a coffeemaker in your room...if you don't mind putting up with a toilet that never flushes and having the maintenance guy come to our room every evening. If you don't mind all of these things, then the Wyndham New Yorker is the hotel for you.";1
We stayed for five nights in December 2017. The location is great - 96th Street subway station is just outside, and if you manage to get an express train, you can be in Times Square in about ten minutes. The Upper West Side is a lovely area, full of interesting people and places, and with numerous good diners nearby. I would recommend this area to anyone who wants to explore Manhattan.  When we arrived, the hotel looked a bit shabby, but we got a relatively cheap deal so we were under no illusions about the fact that this is not exactly a five-star hotel. It was a little more concerning when we reached the ninth floor and found the hallways stank of cigarettes and cannabis - not great for an allegedly non-smoking hotel, and certainly not for anyone with allergies or respiratory;1
I currently have medical needs. I had requested early check in but understand itâs not guaranteed, so no big deal that my room wasnât ready when I checked in. They took my cell number ( which I double checked was the right number) to text me when I checked in. 5 hours later, no text. Go back to the front desk to ask about my room and they say my room is ready to check into. NEVER received a text, why bother to take my number and promise to do so.  I needed a refrigerator in my room for medical reasons. I called in the morning to confirm it was in the notes that it was for a medical reason. They confirmed. Checked again when I checked in later. They said yes no problem. Got to my room, no refrigerator. Called downstairs to ask, they said theyâd send it right up. 40 mins later I;1
We had a 4 night stay ruined where they did not have availability for the family room until the second night. I would have booked elsewhere but was assured they have last minute cancellations so not a problem. They had reserved my family room under a âdummy bookingâ. I was asked to call daily nearer to the booking. I called from abroad 4 times at my cost to be told the same thing and on the day of arrival, they apologized but told me the family room was available the day after.  The following day, I encountered a totally unprofessional âmanagerâ who attempted to educate me that the problem was for my booking and no room was available until the following day as there was no room. I asked her to put this in writing as I did not want to repeat this conversation. She simply stated;1

From the moment we arrived till the day we left it was one let down after another.  The vanity in our room was cracked and broken, the shower would not drain, my family of four couldn't all shower in the morning or the shower would over flow.

I would not recommend staying at this hotel. Terrible level of noise due to the close proximity of the LAX airport.  The noise level from the airplanes was every couple of mins all night long and was so bad that I had to blast my white noise machine and use ear plugs and even that wasn't enough to give me good quality of sleep. My husband and I had the worst sleep ever for the 4 nights we were staying their (which was to attend a convention).  I would suggest staying a little further out to not deal with this noise...even if that means commuting to the hotel each day.  It took asking 3 times the front desk to get a couple glasses sent to our room and had to wait over 1.5 hours to get them.  The bed was uncomfortable for some reason (not sure why in all honesty) but caused me;1

There are two things each of which will prevent me from ever returning to this location. First, the water pressure is terrible. Itâs weak to begin with and then itâs forced through an ecologically-friendly shower head resulting in an unsatisfying mist. Not worth switching rooms because I only have one more shower left and donât feel like packing and unpacking for what wonât be much improvement. But even more inexcusable is a big chain brand, that charges over $250 for a deal on a basic room, $30 for self parking, and super expensive room service, doesnât carry fox sports west (the major network for local sports). All I wanted was a nice shower and the Kings game. Didnât get either. Now writing this review from a bed that ranks in the bottom half of hotel beds. What a waste of a;1

The hotel is old and out dated. I feel like I over paid for the kind of stay I experienced... the hallways smelled, the curtains were broken and stained in our room. Thereâs no room service, the bedding is uncomfortable along with the pillows, the bathrooms are small and the grout work looks like a blind person put in the tile. The TV in the room was old and the remote barely worked and the WiFi was terrible and kept going in and out. When I left the hotel no one even asked me how my stay was. I called for a bell man when we were leaving, we waited so long that I went down stairs to check out and left my friends in the room waiting with the bags. When I got downstairs it was clear no bellman had been told to come to our room. And we were in a hurry to make a reservation but;1
Great location next to Lincoln Center and often good price but it all ends there.

"I'm writing the review as I am sweating in my hotel room after a sweltering, largely sleepless night.     When I checked in, my room was unbearably hot.   When engineering couldn't fix the ancient AC unit, they ""upgraded"" me to a suite on a different floor  - where there are two ancient and nearly as useless AC units.   Yes, NYC is in the midst of a heat wave, but no, a hotel that bills itself as a 4-star property, with chic decor and a hip lobby, shouldn't feel like an old college dorm during summer session.   Apparently, the decor has been upgraded but the infrastructure has not.";1
The manager of this hotel has a bad attitude, unhelpful, and dam right rude. We stayed for a total of 5 nights from the 20th of July, two twin rooms for myself and my work colleagues. The rooms are filthy, dated and in need of a total refurbishment. Staff need training on their customer service skills and the manger should reconsider his vocation as working with the general public obviously offends him.;1
I never got a response or apology from the hotel to my complaint, so I will share it with you.  My stay was pretty much encompassed by the rudeness of your reception staff when I checked out who refused to admit they had change for $20 when I paid my room service bill, and made out like I was mentally challenged when I asked if they had any drinks I could buy because the cafe was closed.   I felt harassed as a single woman using the bathroom and was very scared at night to use the facilities. Im usually very happy to share, so this is not usually a problem. On multiple occasions I had very sleazy men pass comments and flirt with me, two even trying to make a pass and get my room no. This is not acceptable, and should be monitored if there are going to be shared facilities where;1

The tv wasn't working altough we had payed for a tv and the wifi was barely working either. The heater made a lot of high (really really high) noices during the night and the temp couldn't be controlled from the room so it was either freezing or deadly hot. The shower head was about to fall out of the wall. No refrigerator. Overall the hotel was dirty. Would never ever stay at this place again. Although so is the location ok.;1

The ""courtesy wifi"" is slower than molasses.   Also the walls are paper thin. The guests in room next to us were extremely loud at all hours of the night. We could hear them talking about all of the DRUGS they brought. The hallway smelled of marijuana. When the room doors shut they slam way too hard. All of the walls shake.

I had never stayed at the Empire before and am used to staying in great hotels in New York, so was surprised at the lack luster staff and accommodations.

Then handed me my key cards, didn't tell me what floor, room # or even point to where the elevators were!  I had to go back out to foyer, where there were elevators to be told to go back in down the hall and around the corner.  Room was cramped, musty, loud, some kind of blower out my window, charming, blind was hanging on one end, no HBO, the WIFI prompt was";1

The hotel was ok, although there was a party happening until early in the morning which was annoying, and the location was good. However I have been overcharged and on contacting the hotel 3 times I have had no response. I am incredibly frustrated with this dismal after service and am still $500 worse off with no one to speak to.;1
I was so disappointed with my stay here. There was peeling paint on the bathroom door and in the bathroom itself. I felt very unsafe as I was on the second floor and the balcony goes all the way around, so anyone from another room could just walk out of their room and try to break into yours. There were homeless people laying outside on the grounds of the hotel. There are no USB ports anywhere in the room. While waiting for a friend in the lobby, there was no music playing, only the AD for a radio station to sign up- over and over again. I would never stay here again.;1
Iâll start with the positives-   1) Location of the hotel is fantastic, especially if youâre seeing a show at MSG.  Well, that was quick- letâs move on to the rest: 1) hotel is super old and outdated. Rooms, beds, bathrooms, etc.. 2) it will take forever to get an elevator up to your or down to your Room. It actually might be faster walking. Factor at least 10 -15 minutes one way into your travel time 3) housekeeping - I had a family suite with 4 people. There were two bath towels in the room. I called down at 3:30 pm for more. At 11 pm I called back down for additional towels as I hadnât received them and was told it might take a bit bc there was only one person on duty. By the time I get the towels Iâll be back home and able use my own.  4) biggest issue- I booked this room;1
"The use of masks was not mandatory when I stayed there.Â  That was terrible. I always had my mask on, but not all guest did because no one at the hotel enforced that. As a matter of fact, the staff mentioned that wearing masks was optional. Plus, they never asked to see proof of guests vaccination.  I also had a surprise ""cleaning fee"" charged to my account and not a single answer, proof or evidence of what this was for.Â  My room was clean and I didn't leave any mess nor did anything inappropriate in my room,Â  so for me this was outrageous. I have traveled considerably in the U.S. and abroad and this is the first time that I have to deal with something unfair and unprofessional like this. When I tried to inquire about this, I only met rude staff.Â    I also had a key that stopped";1
We have stayed here a few times within the last couple of months and had great experiences, location is convenient and the cafe staff is amazing. The elevators are horrible slow due to the renovations but that was no big deal for us.  The rooms are very basic, even the newly renovated  rooms are nothing special. As we found out after this trip the unrenovated rooms are very out dated, with stained and chipped furniture and horribly ugly pictures on the walls. Our last trip we checked in, unpacked and went immediately to the pool. A couple hours later went back to our room to change and went to their cafe for dinner.  After returning  to our room we noticed that there was no safety latch on the door,  we noticed because our 2 year old walked right up to the locked door and opened;1

Our room (841) sucked. It was miniscule and shaped like a triangle, not even a square or a rectangle. Our window was facing a brick wall. The AC was loud and obnoxious and didn't work. Every night was spent on top of the covers (even with the AC on high)! After a shower our room was stuffy and unbearable.   The bathroom was so tiny that it was impossible to fit two people into, which can be hard if you imagine one person trying to brush their teeth/ shave their face and the other trying to do their makeup (in front of the only mirror in the place!) There was no bath, only a shower (which didn't even have a door or a curtain, just half a glass). Imagine trying to shave your legs in that one ladies.  The only storage in the bathroom was on a small shelf above the toilet.;1

I just returned from a weekend trip to New York, we stayed 3 nights in the hotel and I really wouldn't recommend it to any one. When we arrived we had specified a non smoking room but the room we were allocated smelt like an old ashtray and the toilet was blocked,      when we complained the staff seemed slightly surprised but offered us an alternative room on the 12th floor which we accepted. This also stank of smoke but was ok once we opened a window. While moving our baggage we then got stuck in the lift for 10 minutes while it juddered between the 12th and 14th floors. The room was quiet but grubby(you wouldn't want to walk on the carpet in bare feet) and the shower filled the bath so you had to wait between showers although there was plenty of hot water.

This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Room felt unclean. We never had enough towels. Exposed carpet tack strip. Duct tape on hall carpet. Chipped furniture. Drawers wouldnât close. TV was old with limited channels. Musty unsecured  exercise room.;1
Overall nice place. We were expecting a luxury  hotel based on photos price and review but it was pretty average. Dated rooms and amenities. The security guard is super judgmental too, he stopped me like five times and told me that I was not staying in the hotel and nobody was even occupying a room on my floor!?!!?;1
What can i say. Yes there are more expensive places in town. But more effort could be made.  Its dirty. I can smell what could be illegal substances. When they write self catering they mean you need to buy your own cooking utensils...  The staff seem to think it is funny. Sigh.  Next time i will read reviews before i blindly book somewhere.;1
Pictures will tell the truth..unfortunately we got here only because we got scammed by manhattanregencyapartments.com (we had booked an apartment nearby this place, paid $1000 before arriving and found nothing...) so we had to find a place where to stay closeby (after 10h flying it's an horrible surprise..).  We got here, asked for a room and a rude guy at front desk said $208 for one night. No breakfast. Well, as it was late at night after this nightmare I had to take the room.  Trust me when I say A DUMP IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS 1* HOTEL. DUST EVERYWHERE, FURNITURES OF MID 20'S, TV DIDN'T WORK, WIFI NEVER WORKED AMYWHERE, FREEZING COLD IN THE ROOM AND A HEATER THAT WAS RESTING ON THE WALL AND DID NEVER WORK. AWFUL EXPERIENCE. DON'T YOU EVER GET SCAMMED EVEN FROM THESE HORRIBLE;1
Received the worst customer service in my whole life, was disrespected, staff were rude and make customers feel unsafe. They took advantage of us and smirked watching us stand for 20 minutes whilst taking a personal phone call because they knew we needed somewhere to stay. Saw them shouting at kids. Please save money and book elsewhere. I wish I had listened to the previous reviews because found a much nicer booking same price in London.;1
Below is a list of problems (all documented with photos!) with the Woogo apartment we rented in Chelsea in Manhattan. It shows blatant disregard of the apartment's functionality, upkeep, and even potentially, resident safety:  * The tub filled up with putrid water and did not drain after use. In addition, there appeared to be no overflow cap at the rear of the tub, instead an unfinished and unattractive and vacant hole was present. * The towel bar in the full bath appeared to have been broken off - the cleats were present, but no bar. * The door to the bedroom nearest the front door was held on by only one of three sets of hinges. The other two sets of hinges were hanging loose and no longer attached to the door jam. * The toilet seat in the half bath was cracked completely;1
Picked this hotel as a last minute option when needing to stay near LAX.  A medium length hair on one of the pillows, a body wash bottle in the shower left from the previous guest and apparently wanting me to get the last use out of it, and being woken up to housekeeping knocking but practically inside my room even though I was given a 2pm checkout as a discoverist member (low man on the totem pole clearly).    I understand that things can go awry but this one too many issues for me to choose this property again.;1

"This hotel is for tourists and people that dont recognize what a ""four star hotel"" SHOULD be. This is a crappy hotel sugar coated with a few nice (but well worn) pieces of furniture. Gossip Girl was filmed here? Who cares!? Try offering a proper service. Hows that one for an original idea?  I rented a room for my husband and me's wedding anniversary. My ONLY written request was to have a room with a bathtub. Not to difficult right? Wrong. Upon checking in, I kindly reminded the woman at the front desk of my request. They couldn't even get that right. They ""upgraded"" us to a room with two beds. My husband and I do not need two beds, this is not the 1950's. We do, however, need a tub. I went back down to the desk and her only response was 'Oh, well, the computer SAYS it has a tub.";1
I have been staying at this hotel since Sunday evening & booked it purely because it received such great reviews however, I am utterly disappointed at my choice. Upon checking in, the lady at the front desk informed us that we would be checking out on Thursday which left us in a state of panic as, we thought that we booked 1 less night than we were meant to. Double checked our confirmation this evening to realise that she was in fact wrong! The room itself is very, very basic. The bathroom could do with a bit of updating as it is cold, old and not the nicest. The cleaner does not replace toiletries which I found to be quite shocking as every hotel that I stayed at in the past does replace toiletries daily. And the cherry on the top was that there was what looked to be a pubic;1
There are a number of issues with this hotel. When we first got to the hotel room, it smelled terrible and the lights flickered. The hot water was extremely limited on the first night, the hairdryer was broken, and there was a half-eaten granola bar at the snack bar. While they did provide shampoo, there was not any conditioner, and we were not given any washcloths or hand towels. When we asked for some, the housekeepers were very rude and told us that they were all currently in the laundry and would not be ready until 11 pm. When we called the manager to ask for a new hair dryer, he was very curt and hung up on us.   I will not stay at this hotel again, and would not recommend at all.;1
dirty hotel woderful hotel good choice people n't need cleanliness, attractions golf casino disco restaurants, thing clean beach really wonderful,  ;1
This hotel is horrible. The carpet is dirty and sink of bathroom is broken. The reservation shows free breakfast for two but instead they do not even other breakfast. When I checked out, the lady in front of me was asking the free breakfast for two thing as well. It seems a trick that works well for the hotel.;1
We really did not expect a lot before we moved in (base on reviews from other users), but still we were disappointed. It is waaaay overprized and the standards are in the low region. Dirty floor (check under the bed), malfunctioning sockets which are a health hazard, unlockable bathroom door. Even the staff seemed uninterested and bothered when we asked questions.  Still worse tho: The tried to charge me on my creditcard, on two occasions, after we checked out and went home. When I called the hotel (yeah, they don't have an E-mail adresse..) I was transferred to an accounting firm by the hotel reception. They said they could not help and transferred me back to the hotell. Finally they answered and said there was no bills registered on my name. So just an reoccuring mistake? It;1
"This hotel represents extremely poor value. The rooms themselves are dark and in need of refurbishing as they appear very dated (e.g. wallpaper peeling off, ripped bedding).  The service in both the pool bar and the restaurant is very slow; having tried to order at both these venues we eventually gave up after waiting 20 mins to simply be served.  The most insulting aspect was on arrival in the room a bottle of water (unchilled) is placed at each bedside cabinet for a mere 8 dollars! After an 11 hour trip I found this particularly rude. Most of the room amenities require an extra fee (wifi - which you have to pay for per device). In sum, a very disappointing hotel stay.";1
PLEASE do not stay here!  I understand people can stay in hotels and sometimes it just depends on the room, here my brother moved rooms 3 times and had nothing but trouble, we moved once. First of all the room they were checked into was having maintenance (don't check someone into a room if its not ready) and the second one resulted in waking up with multiple bites from bedbugs (The woman behind the counter argued with us saying it was checked regularly and fumigated, she then brought out the sheet that was signed when this was done and it was last checked on the 9th of jan). The room we stayed in, the heating didn't work and the toilet took 7 times to flush one piece of toilet roll so we moved rooms to a bigger one which was a lot better.  We then decided to wash our clothes,;1
Dingy, small. no amenities, halls were like maze, when you got off the elevator there were no signs indicating where room numbers were, noisy air conditioner, we paid for 2 nights, room was so bad we only stayed for one.

"We arrived late in the evening to be given room 103. The Yale lock door should have given a clue to the quality. The toilet was blocked to bubbling over and the lights didn't work. Not the best start. We were moved to room 1005. A trip in the lift, with the damaged door and music blasting out brought us the room. There would have been a lovely view of Manhattan had they cleaned the Windows and the bed was clean. There the good points stop Never seem such an awful place. There was chewing gum ground in the carpet, broken furniture, mould, a bolted shut door to a crumbling balcony and inadequate lighting. It was awful.

One of the worst experiences I can remember having. Very disappointing and unexpected in a Wyndham property. First room was dirty and in poor condition. After complaining, we were given a different room which was satisfactory but unspectacular (in addition, it had no internet access). For what the price charged, this was definitely not worth it. We will not stay here again.;1
This was the worst hotel we stayed at, on the worst trip, to the worst city, We have ever been to. Oh and itâs right next to the worst airport EVER! The Staff were at best, âsimpleâ, rude, unhelpful, and I donât think I spoke to anyone who spoke English as a first language.;1

There are so many lovely 4 star hotels in Manhattan with great guest service, up-to-date rooms and fantastic amenities.  The Empire Hotel is not one of them.  If you want a lovely hotel with four star quality, look elsewhere.  I have traveled into Manhattan on too many occasions to count, and this hotel was the absolute worst. I felt it was important to let you all know that the best part of this hotel is the location, but there are so many other hotels in the area to choose from, so do your research and read other reviews on this hotel and spend your money elsewhere!  Rooms are tiny and outdated, the walls are paper thin, and the front desk could care less about any issues you may have.   Customer service is just plain horrible.;1

Stay away from here. Not worth any penny (and it was overly expensive so really - stay away). Do not trust the pictures on their website, you would rather have a look at the pictures that other guests and I uploaded here to get an in-depth insight of what's it really like.  First things first: position. At 106th St in NYC, the hotel is actually well placed on the West side of Central Park, and - by contacting the staff in advance - I was able to get a room with a view on it. In fact, the view from the room is very nice. But that's actually it.  Now, why you do not ever want to book in here. Upon arrival, I was welcomed by a careless employee that did not even say hello and just asked for my ID and credit card. Looking around, the reception was excessively dirty. There was a;1
I have thought long and hard about this review, but based on the great advice I've received here from other users, I feel it's my duty to speak up about all that we endured ( yes ENDURED) at the Empire. First things first. This was a business trip. I am journalist who travels to NYC for 10 days every September and February to cover fashion week. This makes my needs very specific. I don't worry about proximity to tourists sights, or a concierge whom can get me tickets to a Broadway show ( nothing wrong with either of those things, I just don't get to do them while on business in NYC) .  What I do need is (a) wifi access so that I can work every day, and (b) a decent night's sleep at least every other day. (c) staff that isn't over the top hostile.  Empire failed horribly on all;1
I emailed the Wyndham New Yorker hotel after receiving my bank statement showing that an unauthorised charge of USD 176.97 was made following my stay from 17-19 November 2019.  However, when I made this booking, I paid all the charges and hotel tax in advance. I also confirmed that no further charges would be made at check-in and when checking out, and the member of staff on duty assured me that no additional charges or resort fees would be made in connection with this booking.   Please could you reply to me regarding the money you have taken from my account in accordance with New York's Unfair Trade Practices Law. This includes a non-sterling transaction fee of Â£3.77, and brings the total unauthorised amount you have taken to Â£140.95.;1
Lobby and room was modern, bathroom was okay. Food at the restaurant was not good at all, valets and staffs at the front desk were the worst. The only good thing was shuttle bus to the airport (run frequently and on time).;1

The single room is the size of a cruise ship cabin. The shower has only half a door so after taking a shower the room is soaked. The room does not come with an ice bucket or an iron or ironing board. You need to call room service, I suspect so they can get a tip for something else... The worst part was the staff. I had stayed in the hotel post hospital stay due to not being able to go home that day. I had called from the hospital and asked if I could get an early check in. They told me if I gave a credit card they would pre register me and do what they could to get me an early check in. I got there a few hours later and was told that the room was not yet available. I offered to pay for a higher level room and they said they had nothing available yet. They took my phone number;1

I stayed with my girlfriend on Sunday December 28th. When we checked in to the hotel, the Valet was very friendly and courteous which was a plus. However, the front desk staff was exactly the opposite. Apparently the front desk staff loved to have their faces in the computers and not assisting guests.They were also cold, rude, and not accommodating. I am a Hhonors Manager at Embassy Suites in Baltimore Maryland and not seeing one front desk agent not smile is unbelievable.   Although the room was beautiful and I enjoyed the waterfall shower, the worst part was that it felt like a Sauna. I called down to have engineering come look at HVAC. He checked the HVAC and said the pipes were still blowing hot air, so he turned them off. That did not help at all. We went to the front desk;1
This hotel reminds me of The Shining, and also of every nightclub fire disaster I've ever read about.  I'm not that clausterphobic of a person, but something about the narrow hallways and low ceilings, which seem even lower if you're in the top bunk, make it feel more like a crypt.  Which I'm sure is really cool for photoshoots or a drink downstairs, but I would highly advise against actually sleeping here.   In case you're not already hyperventilating from lack of space, you will be soon from lack of air, as the temperature is kept at a mandatory bikram-yoga-esque 80 degrees.  I felt like a fish out of water, pressed up to the miniscule window just trying to get a breath of fresh air.  A window which, once opened, made me think sleeping under the Brooklyn Bridge would've been;1
The hotel and guest room were in very good condition upon my arrival.  However, the room was extremely cold.  The heat was more difficult to operate than any other heating system in any other hotel that I have stayed in.  It included no instructions.  I stayed at the hotel 1 night and checked out to go home. It took about 4 hours of wasted time waiting for the room to warm sufficiently on that visit. When my trip was extended unexpectedly, I reserved another night at the Hyatt in spite of the previous heat problem.  Because of a family member who functions best in familiar situations so I took a chance.  Plus, I had spent so much time manipulating the heat the previous night that I felt I knew how to operate it.        After checking in and entering the room on the 2nd night, I;1

After a decade of yearly visits because of its great location, this hotel is in total decline.  Apart from filth almost everywhere, there is a mammoth 20 story bldg going up directly adjacent.  Construction noises will continue for at least 2 years.  Management is ABSENT. Room cards work half the time, elevator service unpredictable to lousy, ancient A/c units, not enough outlets, TV erratic, window blinds donât work (workers in the construction site have good peeking views), not enough towels, no towel rack, tissue wall box rusty, no hand held such a great shower attachment ( but YES, good hot water and pressure, and toilet flushes well - a welcome surprise), and an idiosyncratic price structure.  Examine your bill CAREFULLY, as they made âmistakesâ on my last 2 visits and it;1

I stayed here for about a week and it is one of my greatest regrets. The first big issue was the Wi-fi. When I connected to the Wi-fi, it barely even worked. I had to go to the lobby every night in order to text or make a call. The second big issue was that the room was unclean. They DID NOT change the bedsheets, pillowcases, or threw out the trash. We even asked them several times to change the sheets and clean the room but they DID NOT. Also, I'm pretty sure the beds even had bed bugs because my sister and I both have bites on our legs, arms, back, and neck. I DO NOT recommend staying here.;1
This hotel was definitely an experience I will not forget. My group of 10 people stayed here for 2 nights. We choice this hotel mainly for the location as it was pretty central to most of the New York attractions.   The hotel, or should I say, homeless shelter, was extremely tiny, dirty, smelly and very out of our comfort zone. We found cockroaches of the bed and the cleanest place I could find to unpack my clothes was the fridge. The hotel wasn't even well priced.  If I had my time over I would have chosen something south of manhattan. It's cheaper and a better area.;1
Four star but should be three stars. It took us 3 attempts to get a decent room. The first room was the size of half a shoe box with a night stand that kept toppling over. Room 2 was bigger but was like being in the bowels of a ship with a horrendous noise from a kitchen extractor fan and sewage coming out of the bath tap. Room 3 was passable, that's the best I can say. The internet is NON existent in the rooms. The roof terrace is nice but you get told repeatedly that ALL the tables are reserved. The only good thing about this place is it's proximity to the Lincoln Center and Central Park.;1

The hotel charged a facilities fee ($30 a night) on checkout. This was not mentioned in any prior communication by them, which includes a lot of emails advertising the final rate.  I can understand additional charges for which the amount varies based on the services you use during your visit. But given that this is a fixed charge that will be levied in any scenario, why not include this is the final amount at the time of booking? I don't see any difference between this and resort fees, and a lot of hotels charge the latter upfront. And I made the booking using the Wyndham site itself, no third party. I find this intentionally deceptive on the resort's part.  The cleanliness, size of the rooms, and the service at the place was quite mediocre. The only reason I chose this place;1

My check in was delayed 2 and a half hours because the hotel did not have enough rooms ready. This made me late for the event at MSG I was attending. The room was small but what you would expect in a NYC hotel. The view from the room was average. The only positive thing about my experience here was that it is in a great location.;1
"We did and found discarded pamphlets, an empty shampoo bottle, and enough accumulated dust and dirt to convince us that the housekeeping staff hadn't been under there in a while.  There was no deadbolt or other security lock on the room's entrance door, the toilet broke, the television was well worn and received only local and some basic cable channels (no ESPN, for example), the sink and shower both drained slowly, the front desk was curt, one thin towel each for the two of us, to hit just a few highlights.  Maybe borderline acceptable for $75-100 in New York; for the $240 we paid, not even close.";1
Horrible experience at the New Yorker.   We had to charge one of our phones in the bathroom, not to mention the fire hazard plug socket behind the bed!!   Room was tiny, our luggage took up most of it! We couldnât move around much in the bathroom at all. Room was very dated and dirty (marks on the headboard which was very off putting!) - the walls were so thin all we heard was walking about in the hallway all night, alongside our neighbours being noisyâ¦. VERY thin walls!!!! Awful night sleep.   We got there about 11pm at night due to a late flight, stayed one night and left a day before we were due to because of the sheer state of our room. Hotel reception were very poor and not very helpful or sympathetic at all.   Currently speaking with our agent we booked this through to;1
Where do we start?  Well seeing as the hotel cancelled the booking 2 hours before landing st JFK without telling you, this is probably setting themselves up for a fall.  Arrive at check in desk and they said no you haven't got a room. Hand the guy paperwork, show him the booking.com reservation and he says oh, we've cancelled it. Don't know why and we now have no rooms.  Pulls a rabbit out of the hat and says I'll find one.  Then charges me Â£425 more than the booking plus a bond on the room on top. Low floor, small, very cramped room, very dated. Think 1940's art deco.  Service terrible from reception, everyone else fairly good.  We emailed the manager 3 times when there, twice when we got back a week later and nobody has replied as apparently cancelling rooms is the norm at The;1
The staff members at the reception are simply disrespectful, ignorant and grumpy the whole time. If you need any help, you bett find solutions on your own.  Not only that it's noisy in the morning (slamming doors, construction area next to the building, thin walls), the Wifi costs extra (very rare in hotels(hostels).  The rooms are poorly decorated, no TV, no table lamps) and the beds are uncomfortabe since they are too soft to sleep properly.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend visiting this place, cause there are far more comfortable places for this prize!;1
The hotel and staff were great, both the location and the service.  The room was clean and well maintained.  However on the final day we received a bill for around $130 for 'facilities' which completely put a downer on the whole experience.  $130 for essentially using the internet for 5 days, as we did not use the gym or other facilities (which we were not offered or informed about).    Without this the experience would have been brilliant.;1
We were with two kids. It is very convenient location, but the rooms are terrible. The first room the toilet wasnt working and whatever you make, it was there for ages. They change our room, because we request it, but the other one we have in front of us someone consuming drugs and also old and not very clean.;1
It is one of the worst places where I have stayed. First of all, all the workers are foreigners and they are chaing everyday the rules in the hostel. I can not imagine that they are charching extra for internet. You pay Â£1 per hour. Even you pay for the internet you cannot open all the web sites. Some web sites are blocked and can't be opened. The TV room is a disaster. It is smelling very bad and not confortable at all. The corridors are smelling very very bed. The room was very dirty. Ther is nothing available in the cafeteria. I don't want to say anything about the toilots, kitchen and shower areas. The is no chance to keep you healt after staying here. This is more dirty pension the a host that we know.;1
the hotel is very old fashion and needs a complete update. The room on the second floor was very dark and noisy as it backed on the hotels air con systems, so noisy that it was almost impossible to sleep. The advertise a roof terrace but it was closed all the time we were there. The TV remote control didn't work and the shower dial didn't either. We wouldn't recommend it.  Way too expensive for the room we got.;1
Disappointed after hearing this was a great hotel ð. Room for 4 people is tiny and nothing like the photos on website! We could barely get into room & couldnât even fit cases in.

1st time for everything I suppose, stayed here on numerous occasions and have generally turned up earlier than the 3pm check in and never been a problem. We turned up at 13.20pm and the room was ready but we would need to pay an extra Â£10 early check in fee on top of the Â£240 it had already cost for 1 night in this hotel I'd already paid. I said no we'd get a drink and come back later, we returned about 14.20 and there still trying to charge an extra Â£10 early check in. My point is the room is ready it's cost Â£240 for 1 night, we literally want to off load our bags and be on our way for our meal and show booked in the evening.

Such a impolite , uncivilized, rude staff. Don't even think to book this hotel, thug style . They take money from your credit card before the agreed date and then no way to return. Complete disappointment.;1

"Staying at Empire is like being thrown in a pinball! New York tempo up into your room!  Earplugs (provided by the hotel) are not enough, helmet with noise reduction is rather to be considered. The USP is the roof terrasse with the pool...not open ""for safety reason""! What! in summer! Is there a crocodile in there? Room was clean when they do not forget to do it.";1
This hotel is not recommended at all.   Those guys at the reception have an attitude problem. They locked us out of the room and authorized the credit card without notifying us, claiming that they left us a message in the room (which we werenât allowed to enter anyways).   His argument was you havenât stayed in a hotel in the US before and you donât know the protocol. This comment is extremely offensive from a guest service manager and in our case is not true. Thatâs our 4th or 5th hotel in the US and the WORST of all by far !;1
Abysmyl from start to finish.  Cancelled booking while in flight to NY from the UK.  Overcharged for room by Â£400 and given an awful room.  Deliberately ignored 5 emails to reception and the manager and now only email a week after returning.  Will never use this dump again  This is not Las Vegas so why charge a resort fee. New York is not a resort. Most other hotels in NY are better and don't charge one.  The place is tired, poor quality and just not worth the hassle, money or leave you  Save your time and money and get a nice hotel.;1
over the last two years since I discovered this hostel I have stayed around five times because it is not as expensive as hotels in London and I needed to save a few pounds as we all do given how expensive London can be. There is cleaning there which is good but it is manned by well male not polite staff (not sexist just fact). Occasionally polite but mainly not and I get a distinct feeling that we are filmed in our rooms due to some comments I heard from a staff member talking near me. I have had some politeness but a few times the opposite.   The facitlits are a room with cutlery and plate and mug plus a kitchen nearby and shower room and toilets. They are clean usually. But staff are very unhelpful if something goes wrong eg kettle not working I went to reception and he did;1
I've stayed here mutliple times, at least 5 in the last few years and probably more. It's gone drastically downhill. My last stay wasn't great, but this is even worse. There is red lipstick on multiple spots on the bed cover, crumbs under the table and some dirt/weeds/something in a pile by the couch that has stains all over it. There was 1 decaf coffee when I arrived and virtually no globalist benefits other than one small bottled water. All for a very high price, about $300 w/tax. It is so disappointing as I frequently have overnight layovers here, but the red lipstick is the straw that broke the camel's back. Might as well have stayed at a Motel 6. Probably would have been cleaner and I would have saved a lot of money.;1
We moved out after 1 night of a planned 3 night stay as we couldnât stand the damp and mould in the bedrooms. It looks like lots of money has been spent on the lobby and superficial decorating in the rooms but providing healthy air to breathe should be a priority!;1
Bathtub is rusted. Ran out of hot water in shower. Maid service took two bath towels left one. Went to the basement for vending machine. One was broken, the other one only took dollar bills. Went up to lobby to exchange a $5 for $1s. Manager didnât have any. Room was very clean. Television channels were extremely limited. Internet is only free in a tiny lobby. You can purchase slow internet for outrageous prices. Canât wait to leave;1
I am a World of Hyatt member and stay at many Hyatt properties. This hotel seriously shook my loyalty. The carpets and upholstery were filthy! The first room they gave me smelled of mold and smoke, the second room - like the first - had disgusting stains on all of the furniture. I was there for a night layover on an international trip and had I not been completely jetlagged, would have demanded my money back and gone elsewhere. I'll have to think twice about continuing to choose Hyatt!;1
Terrible experience!!!!  Hotel was definitely not worth $200 PER NIGHT, even with the Shuttle to the Park.   Creamers for coffee were rancid, spoiled -- poor check in (didn't even have my reservation set aside) -- said I had no reservation, even though I had booking.com printout, had to argue with them!!!   Hotel was like a Motel, was shocked.  Food was awful, both from the bar, the restaurant and room service.  Horrible food-  Prices were outrageous, paid $15.99 for 4 Benadryl in the lobby!  Poor experience overall.  Did not clean the white stained sheets and comforter where I had spilled coffee in the morning, before housekeeping came through, and bathroom still had hair from prior guest!;1
The room I stayed in (room 712) had a horrific smell of mold. The sitting room was dark, had a lumpy, old, multiple iron burned carpet with an equally old couch. Bedroom was pretty much the same. I found myself awake at 2 am with a screaming headache (likely due to the mold smell). This room should not be used. I can't speak to other rooms in the hotel, but if I had another option I would have preferred leaving the hotel for another and eating the night's cost ( cheaper than other hotels in the area but by no means cheap at $300+ per night). Bad news.;1
Maybe it is a two start hotel, but i gave one star because the service was very very poor. internet did not work, the elevator was broken, the room keys were broker, in the evening they called me asking for all data sinc ethey had an it issue, i asked to book a taxi and they did not do it, i asked to call me in the mornign to wake me up and they did not do it......  the infrastructure is then very old, medium cleanliness as well.  if you can find something in the area chepaer go there since this is not a nice one!;1

"If you want a good nights sleep then consider staying on a park bench rather than here.  Our room had clearly not been maintained - the bathroom had dripping taps, mould on the walls and a broken extractor fan.  Outside the room were two industrial aircon units which made a constant din all night.  We asked to move rooms but were refused.

"The idea of a microhotel is a good one, but The Jane executes very poorly. I get the sense that whoever designed The Jane never even tried to stay here.  The bathroom situation is a mess. The main bathroom on floor 3 has only 2 stalls and 2 showers; if you're waking up at a normal time, you will have to wait. There are, as it turns out, other bathrooms on floor 3... but it's up to you to discover that, since there's no signage and they're not on the map. Additionally, one morning housekeeping decided to close the entire bathroom for cleaning at 8:30am. Inexplicable; that seems like the peak time for bathroom use. Finally, the bathrooms lack adequate counter/shelf space for toiletries (both at sinks and in the showers).   Also the soundproofing is terrible. You can hear anyone in";1

I booked a double en suite room on the 1st May 2017 with Agoda.com. On my confirmation it stated I would pay at the Hostel, little did I know that Abercorn took my payment two days later on the 3rd May 2017. I don't always check my statements! But to top it off, when I arrived they never had my room so they had to accommodate me in a ground floor basement studio flat in Bayswater. They did transport me there in a Cab, Admittedly this was furnished to a high standard but I wasn't supplied with not even a glass,plate knife or fork even though it had a microwave & cooker. So the moral of the story is even though you have paid it doesn't mean your going to get to stay where you wanted to.;1

What you see on the pictures is a whole different story when you arrive on the premises. This is a Hilton, albeit very very old. The decor is coming apart. The rugs hanging on the walls are so faded that you can no longer see what once was seen or embroidered on there. In the reception lounge, the centre wooden table badly needs to be removed. It is old, chipped and really worn out. The wonderful bouquet that sits atop it does not compensate for the lack of attention to detail that's on display. When we arrived, we were not informed of the renovations occurring to the elevators, banging could be heard in the morning especially. Anyway, we initially booked for 5 nights but due to the state of the place we left after spending one night only...thankfully. Check in was quick, bell;1

Repeat guest, however this stay was not as great. The valet lost the keys to the car rental.  The shower drain was clogged. There were food crumbs on the floor. The sheets had holes and were ripped. We were charged $5 for delivery of utensils/napkins.  We had to call multiple times for extra towels. While face masks are required, there's not any enforcement.  Guests were crowding onto the elevators.   The room/floor was quiet and we slept well, however the overall accommodations were not consistent with our last stay.;1

"We booked 5 nights at the Park West Hotel (Astor on the Park). Based on the reviews on Booking.com, the hotel didnât look too bad, and was quite affordable.   However, if on picture everything looked alright, our stay proved to be very unpleasant to say the least. Here is a list of the stuff that bothered us:  - The hotel is very old-fashioned and in dire need of renovation. The elevator is a disaster;  - Our room and bathroom were freakishly small and uncomfortable. We had to ask for a blanket, because we were only provided with bedlinen;  - Thin walls and bad sound insulation: you can hear everything that happens on the same floor, which is extremely annoying;  - The pipes and plumbing were extremely loud;  - There were spaces between the wall and the window where the outside";1
The staff treated me disrespectfully, the pillows were so huge I used a rolled up towel instead, the water pressure was so awful that I had to use the bath faucet to get all of the shampoo out of my hair and it even shut off completely during both showers I took. Iâll never stay here again and Iâll think twice about ever staying at another Hilton property. The Sheraton is tight next door and way nicer. Stay there instead!;1
I have stayed in many hostels throughout the world, and I'm sad to say that Morningside Inn is the worst I have stayed in. I am embarrassed at the quality of this New York hostel compared to hostels in other countries, and embarrassed that Moringside is a reflection of our quality of hostels in this country. There was a big fight our first night there, where some guy punched holes in the walls, and thrashed the room. The police were called so late, the guy walked away.  Then the room was left open in that condition for everyone to see.  The shower handle kept falling off. In the basement where coffee is supposedly served (either cold or not brewed), a rat ran across the floor, and the floors are dirty, windows wouldn't open and the floor was dirty. The night staff were pleasent,;1
We got a room at the11th floor facing Central Park but filthy windows blocked the view, the carpet was disgusting and a chair's cushion was torn. Finally, the room had no air condition but an old noisy window unit so the sleeping quality was poor. In the positive end, the staff was friendly and helpful. While the location is close to two subway stations it is not the best place if you want to go to Mid and Downtown but it is great for walking central park and Upper West side.   AFMS;1

This was my second time staying at this hotel and I can safely say it will be my last. Before arriving I noticed the hotel had charged my card with extra charges. I contacted the hotel and they did sort this out very quickly. Arrived from a red eye flight from Los Angeles & my room was ready at 10am which was a bonus. Room was extremely small (no issue for me) however this hotel has gone down hill since my last stay in 2016. Room was very grubby and even the lamp shades were wonky and dirty. Hair in the bathroom sink and I noticed the hotel does donât provide sanitary disposal bags for females. Only stayed one night so wasnât the end of the world.

Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Hilton properties and I'm a Hilton honors member, with that said, I frequent mostly Hilton's but this one was awful!! Checking in at 2:30pm there were only 2 clerks available. The lines were confusing and the check in process was very slow. Second, the buffet was near the lobby so it smelled like rotten seafood. Upon entering the room, the carpet was dirty and the bathroom was outdated. On top of that, the tissue box was at it's end so I had to use tp. They left out the lotion as part of the amenities pack as well. And finally, the valet parking parked my car outside where I had major water spots from the sprinkler system when they have underground parking!! If I'm paying $25 for that service, that is unacceptable! My sister self parked;1

We came for 1 night on 8/6 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Weâre locals and wanted a night out in the city. We really wanted to love this place but just couldnât.   More than 1/2 the rooftop bar was closed and they wouldnât open it up for us or others that asked despite the fact that there was no event going on at 11pm on a Tuesday night and we were hotel guests.The few seats that they had were taken by couples or sleeping children there with their parents. So we left. This was a HUGE disappointment given that the rooftop bar was a big reason we booked here.  I called down for extra pillows when we checked in at 4:30, but by 10:30pm nothing had been delivered to our room. We went to the front desk and were assured we would receive 2 feather pillows, however instead we;1
We have had great experiences with Days Inn in the past, but this was absolutely horrible. The staff were rude when we arrived to board our luggage and rude when we came back to check in. Our room was put down as a no-show three days after we checked in and we were locked out of our room and it was booked for someone else. We had to try and deal with getting back into our room at 1 in the morning and were being told it was our fault because we didn't know who checked us in, didn't answer the phone when they called the room once that afternoon (because we were out on vacation enjoying New York), and that we needed to handle it. After sorting through this mess we were called the next day and were being asked why we never showed up and who were the people the hotel booked in our;1
When a family member is hospitalized, you usually have enough on your mind. Having to stay the night in town I needed somewhere close. This hotel seemed like a good place since I could walk to the hospital, but it turned out to be a nightmare.  First upon checking in I noticed they made a photocopy of my drivers license. When I asked why they needed that, I got about five different explanations, none of which seemed believable. They even threw in 9/11 to try to make it seem like it was a matter of security.  Exhausted, I went to my room turned on the heater and went to sleep only to wake up in the morning freezing cold. I went to the front desk and was told that the hotel heater was out and that I should use the space heater that was in the closet. There wasn't one in the;1
Front desk staff were rude.   I made a booking which clearly advertised free internet.  When i got to my room, they refused to provide it and insisted I had to pay a ridiculous amount to get internet.  Come on guys, its not 2002.  I suggest avoiding this hotel.;1
Stayed for 2 nights 24/25th January 2008 No problem with location bus stop opposite hotel and tube station close  by, room clean comfortable bed , good shower, no view from room so kept blind closed, after all you do not go to NY to spend time in your room.

Is one of the WORST hotels Iâve stay in my life. The only good thing was the location because they have other hotels for better price. The bed was âkingâ, the water was only boiling hot or mega cold, and with the cold temperatures and my heater was not working. After this I complained to the front desk and her response was âMy heater at home doesnât work neitherâ  This is without adding that the room is not as they show in the picture. The room is small, everything is outdated with mold and rust.;1
I am an experienced budget traveller. I am happy to have a room & not expect more than a bed & a bathroom as long as it's clean.  I paid approx Â£800 for 6 nights here. My first impression of the room was 'wow this is big.' I opened the blinds , nearly choked on the dust & immediately noticed that they had not been cleaned recently.  The wall paper was peeling off & there were dirty marks all over the walls. The carpet was tatty all the way round the edges. Looked like the room had been self catering at some point as there was a random sink in the room & empty kitchen cupboards, there was a big uncarpeted tatty square which I assume used to be space for a fridge?  As mentioned above, I budget travel so had a bit of a giggle at the shoddiness but was a bit miffed this was the most;1
I don't usually leave reviews but I had to write this one.  This was the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. The actual room was OK. Tiny, but clean. Street noise meant I didn't get to sleep until 4am any night (I was there for 4 nights) but it's New York so...  I had originally booked for 3 nights but added an extra night. The front desk staff did not communicate this to the housekeeping staff so on the forth day I got back to find that I was locked out my room and my stuff had been taken out. That was fine. My stuff (just clothes, umbrella ect) was downstairs in the office, in a bag. The front desk staff was helpful and found it for me. No big deal. I understand that sometimes there is a miscommunication. I was able to reenter my room and stay there that night.  However;1
Dreadful.  We had to ask for our room to be changed twice.  The first room had dirty peeling wallpaper and a filthy floor.  The second had a bath/shower where the tiles were coming off the wall and a strange substance in the bath.  The third and final room had peeling wallpaper, a filthy carpet, dirty curtains, no handles on any of the drawers but at least the bathroom was clean.  The hotel is in an old building and would be charming if it was clean and renovated.  Which it isn't.  The carpets throughout were dirty, the walls were dirty and although we had a room for four people we were only given sufficient towels for two people.  On the postive side, the hotel is in a great location and at least the sheets and towels were changed every day.  Would we stay here again?  Not in a;1
Booking a place without checking reviews was my biggest error. The photos look nothing like the website and Basil Fawlty & staff have much in common. The fire alarm going off at 2am was accompanied by an announcement we think in Spanish but we will never know as an announcement in English never followed. Having spent 2 hours in the street we reentered the hotel & suggested to desk staff that an announcement in English would be appropriate to which he replied âIâve had a very busy night & didnât have timeâ ð³. The reception has cracked tiles and undulating floor, the lifts are dark & dirty & the place is shabby. The rooms were clean enough but the AC rattlers in the windows need replacement. Upon arrival the odour in the room was unpleasant and the alternative room offered was;1
Worst experience Iâve had at a hotel. They lost our reservation from booking.com and when we finally checked in the room we got was very obviously the room thatâs never been updated since this hotel opened. The bathroom door was molding and falling apart and the shower never actually got any hotter than lukewarm. The thermostat was ripped off the wall and when we turned on the heater manually it started spewing smoke, we notified the front desk who had maintenance come and say there was nothing they could do. Hotel staff was rude and very obviously would rather do anything but help you. Youâre much better off staying anywhere else but here.;1
I am a world traveler and this was honestly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie. I have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel. The lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent, but this is all a lie. As soon as you get off the elevator to your room, the hallway is dim, carpets are old, walls need painting, and it smells musty. The rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned. The bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay, there was hardly any counter space above the sink, and they;1
I recently stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine, date of check-in was 9.9.09 - separate rooms.  It started out just fine until we tried to sleep after both having very long flights.  The newly opened hotel bar really should be called a club AND it really should not be in this hotel.  It kept both of us awake at all hours of the night.  Remember that NYC bars don't shut down until about 4am.  When we complained to the front desk, he tried to give us the excuse that all the rooms are soundproof.  Nice try, but I don't think so.  The bags under my eyes are proof.  My friend has her own handful of complaints with this place - they didn't stock her room with clean towels and they didn't clean her room until we specifically asked and requested them to do so.  This is probably;1
You have to pay for internet. The rooms are so small! Request a larger size. We could not even fit our luggage in the room! The shower only has one door, so water pours all over the bathroom if you take a shower. No bathtub. The toilet ran all night, so we could hear it running and running. We called for it to be fixed but it still ran all night the next night. The room was not ready at their check in time. Not even three hours later! It is a good location but there are many hotels nearby that are way better! Oh, we stayed there for the roof top pool. It was CLOSED all weekend. We couldn't even go out on the deck.;1

We visited this hotel early January and stayed for a period of 7 nights. The service was absolutely shocking!! Check in has long ques and the staff at check are not the friendliest. No smiles or anything to do with the personal touch.    It feels like the staff are trained to give robotic responses rather then have the personal touch. When we had arrived the water was ice cold in the shower and eventually this did get sorted.   The hotel is outdated and has no ambienace at all. The life safety certificate is expired (This expired last year, and as at 9 January 2019, 6am, was still not updated)  In 2018 I visited 2 other Hilton hotels in Italy and the service was just as bad, not sure if this is a Hilton thing. Even if I were to get a free stay at a Hilton, think I am done!!!;1
It is cheap and nasty. I got bitten by bed bugs.The staff and manager are unhelpful. If you are unlucky enough to get a room above the 1st floor the kitchen and bathroom are not kept clean. Some kitchens have toasters and microwaves but the one near our room did not. There are cockroaches in the kitchen and the toilets smell like urine. It is noisy with doors slamming all night so is difficult to get a good night sleep. It is cheap and has good transport connections but it is just not worth it.;1

First of all, this hotel or Wyndham just need to disappear.  Checked in on a Saturday.  Had reserved the room for 4 nights.  Lobby was big but nothing really going for it.  The front desk gave me a room on the 27th floor.  I thought to myself great I will have a decent view.  Not only did I not get a decfent view, I got a loset sized room with barely space for one of us leet alone two people in there.  There was peeling paint everywhere.  Old gross doors you were afraid to open because you were not sure what you will find behind the walls.  I always check the bathrooms before I make myself comfortable so you can guess what I found had me horrified.  Black spots all over the nasty old white time, peeling paint, and gualk from the tiles.  Oh god it was vile.  You think I stepped;1
1) When we reached the hotel, no one was there to help us with out largages. We have 5 huge largages and several small ones. We have to load our stuffs to the trolley ourselves and push it to our room!  2) the room was infested with small roaches! I have killed at least 5 baby ones and 1 teenage one!  3) we had a power trip in our room. I have to call the operator 3 times and waited for 1hr before someone came and attend to me.  Bottomline, Don't ever stay here!;1
Where do I start, the AC IN THE ELEVATORS didnât work so if you went from the 30 floor to the 1st and you stopped more than 3 times you are stuck in there for 3+ minutes. One of the days the hot water ran out. The âdoormanâ at the elevators are rude. They were understaffed when I received a package in the mail room and I had to wait a day to get it. The rooms are really small, they make them look big in the pictures. The AC inside the 2nd floor conference room does not work efficiently. Good things are itâs in a good location and it has a lot of history to it.  Itâs way overpriced. Stay here one night to experience it then go to a newer hotel.;1
"I been traveling all over the world, from rich to poor and very poor countries and to be honest this was the worst ever. As soon as we get off from the taxi we saw the building and seems scary, but you know could be just an old building but it wasn't just that. We went in to the reception and the guy didn't even say hi, he just ask for the reservation. He gave us the key and the adventure starts. Is like 3 or 4 building all connected by a long and dirty corridor, with 5 public phones cabin without the phone and all the cables out, very dangeouros. Got into the elevator, naaaaaaaaaaaaaasty smell awful, we got off the elevator we took the left door (""S"") and found our room, but right in front of it was the toilet very small, but that wouldn't be any problem, it was unacceptable";1

Nothing like having $300 of Hyatt gift cards in hand and having the front desk unable to process them - causing me to pay for the  entire charge out of pocket.

They made me wait 10 minutes before I finally was able to check in.  Now the manager said I have to wait until monday and call back for the reservations dep.t can then ""look into it"".  Meantime I am charges another 330 dollars.  The new reservations they made for me at time of check-in was priced higher and I had to dispute the different price upon check-out, further disrupting my day.

I have attended night clubs/bars in New York, Miami, Southern California, and Europe, and have never been so degraded like this.  I will never go here again. I could've told hundreds of friends, but no, this place is tainted.   Ashamed!  Nicole Lopez-Alvar";1
I would give this hotel zero stars if that was an option.   We spend a wonderful day at Universal Studios on June 13, 2017, and on that evening at 10 pm PST, we went to check into our room (two moms, five kids) only to find out there were no rooms left. I had even called earlier in the day to confirm we were checking in later that evening. We had booked our rooms via Priceline.com on May 9 and were charged in full for them on May 10.   While the team there did call hotels in the area to help find us a place to stay, overall the customer service was horrible. It was the worst travel experience I've ever had in my 44 years. I wrote a letter to mgmt. explaining what happened to us and asking for a refund for our original room that was paid for. I have yet to hear a response.   At;1

I honestly don't know how anyone can give this hotel a good review.  A party of 8 of us stayed at The Empire for 3 nights on a recent trip from the UK to New York, having chose it based on it's proximity to Central Park.  When you enter the hotel the reception looks nice enough, however as you go up a few floors you notice that the decor is dated and the carpets are grubby.  Our room was tiny with only a curtain for a wardrobe door. The bedding was fresh but the rest of the room had a musty odour and paint was flaking from the bathroom door and around the skirting boards.  The carpets, though hoovered, hadn't been cleaned in ages.  The roof top terrace was accessed through a dingy stair case and consisted of a pool which was dirty (and closed off) and a small seating area with;1
We went here thinking since it was close to Broadway, we could enjoy the show we had tickets for without walking.   We don't mind walking, but wow, super far.   Also, rooms were extremely small and sheets were stained and rough.   One flat pillow each ,seriously?  One towel each mind you, I have long hair and need one for my hair as well but they didn't answer the phone upon Calling the front.    Extremely long lines and poor service.;1

My advice is not to stay here. Even having been upgraded to one of the best rooms, tThis is one of the worst Hiltons I have stayed in, having stayed in many around the UK and America. The decor is extremely outdated, the bathroom was old and more like a Travel lodge standard. The food was bad. Unclean and generally a very bad experience. We changed hotel by the next night.;1

I checked in at midnight and they would not allow a late checkout without paying extra. I stay on Century BLVD (LAX airport) a lot for travel. I normally stay at a 4 star (Hilton, Westin, sheraton or Crown Plaza). These other hotels always allow me to check out late. The reason for one star is I will not stay here again because this is important to me as flights are often delayed. Other than that nice hotel;1
This place was disgusting. As soon as we enter the room you could smell a rancid smell of  Old yogurt.  It was emanating from the fridge which was warm and not clean. The ceiling had previous water damage and the paint was falling off. The air conditioning unit looked old and had bare copper wire showing. It look like it was installed by a five-year-old. The showerhead mall all the way around the shower glass and bathtub. The bathtub flooring was stained brown in the showerhead was dirty. The cover  for the showerhead was falling off.  They were spiderwebs all over the room and the bathroom. This is the worst place Iâve ever been in. Who are there for approximately 10 minutes I decided to go find another place to stay. The management would not give us a refund and was very rude.;1
We booked a week holiday here to spend NYE in NY - the reviews seemed good and the location was great, but don't be fooled. Any standard double room is facing an inner courtyard that has a really loud fan which will go on day and night. We asked to change rooms but because all standard double rooms are facing the courtyard, they were all noisy and we couldn't sleep for 2 days. Eventually the hotel manager said the only option is to cancel our reservation - which is not what you want 2 days before NYE when everything is fully booked and over priced. The gym is small, dirty and not fit for purpose at all - basically a basement with 2 treadmills and some weights. Not worth at all.;1
I have never seen a hotel so bad in all my life. We arrived and checked in quite quickly and were given a room key not a card an old key, I should have guessed from here that it would be a disaster. We went up to the room and when we opened the door we were surprised to see only a bed with 4 walls around it. There was no space for movement in the room at all and the double bed couldn't even fit two of us into in and the mattress was rock hard so there was no way we could have slept. The bathroom was small and absolutely filthy. Once our cases were in the room too we couldn't even breathe. We went to ask to change room but told it wasn't an option. The hotel had a very funny smell all around it and I certainly didn't feel comfortable. There was absolutely no way we were staying;1
Very poor rooms Not at all spacious and very congested.  The bathroom is also extremely small even though we booked a room for 4 people with 2 double beds. There is hardly any space to walk in the room. Not a good experience at all except that the hotel is located at a very prime location. There is no hospitality and even the receptionists didnt talk to us properly.;1

When I stayed at this place , there was one lady who was extremely rude and disrespectful. An incident occurred over the phone and in the process of that she stated I better pray to Obama in reference to me being black . Her name was Luna . She feels she can say whatever to whom ever because she is related some way to the owners. I never had any issues there until that lady started working there . I Called Wyndham to complain but I have yet to hear back from them. The other lady Angela Nelly was extremely respectful and apologetic for what the lady Luna has said and spoke to me .

They charge you for any thing and everything without telling you. The rooms are small and the view is not that great. The swimming pool is 2x4 feet and the water in it is not clean. The only good thing about it is the proximity to the central park. I don't recommend it to anyone.;1
"Had this hotel booked before COVID happened but then COVID came and we couldn't travel. So I tried to get it refunded as COVID is outside of my control so we asked for a refund but were denied. Via a number of email exchanges they simply said nothing much we can do about it. I understand that it wasn't easy for them as well but I'm not going to physically be there so your simply taking my money and running away with it. They did offer a voucher which lasts 1 or 2 years; that was no use as I knew COVID would last much longer, and it did. If they simply said, we can refund but need to charge you a little of the haste, paper work and so on then that's understandable but this was a joke.   Due for the above reasons I cant recommend them at all.";1
I entered a TripAdvisor review through the hotel feedback system, but they did not permit it to be entered--I suspect they are repressing many of the reviews from last week.  Let me say what happened: 1) a complete power outage for 17 hours, resulting in no lights and no water (no flushing toilets, no showers), 2) pitch black hallways with no emergency lighting, and stairways with no emergency lighting (pitch black), 3) people walking down 11 flights of stairs, in the dark, with heavy suitcases, 4) could not contact the hotel staff, because the phones didn't work, 5) no housecleaning, obviously, 6) before the power went out, a water leak that threatened to cave in our bathroom ceiling, forcing us to change rooms, 7) faulty air conditioning, leaving it 90 degrees in our room the;1
We were moving to a new house and needed to stay in a hotel for a week. So we selected this hotel because of the swimming pool for our two children. Upon arrival we were informed the pool was closed for renovation - our travel agency was not informed so first communication incident.  Our first night was bad. The room was hardly big enough to fir the 4 of us (total bill was $2700 for a week by the way), airconditioning was insufficient and noisy, bathroom is lower quality than anything a YMCA can offer these days (no shower curtain, damaged door), stained carpets etc. So I complained the next day but there was nothing they wanted to do : contemporary bathroom design is the management choice, standard AC across the hotel...

We've chosen this hotel because of its close localization to Universal Studios, the spot is very good and close to the theme park. Unfortunately, the hotel is extremely loud, especially during the night, sounds like moved furniture could be heard the whole night. That wasn't accidental, because it repeated every night. We didn't sleep well. We can't say anything positive about this hotel and it's absolutely not worth its price.;1
I stayed in room 408 (Booking.com reference number: 3877502173) On 16th July 2022, it was 40 degree celsius and the AC did not work at all. I kindly requested to move rooms and the night receptionist (his name was Alms) refused to move saying that they is housekeeping costs to move and the hotel is fully booked. Then again on checkout, I complained about the AC not working and the day receptionist lady (her name was Shol) said that she can give me 10% discount. In the end no 10% discount was given, and they should not charge customers because when you pay $180 per night, you expect to have a peacefull sleep and not be sweaty all night and not been able to sleep. On top of all this, the hotel staff lied that the AC was working to Booking.com team!!!!!;1

This is the worst hotel I have every stayed at.  Upon checking in behind us was a homeless person trying to get a free room.  My children were terrified while we waited for our keys to our room. The front desk people were rude and unfriendly.  We went to our room and it was disgusting.  There were holes in the blankets and sheets.  The bathroom was beyond small and had mold in the shower (no tub).  There was a missing cabinet from the wall and bugs crawling around it.  If you look out the slding glass door you will see the homeless and and the hookers on the street.  After 45 min we checked out and went to the Hilton to a real hotel.  The front desk did not care about any of our complaints since they had a flood of 50 rooms and wanted to give our room to someone else.  We still;1

This was my first time staying at this location (or any Hilton) and I will not be back. The front desk staff was knowledgable and kind, thats when the great experience ended. The sink in our room was clogged. The elevators are being worked on so only a few are operational, they ask you to take the stairs in a note. This wouldn't be bad if the room wasn't on the 19th floor. There was a storm the night of our stay which caused leakage in the room and I was told the building was not designed for rainy weather and if I needed towels to soak up the water to call room service for more.   A friend came to visit us in the hotel and payed for parking, the hotel charged her card and my card the cost of the room 267 dollars plus 298 dollars deposit.I was also double charged for parking on;1
Where do I start. We arrived at 3 in the afternoon for a 5 night stay. The receptionist was watching porn on his phone as we tried to check in. We eventually got his attention and got are keys for the room if that's what you can call it. The towels was filthy with stains all over them as were the bedsheets. The room smelled like it hadn't been Cleaned since it opened, filthy carpets stains on the wall cigarette burns all over the bathroom.  The window didn't Shut properly so you could hear everything  going on all night. But that was nothing compared to the amount of bites I received from the first and only night we stayed there firm bug bites. We had to spend another $600 booking another hotel for the remaining 4 nights. And guess what the receptionist was watching on his phone;1

Stayed for three nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York. Booked on Expedia. When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day. I asked what this was for and mentioned I was not notified of this additional fee when booking. The staff informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made. I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room. However this didn't matter and the fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked and they did not note fee anywhere.   Also, this hotel is not a 4 star hotel.

"Have to say as a 1st time in New York that I was so disappointed with what is a 4star hotel. Had contacted the hotel on several occasions to request a high floor looking towards the Empire state building. I also requested a fridge in the room which I paid for. On Arrival the hotel put us in what I can only describe as a prison cell. There was no enough room to swing a cat and a view of a building wall. There was pieces of old paper hiding cracks in the bathroom door!!!. I immediately went to reception to complain and despite showing the confirmation emails of my request they were stubborn and unhelpful. Eventually they agreed to move the next day but we had to pick up the cost of the ""upgrade"" onto a accessible room. We agreed that all our belongings would be moved by the staff";1

"My wife and myself with my brother just returned from a fantastic holiday in New York City. It was my first time in the city, and for anyone who's there for the first time, it really does just blow your mind. I would just like to point out to fellow Lonely Planet members to AVOID Morningside Inn. It is located in Morningside Heights on 125th St, and what a dump it is! Firstly and most importantly they completely messed up our reservation. Upon check-in we were told that the type of room that we had booked (And confirmed!!!) was not available and they gave us a twin room with 2 small single beds for the 3 of us!!! The attitude of the girl on reception was awful, 0% customer care. In fact she made a joke saying ""Oh well no worries, you look thin anyway"" What a disgrace. I am";1

And that only 1 set of elevators was in service; and of those sets of elevtors only 1 went to the top floor.  When I got to my room there was an ultraviolet light under the bed like some sort of wierd love hotel.  The wifi on the top floor never worked so I waited 10 minutes to reach the ground level where it was meant to be ""better"". The wifi on the ground floor was terrible also; too slow to use. I had to keep using starbucks wifi my entire trip.";1
My travel agency recommended me this hotel to spend 7 days, everything went well, excellent price! until the exit happens! we stayed on the 20th Floor, and at check out they presented a bill of 270 dollars because there was a little ash in the window on the inside on the 20th floor, with a wind from the other world! the evidence they gave me was these attached photos. cheap is really expensive! escape from this hotel, at the reception everything is noted, in order to deceive the tourist. we sent for someone responsible, and a normal counter employee came, who did nothing but say that he offered to keep his bags! (pay if 5 for each bag). after 5 minutes, he said that after all we had to pay to keep it. a person in charge came who was watching everything but pretended (Kader;1

Please be advised that this hotel is partially being used as a homeless shelter and therefore the halls an elevators can be shared with dangerous, loud people. In addition to that, the area around Penn Station is the worst in Manhattan as one will clearly see upon arrival. The check in area is a mix of tourists and homeless residents and their shady visitors. We rode the elevator up to our room with homeless people who were barefoot. Another commenter mentioned that it looked like welfare people were staying at the hotel and he/she is correct. A call to the local police station (or a good Google search) can help advise in choosing a better hotel.;1
"This is a run down, tired and dirty hotel whose only redeeming feature is it is in New York. There the attraction ends. Mould-covered air conditioning units you canât control; a seventh floor bedroom window that doesnât shut; a room no self-respecting cat would want to be swung in; a toilet that, bizarrely, wasnât fixed to the floor; and filthy carpets. It would be a mystery to us if this place received a two star rating. We moved after one night to the excellent Grand Hyatt on East 42nd street, with little price difference. To The Empire Hotelâs credit, they agreed to refund the two nights we didnât stay there.";1

Well, our airline overbooked our JFK flight and flew us to New Jersey. We caught a cab and made it to the hotel an hour and a half later than we wanted to be.   We booked this hotel based upon the close proximity to JFK, shuttle service and breakfast.  We arrived at midnight. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the entry. There was already a party going on somewhere. Lots of screaming, yelling and music. We didnât sleep until 2:30ish and we had an early flight the next morning.  The room was small. The foldout bed was placed right in front of the bathroom, I donât know why it couldnât be next to the window instead. So, you had to crawl over the person using the pullout bed.  Breakfast was subpar.  I complained to the desk in the morning. All he said was sorry.  Shuttle;1
"We chose this hotel for its proximity to Universal studios. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed with the hotel, our room and service. The double room on 22nd ""executive"" floor was very small, with outdated furniture and uncomfortable beds. There were large holes on the wall above our bed, probably from a missing shelf or picture, the bathroom had old tiles and a leaking shower with mouldy corners. The continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs (which was included) was very mediocre.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience, it felt like Motel 6 but we payed close to  $ 400 a night. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone, there are so many nicer places to stay for half the price. Just take the shuttle to Universal.";1
I can just say one thing: Don't stay here. The rooms are horrible with cold water showers and broken toilets. The manager is rude and scary when complaining. No internet access available even though it is promised on website. The list goes on and on...;1
"My wife and I were staying in the hotel for 5 nights and wish we would not have booked the hotel. In the first day, we were arranged in a very noisy room with a broken air-con. The next day we asked for changing to another room but still not be better. The worse happened on the 2nd day of our stay; we went out and bought some panties then left our shopping stuff in the room (there is no safe in the room); then the day after we went out again with the no-room-service tag on the door but when we came back the room was serviced (not as clean as we expected) and we realised we lost 3 pairs of panties (it's like someone entered our room and looked for everything carefully). We reported to the hotel the first time, they promised to contact in the afternoon but no hear anything. The";1
after a five hour road trip from Las Vegas we arrived at the Hollywood Hotel .We had a prepaid reservation for two rooms.One was ok ,the other did not have a working AC That night the hotel was full so they could not change us .The old man in the front desk was alone and said he could not speak to a supervisor at that moment and couldn't do anything about it  , he offered a fan. My kids had to sleep that night in a hot room . We could not open the balcony doors because ,the hotel area is not a nice neighborhood.The following day they changed us three times because the AC was not working in  those rooms  either. They even got mad at us because they don,t have housekeeping personnel after 3 in the afternoon and my kids used the bathroom while they waited to be changed  to another;1
I went alone to this hotel in august 2012. I traveled a lot in my life and this has been definetly my worst experience. First of all, i was in New York to visit the city and i was looking only for a bed, nothing more, so the room which was around 4 feet x 10 feet did not scare me. Also the bed, which was long about 6 feet did not scare me even if i could not sleep on my back. The most terrible thing was the air conditioning, infact, despite the temperature in my room was always more than 80, the conditioner was very incredibly noisy. I slept three hour and then i did check out. Never again, adieu The Jane.;1
"I had paid a reservation for two single rooms in the internet some three months before my and my companion's intended stay in the hotel. When we got to the hotel from airport around 6 P.M., we were told that our reservation was ""not on the system, though it's paid"" and that nothing can be done. We were sent to another cheap motel on the other side of the city, far away from Morningside Inn's good location. We thought that there would be accommodation for us in this another motel, but there wasn't. We had to pay for the rooms ourselves. Happily, things turned out much better, but no thanks goes to Morningside Inn or their receptionist's rude idea of service.  Keep out of this place unless you want some real trouble by noticing that you don't have a place to sleep in a strange big";1

Me and my friend had very bad experience with this hotel. It started even with the first check-in. The manager Erin is very rude and not professional to treat customers. She used threatening language for a small matter of miscommunication. She behaved like this hotel is her and she can do anything she likes. Anyway I was sent to the top floor room. When I opened the door, I found the room is not made: the bed is a mess, the towels are on the floor. There is even a towel in the toilet! I called the front desk about this and ended up moving to another room on the same floor. However, the heating in the room is bad and I did not have much sleep because of the cold and noice. I had a room on the 8th street side and It kept producing noice throughout the night. Next morning when I;1
This review is for a Captain's Cabin room: We wanted to love this place and were planning to stay for 5 nights. It has a great history & I did enjoy the decor. Cafe Gitane (the restaurant downstairs) is wonderful. And I will say, the staff we dealt with were very warm and considerate. Our 2nd floor room had an amazing patio, that if it were nicer weather, we would have definitely used. The small downsides we noticed right away were that 1) our T-Mobile cell phones did not work at all (not even on wifi), and 2) the bed was not comfortable at all.   However, the worst was to come: Starting around 10pm and going until 4am, the music from the ballroom was so loud that I literally could feel the bass through the bed. It was totally unacceptable for the rate we were paying, and when;1
We arrived early and stored our luggage until we could check in. The guy at the front desk told us to come back and check in at 2pm. When we came back, we were told that we had to wait half an hour for a room to be serviced. We did... But no room. We kept being told it would be ready shortly and waited an hour and 45 minutes, not checking in until 3:45. Staff were completely unapologetic despite wasting our time. We don't mind if check in is at 4pm, but don't tell us it's earlier and keep us waiting.   When we went to check out, a piece of paper had appeared under our door indicating they had charged us $27 for a processing fee each night we had stayed. When we asked what it was for, we were told it was Internet. So even though it says free wi fi, it's not. They actually charge;1
When we arrived at the hotel there were a lot of people standing around waiting. I was wondering why. When it was our turn to check in, we were initially told that our room wasnât ready and it was almost 8pm. I told them I was a diamond member and they assigned us a room. We thought it was a good thing but we were wrong. When we opened the door to our room, it was a room that someone was still staying in. We walked right out and I went downstairs to complain. They gave us another room but it was much smaller and it was just horrible. The hotel is poorly managed and employees can be nice but donât do anything to accept responsibility for their actions by making the stay a little better because of the unprofessional action of giving us someone elseâs room that was still occupied.;1
Great location. Thatâs about it really. Hotel upgraded us to a city view room, unfortunately between dirt and broken seals around windows the view was disappointing.  Found medication packaging behind  bin in room, a mans sock at side of bed, skirting boards window sills filthy. Sheets not ironed, curtains looked filthy. Bathroom so basic and tile ridges filthy, overall a very poor standard. Then hit with a $30 per night  tax $120 and $5 per case $25 to store luggage after checkout. Bed, toilet and bath where clean and after being travelling for  20 hours we  where just glad to get our heads down. Reception said we should of informed them on arrival, think their missing the point the room should  be cleaned properly at all times. When leaving the lift (certainly where room 3322);1
So disappointed! We were charged Â£85 to have our room 4 hrs early from check-in time. Our 11 year old was exhausted, so we paid it, even  though our room was ready. The rooms were clean but needed updating. Area not the best, especially when you have a child.;1

I attempted to call the New Yorker with some questions and to hopefully make a reservation. Unfortunately the call was outsourced and I couldn't even get to the front desk. Instead, I was transferred off to some half-assed timeshare schpiel. Oh, and then a 2nd half-assed timeshare schpiel where the people on the phone tried to trick me into giving them all my info, including credit card - just so I could get a $25 gift card, wow! After trying to call and complain about this I was transferred to at LEAST 9 different #s and people none of whom could help me. I finally just got in touch with the hotel themselves, and was told to send an email. Well wouldn't you know it I never received a response to that either. Don't stay here, not that you could if you tried. Some of the most;1
I chose this place because it's close to Penn station.  The location is the only thing going for this 'hotel'. The room was cold.  The toilet wouldn't flush.  The faucet was leaking. The strangest thing was the blood like splatters I found in the bath tub. I was on the top floor, so the blood could be coming from the roof.  I couldn't find where the blood was dripping from.  They were soon washed away by the leaking faucet, so I have no proof if they were indeed blood or they ever existed. This is a place I would never return.;1

I went to New York as a birthday surprise with my husband and young son.  We were aware that the hotel was advertised as a 2.5 star hotel, and as we had travelled to the US many times before, we knew that although basic, the hotels were generally very well kept.  This one was not - The room was freezing although the 'radiator' was on full.  We had to go to bed almost fully clothed to keep warm.  We stayed the first night as we didn't arrive there until the evening.  Wallpaper was dirty and in some places peeling away from the walls.  The windows were taped up with gaffer tape and in some places where the gaps were too big, there was foam material wedged into the gaps.  The heating made a gushing noise all night, there was steam and water coming from the valve and dripping onto;1

I have just returned from a visit to NYC after staying at Hotel Riverside Studios. If you are fussy about staying in a clean environment, do not stay here. My profession means I travel a lot and I am used to very cheap hotels yet I haven't come across anything like this before.  The room itself was big. Two double beds. An attempt at giving the room a cheerful feel with bright bedcovers was immediately undone by the massively uncomfortable mattress and wheels that meant the bed moved! I didn't dare sleeping under the covers, luckily it was very warm during our visit. Talking of warm, let me tell you about the air-con. It's a window unit that makes an ungodly sound and only when stood directly in front could the effects be felt but it did give small relief.   The room didn't feel;1

This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room is nasty looking, the carpeting is old and disgusting. The hallways smell like marijuana. The Wifi barely works, and there is no ice machine.   I'm not sure if I should even sleep in this bed. I will never stay in another Days in again.;1
From start to finish this place was pretty poor accommodation.  Positives:  - Good enough location if you intend on going to the Olympia Exhibition Hall as it's about a 20 minute leisurely walk.  - Within range of some nice places to eat and drink both low and slightly higher end.  - The floor looked clean enough   - Soap dispensers on the wall in the shower and by the sink.  - fridge in my room   - common areas reasonable clean  Negatives:  - I was volunteering at an event at the Olympia Hall and there was an social media group set up for us all to discuss various things. I happened upon a post that mentioned this accommodation and the fact that they had overbooked. and were turning people away or moving them over half an hour away to another hotel. Now, I realise this is;1
We always like to stay at a hotel at the airport the night before we fly anywhere and Hyatt Hotel is absolutely the perfect choice for us.

Terrible place to sleep. We had to change another hotel in the middle of the night because of the strong noise with the air conditioned and ice machine. It never happened to us before in any other hotel. The reception staff didn't care at all about us. I do not recommend at all. We only stayed 2 hours.;1
1. When charging guests ~$400 per night, you should NOT be charging them additional fees for WIFI.  This makes the Empire come across as low-end and greedy.    2. We booked online and had multiple issues with the booking.  On the occasions I called The Empire, some staff had no record of my reservation, while others did.  It seems completely unorganized.   I was also charged a deposit in advance that was $300+ in excess of what I owed - not sure why.  3. We stayed on the 11th floor which was noisy, especially at night.  The rooftop nightclub played music extremely loud - it was clear that no courtesy or thought was extended to the guests directly below.  4. When checking out, the gentleman working at the front desk seemed baffled by the deposit I had payed and did not understand;1

We were given a room for disabled persons (223) on the second floor of the hotel, which is a basement floor with no outside light due to trees in front of the window. The room wasn't cleaned properly and when we entered the water in the bath was running. We tried to turn it off, but the water crane was broken so it wouldn't completely turn off.  We went to the front desk to complain about this and request another room. Teresa, the lady at the front desk, wouldn't give us another room, because in the system it said that we had booked a disabled room. Housekeeping would come to clean the room and an engineer would come to fix the bath. 20 minutes later the engineer;1
This was once an ok hotel.  The location can not be beat...but the rooms are woefully outdated..peeling paint, smelly cigarette stinking carpets...outdated bathrooms, terrible a/c...and nasty staff.  No one answered the phone at the front desk or concierge...they charge an added a mandatory  $23 to cover two mini warm water bottles...no ice...no restaurant or room service...really terrible.  The worst thing that happened is that they gave a key to an incoming guest...who barged into our room while we were still there...I was about to head out to a meeting leaving my 12 year old daughter in the room when this big guy burst in unannounced saying the front desk had given him the key!  Needless to say I did not leave my daughter there...she came to the b'fast meeting.  I would never;1
Hi, My name is Bogdan B. I'm writing about the horror film taking place at the Days INN in New York. We have checked in september 1st, staying until september 5th/2017. I'm providing bunch of pictures from booth hotel rooms and halway as well (room #719 replacemt to > #431) To make long story short let pin point few things:  - we found cat poop in two different spots under the bed - very old, crappy AC unit with a black mold cover towel on the outside that got me and my 5year old daughter sick (whole room stinks as mold) - bathroom sink that once you use, you stand in water - destroyed, ripped, stained, dirty old carpets that make your feet black (disgusting to walk on) - construction side with scaffolding up to 8th floor - wallpaper that is coming off and ripped all the way;1

My friend booked a twin room for us here on June 22nd 2019 as we were having a girls night out in the city and wanted to stay over. After waiting in a huge check in queue at 3pm we eventually got to our room which was horrible. The whole floor where our room was situated actually stank, as soon as we got out of the elevator we could smell a disgusting damp, dirty odor. The room itself was small, cramped and dirty, the bathroom was disgusting and even had excrement marks on the floor. On examining the beds we found pubic hairs on the sheets which had clearly not been changed since the last guest. We decided we just couldnât stay there and went down to reception to check out and ask for a refund. We were told that the room price, which we had paid in full in advance, was non;1

I have to qualify my review to state that we were given a heavily discounted rate (I think it was $350 for 3 nights) if we agreed to sit through a Wyndham Time Share sales pitch. We sat yes.  We arrived at the hotel around 11 am and waited in line to check-in for over 30 minutes - a true inefficient front desk (only 3 customers in front of us, but we still had to wait 30 minutes). Not surprisingly our assigned room was not ready. No worries, can we store our bags and come back around check-in time of 4 pm? Sure - FOR $5/BAG!! That's right, luggage storage costs $5/bag. No tipping allowed, but at that rate, I would not have offered one anyhow. The desk clerk promised that they would call us as soon as our room was ready. Fair enough.  I will interject here that the New Yorker is;1
Good stay for seeing Universal studios and Hollywood. Bed, pillows and linens great quality. Room had a frig, safe, lounge, coffee table and writing desk. Nice views and very handy to Universal Studios with a free shuttle every 15mins. Rooms getting a little dated but very comfy. One could however easily twist one's back out of shape attempting to reach for toilet paper. Room service was prompt and we found the food good value with a wider selection than most (generally seems to be on the decline). The buffet breakfast was great, everything you could want with whole oranges freshly juiced - I liked that. The Sunday Brunch did look good but we didn't try it, appeared popular with locals. Hollywood was around a $13 cab ride away. Lifts were slow, not sure if they were all working;1
At check in, told desk clerk we were checking out of hotel next morning to go to Universal Studios.  Could we leave the car in the garage and specifically would we be charged for the next day.  Was specifically told if we left the garage by 7 p.m. we would not be charged for extra day (and the garage was pretty empty anyway.). Next day when leaving garage the automatic gate would not accept out parking card and charged another $30.  I donât have a problem with their parking rules, I DO have a problem with staff that ASSURED me of something that was simply incorrect.  Had he given us the correct information, we would have parked at Universal, a bit cheaper and closer.;1
"I live nearby, and had friends who'd come to visit and had nice things to say about this hotel & their stay.  Booked a room for them in person at their front desk for ~$150/night, two nights, prepaid; the desk clerk understood that my dad was NOT to receive the bill or receipt, this was a gift to him.  My folks arrived, no reservation in my name or in theirs; I had to go over in person with my card to restore the reservation.  The beds were not made, though the bedspreads were fully pulled up and neat, there were no towels in the bathroom.  Phoned down a request for sheets & towels, and for hangers for the closet (there were none), to the desk, and 45 minutes later went down myself to ask for them.  Over an hour after that (past midnight at this point) they showed up and made";1
Today is our first day in the hotel. From the begining we were really bad receptioned. A couple of weeks before we asked.for a crib as we are traveling with the whole family and our 11 month old daughter. The receptionist had zero sensibility with my wife carrying the baby and was really stupid with her. In the end of the day we are still without the crib, we completely lost our first day of vacation trying also to find out an inflatable tub for giving the baby a bath.  The baby is now slapping on the floor in a bed sheet.  No security and filthy floor.;1
At check-in, we were excited to learn we had received an upgrade.  Upon seeing the room, the excitement vanished.  Small does not begin to describe the room, even by NYC standards.  The mattresses sunk in the middle making it impossible for our family of four to sleep comfortably.  The sink design made it impossible to wash our hands without drenching our clothing.  And, at check-in, the only time our credit card was not in our possession, the card was compromised and used at another NYC hotel, necessitating the deactivation of our credit card while traveling out of town with our family. The hotel was unwilling to offer assistance, aside from one phone call asking for a few details, but no follow up or expression of concern, apology, or understanding for out difficulties.  We;1

The suite was a good 200 sq ft smaller than what we booked (easy to determine as it was a square) -- literally fraud. Continually operating restroom fan immediately adjacent to bed makes it impossible to sleep and staff did nothing in response to concern. Restaurant host misrepresented child buffet prices. Spent second half of trip at Hyatt Regency Orange and it was day (Orange) versus night (LAX).;1

Artived here for a 5 day stay.  Firstly the travel agent misled me a put the hotel if you could call it that. Secondly the mouthy receptionist smiled when she charged me an add Â£550 in security deposit ....not a good advert....then room wasn't what was booked.  A view of the Empite State building....in reality review over a derelict building site. Room was like a wardrobe and you had to close the door to use the bathroom. No food no coffee and charged $30 per night for the privilege of using the tv or internet even if you didn't.  No seats in reception because they were to idle to turn them round for people to sit on whilst they decorated the Xmas tree a day late as Thanksgiving was the day before . I sat on the back of a setee and was ordered to get of it even though I am;1
This hotel is advertised as 4*, how?? The rooms are tiny!!! Seriously small. A.queen room had 5 hangers and no.space for anything else. Literally no space people. Found a new insect crawling in the bathroom. The toilet kept on blocking for both reason at all. They also advertise free WiFi, which is a lie. You have to Pay. I went ahead an paid for it anyway only for it to not work anyway and I'm still waiting for my refund as I type! OK so the location is good if you want midtown hotel. But the edison on 47th street is the same price and 100% better. If you were thinking about booking here, don't. If you already have, tough look.;1
I normally don't write reviews but was so disappointed with my stay on so many different fronts that I wanted to share my experience.  My wife and I and two small kids were promised adjoining rooms.  On check-in, one was ready and the other was not.  When we came back that night, we were given a key to the second room and when we walked it -- there were animals in it (a dog and a cat) and it was disgusting.  The prior guests had not moved out and we were not notified of this in advance so we could make other arrangements.  When we told the front desk, they were not particularly helpful and it took numerous follow-up attempts before they rebooked us.  The bellman never showed up as promised to help us move our luggage so we moved it ourselves.  And calls to the front desk were;1
This hotel an easy stroll to Universal Studios and and the Metro station is only about a 10 minute stroll down hill. Wonderfully situated. The hotel is clean, with decent sized rooms. HOWEVER, everything inside the hotel is so slow. The check in/ check out procedures, the lifts, the restaurant service .. and the list goes on. At breakfast, we were amazed to watch a manager have daily arguments with staff on the floor. I dont think I saw one happy staff member during the whole stay.  I seriously dont think I will ever return here.;1

On setting foot inside the room my wife and I turned around and checked out again. The hostess was wearing her pajamas and is apparently a private residence masquerading as a hotel. My concern is that because of Booking.comâs non-refundable reservation policy the proprietors of this listing are making quite a bit of money from a very unprofessional enterprise. And yes, the photos are very misleading.;1
Both times I've stayed here, the drains in teh sink and shower do not work.  Why can't they fix it - surely I'm not the only one with the issues.  Second, this is a happening hotel and not in a good way.  I think there was a hooker in the lobby upon my arrival, doing her hair and makeup right there in the lobby mirror.  Nothing against sex workers doing what they need to survive, but I won't support a hotel that allows that, nor do I think it makes for a safe environment.  I won't be staying there again.;1

I had a room on the 20th floor as did my colleague. I have stayed hotels all over the world and would never stay here again.   When the lift stopped at floors up to the 20th floor the corridors looked like a dodgy old American movie. Seems to house small businesses and community projects. Not a hotel at all.   The corridor between the lifts and our rooms were dingy and in need of a complete overhaul. It was actually quite creepy.   Staff were indifferent and I overheard some being extremely rude to guests unhappy with their charges. It seems some âextrasâ are added on without notice.   The bedroom was tiny and in a poor state of repair. I could not believe the condition of the bathroom. Photos attached.   One morning, I went downstairs from the lobby to use the washroom. They;1
Stayed here for 5 nights, booked 4 rooms, 3 on the 11th floor and one on 2nd floor, we had plenty of issues and despite reporting to the front desk, junior management and hotel manager something everyday issues continued. Scott Griffith the manager refused to meet us about all of the issues and now 4 days after checking out has still not contacted us having promised to come back to us on Monday. In summary issues were in relation to room cleanliness, dirty showers, dust, glass on the floor, too many towels in one room for one person, 8 in total then zero the following day. Also had a number of issues in relation to noise reported to the front desk, people drunk late at night or running in the corridors.

Stay away from this place at all costs. I had the misfortune to stay at this place for a week. It is dirty, grimy, roach and rat infested and the staff is very very unprofessional and verbally abusive.  The staff was very unprofessional especially the manager Patrick. I was verbally abused for asking for a towel and when I finally got a towel from the cleaning lady 3 days later it was dirty with hair and brown spots all over.  A very sexist and verbally abusive manager. He would get upset at guys asking general questions and would reply happily to the same questions asked by a female. If you catch him on a bad day then good luck to you.  The stairway is dark and really dirty and grimy. The carpetting in the hallway is very old and extremely dirty. I understand that a hotel has;1

The room was kind of dusty but it's Manhattan, right -- I mean, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room anyways with only 24 hours in New York?

We chose your hotel because of the location which was perfect but unfortunately not much else was. 1. In my room (#248) the sink faucet was all jiggly. Pretty sure the thing shouldn't rock back and forth when switching from hot to cold. 2. The drain cover was not attached to the drain causing me to slip and break my neck in the shower. Not really but almost. 3. Sitting on the commode was scary because when I did, the toilet rocked back and slammed against the wall. 4. The lights in my sister's room (#232), half of which did not work, were controlled for some bizarre reason by the front desk. 5. In my brother's room (#230) the refrigerator was squealing (for real) so he unplugged it to shut it up and requested a new one. Which was never delivered. 6. The on-off switch was broken;1

I have been travelling in hotels in NY and ended up staying here as all other hotels in Manhattan were sold out. One of the worst hotels ever - the room that I got could not be located as there were no signs for the rooms. Finally, I had to go down and the manager told me that the room was located in the staircase area. Terrible, smelly rooms, rickety lifts - they claimed to have free wireless but it was so slow that it was good as useless. No provision for breakfast either - for the money I spent, I would never stay here again.;1
Just spent 5 nights at this hotel while in NYC for my daughter's college graduation.  Paid $385 for a Superior Double-Double.  Disappointments began from the moment of check in.  While I recognize that there are still some hotels that charge for wifi access, most will allow at least 3 devices to have access through the paid network.  Not the Empire, wifi is $9.99 per day, per device!  That's right - don't think about two people in the room using their laptops unless you want to pay $20/day.  Traveling with teenagers?  Forget it!  The next surprise came upon entering the room - we were on the first floor at the bottom of an air shaft.  Our windows looked out upon a maze of old ductwork, fans and trash.  Natural light was non-existent.  Room was tiny and had seen better days and;1
Room is tiny - understandable considering this is NewYork. But toiletries were not good quality. Room keep smelling sometimes. If you want to store cool drinks or some eatables, there's no fridge at all. Coffee/Tea Machine is not there. Even small 2 or 3 star hotels offer these basic amenities.;1

This hotel falls below Motel 6 in nearly all categories.  Horrible elevators, WAY OVERPRICED food and drinks, and staff that is unreachable.  I dare say that it's INSULTING for every customer to charge $3.50 per Keurig Coffee pod!   Within my first 2 hours of staying at this location, there room was not ready for 30 min, the carpeting was wet, I need engineering and housekeeping, called the front desk 8 times with no answer, and changed rooms.  Thank you to the manager for the free upgrade and room switch, but should not have happened in the first place. Save your money and save your trip!  DON'T STAY HERE!;1

"Hello,  Recently stayed in Woogo.   We were a party of three adults so booked a one bedroomed apartment.  When we arrived it was between nine and ten in the evening. There was no bed linen supplied for the sofa bed.  I went downstairs to request some and was told ""come back tomorrow - it's not my problem"" by the woogo employee responsible for checking people in and out.  Eventually, when I refused to leave the lobby without bedlinen he got the message. How he thought we could sleep with no bed linen is beyond me. He was rude, unhelpful - and it was a simple request - can we please have some sheets and some duvets/slumberdowns for the sofabed. The sofabed mattress was thin and not comfortable, i.e. springs and bars stick into you, we ended up sleeping on the floor on sofa";1

Your location is spectacular but the value is missing. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are too small, there was no hot water and the room was stuffy despite having the a/c on during the day. The night we were there it was cold out and though we wanted heatbwe we're told it wasn't available.;1
Everything about this hotel was unpleasant.  The rooms were very small, and dirty.  The elevator was so tiny, I think the most people we had on there was four people.    There is maid service but there was popcorn on the floor under the tv stand, and chocolate chips on the desk chair.  Went to take a shower, it took 5 minutes for the hot water to arrive.  There was no one at the front desk.  I stayed one night, anything longer than that would have to require a free night or have the room steam cleaned from top to bottom.  I will not and do not recommend this hotel.;1

The entrance is nice, but as soon as you step in you see dirt everywhere. The building was filthy beyond imagination, dismal, and the room not at all like the pictures shown on the website. We stayed one night out of the six planned because we thought we had already paid it, but then we found out that the 125 dollars we had paid Budgetplaces were just for the reservation, not for the night, so we had to pay 132 dollars extra!;1
"The hotel itself is cute and full of old-world features. This unfortunately stretches to bed bugs. We woke with sore red bites on our legs, and when we reported this we had to change rooms and give all our belongings to staff to be treated - either blasted in heat or wiped with alcohol. The issue is obviously rife because they have a code word for the problem (BB's) and a set procedure they follow. The staff were rude and made us feel like we were causing an inconvenience to them. We were also given contradictory information from various members of staff about how long the treatment would take. After the process, my spectacles came back to me broken and when I reported the problem at reception, all they would say is ""we just wipe them with an alcohol wipe"" and wouldn't accept";1
Location is the only reason to stay here for us. The rooms are overpriced, furniture beat up, draft in window, could not read the warm/cold on dial it was so old and worn out, no hot water one morning, no wash cltohes or coffee. All of this reported to front desk and never heard a peep from management over the course of four day staff. Seem very disinterested;1
Woogo is probably the worst Apartment Rental agency ever. My friends booked an apartment with them in August 2011. I had to call twice to get a written confirmation from the agency, and when they finally decided to send it, neither the number of nights nor the way to get the keys was mentioned on it. During their stay, we were informed that Woogo had only paid 5 nights to the owner (although my friends had paid 9 nights in advance) and that they were illegal occupants. And I don't even mention the dirty bathroom, the windows that do not close, etc. A real dump! Beware of Woogo!;1

We booked a 4-day stay at the Morningside Inn in late May-early June 2015 because of convenience for a college reunion celebration.   We were shown a first floor room which was Spartan but clean.  The first 2 days went smoothly but on the third day we woke up to cold water in the shower -- a boiler failure we were told.  The hot water was restored late in the day but our schedule for the day and evening was full.  Because the hot water was restored late in the day, we did not request moving to another hotel.  Nevetheless, on the 4th morning, the boiler failed again and there was no hot water.   On checking out we requested an adjustment in our charges and were told this would be referred to the hotel's ownership.   Repeated calls and emails about being compensated for the lack;1
Have just rerurned from a very disappointing encounter with the Astor on the Park hotel New York. Soaking wet floors, mouldy carpets and a three inch gap under the door were only the beginning.

I spent the last 3 nights at this hotel and it wasn't good...  After returning to hotel after a busy day in Manhattan we found that the maid service had not visited or cleaned our room... Not a major hassle but a service we had paid for but not received.  The following day we returned to our room briefly early afternoon to freshen up... This turned out to be good fortune as whilst we were in the room someone else came into the room... They had been issued a key to our room!! This was reported to the manager and we were given an apology and were ensured that it wouldn't happen again... Later that evening, on our return from being tourists, the security of our room was breached once again!! Another guest had been issued with a pass to our room... Twice in one day and luckily on;1

Visited this hotel during a family trip to New York as my daughters wanted to try out the rooftop restaurant for brunch. Visited on 11/11/18 and the setting and view was amazing, as was the young girl who greeted us when we arrived. However our server was unhelpful and appeared as if she was barely listening to us when we ordered our food. I ordered a lobster sandwich and both my daughters ordered chicken and waffles, however one had to be sent back as it arrived covered in sauce when my daughter had clearly stated âsauce on the side.â My lobster sandwich consisted of 4 mini toasted sandwiches with a tiny amount of mashed up lobster in them, it was so disappointing. My daughters did not particularly enjoy theirs either and in fact that night both of them were vomiting, canât;1

"The Empire used to be a great place to stay.  Our most recent stay changed our minds on that.  Check in took an hour.  When we asked for rooms (2) on a higher floor than the second floor rooms we were given we were told ""no"".  Our room did not have heat, no coffee maker, no working frig (one was present but wasn't working), and hadn't been properly cleaned (hair in the sink and shower drains, etc.).  Overall, very unpleasant.  In addition, on checkout, we were told that there is a $20/day fee for wifi and bottled water.  We didn't receive the water and the wifi is pretty bad.  In any case, we didn't have to pay this because we booked our room before this additional fee went into place.  Something to consider if you plan on staying here.  We were told that this is the new thing";1

The room was very dirty and old not what they marketing on the website, I had to call to change to another room because someone was smoking marijuana in a room. Many people walking in the halway during night making a lot of noise. During the day to checkout I was told I could checkout at 12:30pm so I went to take a breakfast, when I returning for my backpack around 12:05pm the room was locked and I could not open the door, I had to went to the lobby and wait for 20 minutes to someone to attend me, I would not recommend this hotel.;1

So we read the reviews, and decided this would be a good place to go. Big mistake.  Two of the electrical outlets in our room didn't even work, which I thought was weird. Then, my daughter, staying in another room said the same two outlets didn't work in her room either (rooms 212 and 214). It didn't even feel like the plugins had actual outlets behind them, so I don't think they were really wired. My guess is, if inspected they would not meet code.  The thermostat in our room could not be set to heat, and we needed heat. The picture shown is of a fountain that has no water. The view from our window was of a lot where some homeless stayed.   This was a huge mistake, and we won't be staying there again.;1
Here is the thing, if this was a lousy bangkok hotel for 30/night, then I would understand.  At this price point well....half the things in our room were broken.  The shower has no door, so after 3 min of use, you can go swimming by the toilet.  Yes I have seen that before (like in Europe), but in the USA, where the bathroom is big enough for a sliding door, just being cheap? Also, some lower rooms are so loud next to AC machines outside??..that there is no peace or quiet.  Literally had to convince myself the noise was anything else to somehow accept it...the loudest hotel room I have ever stayed in, and I have been around.  Just do yourself a favor and find another place. I easily take sleeping on a bamboo house raft again with no ac, sleep on the floor with ants crawling on;1

Hotel inside was nice, great location. But the second day my luggage was stolen out of my room. Spoke with the security and also filled out a report with the police.  Security looked at the camera's and said the only two people that went in the room was the maid and the mini bar person. Said they didn't see any luggage taken out. I explained to them that it was just a soft carry on bag which is easy to throw under some towels and take out. The bag was closed up so they could not see in it with my night shirt thrown over it.  Funny thing was that were my luggage was my night shirt was folded neatly.  The whole time i was there i was not even offered any compensation for not having my luggage and only had the clothes that i was wearing that had to last me for two more nights.;1
This was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever encountered. The room are so small that you can not barely move. The noise level on the 3rd floor sounds like a train is coming through. I had to request to be moved and was to the 7th floor. Believe it or not, the room was even smaller! Plus the TV was not working. This place is NOT worth your $$$. I have stayed in NYC thousands of times, and this hotel is by far the one with the smallest and most uncomfortable rooms. The housekeeper did a lousy job and basically made my bed the last day with dirty sheets and did not vacuum or clean anything. It was horrible.;1

The 1970s carpet had spots; the sofabed had holes and tears; had iron but no ironing board; dirty fingerprints on bathroom door; and old and worn furniture. Apparently this is half hotel/half homeless shelter. Seems like every room had a weed smoker staying there. Wyndham should be ashamed to have this place as part of their network.

Stayed one night at the Night Hotel last week.  The hotel in general was shabby and my room was even shabbier, and smelly.   The sink fixtures in the bathroom were broken and there was no hot water.  I asked for a wake-up call which never arrived.  When I checked out the desk clerk said he'd tried to call but the phone line to my room did not work.  The whole experience was so bad I wrote management the next day asking for a refund, something I've never done before.  I have not had a reply.;1
We were booked into this hotel by our travel agents for a last minute trip. What a shock, what a dump. The rooms were filthy and there was a terrible stench. The rooms that were supposed to be with two double beds in fact had one bed that two grown men were supposed the share! The single room had a bed crammed into it so there was hardly any room to move. The carpet was so old and dirty that it had become black and flattened.The shower didn't work and the bathroom was filthy. We had no alternative but to stop the first night of our arrival but moved into another hotel at our own expense the following day. The lady at the reception didn't give a dam. This hotel nowhere near the centre of New York City. Avoid this place at all costs.;1
This was the worst hotel Iâve ever stayed in for the price we paid for two nights. First the goodâthe staff at the front desk were very friendly. Greeted us with a smile. The bell hops were pleasant as well. That is the only thing good I can say.  The hallwaysâdark and smelled somewhat like mildew.  Our roomâthere were 4 of us in a room that was very small including the bathroom. We had 2 towels folded in the shower. No wash cloths and toiletries enough for one person. We called for more basic supplies and they were delivered. (Shouldnât have to call). The space to place suitcases, hang clothes, is beyond minimal, as there is barely any. I realize this is an older hotel but updating furniture, etc is a doable investment. The air conditioning and heating unit is probably the;1
A more accurate description would be a hostel rather than a hotel. Run down grimy noisy grubby awful. Staff were friendly enough but no facilities in hotel worth talking about. Not a great place to stay tiny rooms with no views and really noisy decrepit air conditioning. I will never be back.;1
Having stayed in this hotel twice previous, I thought I'd take my son too. Big mistake... Place firstly needs new staff.... Concierge.. Appalling... No help whatsoever, wanted to print off passes for knicks game, asked concierge for help..to use pc and printer( you have to pay for  of course)There is a cocktail bar that non residential customers use and the staff can't do enough for the customers who are in and out of the hotel. Not cheap to stay here, so the least they should do is leave you to sit in the bar ( after being on your feet since early morning)  should you wish without plying yourself with drinks all night for the fun of it. We also had to change rooms twice as the smell of the bathrooms  was that of stale cheese, when the housekeeping had been and closed the;1
Booked 2 rooms, 1 was on the 3rd floor and 1 was on the first. First floor room was absolutely disgusting. Toilet ran all night, hair on the sheets, stains on the towels, bed was hard as a rock, curtain rods ripped off the wall, wasnât even a room number on the door. 3rd floor room was significantly different (still not nice). Both rooms were same price and worker tried to tell us the rooms were the exact same. Second floor room had carpet floors, fridge, table and chair, curtains, art on the wall, and a phone- all of which the first floor didnât have. Location is walking distance to good areas but not in a great area itself. Spend double your money and literally stay anywhere else.;1
Want a youth hostel for USD 360 a night, this is your place! Motel 6 rooms for Hilton prices. They spiced up the place outside and renovated the bathrooms, the rest is bare bones. Total and utter rip off. NYC is expensive, but this is a joke. WIFI is not working either.;1
Stayed 5/26-5/28 - Upon check in found the front desk staff rude. not hospitable at all (the young lady at the front desk projected distain for guests).  We had called a few weeks earlier to ask about early check-in policy (we took a red-eye to NYC) are elderly and needed to rest, we were informed Empire could accommodate us.  When low-and-behold upon arrival our friendly desk clerk said  our room would NOT be available until sometime between 1-2, we would receive a text to let us know (never received a text).  Room 438 smelled like mildew, tiny bathroom smelled unclean and also of mildew, no bathroom counter space, carpet in room was unclean, furniture is chipped, old, ceiling stains and cracks and the floor is uneven...causing multiple tripping.  This boutique hotel needs to;1
This is the worse review I will have given to a place in a long while. The first requirement of any hotel is a good night's sleep. Impossible here. The rooms are steaming hot with no way to lower the heat other than opening the windows and letting all the Broadway traffic in, which made it impossible to sleep well. The room furniture is worse than a college dorm rooms, the bed sinks in the middle and is very uncomfortable, the bathroom is as large as a hall closet, the lobby is ratty. Just a bad, bad experience. And I usually give places the benefit of the doubt. One nice thing: it is near the subway so you can make a quick escape!;1
I rarely post any review for hotel because  this is my fist poor and terrible experience with any Hotel in USA, So writing my review to beware others. I was planning for trip to New York with my family and was looking for a budget hotel. I found this hotel and despite of it negative reviews, I decided to give it a try. I got a free room upgradation from shared restroom to attached restroom, but overall all the rooms has a very bad smell and you will feel very uneasy from the moment youâre in the rooms. Moreover, there was no hot water and I called the staff to check , they came and checked but no action!! But still the last nail in the coffin was missing and that happened to me next day. I booked my room for 2 days and next morning , Patrick the manager told me that I have paid;1
First, I must say that I acually didn't stay at this hotel. I was working in the area, so I walked in and asked about availability at the front desk. As I stood at the desk, I was hit with a very fowl smell. I turned around and notice two very disheveled people walking out. As they were leaving, the front desk woman asked for their vouchers and they told her they will get one later. That's when I found out that the hotel is home to many homeless people who sleep there using vouchers. Now, I'm very happy that homeless people get to stay off the street and out of the cold, but in my opinion, where they stay should be dedicated to them and not shared with others. Even though the room rate was reasonable for the location, I just could not stay there after that smell and knowing what;1
Rude staff, overpriced, old building. When I complained I was promised breakfast - that never happened. Just not worth it. I've had better rooms at Holiday Day Inn Express. And I wish I had gone there instead of here. Thumbs down.;1
While its location near Lincoln Center is ideal, this hotel makes little effort to make the guest experience tolerable. The front desk was apathetic and ignored us at check-in, The room smiled bad and was noisy, and the drinks in the lounge were poor.;1
Do NOT stay here!  Any positive review cannot be legitimate.  I made the mistake of using an awful opaque site (Lastminutetravel) and thought I was getting a three star.  Sure enough this place lived up to its 1-star class as listed here.  So much was wrong I'm not sure where to start.  The room was lime green with florescent lighting that made the place feel like a prison waiting room.  Repairs had been done to the walls and ceiling, yet they had not repainted.  There was NO HEAT!  I asked about it and all they could offer was an extra blanket.  From other reviews below, their lack of heating is a permanent situation.  The cable TV was on the fritz.  Only three channels came thru clearly.  The bathroom had a nasty odor, probably from the mildew.  There was an ironing board, but;1
"We stayed for 3 nights intending to visit Universal Studios and Hollywood.  Our first impression was bad, we arrived half an hour until check in and our room we ""checked in"" in their app wasn't ready... neither was anyone else's judging by the amount of people with suitcases sitting in the lobby.  So we parked, went to get our park tickets, and came back.  Half an hour afterward room still not ready.  We can wait or get another room... we got another room.  Next I was introduced into the seemingly clean room.  It seems  Clean, until are sitting on the toilet seat trying not to watch yourself poop, since they put the vanity mirror across from the toilet.

Abercorn House Hostel London was a horrible experience. No sink in room. Kitchen sink nozzles were overgrown with thick hairy green mold. No chairs, tables, or desks in rooms. The Iraqi front desk staff were profoundly rude from behind their bulletproof glass. Room wasn't ready. Made us wait in hall with luggage for 45 minutes. Windows open to an active construction site. Noise from saws, drills, and garbage dumping runs from 8am-5pm, Saturday included. The courtyard is totally cluttered and trashy with old mattresses, furniture, and assorted rubbish. Internet is not free. Wifi costs Â£1 for every hour of use. Wifi coverage is spotty and slow. Some sites blocked. They charge Â£5 for tokens to use the washer/dryer.

Do not stay here if you expect to get any sleep. Every night, trucks idled loudly directly under my window into the wee hours of the morning. Last night I had to call the front desk to request they ask the truck to leave. And then the jackhammers started at about 5:30 am. The hotel MUST INSTALL BETTER SOUND-PROOF WINDOWS. It was RIDICULOUS.  Also, they artificially lower their rates on TripAdvisor, so don't be fooled. You think you're getting a decent rate only to find out from their website they will be charging you (at the end of your stay) a $20 service fee per day for wifi, coffee, etc. That fee also covers afternoon refreshments. The wifi was spotty and the refreshments consisted of tiny muffins and tea. Hardly worth $20 extra each night. I said something to the clerk about;1
I don't really know where to start! We have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel. From the check in process to upgrading the room the whole stay was a disaster. Virgins photographs and descriptions of the hotel are very misleading. After checking in and paying for an upgrade ($172) we made our way to a room. The lobby is the best area in the hotel. After getting out of the lift you are met with dark, dirty and dated corridors. From that moment I knew there was going to be a problem. The first room was no bigger than the bed itself. The room was absolutely filthy. After speaking to reception and changing rooms we were moved to a slightly bigger one which was a bit cleaner. However it was very dated and the bathroom is in real need of repair as the tap was constantly;1

I could never get something as simple as a cup of hot water (to soothe my daughterâs pink eye) from these people. They didnât caer at all. They insisten there was a coffee machine in the room, which was incorrect, and never sent one despite repeated requests.;1
Iâve stayed her numerous times over the years and it used to be okay but itâs getting tragically worse. EVERYTHING was unclean ! The staff are not accommodating at all and seen to their own conversation before greeting us on arrival. We were late into London and had plans so couldnât find somewhere else to stay and I didnât even feel confident to approach reception about the state of the room because the place hadnât been cleaned in MONTHS by the looks of it. On checkout I showed reception images and said it was a disgrace only to be told I shouldâve mentioned it sooner. I have no doubt that many guests had mentioned something. That was not a days worth of dirt and grime! AVOID. AVOID.;1
"I was experiencing Difficulties with the Maid not making up my Guestroom, and being a Globalist, at Reception, I requested to speak to the General Manager. Instead, one of his Supervisors ""Sebastian"" was sent. You could tell Sebastian was NEW and UNFAMILIAR. I explained that the Maids were NOT cleaning my Guestroom. He apologies and lots of ""Blah Blah"" and would CREDIT my World of Hyatt account with some Points. I explained I was Not looking for points, but for Service. He looked CLUELESS, when I said that !!  More NEEDLESS Blah Blah from Sebastian. Also, when I checked in I requested ""Evening Turn down service"". This NEVER happened on any of the evenings. A maid did visit my Guestroom and clean it after my chat with Sebastian . The NEXT 2 days...NO maid service -or- Turndown";1
This hotel was outdated and dirty and I would never stay there again.  Here are the bad points:  The hotel must not have been updated for 50 years. There was peeling paint and peeling wallpaper everywhere.  The rugs were old, stained, and disgusting.  The bedspreads were stained.  There was exposed wiring in the elevator.  The room had old windows that let cold air through.  There was a through-the-wall air conditioner that wasn't covered, thus it was very drafty.  There was one heat radiator and guest could not control the heat in their own room.  The water that came through the shower head was often brown in color.  There was no internet in guest rooms.  Internet in lobby was very, very slow.  No clock or alarm clock in room.  Beds were very short.  The elevators were slow.;1
I've stayed in many hostels in many different countries and have never been so disappointed. The room was not only bare bones, but there was no box spring on the bed- only two mattresses on top of one another. I wouldn't even complain about this if the mattress was at least comfortable, but instead, you would sink in wherever you laid down! The dirty mattress was covered by a flat sheet that wasn't sized correctly, so it often came undone. (No fitted sheet) This is not the type of mattress you would want to be touching without a sheet to act as a protective barrier.... although you found some comfort in having a sheet between you and the filthy mattress, the sheet provided was also not clean! We found several hairs on the sheets which did not belong to me or my boyfriend! There;1
I went to the NYC with my mom and sister and stayed at the Empire hotel. This was deemed a 4 star hotel..it deserves 1! The lobby and front desk staff were lovely and the location is great but thatâs where the compliments end. The rooms are super small and dark. The lighting was terrible. Our showers were luke warm at best the entire 3 days. The bathroom was only big enough for 1 person to enter at a time. The beds were double not queen. The air conditioner/ heater was an old unit with a dial and though we had the temperature at the lowest setting it was still really hot in the room. The blind in the room on the one window randomly fell so it was all the way down and it was so old it didnât go back up. The furniture is all really old. One of our lamps looked like it would fall;1
I was eaten alive by bedbugs.  I am not talking one or two bites, my whole arm looked like i was diseased.  I was bitten by bedbugs in a grotty motel in Bangkok - this was worse.  The staff at the counter seemed concerned, and for our second night the maintenance man came and gave the room and mattress a spray with some bug killer, and it appeared to help, i only got a few bites the second night. I have heard that bedbugs are everywhere in NYC at the moment, so i was quite understanding, and only asked for one nights refund.  They told me they did not handle refunds, and i had to go through my booking agency (GetaRoom.com) and they would sort it out.  I contacted GetaRoom, and they said i needed a written confirmation from the hotel.   They told me i did not need to do this.  I;1
The Jane seems to prioritize the bar scene, hundreds of people in the lobby, couldn't even get back into our hotel without pushing our way thru. Then, we didn't sleep at all because they were all out in the street below our window until 4 am, then the staff was cleaning up bottles loudly clanking them. Also, no in-room coffee, if you want a cup of coffee in the morning you have to pay $4 for a terrible & weak small cup from the cafe.;1

We arrived January 10th in the morning. Our room was not available which we expected however we were told we would be notified via call or text when the room was ready. That never happened. When we came back to the hotel at 4:30 we were told that we had an upgrade to a higher floor room for an extra 36 dollars. I asked to have a lower floor room and not pay that extra money and front desk said we had to take that room. Once parking ($28) and taxes were added in this increased our room to $325. This is a ridiculous amount of money. For that price we could have stayed in a theme room at the Disney Hotel.  We arrived in our room and there was an issue with the heating/cooling system which made the room smell like burnt substances. We did inform the front desk but no solution;1
"On July 31, 2006, I booked a room at the Morningside Inn in NYC on the internet site www.lodgingNet.us for the weekend of November 3 to 6, 2006 for my participation in the New York City Marathon.

When I arrived at the Morningside Inn on November 3rd at 7:00 pm, I was met by a young woman clerk at the desk who informed me that my reservation had been cancelled by her boss ""Patrick"" and that he had tried to get a hold of me to let me know. I told her that no one had gotten a hold of me at any time and that I wanted my room immediately because I had Broadway theater tickets for 8:00 pm. She said there were no rooms available and that Patrick was gone for the weekend. I asked the clerk to get me a room elsewhere and she called one hotel";1

On the morning of August 12, we left the hotel to the theme park.  My son left his Nintendo DS game on the table in the room.  We realized that it got stolen when we got back to the room.  We filed a report with the security, but it did not seem they could do anything.  My son was upset and cried until we got home.  Our trip was ruined by this hotel.

"Firstly just to point out I've resorted to writing this review as talking to hotel staff gets you nowhere at this hotel.  And also to point out the location is great etc. etc. but hotels are in the service and experience industry and it's the job of hotel staff to ensure that each guest's experience is up to scratch. Sadly on this occasion, our experience to date (yes I'm still at the hotel - only cos I've paid up) has been disappointing.  Similar to other reviews on this site, on check-in we were made to feel like the bad guys for booking a room through a third party website offering a special offer on rooms at a lesser rate. Having booked a standard queen, at check-in we were told this was a single room and ""was the smallest room in the hotel"" and would we like an upgrade for";1
One of the worst things about this hotel besides the inadequate rooms, terrible bathrooms and depressing decor is the rude staff at the reception desk. Whenever you need to engage with them for anything they act as if youâre a bother. I asked about why our wifi said that we were only getting 200 mb of internet per day after paying an exorbitant $45 resort fees which states fast internet on their site. The person at reception said he didnât know, so he went to ask his manager and he didnât know either. So he gave me the number of the internet provider they use and said I could call them and ask if I want to! Unbelievable.  My sonâs suitcase was lost in LA but was found and was arriving in NY the next day. When I went to ask if it had arrived the disinterested reception worker;1
First, I only booked this because of the value, the pictures are nothing like the twin room I booked.  The room was ok, the bed was the worst mattress I have ever slept on.  This hotel should be an SRO not hotel.  The tv antenna, yes antenna not cable did not work.  There is no elevator, not a big deal, however there is not a sole at front desk early morning, I don't know about late night.  I asked for a late check out and was told it would cost additional $50, really?  The room was $160...Please do yourself a favor and spend $40 more dollars at another hotel.  This really wants to be a hostel but lacks the charm and idea of that and over charges for less than comfortable accommodations.;1

I emailed the Wyndham New Yorker hotel after receiving my bank statement showing that an unauthorised charge of USD 176.97 was made following my stay from 17-19 November 2019.  However, when I made this booking, I paid all the charges and hotel tax in advance. I also confirmed that no further charges would be made at check-in and when checking out, and the member of staff on duty assured me that no additional charges or resort fees would be made in connection with this booking.   Please could you reply to me regarding the money you have taken from my account in accordance with New York's Unfair Trade Practices Law. This includes a non-sterling transaction fee of Â£3.77, and brings the total unauthorised amount you have taken to Â£140.95.;1
This has to be one of the worst hotel experiences ever. Just simply do not consider staying here. It's cheap yes. So is a dog kennel which would be better.

We stayed at this hotel as part of a package holiday that took us to Niagara, to New York by train then cruise home to the UK.  The room was dire. It was very small, smelt horrible, was damp and had a noisy air conditioner that didn't work properly. The bath had a crack in it. The bathroom door wouldn't shut. The bed was uncomfortable.There was no where to eat. There were no tea or coffee making facilities or any way of getting food or drink. On the last night the carbon monoxide monitor started bleeping so they removed it pointing out the smoke alarm as a 'back up'. Not quite sure how that works!!  Anything good to say about it?  It was cheap. It is close to Central Park, although I should point out it was a couple of miles from down town Manhattan, where most of the main;1
"There is apparently a dance club at the Jane, and the bass from the club is loud enough in some of the rooms (we were on the 2nd floor) to make sleeping effectively impossible.   Since this is New York, bars and clubs are open until 4am.   When I called the front desk at 1am, their response was ""whoops, yeah, nobody told you? Let me see if there is another room [3 seconds of fake typing] no, sorry, yes, the bar closes at 4, have a good night.""  In short, if you like funky decor (and powerful showers) and have no desire to actually sleep at your hotel, then maybe the Jane is right for you. Anyone who actually needs to get some sleep should stay far far away.";1
My wife and I arrived on Saturday night for 3 nights US$259 + taxes per night. We were given room 211. It had to be the worst room I have experenced in 50 years of travelling around the world. The TINY room was dirty, the capet fifthly, the electric plug scoket was hanging out of the wall exposing the cables, the bathroom hand basin was broken, the bathroom tiles were broken, the very small bath tub was badly chipped. The small window looked out at a concrete wall. My wife was so upset she sat down on the bed and cried - there were no chairs to sit on - not enough room! I went to reception to complain. The receptionist told me we would have to stay in this room until the next day - and perhaps they might be able to move us to another room. I asked to see the manager - she told;1

I have been stayed in this hotel for nine days. It was LITERALLY the worst hotel experience that I  have ever had. The housekeeper doesnât clean our room. To give examples, the trash was the same when we check in the hotel and check out the hotel and again the housekeeper doesnât close the beds.

"I am a covid-displaced New Yorker, so the idiosyncrasies and difficulties of nyc do not cloud my judgement; I come in understanding New York is dirty, loud, and full of people (including myself) who are such concentrated versions of themselves, they'd be considered freaks anywhere else.

Between the cockroaches and the disgusting smell coming from the shower curtain, the ultra dirty carpet and long hairs I found all over the comforter I thought I was on some hidden camera joke - This place is the worst I have ever stayed in 25 years of business travel.

I checked in and left within an hour.  I thought there was something odd about the other people checking - one lady next to me was paying for her room with cash and apologizing for being late with her payment.  The hallway smelt as if people were cooking dinner in their rooms.  My room had no bed spread, exposed radiator, large stains on the floor and burn holes.  The floor in the shower was absolutely discussing.  I could have asked for another room but I was pretty sure the rest of the rooms would look the same.  Now that I see other reviewers had similar experiences, my gut feeling about other rooms being better seemed to be validated.  I dont know if this hotel is housing homeless people as another reviewer suggested, but I would like to have been warned that I was spending;1
WORST. NIGHT. EVER. Came back from a lovely dinner in Chelsea to this West Village Hotel and as I was getting into bed spotted a fat, blood-filled bedbug under the pillow. Smushed it and recoiled in horror. Thence began the five-hour saga in which hotel staff basically stripped me, asked me to take a shower, put me in another room, and took all my belongings for some alleged anti-bedbug treatment variously described as steam cleaning, heating to 100, heating to 120, heating to 140, and using a Pack-Rite device. No idea which if any of these explanations was correct, because when I got my stuff back at 5 am, nothing appeared to have been done to my belongings, certainly not any heating to 120 or 140 or else my cosmetics would have melted. TERRIBLE service and explanations;1
"for two people in their late sixties, this was a nightmare. rom was tiny, dirty and the people ""looking after it"" a joke. What was hanging around the entrance, (i could never call it a foyer,) were of dubios looking character .There was barely enough room on either side of the bed to move.It had not been cleaned in god knows how long.we did not stay there.how someone can say that for a vacation it is well situated is beyond me. never again";1
Imagine now, renting any place for $200 per night, and finding out that you have to climb 5 flights of stairs in the dark, with a heavy suitcase, to enter an apartment that also has no working lights -except in the bathroom, it's 11pm, you're exhausted from travel, and want to take a shower, but there are no towels, no soap, no toilet tissue, the bedroom smells, the pillows smell, the mattress feels like it's stuffed with sawdust, and the terrace advertised is laden with garbage and no furniture... then you can imagine what a stay with Woogo turned out to be for us, and could easily be for you.. Our advice, spend $100 more and sleep somewhere in a clean, safe, functioning and organized - hotel.;1
After having recieved the confirmation email which repeatedly stated that I had paid in full I arrived at the hotel to discover in the small print of the email was a hidden additional cost of over $30 per night. This fee covered the costs of what the initial booking had detailed as being included items for example the WiFi.   Thanks for the great welcome to NYC;1

I had to go to NYC on business during what was one of the coldest days in NYC in January. I needed a hotel that would be conveniently located to the javitz center, so I chose the Empire Hotel.   I had booked through Expedia.com because they give you a cheaper rate, even though the hotel was barely booked due to the subzero temperatures. A month later, I noticed on my credit card statement, I was double billed- once by expedia, and once by the hotel.   After expressing the problem to the manager, they were unable to credit me for the full amount in which I was double charged for. Absolutely ridiculous! I'm still going back and forth, trying to get just a simple phone call and a simple credit for a clear over-charge on my credit card statement!  BE AWARE... THIS HOTEL WILL TRY TO;1

The Empire Hotel is the worst  hotel in New York , with no customer service. The cleaning staff are dishonest and the employers didn't go to any length to help us. It may be a great location for shows at the Licoln centre however it's not an enjoyable place to stay with staff being so dishonest .;1
I have traveled to NYC for business and pleasure for over 40 years. This was the worst hotel experience. My wife and I needed to ask for a room change immediately because the room was VERY HOT and we could not adjust the temperature. Relocated to room 217. Room was very dark. One night stand did not have a lamp. The heater in this room was extremely hard to adjust....it was either too hot or too cold. I burnt my finger while attempting to adjust the temp!  In order to sleep we turned off the heat and slept in a cold room which for us was better that sleeping in a very hot room. The window shades were nearly impossible to put up or down. Paint was peeling on the inside of the bathroom door. The remote for the TV was not fully operable (I suspect weak battery). We found a serious;1
Paid 600$ for 5 nights here. On arrival got charged a further 550$ in taxes security deposit and compulsory service charges for electric water and internet.. Reception doesnt look bad. Staff smile as you get ripped off.  Lifts antiquated corridors dirty and scruffy looking and rooms so small like tiny boxes crammed in together. No kettle so cant make a drink. Bathroom like something out of the 1920s old fashioned and out dated. No breakfast allowed so have to go out all the time to eat. Wouldn't reccomend this dump to anybody. There are a lot of better hotels than this place;1

Outrageously overpriced. Construction noise. Elevators not working. Restaurant buffet was disgusting. Unwrapped glasses to have a drink and they were filthy. Shuttle bus showed up 25 minutes late so we lost our early morning entrance to Universal Studios.;1
This hotel was a bad experience.  We were given a room on the 2nd floor, facing Broadway, and it was very  noisy.  The room was also cold and the heater didn't work.  We moved to a different room and then the bed was terrible!  I would not stay here again, even tho the location was what we needed for this trip.;1

At the start of the trip things seemed fine.  We checked in an hour or two early, and the front desk person told us that she could put us in a room in a slightly higher floor that was a little larger than the one we reserved, for no charge.  We thought - why not!  When we woke up the last morning of our stay, we saw that the bill in fact did have a higher per-night charge than the one I had booked the room under.  It took about 30 mins downstairs with the front desk person to get the charge reversed, as he needed to get his manager.  Unfortunately that was not where the story ends.  Upon receiving my credit card statement, I saw that in addition to the charge for the hotel room, there was an additional ~$90 charge (on the day of our check-out on March 4th).  Since I or my finace;1
This has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are so rude and people smoking weed in the hotel, the smell was awful. When I complained they said they couldnt do anything about it, they could call the police but they might not come. There was others complaining about the smell of smoke also. They didnt care. Rooms look nothing like the pics they have. We were booked to stay for 6 nights, but checked out after 3 nights, Stay elsewhere;1
We spent four nights in this hotel and the only good comment is.......the bed was comfortable! Hotel is needing a total renovation.  Our view of Central Park from our second floor window was scaffolding and no work being done.  Room furniture was falling apart and carpet was threadbare.;1
DO NOT STAY HERE. Absolutely awful!!! All the bad reviews already posted are spot on. Manager was extremely rude, inconsiderate and unaccommodating to all our concerns. Baby crib was dirty and held together with packing tape. Scary black mold in the bathroom. Squeaky doors. Room was super cold and only had a tiny space heater that took hours to get the room to an acceptable body temperature. Room has no closet and no draws, we had to keep our clothes and items in the suitcases. Disgustingly dirty poolside chair cushions and pool area swarmed with mosquitoes making it literally impossible to lounge poolside. Not eco friendly, all cups in the room were paper and plastic. That's just the start of it. This hotel needs a major renovation and customer hospitality attitude adjustment.;1
Rooms and bathroom so small you could not turn around. Kept injuring legs on foot of beds.Font stay on high floors in summer. Old AC system can't cool the room. Primitive AC system. Hot as Hell.Doormen were A plus;1
"We stayed at empire hotel for 5 days for the first stage of our honeymoon, during Christmas Holidays. The hotel is in a good position to visit NYC but that's the only advantage as we weren't satisfied at all with the room and the service.  The concierge at the check-in confirmed our room was prepaid by our travel agent, BUT debited instead the 150$deposit the WHOLE AMOUNT of the room on our credit card ""by mistake"" and justified himself with an error in their system: a couple of tickets for free drinks and breakfast was their only form of excuse, and we had to arrange for solution of the problem on our own. You can immagine the inconvenience caused. I know humans do make mistakes but these inconvents just should not happen, and should definitely be treated in a different way.";1

The hotel is in terrible conditions: - Dirty Room - Terrible Bathroom - Poor bathroom features - Broken door lock - Black tape in the windows - Old TV from the 90's - Very slow internet connection - No kitchen or any food services - Ok Service The Hotel pictures are 100% not true. Is very expensive compared to quality. The Hotel should be 1 star and it should cost 50 dollars.;1
"This hotel is being used for housing people who appear to be the equivilant of DHSS boarders. The hotel is very shabby & the staff are very sullen. The whole experience could easily put the average traveller off of returning to this wondeful city. The whole experience was one of feeling that we had been ripped off for a considerable sum of money to stya in a doss house. There wewre kids running in the hallways & doing thjeir homework. The noise was constant day & night fromm the ""fellow guests"". The only saving grace (which is purley coincidental) is the proximity to the subway station. DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE IN ANY WAY EXPECTING ANYTHING BETTER THAN A 1 STAR HOTEL.";1
We booked this hotel thinking it was the best value in LA because it had a pool, included breakfast & cheapish parking. It also looked in relatively good decorative order from photos.  In reality it wasnât very nice! Our room, and therefore all our belongings became infested with ants from their drains (pics attached). Most of the facilities are okay but the rooms are in horrible decorative order and didnât feel very clean. This therefore made me not want to use the pool. If you get an outside room rather than a courtyard itâs also incredibly noisy! The hotel kept turning our electricity off so our phones wouldnât charge over night. I rang 4 times to ask them to stop turning it off until they admitted they were via their computer systems, very strange!;1
"We were trying to save money by booking a more pocket-friendly hotel that was also near the subway and various dining options. The location was great, but for the amount we paid, the accommodations were terrible. We were not expecting a 4-star hotel, but for over $400, we were expecting a bit more from the Days Inn. When we arrived, we were told that we had been ""upgraded"" to a queen bed suite; however, the bed was almost the size of a dorm room bed. When we asked for another blanket (because there was only a sheet), we had to wait for three (3) hours with repeated requests. The bathroom was clean, however, you could not get to the sink without turning sideways. Wi-Fi did not work at all despite it being free, and the cable was out during our entire stay.

So I originally booked via expedia which the hotel staff utilized as an excuse to not provide any assistance or modifications to any of the arrangements.    While staying here the hotel had a power outage in part of the building and claimed that the utility was at fault as opposed to fessing up and getting the electrical service repaired.    Initially they claimed they would credit for my and my colleagues stay due to the inconvenience yet then later did not honor that as another desk clerk was there.  Location is sketchy, significantly charge too much for parking and also the restaurant and bar were not open as told.;1
One of the worst hotels I have stood at, the room looked nothing like the pictures, bed skirt was all teared up and sheet was stained. The TV was Older then I am, I was hoping to take a nice warm shower but had to wait about 15 minutes before the water got warm. The room smelled bad.. :( I really wished I would of spend the extra $30 or $40 a night to stay somewhere else. Too bad they wouldnât let me cancel and get my money back so had to stay 1 night but defiantly did cancel the second. I have stood in many hotels and this one was by far the worst. Serious RENOVATION needed people!! And to top it all of parking was horrible $44 a night!! ðð¼;1

The location is great close to Lincoln center.  Front desk man luggage person and doorman were friendly.       However the AC is too noisy feels like inside subway stations. Claimed to change the room and the front desk said they will prepare a new room till Iâm back. I got back but found NO new room was prepared.  Seems like the relocation request has not been relayed.  The ladies in the front said they will manage for relocation in the next day because âitâs too late for the day to get another room.â   Iâm wearing ear plugs but their not working for this level of sound. Iâm really tired after long flight but the AC keep me awake. I feel like getting a headache.  I saw similar comments in some booking sites about the noise and other comments.

We expected a lot from this hotel given how it sells itself online, but we're really disappointed.   The let down started on arrival when we were greeted at the front desk by a lady who was rude and quite frankly, didn't want to be there.   She put us on the first floor which I asked to be moved due to the noise (this was mentioned in the booking) so she put us next to an elevator on the 9th floor..... she was clearly having a good day.  The rooms are way too small, even for a New York hotel.   The hotel clearly needs new air conditioners. We had friends staying in another room and both of us had issues. Ours continued to switch itself off and then not turn back on. We called the front desk atleast for times over two days and unfortunately it took me going down personally for;1
Well it started with more than a 30 minute wait for check in.  Then I had to go back because front desk did not provide any information about location of fitness center or breakfast etc.  The next day there was no hot water in the shower.  Fifteen minutes of calling the front desk and no one answered.  I had to go down in gym clothes to talk to them and they told me an engineer would look at the problem sometime in the day.  So after having a cold shower I went on with my day and came back to find the keys demagnetized.  Front desk fixes and then tells me they donât have a credit card on file for me.  After I show them that theyâve already taken a $150 deposit on check in, they insist on taking another imprint of the card.    This is the last time I will stay here.  The only;1
Was very excited to be traveling with our crew for our show to the Los Angeles area.

Our office/production manager back in NY tried to speak with Devon through my cell phone (1AM NY time) but Devon said it was against company policy to talk on a customers cell. She then called him direct. He said there was nothing he could do. The manager was out.   I offered to put down;1

This hotel is basically one big scam, the photos you see online are nothing like the actual rooms, they cost a fortune but the rooms are so disgusting that even bed bugs stay away... Front desk is a window with a rude girl who was too busy on her phone to serve us, the showers and restrooms if you can actually define them that, are shared and absolutely disgusting.

This hotel is very basic if that. The bed was all springs so very hard to sleep but is was quiet.

The location was good and right next to the bus to LaGuardia and the subway. I won't go back.;1

Absolute mess. First thoughts were great as you get to a newly renovated lobby thinking excellent for the price. After that everything else was dirty and horrible and the whole place constantly stunk. Walk into the tiny lift that stunk of cannabis with little all inside. Then you walk down the hallway with the mouldy walls and wallpaper peeling, again stinking. As we got into the room the radiator was leaking and making a screeching noise. There was mould on both the floor and ceiling, telly was antique and had no remote. The sink was out of place and could see all the moulding sealant round the bottom. The door frame wasn't even on properly on the cupboard.  The place is an absolute mess if they spent the money they have on the lobby on the rest of the place the hotel wouldn't;1

We stayed here for a long weekend in December of 2004.  Upon our arrival we were greeted with a wonderful aroma of curry mixed with cigarette smoke which lingered through the entire building.  I was not impressed with the lobby area which scared me as typically what lies beyond that area isn't usually any more impressive.  We checked in (which was somewhat of a challenge since they had no record of our reservation which was confirmed twice prior to arrival) and entered the refrigerator sized elevator.  Once we got to our floor, we tried to make our way through the labyrinth of narrow hallways and misleading signs that led us in circles on the way to our room.  Our room was cramped to say the least, and looking out our window we were delighted to find an old sock sitting on our;1
This hotel has major cleanliness issues.  The location is good, close to transportation and restaurants, but bring your drain cleaner and some insect spray.  There are cigarette butts in the hallway (even though it's no smoking) the bathtub doesn't drain, and yes, insect and signs of rodents in the rooms.  Both window shades were broken, and the elevator didn't work.  Beware.;1
Despite its stellar location across from Lincoln Center and genial, though unresponsive, staff, this hotel is a total ânoâ!  Poor, if any AC, TVs âall around hotel donât workâ (according to front desk), dark wallpaper in halls and rooms â all decor is stale by 50 years, halls are not much more than 3â wide.

Do not stay here! I paid $500 for 3 nights, and it was ridiculous. Even if you are on a budget, Iâm sure you can find a much better hotel elsewhere.   My room was not ready when I arrived at the hotel, because the cleaning staff was taking their sweet time. When the front desk tried calling them, they would not respond. They kept telling me that it would be ready soon, but I ended up waiting for an hour before I got my room. The front desk staff as also very rude and gave me attitude when I asked why my room wasnât ready.   The hallways and elevators are not ventilated, and have a smoky, pungent smell. The rooms are not that much better. The walls are paper thin, so you can very easily hear everyoneâs detailed conversations. I had to call the front desk a few times on my first;1

Disgusting service at the worst hotel ever had the misfortune of staying in !

I recently had experience with the yourstay company in London.  The building was still under construction, including taped up carpets in the hallways, debris in the stairwells, and an elevator which had insulation covered by a cloth curtain:  no walls.  Several of the promised amenities were absent including a telephone. Neither was there a telephone in the lobby. We were two woman travelling alone on business. We needed a telephone for many reasons, including safety.  We were assigned a seventh floor apartment. The building was in a very isolated area, surrounded by office buildings, which were empty on the weekends and at night. Some were still under construction.  In order to get to the tube station we would have had to walk through a long, deserted unlighted alley.  Our;1
There was a mouse in our hotel room. We were sitting on the bed when we saw a mouse run across one side of the small room, to the other inside the AC unit. We immediately freaked out and notified staff. The engineer opened up the AC unit and found a hole. The mouse or even mice use the hole to enter that room for who knows how long! We were mover to a different room however I could not sleep. I was so uncomfortable. This incident happened on the 3rd night of our 5 night stay. Knowing that mouse was in and out of that room makes me sick. We paid over $1300 for 5 nights, and for this to happen? The rooms are old and dated to top it off. Itâs a small hotel with a small budget clearly.   I spoke/emailed management to ask about compensation and Iâve heard nothing back even though a;1

Firstly I am giving 1 star as I cannot give zero! We stayed here as nothing else in an ok location was available. We stayed here in 2009 and the decor has not been refurbished so the hotel now looks even more tired than 13 years ago! I do not know how this is rated as a 4 star hotel? I have stayed in 3 star hotels in NYC far better than this hotel and the fact we stay in 5 star hotels around the world including the USA (Las Vegas) this hotel is a million miles behind them! I do not trust the 5 stars reviews on this hotel as genuine either that or the people leaving them have never stayed in any hotel before! You will also notice the hotel only comments on the good reviews! Right from the start this hotel experience was awful! Starting with the rude check in staff who tutted at;1
Whilst here on a work holiday we have been staying in a number of hotels and this is by far the worst.   We couldn't check in until 16.30 and then the staff were very rude.

I'm even dreading staying here one;1
This hotel needs to retrain their staff to be nicer to customers, most of the front desk and in room dining staff where rude to us and just plain nasty.  We also had hair in tubs and on pillow cases, we also had to wait 24 min to check in. For $300+ a night I think there are much better options. Only thing this hotel has going is it's proximity to universal. Nothing else to offer  We are also diamond members and they said room is upgraded but upon confirming with other guests it's the standard room.;1

The room was not very clean and kind of run down. We were on the 10th floor. We couldnât get our room to cool off and it was 30 degrees out. We kept the windows open while attempting to sleep and it only went from 77 to 76 degrees. They did nothing to fix it nor did they get us into a similar sized room. The door men were all awesome though! We ended up at the Lombardy and it was amazing!;1

This place takes overpriced mediocrity to a whole new level.  The food at the restaurant was expensive and lousy.  The parking was ridiculously expensive, did not prorate by hours, and the staff would not validate for the lower rate that is clearly posted on the parking garage.

I do not recommend this hotel at all. Actually the only thing which was ok about that hotel was the location (near to the metro station) but still it was not really Hollywood-like there... I couldn't stand the breakfast - every day the same artificial food :/  The rooms could have been cleaner ... The people working there were really unfriendly and everything seemed to be a problem for them (well and I thought there are no problems in Hollywood - in fact, there are...)   All those problems made my opinion about this place. I will never go back there.;1

I was at this hostel for one night and I decided to move out the day after. The stink was everywhere and terrible.  The bathroom (which is shared) was right by my room so that I could hear the footsteps of the people all night long without sleeping.  As I opened the window plenty of flies flew in my room, and there was also a deep hole by the radiator. Finally, the curtain was partially broken so that I had to call the reception to fix it. At least the bed-sheets were clean.;1

We stayed in the third floor, no lift. Room was small and we didnt have our own toilet or shower. The second day we were there I was terribly sick and had to stay in bed all day and the cleaning lady just stormed in our room without even knocking and said ""I need to change sheets - I need to change sheets""- my boyfriend had to raise his voice to get her to leave. After that the cleaning staff didnt come to our room until the very last evening and we stayed there for five nights.";1
This could be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  The good news was the room was clean.  Now the rest.  I came in late with my son. There were no rooms with twin beds. We got a room with a queen bed.  It was unclear which was harder, the floor or the mattress.  The room was small and the bathroom even smaller.  There was no cover for the toilet. It was so noisy from traffic outside, you could not sleep. The blanket was like tissue paper. The wifi made dial-up seem fast. The sprinkler in the ceiling was leaking. There is no elevator so we carried  our bags up four flights. We checked out the next morning to go to a different hotel for our second evening. No refund.;1

What a complete waste of space this hotel is. Unless, of course, you were looking for a cheap and nasty little hole with no character, no services, located on the dark side of the moon and you were happy to pay $10 a night for the pleasure.  We were booked for 4 nights in New York staying at the Astor.  We booked in about 1400ish on the day we arrived, went up to the room and immediately groaned.  The room was small, stuffy and impractical.  Smoking in the place means that non-smoking rooms are far from clean or in fact, non-smoking.  A filthy and unpleasant experience.  Hanging space for clothes was limited, no drawers, so the case had to do.  OK, maybe not a big deal, but certainly not at all comfortable or convenient.

Iâve had issues with this Hotel multiple times on business trips. Iâd never in my life recommend to anyone. Thereâs no shower door in any room, which is an odd design because the floor easily gets wet leaving the room smelling like mildew. However this is the least of my complaints. I was charged for a mini bar that I didnât use AT ALL! Plus I was charged for all 7 days of stay on my card that they asked to put on hold for damages etc now itâs been nearly 3 weeks and accounting hasnât called back and Iâve called about 7 times.;1

I would give this 0 stars if I could. We walked into the room and there was a leak coming from the ceiling, dripping onto the floor - as a result, the rug was wet.

I have to admit the location is brilliant 10mins from times square and 20 mins from central park.  Short 1hour walk will take you downtown.

When I arrived here at 4am I was told due to a computer audit I couldnât be checked in for a further half an hour.  I very calmly explained Iâve had a long journey and have been travelling for 22 hours but she said that didnât matter and I had to wait for the computer audit   I asked to speak to the manager but was told she was the manager.   I was offered a voucher to get some snacks however the 2 females behind the counter asked me;1
"We arrived on a Saturday night around 11pm to find a group of people hovering around the reception desk. We were told that there were no rooms available as they had been flooded the night before, despite us having a booking. We were not informed - nobody had reached out to us or any other guest to tell them that the accommodation was uninhabitable before we arrived there. The only representative at the front desk was in his own words ""overwhelmed"" - he got very short with the understandably frustrated group of guests now having nowhere to stay for their holiday, coming up with ridiculous solutions (like moving into a hotel he knew about 45 blocks further north out of the city with a shared bathroom...). Nobody else was there to speak to. We never received an apology. We had to";1
"Being a loyal Hilton HHonors member I'm sorry that I ever stay in this Hotel, customer service is terrible, we're not demanding customers, just a clean room and medicre service will be ok with us. 3rd time that we stay here and all 3 times had horrible customer service ""Richard"" at the front was helping a couple before us and the couple left very frustated, upon my turn he stated that this Hotel was not for ""those type of peole"" when I asked him what he meant by that he said ""you know, dark color people don't tips us very well"" I ask him (Richard) to apologize to this couple instanly. he stated that ""if you don't like it your welcome to go also"". Rooms are old and blood on bed covers. 289/night plus 16 to park + hate towards minorities. The Sheraton is much better choice, I will";1
I will never stay here again! From a staff who doesnât answer the phones and was mostly rude, to broken pipes in the sink, broken lampshades, and not getting room service when I was gone all day. Having to switch rooms 3 times for YOUR MISTAKES and then being charged twice on the deposit. AWFUL! build in some decency to your policies.;1
It's always nice to show up at a major hotel and be treated very well. They have to deal with so many people every day that it would be very easy to be off your game and be tired of someone's bad attitude, but this Hyatt is always a Great experience. I know I'm crazy, but I love walking to and from the airport so I get some exercise before and after a long conference.;1
horrible service.  slow waitress.  The door/bell men were useless.  They would rather talk to each other or ogle girls than help you with the door or your things.  The walls are thin and the doors are heavy metal.  So whenever anyone needs to close the door, they slam, and you're kept up all night hearing the noise.    Come if you want to get trashed at the bar and take selfies to prove you're a gossip girl.  Don't expect much rest at all.;1
Smelly. Filthy. Carpet filthy And worn down. Bathroom door didnt close. Wires tapped to the wall. Noisy useless air con. Old. Run down And badly maintained. This place should be closed down. Avoid or go And be very disappointed. The pictures they show are not what you will get. The Wi-Fi is very weak And frustrating. The TV does not have cable. Like they say it has. Very BAD experience.;1

Horrifically bad experience.   I booked online with a âpromo rateâ that was nominally below list and in return was given an in renovated room without a working toilet, broken A/C, none of the promised amenities that were requested (foam pillows, etc)  Further, I was placed in an area of the hotel that was under construction - meaning, every morning I was awakened by what sounded like a jackhammer next door.   Also, there is no breakfast, comedy club, bar, or anything else touted online. This is a bare bones, 2 star hotel in a sketchy neighborhood, trapping unwitting travelers with doctored photos of the property online;1
I stayed here for a few days while i went sight seeing in NYC, the hotel is a miserable dump, OK its cheap, all i can advise is spend more and go elsewhere!  Its not clean, its shabby and still has that 1930's feel about, AVOID,AVOID AVOID is that clear.  The rooms are tiny and grubby, the only saving grace is that it forced me to spend loads more time in NYC sight seeing :);1

This was my first trip to New York, and boy has it stuck in my mind and all for the wrong reasons. I have never come across such an arrogant and rude man as Patrick the owner. The room was shabby for what we paid, then we found out that our room wasn't booked out to us even though I had corresponded with him on several occasions stating the exact dates we would be staying, he then went on to say the amount he had quoted was actually for one night and not three nights even though I had repeated the dates in EVERY SINGLE EMAIL I had sent him, I even asked for the full total of the stay as prices differed from one website to another, he quoted me the price for the three nights I had given him. He refused to look at the email correspondence between us, said point blank he wasn't;1

the poor standard of this hotel.   Staff here especially that at front desk were rude , unhelpful and very unprofessional. In the week we stayed here the only friendly person at front desk was Wendy.   Our first room was lovely and clean that was until the room next door had a blocked toilet and maintenance flushed the blockage through to our bathroom creating in a huge flood of excrement and water through the shower, toilet all over the bathroom and half the room and into the corridor.   It took front desk 20 mins to get maintenance to come to our room and a further hour to get us moved from the room which they initially just wanted to keep us in and clean the floor.   I was told we were lucky they had another room for us. When we went to the next room the room was filthy.;1
"I was extremely disappoined with the quality of this hotel.  I don't stay in hotels very often and for my price-range I have reasonably low expectations I think.  I have definitely stayed in cheaper hotels that were nicer, however.  A quick list of my biggest gripes: - had to duck to get under the showerhead - I'm 5'5""; showerhead was slightly calcified, moldy - shower curtain rod was falling out of the wall - twice (of five nights) the bathroom was slightly dirtier after cleaning than it was before - one (1) elevator to access floors 2, 3, and basement (where breakfast was) - and there were no stairs (except emergency stairs), had multiple discussions with other hotel guests about the slowness and disappointment of this one elevator to access our rooms - shared courtyard";1
"This was by far the worst experience I have had at a hotel. I get there and there is no one at the door.

I finally get in the damn door and there's to doormen/busboys just standing there. One of them says to me, ""Do you need help"". Hello, isn't that your job. Of course I need help!!!! So I get, or try to get to the front desk, 20 minutes to check in. Finally get to the disgusting room, my suitcase barely fits in the door. The room was dirty, falling apart and really tiny. I stay in NYC all the time. This room was NOT 4 star quality. The wallpaper was peeling, the light was peeling, the thermostat control panel was hanging";1

I stayed for one night at this hotel last minute for work at a cost of $350. The only positive thing I can say is its location near Lincoln center. I arrived at around 10 pm and was give probably the worst room in the hotel, smaller than my closet on the lowest floor. The elevator on this floor had no button- not one that didnt work- but actually no button so I had to take the stairs to the lobby with my luggage. The floor I was on was moldy and old- as was the room. The water was luke warm in the shower with too much water pressure (the opposite is usually true). The worst part was the front desk staff- snooty with a could not care less attitude. The woman that checked me out didnt even look at me when I tried to settle my bill and would not give me a bill since she said I;1
We were very disappointed with our room.  It was not clean with moldy brown spots in the bathroom and dirty marks on the walls.  The room generally looked pretty shabby and the hallways were dark and dated.  We were treated rudely at check-in.  The neighborhood is dirty and noisy.  The only advantage this hotel has is that it is convenient to the train station and subway.  Look for somewhere nicer in NY to stay!;1
This hotel has bed bugs. In NYC, with friends, we had two rooms on two different floors (4&5). Bed bugs were found in both rooms. The bugs were in the adult stage, so I can only imagine how long Windsor has been infested. The location was great - Not worth sleeping with bed bugs. Do not stay here.;1
I had a recent multi-night stay here at the Empire, my first stay at this property.  A frequent mid-town Manhattan visitor, I often stay in a variety of properties, wherever my company places me.  For the first night, I was placed in a smoking room, despite my request online for a non-smoking room.  (Note: 4th floor is smoking floor.) I was told the hotel was sold out and I couldn't be moved until the next day.  I left my bags packed and they reassigned me to another room the next day.    Once I returned to my new room late the second evening, I discovered that the heater/AC was defective and would bang and clank whenever it was operating.  I reported it to the front desk, but since it was after 11pm, I opted for them to send maintenance the next day and I unplugged the unit;1

AWFUL experience. The beds are extremely small and uncomfortable. The room is so gross. Lampshade has a stain all over it. My sheets had a stain. The wood in the bathroom was molded and chipping. By far worst experience.;1
Worst internet service I have had in 10 years. Staff refused to do anything about no wireless internet connection on several whole floors. Wireless connection worked only sometimes and slowly in lobby. Two of 4 elevators out of service for a year and a half, according to long-term residents -- so waiting for one takes forever on weekends. Plumbing issues with sinks and tubs incredibly slow to drain and a toilet that took 20 minutes to stop running very loudly.Limited cable service with very few TV channels to choose from.;1
Upon checkin at 4:00 PM, room not available. Told to wait for a digital message. No message after one hour. Finally confronted desk clerk and room still not available. After much debate finally found a different room. No offer of compensation for inconvenience. Steer clear of this hotel.;1
Hotel rooms need to be renovated badly. Cheap deteriorating structure and decor. There were 2 inches between wall and sink so I had to lean across the toilet to see into the mirror to brush my teeth. There was no hot water, it was ice cold water, that last morning I was there and they refused to comp one night.  Hence why I wrote this review.  Bad Choice, empire hotel.;1
Having never been to New York before we booked a package deal of flights and accommodation, Astor on the park was choice of Hotel with great location and affordable price. Having read reviews before booking we decided based on the handful of good reviews that it was worth a shot. Upon arrival at the Hotel we were greeted by an uninterested receptionist no hello just âyou want to check in?â After asking for a credit card as deposit she then demanded $100 also her reasoning in case we take something from the room. Reluctantly now checking into our double room supposed to be twin room after being advised due to overbooking will move you tomorrow. Being exhausted from 9 hours of travel we decided to deal with it the following day. Having crammed into the tiniest double room in;1

I booked this hotel on Expedia because the photos looked ok and it had a good price relative to the other hotels I was finding ($165/ night). I'm now wishing I had sprung for something nicer.

I am seriously considering just leaving and getting another hotel even though I will lose my money on this one.;1

This was a nightmare of a stay. The ac was so loud that it could not be run while attempting to sleep. The outside building HVAC was even louder, so opening a window was not an option. There were bed bugs (or something in the room that bit me) and the tv remote never worked (went through two). There is no space in the bathroom, so you have to put your products in the sink while getting ready.. staff was friendly, and the shower was nice;1
The only good thing about this hotel was that the room was clean. The a/c didn't work, lack of electrical outlets, no full length mirror, make up mirror only adequate for 6' tall women,lack of lighting, bed hard as rock, closet had shelf which didn't allow for hanging suiter.;1
Staff weren't welcoming. Room confusion and offered no apology simply recharged for the room again without explanation.  Wifi didn't work. Ordered a shuttle to the Airport and it never came. Were left standing outside freezing until they finally ordered taxi's (after being asked numerous times). Powerpoints didn't work. Hot water wasn't constant. Towels were stained.  We had 5 rooms in the hotel, all on different floors.   With all the options that NY has to offer, find somewhere else.;1

I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. The front desk attendees were sarcastic and rude every time I had contact with them during my 2 day stay, in person and over the phone. I was double-charged for my stay and not one person was willing to rectify the situation, I was pushed around from person to person and it was up to me to try and have the problem resolved. It's been days and I still haven't been reimbursed. During check-in, the attendant did not mention any instructions on how to take advantage of the extra amenities paid for when I made my reservation. Overall quality, service, location, and value were terrible and I won't be staying here again. There are many other great hotels in LA, don't make the mistake of choosing this one.;1
I booked a 15 night,  prepaid stay with them via Hotels.com a few months ago for this coming October.  Since then, I ended up renting an apt in NYC for 2 yrs... and no longer need the hotel in October.... Yet they are refusing to let me cancel and refund me the money... despite October being a high demand month for NYC hotels... and it being super close to the New Yorker Festival....  To keep my $5600 is outrageous when they can easily free up the room for another to purchase.   Most NYC hotels I've used have been cooperative and flexible.  I handed found this hotel's management to be inflexible and at arms length.... not what one wants in hotel service.;1
We had traveled 8 hrs from Peru after a 10+hr lay-over at the Lima Peru airport.  All we wanted was to get to our hotel.  We called the hotel from the airport asking where and how do we get a shuttle.  They said go out to the median and the bus comes be every 15 minutes.  We did so only to have 3 of the hotel buses pass us by with the drivers pointing fingers or waving their hands at us.  We called the hotel back.  They again said the median was where to catch the bus.  We finally walked a ways to where other hotel shuttles were stopping and eventually the bus came.  The driver asked us if we wanted the parking lot or the hotel.  We said the hotel please.  Apparently the bus arrangement picks up employees from the airport and drops them in the parking structure next to the hotel;1
PROS: 1. Location: The location of this hotel is great with 10 mins walk to the Universal Studios entrance. 2. Check-in: We arrived early before our check-in time to drop our bags, but to our surprise we were allotted a room even before our check-in time and we were able to drop our bags and head to the universal. 3. Rooms: Spacious, neat and clean with a great view!!  CONS: 1. Service: We requested for some toiletries at the front desk, we called twice, but no one bothered to come to the room and give it us. The service at the restaurant sucks! we asked for a banana for the breakfast in the morning from 4 different waiters, nobody bothered to get it to us. Finally we had ask the floor manager for it and he got it us. 2. Food: My wife and I got food poisoning after eating dinner;1

I stayed here as a part of a group tour.  Upon arrival the room we were allocated was dirty and wreaked of cigarette smoke. I had 3 people enter the room and confirm the smell before calling reception. The hotel was very condescending in their response saying âwe canât smell smoke but we want to make you happy so we will move youâ.  Later a cleaner informed us that the room smelled so bad they were going to have to filter the air. I hated that they tried to make me think it was all in my head. My daughter was having an asthma attack due to the smoke and they could not have cared less. Another of my daughters was supposed to be in an adjoining room and panicked about being away from me. They shoved us in an inferior room far away from our group and put a fold out bed for my;1

The 'non-smoking' room might as well have been smoking since the smell from other room wafted in through the vents, dingy room with a slightly scary carpet (bring flip flops), a stained mattress, and hot water not always available.  If you are there to sleep for a night or two, its fine; but for longer stays I'd recommend paying bit more and staying elsewhere.";1

The place is a dump.  I had a room with two lumpy beds (one double, one twin) with barely more than 18 inches between the beds.

We were in NYC for the Mostly Mozart Festival. I am a performer. The first room we received smelled heavily of mold and rat poison.

After staying in Vegas and Anaheim we were looking forward to Los Angeles. When we arrived the hotel receptionist was in a full blown arguement with a guest...what ever happened to the customer always being right. The room on first impressions was ok. But after three days of the toilet not flushing and the TV working when it wanted, it got a bit annoying. These defects were reported every morning, but the toilet only ever flushed twice until not working again until the next morning. Unfortunately we had two young children, who were asleep very soon after returning from a day out, and the option of getting a plumber in to fix the toilet in the evenings was impractical as it would of woke our children. On asking the reception staff for directions or advice on were to go, it was;1

"The room with two double beds had almost no passing room to the bathroom. The bath water in the tub never got hotter than lukewarm.

Sanitary bathroom, but too sanitary - had to air out each day because of the chlorine smell.  Partying on Fridays - absolutely no sleep on weekends.  Overnight ""security"" is no help - wouldn't do a thing.  Manager charged the 5-nights we booked immediately upon our arrival (probably illegal).

Were they telling the truth about the Wifi on check in or to Priceline?  Who knows... but clearly they were lying one of those times.  I called up Priceline and demanded a partial refund.

A credit card was given to secure the upgrade and a email confirmation. The email was wrong as stated 1 person and a total value of over $2,700 for 4 nights .

Hi stayed at this hotel over Memorial weekend and have to admit (besides the location of this hotel if you're spending the day at Universal Studios) there is nothing great about this hotel.  The rooms were fine, but as a Diamond member their benefits are poor.  I took my family there for the weekend and booked three rooms.  I've been a Diamond member for about ten years at every other Hilton (or Hilton family hotel) I've stayed at everyone under my reservation can access the executive lounge with me or receives a free breakfast voucher.    Not at this hotel.  I spoke to the manager and he said Hilton changed their rules so only the Diamond member plus one family member receives any benefits.  I called corporate and this is not true.  It's NOT a new rule, but rather it's the;1

He further tried intimidating the group by having the head of Loss Prevention threaten to have us removed for being showing both the elderly and handicapped proper respect and courtesy.

I could keep going for quite some time. Another couple from our party booked a standard double room yet there's was literally at least double the size of ours??

Before making a booking with Hotwire in the US, we looked in detail at the Hotwire website information, read the testimonials they have on the website, and looked at Trip Advisor. Hotwire was promoted as reputable company that offered quality travel deals below published prices.   HOWEVER... we were very shocked to find that the hotel we had booked - the Windsor Hotel - supposedly in the financial district and supposedly usually priced at US $375 - was a rundown hotel in Chinatown staffed by people with very low-level English language skills. The room was quite dirty, smelt funny, and was furnished very shabbily. There were people in the street outside talking and you could hear every word from inside the room.

Beware of high daily parking fee not included in hotel pricing. Neighborhood is not the greatest, hence gated parking around hotel. Hotel looks nice from pics.

This place is disgusting! They show pictures on their website of updated rooms when what theyâre actually selling is out dated garbage rooms. Their front desk staff is not friendly/useful and not willing to help with issues caused by the hotel. They should not be allowed to serve ham and cheese sandwiches to the homeless.   I stayed two nights. The first night I informed them about the air conditioner not working  and they sent someone to the room who did nothing about it. The second night after coming back to the room the AC was completely broken. They did the bare minimum of sending me to another below average room.

Canât fault the location. Paid over Â£1000 to stay but the facilities very average/poor. Like ever other Premier Inn, London prices just not London facilities. I expected it to be their flagship. Iâve stayed in better near a motorway.  Bed was far too high off the ground, thereâs no need.   The bed mattress was far too hard and we had to take Paracetamol & Ibuprofen before bed as we both had terrible nights sleep otherwise. We also had to take painkillers in the morning as the mattress is far too hard for your longevity of replacement rather than our comfort. You talk a good talk but they arenât the comfy mattresses you brag about.

I stayed here twice in November and the first time it was okay.  Nothing special but okay.  The second time I couldn't believe my eyes.  These comments all apply to my second stay.  It seems that it is pot luck at this hotel as some rooms are okay and others are truely awful.  I had read the reviews and decided that it would be okay as each stay was only one night and you can put up with anything for one night right?  Wrong.    The room was so small that it was difficult to simply get from the door to the bathroom. It smelled damp and musty but the bathroom was clean and everything worked.  There was no alarm clock, the phone was not able to be used as I had prepaid my accommodation.   The real problem started when I pulled back the bedspread to get into bed and I thought those;1

Check in wasn't great, Greeted by OZLEM, at reception, who had a very bad manner. she then asked for a $200 deposit, incase we break anything, well let me tell you, there was absolutely nothing to break.weirdly the couple booking in next to us, were not asked for a deposit, so its definitely up to who checks you in and their mood.   we in for a shock- for a 4*, I would grade it a 2, the room was 4sqm, . It was clean, the bedding, towels and shower curtain was brand new, but it was a very dated decor, that needed a urgent update.

Don't come to this place. We arrived in LA at 6am and had to walk around until 4pm because 4pm should be the time that our room would be ready for us. Surprise: it should, but, according to the clerk, this is not something they can't guarantee. Wifi is not free. Parking is paid, as well as breakfast (of course this may vary accordingly to your reservation). The hotel is packed and we had to wait for half an hour to try to check in and hear that we had to wait some more. So... if you are looking for a hotel that treats you with respect, look for another one. One last thing: I asked if this situation would at least cause some kind of discount in the room price, and, well, I don't have to tell you the answer. This is the first Hilton I stay where I get angry and unhappy with the;1

The Internet coverage didn't reach our room (""oh yeah that happens with some of our rooms"" I was told) and unbelievably the aircon remperature is apparently controlled by the staff so that you can't change it yourself. Unreal.   The hotel itself overall was very tired and pretty dirty and in need of a deep clean. The room was never cleaned and we asked multiple times for new towels, until eventually I had to take my dirty towels down to reception (which was frequently unmanned)  and wait for 20 minutes until someone appeared to change them over myself.    Location was fine and the staff we dealt with were very pleasant and trying their best. However  they were completely overwhelmed and various";1
Upon entering the premises everything seemed alright, clean, decent facilities which included vending machines, laundry area, a kitchen and a communal area.  However, after dropping my bags off in my room and going out into London and returning to the hostel at about 11pm ready for bed I walked through the corridor which I can only describe as a Sauna.  I am sure this wasn't included on the hostels list of facilities because a corridor did seem a strange place to put your sauna, but I thought nothing of it intially thinking surely my room would be cooler with in being 2015 and the invention of air conditioning.  But I was wrong! In fact the room was hotter or at least equally as hot as the corridors!    My room was situated on the ground floor and although I did have the option;1

This was the worst hotel Iâve stayed in in years yet one of the most expensive.  The room was run down, uncomfortable and felt overall dirty because of its state.  Even though we were on the 24th floor, the windows may have been the original and we could hear all street sounds.  The sheets were scratchy and beds felt like a brick.  I would not recommend-far better hotels in NYC for the same price.  I thought Wyndham had a standard but if this is it, I wonât stay at one again.;1

The hotel lobby was very clean. However, on many occasions the floor was dirty with stuff stomped into the carpet. The lift smelled badly of marijuana and occasionally could smell it on our floor and in the room. The room itself was disgusting, lots of attention paid to the sheets and bathroom but behind the bed was very dusty, the lamps had thick layers of dust, the plug sockets were unsafe as some were broken, furniture was all scratched and really worn, the radiator in the room was thick with dust and dirt, the valance round the bed was ripped, wallpaper was coming off of the wall. Some of the staff were unapproachable, I paid my room in cash and the boy at the desk took about 6 attempts at trying to count the money, which was time consuming and was rather annoying after;1

After reading a number of fantastic reviews about this budget glory, I was sure that we were going to get along just fine.  I was wrong.  In college, I lived in the dorms and, At the time, it seemed like glamorous fun to share a 150 square foot room with another person, and share bathrooms down the hall with everyone on my floor.  In retrospect?  It sucked.  To compare, this is even worse.  The Bed: at 5'6 I reach the end of the mattress when I lie down.  This means that my feet are practically in the shelves at the end of the bed.  Also, the matress thickness is about that of a cot.  Not comfortable.  I suppose they try to balance this by having feather pillows and high threadcount sheets but it just seems a pittance.  The noises: You can hear everything.  Your next door;1

This was a truely expensive disappointment clearly the demand and supply factor for families visiting Universal Studios means that service can be poor to non existent.

Worst hotel experience, blood on sheets, hole in sheets and towels. Food stains on bedding. A fly was also in the room on the 2nd day. And customer service was very poor.

Last time I had anything like old blood on sheets at a hotel, a refund was given due to the inconvenience. It exposes you to blood borne diseases and has made for a very uncomfortable, unsettling stay. Worst Hyatt I have been to.

Decent sized clean rooms and close to Universal which is their ONLY selling points.Other than that they are over-priced. I went here on family vacation and the staff and elevators in the hotel tried their hardest to ruin our vacation.

I've stayed in hotels all over the world, many times they have been Hilton, which is generally a good experience, NOT THIS ONE, NEVER AGAIN.

Not sure where to start about the Morningside â thereâs nothing nice about it.  Immediately upon our arrival, we were subject to rude customer service by the entire hotel staff, including Patrick, the hotel âmanagerâ who claimed that weâd canceled our reservation, even though we had CONFIRMED our reservation the night before and had the documents to prove it.  After acting like he did us a big favor, he gave us Room #604.  What we found were several deficiencies of very basic amenities, from no batteries in the smoke detector to a chain lock that we could simply pull right off the wall to thin, dirty towels.  This is in addition to no hot water in the shower and a heating system that turned on once every 12 hours (we slept in our jackets).  Mismatched paint on the walls and bird;1
"It amazes me the varying reviews on this hotel.  My husband and I are on the "" we'll never stay here again"" side of things.  From the sound of some of the review - there are obviously many different types of rooms you can stay in, and maybe that makes a difference.  If this place really wants to become a hotel, though, then it needs to refurbish the rooms and make them more uniform.    What we got was a room not much bigger than a dorm room. Stark white walls, no artwork at all, no mirror or sink in the room.  Even if it was clean, it just FELT dirty.  Pillows that were the thinnest, barest pillows.  And the shared bathrooms... oi.  I will say - never really had to wait.  BUT- we had to carry our own toilet paper!  They supplied it for us, but in our room. We had to take it w/";1

Didn't show up on my bill. (Called prior to check out and manager tried to deny and offered me $25.00 instead (Seriously!)) Spoke with front desk again re freezing room. Told they had portable heaters but all being used ( No kidding!) but assured me when people checked out later that day I would get one.Offered a $75.00 credit for the heat problem. I never asked for any money, I just wanted a room that had heat and hot water. Again, returned to;1

"Stayed one night on a business trip. Got there at 10:30PM to find that because it had been raining, there was a leak in a room which forced them to put me in a basement room with a shared bathroom - not what I wanted to deal with. The room seemed clean (I checked for bedbugs after reading another Tripadvisor review after I booked the hotel) and had a tile floor, which I was glad  to have. But it was barely big enough to hold the double bed, chair and table (with a TV on it) that it had. No hooks on the wall, so nowhere to hang anything. The ""bathroom"" was a small room with a toilet, sink and shower head sticking out of the wall - fortunately there were disposable slippers that I was able to shower in.  I will never stay here again.";1
Absolute garbage.  We paid for a  hotel room and we got something you wouldnât let your dog sleep.  Including the repairs to the air conditioning unit next door at 2.00 am in the morning.  The brown water ?? covering the floor of the bathroom was offensive and suggest people take their waterproof footwear if  they are going to stay there.  The beds were marginally softer than a park bench and the cockroach races were entertaining.  We are only thankful we brought our own bug spray.  Next time weâll stay in Central Park on a bench.  It was unworthy of the name hotel. Paid New York marathon prices.;1
Do not stay here unless you're absolutely desperate, even then, keep looking elsewhere.  Keep in mind, none of these issues would be relevant at $90/ night, but with the rates these people charge their service is disgusting.   They have a policy not to give guests more than two bottles of water which is insane. They refuse to answer the phone if you call the front desk and are rude when you ask simple questions.   It's incredibly frustrating to pay so much for a room so tiny that you have to step over the toilet into the tub to close the restroom door.;1
Room was very aged, carpet felt dirty and had a big iron burn in it, everything was old, aged, worn and a bit dusty, TV from the 80s, sink had no stopper yet wouldn't drain.  It took three trips up and down in the elevator to even get into my room as the keys wouldn't work. My room was located in the fire escape stair well, where everything stank of bleach. Presumably after a good hosing down from the previous tenant.  However the absolute worst feature was despite being many floors up, the noise from the dive across the road was incredible until about 3am.  If you're young, in NYC to go out late, get drunk and not really worry about the standard of your accomodation or sleep, and need a place at the more budget end or at the last minute, then you might consider this place.;1

The staff turned their nose and couldn't give the time of day and acted like they were some big shots out on 5 th avenue but the place was a dump. The shower was the size of a sink with dirty broken tile the handle kept breaking off the room was beat up with peeling paint the door kept locking me out. The halls were just as bad and smelled of cigarettes, lastly the place checked me out a day early and locked my bags inside and the staff couldn't have been any nastier about it. This almost ruined it for a person who went to New York for the first time.;1

I stayed at the empire hotel for my honeymoon for 4 nights during my 1 month travel around the states. The lady who checked us in was fantastic and very helpful in telling us places to go as we live in Australia... When I checked out of the hotel I believed that I had paid all of my accomodation and the hotel would just refund the $150 bond that was authorised but no instead they charged my card $1245 while still holding the $1385 so overall I had $2500 being taken/held from the hotel... When I called to question this (as this is not how itâs done in Australia) the lady I spoke to was very rude and told me I would only receive the $150 back not the full $1345 so I was exteramly annoyed thinking I had paid $2000 for my accomodation after I emailed the hotel and spoke to the;1

Until Hilton gets there act together with respect to this property, I wouldn't consider it again.  The location is convenient to Universal Studios, but the quality of the hotel is well below standard.  It's one thing to have high use, it's completely different to be poorly maintained.  This property is poorly maintained.  The staff at the front desk appeared to be clueless.;1
Checked in here for three nights . Unfortunate it was a terrible experience, on check in were given room 324 this was a great room nice and big unfortunately the smell was awfull, on reporting this to front desk their solution was spray air freshener, all this would have done is mask the smell I refused,they moved us to room 308 this room was tiny did not even have a closet, and to top it all the smoke alarm in the room started to beep at4am because it had a low battery, reported this the next morning and maintenance did replace battery, we then went out for the day returned at 7 pm to discover room at not been serviced when we reported this ( front desk must have dreaded seeing us coming) were told housekeeping had gone home, they arranged fresh towels and took away the rubbish;1

Hmmmm, Should I begin with how disappointing it was to book this hotel through TripAdvisor and have it be such a totally horrible experience? (Still waiting on that refund!!!) Or maybe I should just describe the room. Dirty, stained carpet. Lampshades that were broken, stained. Heat/Air unit that sounded like it had rats running around inside, or maybe hamsters on a wheel but really this place inspired thoughts of rats. Or maybe I should talk about the smoke alarm going off and smoke pouring into my room under the door. Hallway filled with smoke which was nothing but some really stupid person smoking a heck of a lot of weed. Oh and 1983 called and wants it's TV back.;1

We arrived on Sunday evening excited about a few night stay in the city center. We had expected the hotel and rooms to be smaller than other cities based on common sense and other reviews. this was of course the case and not a problem. The rooms them selves were quite tired and dated, with some areas (such as the bathroom) needing proper repairs and replacement from lack of proper maintenance, not just age, but again that was no major problem and to be expected (would have been great if that wasnt the case though, good job we got a good deal!).  The problems started on the Monday. With suitcases and clothes everywhere, it wasnt the best state for anyone to come in, so we left the 'do not disturb/ no cleaning' sign on the door and went to enjoy our day. around 4pm we came back;1

We stayed at the Jane due to its cheap price and its location (which are its positives).  However, the negatives far outweigh the positives.  For example, the rooms are very, very small. There is barely enough space for one person to change.  There is simply not enough space for two people to change....one will have to leave the room for the other to change.  The hotel also smells....there is a nasty odor that permeated the halls and rooms.  There are local residents that stay in the hotel, and yes, they are strange.  The worst part of the hotel is the shower.  During our stay, the shower stalls in both bathrooms on the floor were flooded (the drains did not drain the water).  You can only imagine how gross this would be to step into and shower.  There are much better values for;1
The hotel looks nice on paper but wooooowww. Do yourself a favor and donât book here. The bathroom was so small I had to put half of my body in the shower (which has no door btw) just so I could open and close the door (which you must, bc they decided it was a good idea to put the TP behind the door...?). My room was literally a closet. There wasnât even room for me to open my suitcase anywhere, so I had to put it on my bed every time I needed something. The AC was awful, hallways were a thousand degrees, the pool is a one lane quarter of a lap size pool, and the elevators are shanky. (We got stuck bc none of the buttons worked). ðð¼ðð¼ðð¼;1
I am absolutely appalled at the way I was treated at the Hyatt Regency LAX. I  made a reservation a month in advance through American Airlines, who had told me that no card or payment was required until check-in. I flew in from New York, a flight that was delayed several hours and didn't arrive at LAX until 2am (5am my time). I arrive at the Hyatt Recency to find that the hotel cancelled my reservation due to;1
The main and only thing to consider if you come to this place is the price . My room was not ready , it was barely clean in the hostel , the place is noisy with construction near by and slaming doors .On the top of this : no elevator , you have to pay for the wifi (and it's not cheap) and the staff is not friendly at all .Saying that , staying close to hammersmith station is very convenient  .Honestly , for my next trip to London I'd rather put more money for the hostel than come back to this place , even for free because the staff was so rude !;1
Had a booking for 7nights, checked in to MY room for the first 3 nights then got told to move out of MY room for someone else and I got put in to the worse looking room possible. Had no space at all my bags when I walked in, the floor was filthy and disgusting, stains all over the place and the staff just started to stretch and act as if nothing was wrong when I told them I want something else. Completely disappointed in this place.;1
This is probably the worst of maybe 3 dozen hotels I've stayed in NYC over the years. Besides the peeling wallpaper, the mold on the ceiling, the thick brown water coming out of the bathroom faucet, the window that wouldn't shut and the accumulated filth on the windowsill, missing knobs on the a/c heating unit, housekeeping not answering the phone, front desk not answering the phone, the room was one of the smallest I've ever been given. Took three different rooms before I was able to get one that was minimally acceptable. The location is perfect for Lincoln Center but there is just no way I will ever stay there again....and it was more than $400 !!!! Unbelievable.;1
"I wish I had inspected the room upon arrival. We stayed less than 24 hours. Silverfish bugs in shower; dirty air conditioner filled with dust and mold, desk unclean with liquid stains.

When we arrived, the whole space was taken up by a SUV that was parked right in the middle leaving no space for my little car.  The rug between the beds was filthy!

That evening when we were laying in bed, we noticed that there was a bed bug crawling in the sheets.!!! We immediately went to the front desk and were told that they had no rooms left and there was nothing they could do. The was 8:00pm the night before the Oscars and we were left to find another hotel on our own. Management were not friendly and didn't care. They felt they had not reason to help us what so ever, as if it was our fault. It also didn't seem like a surprise, so I assume they see this on a regular basis. They charged us for 7 nights parking and also charged for rooms calls that we used to find a new hotel. Not;1

So let me say I have stayed at this Hilton previously and had a good experience - hence the return.  This time however we were not so lucky.   Booked rooms with larger group.  No one ever told about two elevators being down for upgrades.  Additionally on Friday another elevator was out of service.  Normally not a problem but with someone on wheel chair.  Called the front desk and asked what to do after waiting for 17 minutes.  We were told they would send elevator to floor.  After 26 minutes of waiting called back to front desk - they didn't understand why elevator hadn't arrived.  Suggested we carry down the stairs our wheelchair bound friend.  We were only on th 11th floor.  After 1 hour, 4 minutes we finally got an elevator.  Went down to breakfast buffet - had the breakfast;1

I have taken the trouble to complete this review because I don't want others to fall victim of this hotel which promises much more than it delivers. The rooms are dirty and noisy - awful air conditioning humming reverberates around all rooms.. it's awful .. like sleeping under a runway! I stayed for a week and the room was only cleaned once during that time - yes no clean towels, no replenished toiletries, no beds made etc..  We booked the hotel for the pool but it wasn't available for the entire week (other guests told me this had happened to them the week before our trip too). The gym was also out of order. The staff were rarely seen - the queue in reception was always at least 30 mins wait.. it's a disgrace!  There are hundreds of hotels in New York - think really carefully;1
I've never written a bad review for anything before but I found the Empire to be such a let down. We were staying in NYC for 8 days and decided to stay in a couple of different hotels to keep it interesting and see new locations. We booked through Agoda.co.uk for 3 nights after reading about the rooftop pool and roof bar. It sounded amazing and was pretty much the main reason for our stay. I also loved the look of the interiors with the Art Deco decor and sunburst mirrors.   When we checked in we weren't told much at all, and we were not informed that the pool and bar would be closed for the duration of our stay (We found that out later when we threw our bags into the room and ran up to the 11th floor to find both locked) and when we rang reception to enquire about this we were;1

She basically refused to play anything but her horrible 80s-90s chill out music and when I told her that she should play music closer to what we wanted she told me that we could all leave and proceeded to CURSE AT ME REPEATEDLY.

This is not so much a hotel as it is an elaborate scam to lure money from clueless tourists. Plumbing was a disaster, wifi useless, tv not working. Complaints are recieved with standard polite remarks, but are not  dealt with. What is really scary, is that the same issues that appear in most reviews here are not fixed, and seem to be permanent - hence my growing suspicion that this is a business based on screwing costumers and hotel inspectors over. Would never, ever return.;1
Looked forward to staying at this hotel. It was a birthday holiday and Iâd always wanted to go to New York. I picked this hotel but I sorely wish Iâd stayed at a Hilton or something more basic as we had nothing but issues. I wouldnât step foot in this hotel again even if I received a free trip.  As soon as we arrived we were asked for money to cover the room. Iâve never known them to charge you, only to take your card and if anything is taken out of the room, then they charge you and excuse me Iâve travelled a lot Iâm no dodo to hotel charges but what I did not appreciate was that they expected DOUBLE the amount at the rate of $300 in cash because we didnât have a card. I was outraged. I think that is disgusting and I donât care where itâs written, Iâm not a saddo who reads;1
Stayed for 5 nights in November, room was smaller than advertised, bathroom the size  of a postage stamp, soundproofing very bad, sounded like the road was running next to my bed. Coffee $3, water $5, Wi-fi charged $9.95 on the website or $12.95 in the room guide per device per 24 hours so not sure what the price actually is. Complained about the room size and was told by the young lady on reception I would get an email from the manage - still waiting........  went for a drink at the hotel bar and asked for wine, there was no red wine at all in the hotel and only 1 white wine, again asked to speak to the manager this time the manger was conveniently on the phone (apparently) by now I had the impression the manager did not even have the balls to speak to customers regarding;1
This hotel is a joke. Location is horrible, room was bad, the front staff manager Gisel really needs a career change in which she doesnât have to deal with people, disgusting rude.   Upon leaving the hotel and checking into my next hotel, I noticed my Oakley sunglasses, and hanshin tigers cap had been stolen. Do yourself a favor and donât stay here.;1

Booked a Queen room and when we opened the door the bed was very small with barely enough room to walk around it.  I went to front desk and was told that beds in the hotel were a little small compared to what we have at home.  Upon looking a little further, the desk agent found out that they had put us in a room with full bed.  They moved us to a queen room in a part of the hotel that has not yet been remodeled. Bed was better but still a very small room. I tried to call for a roll away bed but could not get through to housekeeping or the front desk - both rang busy. I tried repeatedly.  Finally I went to front desk to ask for a roll away.  We went out to dinner and still no roll away. At 11:30 I got through to the front desk and was told that they were really busy with 50 roll;1

The location of the hotel is perfect however it ends there. We paid for a executive double with a view and were told the day before it was fine but when we arrived it was there's a burst pipe. We were given a room on the 7th floor which looks into class room/ training room. We tried to complain but got no where. The carpet was bumpy and if i was unsteady on my feet I would have tripped. The shower leaks regardless of the towels on the floor to stop the water flooding the room.  The room was a lot smaller than what we paid for.  When I returned home we emailed to complain which seems to have been ignored.;1
Stayed two nights at Jane Hotel (July 2-4), other than good location, everything else was horrible.  Carpet in the room is dirty, room is stuffy, so is the corridor, very noisy from corridor and other rooms. Donât stay at Jane in hot daysâno air-cond, and the fan is loud, and air is not circulating at all. Courtesy of staff is minus-10 on a 1-10 scale.  Heavy equipment brought in to do major work in 3 rooms opposite my room from 5pm-2:30am!!! This is unacceptable!!! I complained and the staff said will stop at 11:30pm (even then is unacceptable), and did not happen, so I have to yell at workers at 2:30am then they stopped. No courtesy of the staff or the hotel to forewarn me or move me to other room. Staff is rude. I will never stay in the Jane Hotel again. Minus 5 stars, if I;1
Worst experience of my life. The hotel ran out of hot water and had to take an ice cold shower. The hotel didn't even offer another option...no nearby gym, hotel or anything. How can a hotel run out of hot water and expect their guests to return?;1
Our party of ten (including my blind Father) arrived at this hotel for just a one night stay and have to say that the male receptionist, Pascal, was so rude and unhelpful. He had a very un-pleasant manner, was impatient, tutted at us and was rolling his eyes. We booked in with another member of staff earlier that morning (Rudi), who was lovely and very helpfull- who told us only 2 of our 5 allocated rooms were available. So, we went out for the day and when we came back that afternoon, was unfortunate enough to be served by this rude man who made a drama out of things. Our previously given room numbers had changed unbe known to us which confused matters, but his rudeness did not help. This was not our fault.  Our new rooms were small, shabby and overlooking lots of air;1

As a traveling professional I've stayed at a myriad of hotels and never have I stayed in a hotel room as bad a shape as this one. No heat/hot water, no thick comforters, broken tv and the most dangerous was the metal bar protruding from the mattres that ended up cutting my leg as I slept.;1
Caveat: I was on the 1st floor so I have no idea if upper floors would have the same ambiance.  My room was about 4ft below ground level facing the sidewalk.  The A/C was above the window. I had to climb on to the night stand to adjust the A/C.   With the curtains closed, the A/C was ineffective.  With the curtains open, I was watching the world watch me.  The building is in VERY close proximity to the Subway.  I can feel and hear the rumble of the passing trains all night long.  In convenient power outlets, no place to place clothes in the bathroom.  Even the toilette seat did not have a cover so Plan B was out.  No coffee anywhere in the hotel.    The people were friendly and the location was convenient for me but overall, this was a complete disaster.  When I travel, I need;1
I traveled to NYC from Minneapolis with my sister and elderly parents. I pre paid for our rooms,  however there was an issue with their website which changed our check in and check out dates. The Empire was very accommodating, appearing to resolve the issue.  I have multiple emails claiming it was taken care of.  Upon check in,  only one room was noted as pre paid.  I was charged again for the second room in my reservation.  Upon discovering this,  the front desk staff was as helpful as they can be.  The charge was reversed,  but not until I arrived home.  In the mean time,  the $150 refundable deposit had to be paid.    In the days since I have arrived home (Stay was July 7-10th) another almost $360 in charges has appeared on my account.

"As a Hyatt Globalist - top tier of loyalty program - I stay at a lot of Hyatts and know what to expect of the brands, especially Regency. This particular hotel does not meet that level and is closer to a Motel 6. The pros are simple: the lobby looks pretty and the location cannot be any better to LAX. The cons however are purely outrageous. To start, after checking in, the bellman (a bald Greek or Mediterranean man) walked up to me and my clearly marked service dog and immediately said ""Nice dog, is that kind expensive?"" I skated the question and replied that she is a Boston Terrier service dog. To which he came back and said ""How much did you pay for her?"" I was a little dumbfounded at this and after a brief pause I just said ""I don't know..."" He then asked ""How old is she?""";1

We had an all around terrible experience. We would have been better off at a motel 6. Took over 45 min to check in. Our room wasn't ready so the moved us to a different room with a pull out bed. Call to request additional blankets and pillows for the pull out bed and it took over two hours. When they did arrive house keeping let themselves in my room without knocking, I was half dressed. Then we froze all night because the heater blew out cold air, the next morning we ran out of hot water after two showers, my husband ended up taking a cold shower. there were several other small things that irritated me, like $40 per night to park and you had to pay for wi-fi. You don't get your moneys worth at this hotel. try the Sheraton next door, I know we will next time.;1
The worst place to stay... ever. 3 nights. 2 out of 3 nights, no heat.  2 nights. No hot water. After numerous complaints, problems were not fixed nor was there any adjustments made.  2 towels.

Overall nice place. We were expecting a luxury  hotel based on photos price and review but it was pretty average. Dated rooms and amenities.

"Hotel is in a great Lincoln Center location - close to subway, Time Warner, UWS, Midtown, etc.  We did a ""stay cation"" and opted for a suite so our son would have a private area to sleep.  I emailed with the hotel ahead of time, and was told pool would be open, heated, etc.  Pool is more like a jacuzzi in size, has no sunlight despite being on the roof and is definitely not heated.  It would have to be 100+ degrees to be warm enough to use.  In my pre stay emails, I also emphasized that we needed a crib and small refrigerator plugged in before our arrival so it would already be cool.  Hotel fridges seem to take hours to cool down which does not help when you have milk for the baby.  Nothing was in the room upon arrival, had to call.  And call. And call.  And call.  And go down";1

Booked a room last minute online only to arrive 8 hours later to be turned away as they had no rooms available. I think Josna is an incompetent receptionist who was unable to tell me what the problem and only âwas allowedâ to murmur you have to wait for the manager, Gerald Dotson. It is my opinion that Gerald was very rude. First, he was cavorting around at 11pm for 15 minutes before casually arriving and not apologizing. Meanwhile others were being checked in around me. I believe the whole experience was poorly handled, reflected incompetence by the staff, showed the hotel is unreliable with reservations and reflected extreme unprofessionaliam. I have never been so poorly treated at a hotel. I demanded a refund in writing which Gerald reluctantly agreed to give me after much;1

Read poor reviews about this hotel and assumed other guests had just been fussy - how wrong I was. The hotels lobby is welcoming, and the location is decent - close to a subway (but everything's close to a subway in NYC). The room, though, was appalling. Dimly lit and dated, dirty bathroom and a a bath that wouldn't drain, plug sockets hanging off the wall, mold and damp on floors and walls, and a radiator that hissed and whistled through the night. Someone tried to get into our room at 4am so we couldn't sleep and felt unsafe. When I stepped out for a cigarette in the early hours to chill out I seemed to step right into the middle of a drug deal right outside the hotel.  We checked out as soon as we could and found somewhere safer to spend the rest of our time in Manhattan.;1
I am Wyndham Diamond and this is the worst NY hotel I have ever stayed at. The front desk staff are amazing and made the most of what they have to offer, but the hotel itself is in DIRE NEED of an upgrade.   We stayed at the Terrence Suite and the room smelled like puke. No one was available to clean so family had to sleep in a puke smelling couch overnight until cleaning staff was available to clean.  The next day, the toilet clogged and we had to call again.  They said they would charge us $3.00 when my grandmother asked for hot water until a very nice manager saw that I was wyndham diamond and sent over complimentary water.   The rooms and bathrooms are ridiculously outdated.;1
20 minutes after checkout i called to let staff know i left my charger in the room. When i arrived back all i was told was that nothing was found.

To add insult to injury - the rooms were prepaid.  There was no offer to walk us - simply a ""too bad"" with a rather blank stare.

When I checked in the hotel was very busy and when I asked if they had any quiet rooms they pretty much said I was out of luck. The room I stayed in was very small which is expected for Manhattan, and was also facing the street (also expected). The windows appeared to be older double-pane and were really not doing much to block out the street noise. In the room it pretty much sounded like I was standing outside in the street. Being a light sleeper, this was very much a problem. I was so desperate I actually tried curling up in the tiny shower and shutting the bathroom door to get a little shut eye. Needless to say, I didn't sleep at all the night I stayed there. If you can sleep with a lot of noise, the hotel would probably be fine for you otherwise.;1

"This isn't a hotel.   It's ""Cabin style"" rooms are barely workable. Basically one uncomfortable single bed,  with 2 very slim sheets that don't keep anything warm.

This room is so small that my son and I can not walk past each other without bumping into one another.  We were on a cruise a month ago and it's hard to believe but that room was larger than this shoebox.  Unfortunately we have 2 more nights here.  The common areas are sweltering hot.  Especially the elevators.  Elevators are not easy to get and when you do get one you will be smushed up against 20 other sweaty bodies.  Also, whatever you pay for this room when you book, forget it, you will be hit with a facilities fee of up to $35 a night.  Which is an absolute ripoff as we haven't been able to access wifi at all which is supposedly one of the items covered under this fee.  Avoid this hotel.  It's a joke.;1

All I can say is that by staying at this hotel, my sisters and I felt that they (the management) had ruined our whole nyc experience.  From the beginning they gave us a smoking room (without us asking for it) and they interrogated us, yes I said interrogated when we requested a change.  the staff is rude, hostile and uppity. Our requests took over an hour, ruined our dinner and made us late for our show.  Upon returning not only werent we upgraded, but our luggage could not be found, and was left in the smoking room that we had requested to leave.  The night manager was rude and certainly wasnt trained in being hospitable to guests. It took more time out of our evening to get this settled as well. My advice, even if you have to walk or take a subway to Lincoln Center do not give;1
We stayed in a room that doesn't have a private bathroom. We were supposed to stay for 4 nights but we have to look for another accommodation because we felt VERY UNSAFE in this hotel. Advised them on the morning of the second day, but because of their refund policy of 72 hours once you are checked in, we didn't get any money back even for 1 day.   CONS:  - NO SEPARATE toilet and shower for women - VERY NOISY, people singing karaoke in the middle of the night, no noise control from the management - Showers, toilets and kitchen are DISTY and SMELLY - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE from the front desk - NO FREE WIFI, you have to pay in cash if you need access to wifi which is 1 pound per hour - elevator wasn't working when we were there - NO Air Condition  NOT RECOMMENDED for women;1
The hotel looks absolutely nothing like the photos, dark, out dated and dingy the most. Quality of a motel!! The front desk are the least helpful or friendly I ever meet! Good thing, we only need one night. The experience is unpleasant, unsafe! Staff wear no mask while weâre still amidst pandemic. DO NOT stay here!;1

The hotel staff was ill equipped to handle an emergency that left the hotel without power and water. Communication was absent as we woke up to complete darkness. There were no attempts to relocate guests to other properties. The hotel management represented that they would reach out to guests and refund the stay, however I have yet to hear from them.;1

Hotel was contacted by us days in advance that we would be a late p.m. arrival.  When we arrived at reception desk they informed us that there was bad news and good news.  The bad news was that our room had water damage.  The good news was that they were sending us to their sister hotel, a 15 minute cab ride away and would give us the taxi fare.  We chose the Empire Hotel for location.  Reservation was made 3 months in advance.  We had a conference the next morning, 7 a.m. at the Lincoln Center, just across the street, and had other friends staying nearby.  If Empire would have contacted us earlier about this problem, we could have arranged to find another Central Park hotel location.  They claimed they were unable to notify us but this was false since our email address was;1
For $250/night, I expected much better. What was described as a room that would comfortably house three adults was tiny (perhaps 10 by 12) with a twin and a bed described as a full that was actually a twin with six more inches of width meant to hold two adults. The mattresses were rock-hard and stained with what looked like blood. The fitted sheets did not fit the mattresses. The comforters were almost crunchy in texture. The blankets had something on them that made me sneeze whenever I was near them. I can only hope the mystery substance was a cleaning chemical and not mold, mildew, or worse. I woke up every day with a terrible back and neck ache that required several minutes of stretching and medication.  We barely had room to move around in the room, which did not include;1
I stayed in this tiny ween hotel for an extended week end and my first impression upon entering is deemed light,unsanitary atmosphere and rudness of the front desk worker. The hotel does not worth half of what they are charging and most of the front workers are nasty.This building need to be knocked down and get most needed renovation.Terrible experience that will never repeat itself. Read peoples first hand review before confirmation.;1

We love Hilton and we our honor members. We stay at Orlando Bonnet Creek a few times a year. Beware of the upper management in this California Hotel. No masks in pool area...over crowded...parties and outside guests bringing food and drinks in....reported to front desk continued throughout stay. Los Angelos police were called when the huge party continued inside a room and a fight broke out. After an email to the manager he simply said sorry. Our vacation was less than expected. The other staff were kind and the room was clean. The covid standards were ignored which put all guests in grave danger.;1

"First, I have reserved this hotel using ---.com.  I have found that ---.com did not tell me in advance about the parking issue at this hotel. I had to pay for each day parking $13 per day.  The other issues I had, is that after first night of stay, I have placed ""Refresh me"" sign at the door, the room was as it is condition when we came back after spending our day out. Continental breakfast compare to other hotels where I have stayed in the past is 3 out of 10. The breakfast room had a leakage, where water was dripping from the roof, that was there during our entire stay at the hotel. The staff rating that I can give is 5 out of 10. My overall experience is very bad, and I think you can find better hotels in that area.";1
Upon arriving about 6pm, we were greeted by not very friendly reception staff and the concierge was asleep standing up at his desk and just pushed a map across to us ....  the room - well well.... itâs old, stuffy, dirty and dated.  The beds are comfortable and looked clean enough but the A/C which did work but was noisy all night long. There are no dark blinds and as for a view the windows are so dirty you canât see out of them at all.  The bathroom - well the ceiling is mouldy and the bath has a cracked tile around the main spout. There is mould all around the tub and itâs stained and old. Our shower blocked on the first night which made me almost sick showering in a 3 inch bath of god knows what coming up from the drain. When we asked for someone to come and unblock it I was;1

Smelly, dingy and utterly uncomfortable.  I BEGGED my children to take a shower in the shared bathroom. Our AC broke which was pinned into the window with boards, the beds were rock hard, and right when it couldn't get any worse, we saw two roaches.  I couldn't wait to leave...and neither could my children.  If you're in and out and on an EXTREME budget (without children) this might work, but save your NYC experience for another hotel if you can.;1
We stayed for one week, they charged me with extra fees like parking when I never requested and I never had a car in NY, then I did a reservation with the $119.00 special they offer in internet, but the charged me more at the end because it was a weekend. I expected a better information before you get this hotel. Now, I must deal with back charges from my bank and deal with this problem.;1
unpleasant overall, room was way too small for two beds and hv/ac unit kept blowing breaker, was informed we would be moved to another room only to be told no rooms were available nothing was offered in exchange for total inconvenience of uncomfortable room which made for horrible nights sleep.;1
Sheraton Times Square then this is the hotel for you. We requested an extra night on arrival at this hotel to find the hotel manager and receptionist had not bothered pursuing our request , leaving us without a hotel room on the last night of our stay in New York, despite their assurances on arrival it would not be a problem. When it got to the day before our due departure date we still had not got a confirmation of our extra night. The receptionist did not even want to call, leaving us to call the central reservations from our room, the following morning not only did they not care we had no hotel room for our extra night, I even had to pay $1 to access the internet in the basement to see if I had an email confirmation. The manager did not try to find another room for us,;1
I'm not one for slamming hotels. But this hotel deserves to be slammed. First, I made my booking for a busy weekend in September. My plan was to propose to my fiance in California, having a stay at the nicest hotel I could find within walking distance of Universal. So we were greeted by a rather obstinant manager (Phillipe, you know who you are) who impolitely informed us preferences are just that when you book through Expedia, and our non smoking room was now a smoking room. With bad allergies, we reluctantly took the room and were greeted by an old bar-like reeking room of smoke - with air condition apparently not on. We turned it on, and left. Coming back later that evening to find the place hadnt cooled down. Did I mess up the ac settings? I turned it on further, down to 50;1
This was one of the worst hotels I've stayed at. Room walls paper thin, I could hear people next door talking and laughing ALL day and night. Doors closing all night echo loudly keeping me up.

Service guy will rectify by tonight  The next morning it was the same until i checked out. I even email to the hotel but no reply till date.

I booked this through Hotels.com which described it as a boutique hotel and had the fact there were shared bathrooms buried deep in the description - which I only discovered after checking in. From the front lobby where you walked into booming rap music to the 2 non-working and utterly disgusting bathrooms on the floor, I checked in out of exhaustion on a forced overnight due to travel issues and regretted every minute I was there.  No A/C on a hot steamy night in June, no television, there was a hole in the floor in my room that was covered by carpet.  DISGUSTING.  There should be a negative star rating. Ultimately I slept for 2 hours on top of the bed and left back to JFK.;1

I have stayed here so many times, the staff are always friendly and you know what your getting. On this occasion the room was so loud it was next to the lift. The beds were really uncomfortable. Lastly my son left some really expensive ear phones in the room. Realises good this 40 minutes after I left on the train I tried to phone the hotelâ¦ 7 hours to get through, I am still waiting for a reply. I know this is my mistake but this could of been rectified before housekeeping even got in there if Iâd of been able to get through on a call. No call back to say if they have found the headphones;1

My husband (53) daughter (9) and I stayed here from the 28th till the 30th December 2015.  We're from Scotland in the UK and were en route to Florida for a birthday celebration for our daughter and decided to squeeze in a visit to New York.  If I had been staying any longer I would have shifted to a different hotel, only decided to stay through sheer exhaustion.    The Days Hotel could give the prison service a hint or two on how to accommodate inmates as that's how we felt upon our departure/release!  We arrived at the hotel with lots of bags but no sign of any assistance was on offer ~(the concierge was busy having a chat).  The reception desk had 2 female staff when it came my turn to be attended to they proceeded to chat away to each other in Spanish while I was standing;1

Location: Great - across from Lincoln Center/The Met.  Upkeep: Dingy rooms. A/C rattled all night, bathroom sink was clogged, shower floods the bathroom if you aren't careful, corroded window frames, corroded and cracked shower corners, etc. For NYC, its OK, but on principal, it isn't OK. Overpriced food and beverage traps are laid throughout the room: $3 coffee, $8 water bottles, a fridge packed with $$$$ booze and chasers, a desk packed with $$$$$$ snacks.  Avoid.   Pool Deck: Good views of Broadway. The pool itself is really small. Pool Staff - for the most part, the runners were friendly and did a good job picking up cups and running food orders out, but unfortunately, the Food & Bev Team in charge is incredibly unprofessional and will try to push you to reserve spaces/seats;1

I would have rated this hotel 5 stars but when the integrity of the housekeeping staff is in question, thatâs where I draw the line.  Stayed here last week 10/31 - 11/2. Wife and I.  Things were great.  Great hotel, great dining options, great views, very inviting.  On our last day, my wife accidentally left her $250 Gucci earrings on the night stand while getting ready to checkout.  She simply forgot to put them on before leaving the room.  When we arrived to our new hotel (in Culver City), she realized she didnât have them on.  We called the hotel immediately and was told to file claim via email.  Person from Loss Prevention said that nothing was turned in and sometimes, lost items donât get turned in right away and to check back a few days later.  As a long time Hilton;1

Close to worst hotel I have stayed at. Firstly we had to wait for our rooms to be ready, the pool had been closed for weeks prior to our arrival even though when we booked we ensured that the pool was available. The air conditioner in our room was emitting a damp mist that we reported to the front desk which we were told that maintenance would have a look at it. After 2 days nothing had been done, we reported it again but still nothing was done. Our room was not serviced for two days, no fresh towels. On the third day I asked to speak to the manager and while waiting to speak to her there were 3 other people complaining about one thing or another. The manager changed rooms for us but when we tried to turn the a/c on this one didn't work at all. So we changed rooms again and we;1
Worst Experience EVER! They ruined our Honeymoon!  Reservation was done via Booking.com (with a good offer/price) over 1 Month ago. Upon arriving at the Hotel they told us that the price given by Booking.com is not acceptable by them! They insisted that it was a systematical error by Booking.com and the Hotel but they told me that I SHOULD SOLVE this issue with Booking.com!!! Booking.com apologized and only did cancellation free of charge â¦ After that we had to find a new hotel -last minute-. The cherry on top is that they increased the prices nearly to a double-price and after 2 days they made a special offer via Booking.com.  Be alerted and DONâT make your reservations in this Hotel.  - Rude staff - Staff that could hardly speak English - Non-Professional;1

I read all the reviews for this hotel on Trip Advisor and considering the price of the room ($79 per night + tax) I though even worse case scenario its going to be livable! Right? WRONG!  First night = no sleep and then had to move rooms at 3am because the noise from the bar was so loud, I was on the 3rd floor. Moved to the 6th floor - no elevator (which I knew about in advance). I was told that the club closed at 4am so the noise wouldn't be a problem after that.... fantastic. So the noise is only until 4am.... they should have said earlier and I would have waited to go to sleep!!!   So then I moved rooms, the room was what I expected, however the bed was way too small... the bed in the first room was ok but the second room it was literally about 2ft wide and about 5ft long!;1

Having read many poor reviews about Astor on the park,it definately lived up to it's bad reputation!. When we arrived we were checked into a room on the 5th floor and the one elevator they had was'nt working.We were'nt offered any help with our luggage at all.When we got to our room we opened the door to discover that somebody else was already staying in it.My husband went back down to the reception area only to be told that the person that had allocated us the room was on their break and until they came back there was nothing that could be done.After waiting half an hour my husband re-appeared with a key for another room, i have to say i was so relieved as we'd been travelling for 8 hours. Sadly it was short lived when we entered the room it was clearly filthy with urnine all;1
This was possibly the worst Hilton experience Iâve ever had.  I arrived a little after 4:00, and used the electronic check in, it assigned a room but when I got up to the room while waiting for the e-key the maid was still cleaning it.  I couldnât put my bags in the room and had to have a bellman help me haul them all back downstairs to be stored for 20 minutes.  When I did get to check in we opted for a standard plastic key.  When we got into our room we saw that we had an adjoining room with a common door, the neighbors had about 4 kids and besides every regular conversation they had we could of course hear screaming kids all the time.  I purposefully chose an âexecutiveâ floor room to be away from loud children, not because of the view which I couldnât care less about.  Stop;1
We were very disappointed with the hotel. Our room had damp in so we had to ask to switch rooms, in the new room we weren't provided with a hairdryer. Walls are very thin so you can hear people in the rooms next to you. Poor cleanliness overall. Extremely disappointed that we had to pay extra for wifi every day! Would not recommend.;1
Complete and total disrespect.  If you want pay 200 a night to be treated like a red headed stepchild come here.  I called the day before to ask about parking prices. They said 17 self park 45 valet.  I arrived and the valets acted like snobby millionaires.   Not 45$ valets.   Forced me to valet for 45$ self park doesnât exist.   Check in clerk rude.   Noise kept me up all night.   No bathtub.   Dirty room smelled like smoke.  Absolute nightmare.;1

Went to check in with a young lady, she gave me ground level which I don't feel safe so she did move me to 3rd floor. Told her I had a service animal she talked to a gentleman he said dog must be Ada certified which is against the law. Service animals do not have to be certified according to the Americans with disability act. He was very rude to me even threatening in front of other guests, It was humiliating. I paid the $100 pet fee and felt uncomfortable staying there after that. They  say pet friendly but no green space for animals to go to o bathroom. Bathroom had small ants everywhere upon check in but not comfortable telling front desk. I had a car and location is close to Griffith park.

I have been coming to this charming NYC hotel in a neighborhood I love for many years, sometimes twice a year. I have come alone, with my husband, with my mother, and with friends. Unfortunately, I have noticed that the cleanliness of the hotel and the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff has declined over the years. On this current solo trip, I was able to check in slightly early after a long day of travel and asked the desk attendant for a room near the shared bathroom like I usually do when I travel solo. After spending a few minutes searching for a room, the desk attendant placed me on the 3rd floor in a room which was about as far away from the bathroom as you could get and smelled of foul body odor. Also, the 3rd floor hallway smells like cigarettes. It's really;1
Very bad experience in this hotel... When we made the reservation, we could not select a single room because of the crib so we reserved a double room, we asked for a nice room for our wedding travel and a crib on the reservation. When we arrived at 4 am after 12 hours trip we had a single room ?!! whithout crib on the 8th floor (818) (there are 40 floors...) we waited for almost 1 hour for the crib with a baby really tired. The second day, we asked for an other double room as we reserved, we had it (2523 25th floor) but whithout the crib, we waited again more than an hour to have it at 11 pm. I had to call 4 times...  Furthermore, for the wedding day I asked 3 times on 2 days some stuffs for my hairdresser, every time they told me they will bring everything in the room, I never;1

The following most horrible experience left me speechless and I still cannot believe that this Woogo scam continues almost 2 days after weâve checked out and decided to never come back.  We not only lost the reserved place upon arrival at the property, but also lost time and money risking to be left on the street in NY late at night. In addition, the credit card statement confirmed more than one unauthorized charges from Woogo.  I reserved a One Bedroom apartment at their Central Park property at 240 West 73rd St, New York, NY and arrived there at 2 p.m. The front desk lady pulled up the reservation and told us that we could not check in till 3 pm. The reservation confirmation email stated that the check-in times are between 2 and 3 p.m. She allowed our group to keep the luggage;1
On a multi-family trip to NYC I booked 3 rooms at this hotel through Expedia and then cancelled when one of the other families found a better deal. Expedia cancelled the room and I was given a cancellation number and thought everything was fine. The hotel proceeded to bill my credit card for the 3 rooms and it has taken 5 months (!) and we still cannot get them to refund my credit card. No one is ever there when Expedia calls to rectify this (no matter the time of day). Expedia also has given me the runaround blaming the hotel when they, Expedia, did the cancellation and provided me a cancellation number. Unless you enjoy hundreds of dollars $$$ in interest charges while you wait for a refund..... do not book here. Forget about Expedia --terrible public relations and customer;1
I travel often and never have I been so dissapointed in the service I've received. If it were possible let to give this place a 0 rating that's what it would get.   To start in day one we had ants in our room. They were in out clothes, our electronics, Be sheets and bathroom. EVERYWHERE. We complained, then transfered to another room. The following night we had Cicero aches in the room!!   We had called the front desk and they had someone come and remove it. At which time we were fed up and have decided to speak to management (CFDR Accountant) who told us that she won't give us a refund or compensation of any sort. Later that night we were also told that we were lying about the bugs.   The following day we slept in the car as the hotel was so nasty!! We went to talk to the;1
"Where do I start?  Hollywood Hotel has no ""Hollywood"" glam in it whatsoever. You have to pay for parking if you want to park in the hotel lot, tip: if you HAVE to stay here, park around the corner..its free!  The bed smelled terrible, like they'd been slept in and not washed. Weird uncomfortable shaped pillows, I was itchy and we both had rashes on us in the morning, which meant there were probably bed bugs.  The air conditioner sounded like a freight train and couldnt be used from the noise it made.  The hot water was lukewarm to cold, was told to leave it on for 5 mins according to ""maintenance""- If someone complains, you get someone to come up and look into it!  The microwave was unclean and we had to clean it in the sink.  The worst part to me was we put ""Do not Disturb"" on";1
First of all I will mention that the only good thing about this hotel is the bell boys. They went above and beyond to help.    The staff at front desks are absolutely dreadful. No help at all. The elevators are all knackered, three times we got locked in them, we started taking the stairs to the room which was on the 10th floor. The stairs were shocking as you can see from one of my pictures there was loose mains wires hanging out the wall !! If a child was to even go near the stairs it could have been dangerous.   The room ... the room was an absolute disgrace as you can see from the pictures it was filthy, every day something new would go missing from our room small items like a pair of gloves then it was a pair of trousers.  When we checked into the room there was an old pair;1
By all means, stay away from this place. It was advertised as a three star hotel which it is not. It might be a one star at best. The rooms do not look like the pics that the hotel ads convey. The rooms are FILTHY. The hotel is in a wonderful area of town but unfortunatley the location is going to waste. The doorman refused to assist getting our bags from taxi, the desk attendant was rude beyond belief, and we found a homeless person sleeping in the snack room. There was also drug activity going on as well. Toliet kept backing up but we were very afraid to ask for help. Considered staying out all night rather than sleeping there. If you have children with you, by all means stay away from this place. I am an avid traveler who has stayed many places including hostels. I am not;1

During this pandemic, I had to go to new york and I decided to stay at the new yorker hotel. Everything it's very disturbing with the pandemic situation that the last thing that you need is that the employees of the hotel treat you badly.  I got the worst experience ever with a lady working at night time as a security and taking your temperature every time that you go in and out of the hotel. very annoying. she wasn't nice or kind. she treated me badly, she was very mean. There is another guy that works at night, Asian. He wasn't professional at all. Neither of them was.  they shouldn't treat clients badly.  I won't ever come back and I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. plus, in these pandemic times.;1

I purchased 4 rooms for two nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York on Priceline.  When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day.  I inquired what this was for and explained I was not notified of this additional fee when booking.  The desk clerk informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made in the rooms.  I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room.  Didnât matter fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked just in case I missed it and they did not note fee in Express Deals.    But, if I booked it under the list view they did note the fee and charged you for it.   Because I booked it under express deals I;1

We stayed here for the weekend with our family. I know when we booked it months ago and the rate was fairly cheap for December in NYC that it would not be great but I was even more disappointed than I was expecting.  The rooms were small and dirty.  The bathroom was not clean, rust in the tub and dirty. Our toilet got clogged the 2nd night and took an hour to get someone up to fix it.  On the last day we had a charge to the restaurant downstairs that  was not ours.  We got the run around trying to get it reimbursed.  The hotel management would not take responsibility for it and told us to find the managers of the restaurant and they did not help us.

This is a very expensive hotel....and it's not worth half the prices they charge!!  The A/C didn't work in rooms....food is tremendously expensive....and the attitudes of the staff make you feel like they're doing you a favor by letting you stay there.  Whatever the problem, they make it the fault or responsibility if the customer.  Not good at all!!!;1
Frankly Iâd never set foot inside this building again. The rooms are tired, tatty, small and dingy. Nothing like the website shows. I could accept this had I not been treated so badly by the front desk manager call Del. I havenât in a very long time, been treated with such a lack of dignity and respect, by someone in a management position who should know better. Honestly Iâd say heâs not fit to sweep the floors of the building. Thanks for ruining my day.;1
I was so grossed out by this hotel that I refused to stay there. As soon as I walked in it was dirty and smelled of marijuana. I continued to check in with hopes the room would be ok. As soon as I entered the room the beds looked dirty with blood stains on one of the covers. I went to wash my hands and didnât even use the towels as I was nervous if catching something. My aunt and I decided not to stay and left the hotel. After contacting Travelocity they called the hotel to get me a refund but the hotel said they wouldnât refund 1 day of it because they offered me another room, which they didnât. Before you stay in this hotel READ ALL THE BAD REVIEWS!;1

Dear Friends, Please avoid as much as you can. The worst place to stay unless the price with tax is less than $70. It's more like a Motel rather than a hotel. The front desk does not pickup calls no matter what time/how many times you call. If the operator picks up, pretends like transferring but hangs up. I saw this first hand when I was waiting to check-in and the phone was ringing and no one at the front desk. I arrived late, tired after my travel but no one was there at the front desk. No bell to call them either, so I had to wait around standing for a long time. The front desk person was very unfriendly. The room key didn't work the first time and I had to come back down. It was tiny, clean but extremely old and not like the pictures shown. Narrow, corridors. The wallpaper;1

Room very small -- had to move sideways to get around king size bed.  Shower did not work and despite calls for service - not even an answer!  Closet too short -- Blazer jacket would not hang (bottom folded onto a lower shelf).  Besides shower problem, bathroom design lacking (sink bottom flat and so doesn't drain).  Staff does not seem to care - even though was paying a full, non-discounted rate.  Will not stay there again;1
We were supposed to stay here. Called 2 weeks in advance, gave credit card # over the phone, got confirmation #, but when we showed up (our plane was late and we arrived late at night) they had no listing or rooms for us. I understand that it was a busy week but someone who answered the phone 2 weeks earlier messed up and my credit card number and name are floating around their office on some random peice of scratch paper. The night clerk did call some other places which was helpful. Just be sure to get the name of the person you spoke with if you call them directly and then call back before your trip to make sure they still have your reservation. It looked like a great area though and had easy bus access to LaGuardia Airport.;1
Please be warned: the Jane is in in the process of converting from a NYC rooming house into a hotel.  While I was there, all of my fellow residents were actual residents.  Late night coming and going, folks hanging out in the hall, as well as personal possessions.  Had to walk around guys on ladders, guys carrying bags of trash, plaster, etc.  Elevator out of order.  Restaurant on the first floor not in existence yet, still under construction.  When this is all done, it'll look great and will be a cheap alternative for folks who don't mind sharing a bathroom with the whole floor but right now, not ready, still a rooming house.  Rooms are truly tiny tiny but that was expected (barely bigger than the bed).  I was surprised that its marketed as a hotel at the present.;1
We have traveled from Arizona to Hollywood many times.    EACH time we make a point to go to the Hilton Universal for Sunday brunch, for several reasons - among them are:  1.  The dining room staff and the service are SUPERB!   The dining room manager, Lenore Mather, is always so very welcoming to us, even though we only get to see her a few times a year she always remembers us and knows where we like to sit in the dining room.  2.  The food is consistently high quality and delicious.   The last time we were there the chef at the carving station came into the dining room to find my son, to tell him that a new prime rib had arrived - as he knew my son particularly loves the end-cut. 3.  We also appreciate Amanda, a fine waitress in the lobby bar - who also is very welcoming and;1
First off the hotel was in an amazing location for the price that we paid. It has a beautiful lobby and the doormen are very friendly and helpful. That's all of the nice things I have to say about the stay. Upon checking in at 7pm on a Wednesday there were 4 staff members at the front desk, not including the concierge. We stood there as they peaked up at us, but no one could check us in. The concierge was kind enough to at least acknowledge us and let us know someone would be with us shortly. Finally we were helped and checked in. We left for dinner and returned around 10pm ready for a good night of rest. Around midnight we were woken up by a woman screaming down the hallway for someone to help and that the guy following her was on drugs and trying to hurt her. We called the;1

We stayed from 1 Jan to 2 Jan 2020.  NEVER EVER book this hotel. It is FULL of additional charges. The staff members and managers are rude and condescending. The customer service is terrible.  First, they hit you with a $60 AUD amenity fee for the gym and pool. Erica, the manager on duty, simply did not care if you don't use these amenities and will not waive the $60.  Secondly, this nasty hotel will you charge you $7.50 AUD per day to store each bag, if your room is not ready for check-in.  Thirdly, this greedy hotel will charge you $5.00 AUD for a 300ml bottle of water. Don't touch it, go down stairs to Walgreens and get the same bottle for $1 AUD.  Finally, this stinky hotel has not changed nor steam cleaned the carpet since it was open in the 1930s. The stench of the carpet;1

Had requested early check-in 4 months in advance. Didn't get in even 1 minute early.  Worst hotel I've ever stayed at - w/ exception of 1 hellhole in Antigua, which I immediately walked out of. Didn't have that option on this trip.  I've stayed at better places in 3rd world countries.  Shame on you, Days Inn.  As a solo traveler, I don't require any luxuries, but this place did not have the most basic amenities, you know, like a useable bathtub, and a room phone which works in case of emergencies.

I would not recommend this hotel! Though the location is good, itâs above a late night Cannabis shop. The room was tiny - there wasnât even enough room to open my suitcase on the floor. The room was freezing cold and I had to wear several layers in order to sleep. The bed was also very small. The âwardrobeâ comprised a few hooks and a single hanger. It could also do with some fresh paint. The bathroom was very cramped with a shower that wasnât overly clean and you had to wait a long time to get hot water. All you can hear from the room is loud traffic and car horns. The staff were not friendly nor helpful and were chatting to a friend on the phone while checking me in. There isnât a lift (which to be fair, they do note this in their description) but lugging a suitcase up several;1
I'm disappointed to say this was one of the worst hotel experiences I've had. I stayed here in March 2012 for 4 nights on my first visit to NYC with two friends. First impression was great - the hotel was cute and check in was quick and efficient, with friendly service. Concierge told us we were staying on the 11th floor which sounds like a good thing in NYC for views etc, but unfortunately they failed to mention that the 12th floor was a nightclub that banged on until 4am. Not ideal when you are a bit jet-lagged on night one. Still not ideal on night two when you think 'can't beat them join them' but the club is full of trash-bags. At 4am, we called the front desk and arranged to move our rooms the next day. We then had to pack all our stuff up (mid-trip) to have it moved to;1
The taxi driver had a look of pity on his face when i said i wanted to go here.  Arrived early in the evening to find receptionist arguing with a guest about a fax he didn't receive.  Not a good first impression!  Checked in fine and was told had a complementary upgrade to a Queen X room, thought things were looking up, got up to my room (which took forever, slowest lift in the world) was freezing cold and had a disgusting smell! I had to sleep with a t-shirt over my nose it was that bad.  Jumped on my bed only to find it had been made of bricks!  Very very uncomfortable. Carpets were foul, paint coming off walls, there was a leak on the landing by the lift where bits of plaster were coming off, told the receptionist she didn't seem at all surprised or bothered.  The drinks;1
This hotel is centrally located which is an advantage and  the owners know it. This is probably why they do not  bother about complaints. The room and the bathroom were large enough but with no comfort at all. 4 nails directly in the wall  were the only supposed means to keep clothes. The hotel was not able or did not want to provide coat hangers. There was not even  basic furniture as in proper hotels. The room, on the gound floor, was very poorly soundproofed with a public wifi station on the sidewalk outside the window used to listen to music all night long. The price ( more than $1,000 for 3 nights) is totally unjustifiable even in Manhattan. Is it useful to add that we would never recommend such a place to our worst enemy?;1
SERIOUSLY!!! The worst experience ever. I extremely recommend guests to never EVER book this hotel. I have checked out on Aug 21st and as of today September 10th I never got my deposit refund at all. It's impossible to call the hotel because no one EVER answers and Secondly I had to do an international call almost everyday from my end just to get in touch with Wyndham. When a guest arrives they want immediate payment for everything and when you checkout they'll charge you for whatever you did immediately and when you want your basic right i.e. Deposit refund back to your depit or credit card you'll never get that and you'll be sending tons of emails to the manager (which I got from the hotline number that I had search through google) and I'm only getting useless apologies.

We booked this hotel as a base for our holiday in New York. Upon arriving, we were checked in and asked to sign for hidden charges that we had not been told about - this included a $25 a DAY charge to use the services in the hotel. When questioned about this a rude receptionist told us that it would allow us to use the hotel's FREE internet, as well as the fitness studio (which we had no interest in using), the business suite (we were there for a holiday) and a poorly put together exhibition. After much debate, this charge was removed from the bill.  Upon entering the room, we found it to be average in terms of furnishing however, there was no kettle, mini bar or additional facilities in the room. The sheet on one of the beds was also torn and when we moved a seat forward it was;1

My review has little to do with the hotel itself - my friend and I passed through NYC for a day and stayed here, and the experience itself was wonderful. Quirky, charming, etc.  However, when I looked at my card this morning, I saw that I'd been charged $65 extra for the room my friend and I stayed in. When I called the Jane to ask why, I spoke to a flippant, rude employee who gave me a half-assed explanation that had something to do with taxes and deposits and possibly getting some of the money back. I told him (in a clear, reasonable tone, not an angry one) that I found that practice misleading, since the email I received said that the total rate I'd pay would be $135, and he proceeded to belittle me until I cried: raising his voice, interrupting me, and saying that there was;1
Expensive, unpolite staff and the rooms... bad, old, extremely small and very noisy. We complained about the noise but no one did anything about it. Stay at another place when in NYC. Not even space for a mid-sized luggage.;1
"The only positive thing during the stay was that the room was clean, the fridge we had in our room worked and it was near Hammersmith station. Everything else were so bad. The guys at the counter were extremely rude, they didn't greet us when we arrived and looked upset like we interrupted their conversation or something. Our room were on the bottom floor and the window we had were located in their ""indoor garden"" so we could hear the staff talk.

I have never seen such a difference between a internet photo /review and the actual hotel.I am from the travel Industry and have travelled for 20 years to over 44 countries. Fortunately i only needed to selep and was busy the 2 days i was there. Rude staff.Totally lonley hotel. Even water vending machine was not working. The design of this building maybe First world war time!! and if you have luggage the multitude of doors and floors will tire you. The carpet was definately during Teddy Roosevelts time. South Asians ( i am one)  who run motels in western countries must learn from Asia the art of service with a smile.It costs nothing. I have seen worse in India but for $ 240 for 2 nights even if it is NYC they can do much better!;1
The staff here are helpful and housekeeping is good thanks again to the staff BUT this hotel is really expensive even by Manhattan terms ($380!/night) and the rooms are tired and need of basic repainting.  Linens are basic. Room sizes are unusually small (you cannot extend your arms in the bathrooms without touching either walls as the bathrooms are SO tiny. Hotel-supplied toiletries are basic. I expected more luxury in my stay given the nightly rate.  a standard coffee pod is $2.50 in the room and there is no complimentary water...just a weirdly basic hotel experience at a luxe price. The owners are lucky to have such capable staff...it would be great if more of the profits could remain in the hotel redirected to guest room quality. The main draw is proximity to Lincoln centre,;1
My husband and I recently stayed at The Jane hotel for one night as we traveled to Boston via NYC. The night we spent there was average, the rooms are tiny, but seemed clean, the building is amazing. Hind site is 20/20. As we were packing up to leave I had noticed several tiny blood spots on my sheets, didn't really give it much thought assuming I had cut my arm before heading to bed. Now I know that this is a tale tell sign of a bed bug infestation and the reason I know is because we carried these awful creatures home with us from the hotel. As I did more research I found that The Jane has had issues for over a year and is on the Bed Bug Registry with several complaints one dating within days of when my husband and I were there. I was totally grossed out and completely appalled;1

Room looked nice, trendy and had good decor. Staff were pleasant and efficient.  It was hard to sleep due to a continuous humming noise from outside which sounded like a large mine truck was parked right by the window (despite being on the 8th floor). I would have asked to move to another part of the hotel, but it only came to light late in the evening when I turned off the A/C which I thought was the source of the noise, but it wasn't.;1
The poor service from this hotel actually began a few weeks before. An email I sent asking for some Amtrak advice went unanswered - no big deal.  But on arrival things quickly went downhill. The first room we were allocated was a tiny corner room where both aspects managed to look onto brick walls. The WC was defective (flushed constantly) so we asked for another room. This was even smaller and again the only window looked directly against a brick wall. Staff finally agreed to a room on an upper floor (36th) which was acceptable but why was this not allocated first? Could it be that room allocations are prejudiced against those who book through travel companies?   However :- - the AC was noisy so we turned it off at night. During the first night we both woke up cold and there;1

We have just returned from a visit to New York and stayed at the Yourstay apartments on West 73rd street, what a disappointment! The apartment stank of cigarette smoke although we were non-smokers. The bed settee was dirty, toilet did not flush and air con in lounge did not work. The staff were unhelpful and at one point down right rude although the maintenance staff were quick to respond to the toilet problem which in the end my husband fixed himself! We were travelling with our 3 children so as a party of five the apartments seemed a good idea so we could be altogether rather than book 2 to 3 hotel rooms, the children hated it and could not wait to leave. We would say unless you want cheap and don't mind the conditions give these apartments a miss.;1
Booked a King bed deluxe room with my partner, we were given 2 separate beds, we were not told about it - with a 10h flight and arrival at midnight it was a very bad surprise. We were promised the room we booked next day and told to pack and store our bags until the room was ready, when we were back to check in to our new room we were told it was not available and that we had to go back to our old room. Terrible experience, over rated over priced terrible hotel. Fortunately we were able to find a much better replacement nearby.;1
One or both of our daughters have lived in Manhattan since 2005.  We have stayed in various hotels there dozens of times. On this occasion our flight to New York was late and we did not arrive until well after midnight. It was Fashion Week and difficult to find a hotel, it was a late-planned trip after we found out our 4 year old granddaughter was asked to be in a runway show.  We had reservations at the Days Inn at 94th and Broadway at roughly $300 per night for 5 nights.  The noticeably indifferent hotel clerk assigned us to Room 214.  We were stunned at how bad the room was.  Carpet - Stained and worn.  Furniture - so beat up an dirty it would have been embarrassing to give away. Wallpaper - stained and peeling off walls. Shower tub - stained and dirty.  Lights - most had no;1

I booked one queen room via Priceline, but the room turned out to be a single room with only one queen bed. WHAT??? I double-checked my itinerary... Oh, yes, the wording there cannot be more tricky. So if you want to stay here, DO Pay more attention to what exactly room you are looking for. I asked whether it was possible to upgrade. Yes, of course, but with additional $57 upgrade fees... @_@ Moreover, $20 + tax for parking? I've never been to a hotel that charges for parking here in LA before...

Few bathroom amenities, no washcloths, raggy face towels - we will not stay ever again.No wake-up call because phone was out, not fixed until during the 2nd stay, when another wakeup was asked. requested.The place is dirty, ice machines on only 2 floors.;1
The lobby is nice step into the lift and you are transported to another world. Room was very small still containing 1920 furnishings  Toilet blocked and flooded the bathroom. Moped up the mess with towels and reported it to the cleaning staff on the floor who delivered fresh towels but didnt remove the filthy ones. We were out for four hours and still maintenance or proper cleaning wasn't carried out!!! You can hear all the neighbouring rooms ...noise is an issue;1

I booked this hotel in january and had an e-mail confirmation from them. My partner phoned them the day before we were due to travel just to make sure all was well and they had no record of the booking at all. Further to that the attitude of the person on the phone was pretty rude. She instructed us to e-mail the manager (apparently the only way to contact him) and he would e-mail us back within 5 minutes, it's a week later and i'm still waiting. Got another hotel (city park) that was only $30 a night more and was great and in a much better location;1

Not a relaxing hotel. Everything felt very sterile and over the top modern. The rooms were not comfortable and the furniture was beat.

The elevator doesn't work most of the days. One of my friends actually got stuck in it for 20 minutes when it broke down. The carpet looks like it has never been cleaned and the air conditioning makes an extremely loud sound. The service is terrible, I asked for someone to send up ice and I never got any ice. The door to my balcony doesn't lock which is a safety issue as well. There is only one key per room which is a hassle when more than one person is staying in a room. There are also a lot of empty hotel rooms that are used for storage but the doors are always open and you can see a bunch of mattresses laying around. The doorman also never opens the door. Please don't stay here.;1
"Worst. Hotel. Ever. And I've stayed in some dumps in my uni years... The lobby was covered in building material, the staff were rude and unhelpful.

Stayed here during my daughter's graduation from Columbia University.  Rooms were disgusting. Had front desk change our first room because AC didnât work, tub badly stained, holes in carpet and wallpaper falling off walls. Second room a little better but still issues. Lamp missing bulbs, old TV with terrible reception and hole in bathroom wall.  Windows only had cheap miniblinds so the rooms were not very dark so it was difficult to sleep.  Also very difficult to find rooms.  Hallways set up as maze and very little markings. The rooms were very pricey.  I've stayed in NYC multiple times and this was the most disappointing hotel I've ever stayed at.

We went to the quality inn during august 2003. It was extrememly humid and hot and their air conditioning was broken. Elevators are so small that my closet in my hotel room was bigger. We had requested 1 bed, they gave us two. Room is EXTREMELY small, we barely had room to walk.  It was difficult to get tv channels, bathroom leaked, hotel staff rude and discourteous.

Absolute nightmare with this hotel with the communication side. I originally booked this hotel in may 2020, had to cancel due to covid as we where not allowed to fly from the uk. They would not give me a refund and was offered a voucher which i had to accept. spoke to nice lady called Neida who said let me know when you want to rebook. I emailed Neida and let her know that we want to stay December 2022 and gave the dates for when we will arrive. I was given the price as was told that i was pencilled in. Several emails later and several phone calls with no reply as i keep getting fobbed off by the phone saying send a email. I have done this several times with no joy. The customer service is very poor on this occasion. Still do not know whether we will be staying at this hotel as;1

My mother who is Diamond member booked my husband and baby and I here for the weekend trying to do something nice. She confirmed multiple times including last night that we had the NY View Queen Suite. It even showed up online last night that was the room we were confirmed in. Unfortunately we got here and the reservation was changed to a double room. The management were rude and condescending kept telling me they were taking care of things. I am still waiting on Stephen the Concierge Manager to finish taking care of the things we were promised.   we did finally get the fridge it we were promised it only took numerous calls.  And after those calls They did replace the spoiled milk. Barry the operations manager told me he had no intention of trying at all to solve the issue.;1

The carpet also felt dirty. - Cold showers for probably 10 of the 15 days that I was there. Didn't matter what time of the day I showered (before 7 am, after 9 am, 10 pm) - all of them";1
Abercorn House Hostel has the potential to be good value for money and has a great location in terms of the underground and in Greater London.  I stayed twice at this Hostel: in 2015 and in July 2016.  The place is rising in one direction: in noise and grotty rooms!  We paid 52 pounds sterling for a double room with private bathroom, so it wasn't cheap.  Imagine our horror when we find the bed sheets appeared to have been used before our stay: hairs all over the sheets and a wet patch that smelled of urine.  The common areas like TV room are kept relatively clean.  Being opposite the TV room and common bathroom and some meters away from the firedoor meant slamming and creaking noises for most of the night.  Every time these doors opened and closed our room door rattled;1
Unfortunately I am left with no choice but to leave a poor review. The customer service at this hotel is nothing short of shocking. Please be wary of paying residents tax in cash. Theyâll take it again from the registered credit card claiming it was never paid- someone pocketing cash??   Obviously you have returned home so then spend months trying to sort with them ignoring your emails/ correspondence and leaving you out of pocket.   Claimed passed issue back to booking agent- but agent unaware and chasing continues again.  Disgusting behaviour from what should be a reputable hotel.  Very unhappy as tarnished what would have been a great trip.;1
$100 worth of new clothing stolen from my room when do no disturb sign was on door, but housekeeping continued to go in on most days, unfriendly staff who did not do anything about the theft as well as not addressing the issue of bedbugs at this hotel.

Planned a overnight get a way trip into NYC to see a couple of Broadway plays - we got to the  New Yorker no reservations on file. I had my confirmation having gone through TripAdvisor to book my room, and to my regret prepaid for my room thinking I was safe with the TripAdvisor affiliation. TripAdvisor takes no accountability in problem resolution for companies they partner with, so  I called Cancelon customer service was told they were working on it and would get back to me shortly. Well 2 1/2 hours later no response, called again and told it would be resolved in 15-20 minutes.

This was honestly the worst Hotel Ever!!!  The only words to descirbe the staff are mean and hateful!!!   I can't even go into all of the many things they did that were appalling...  When I asked to speak to a manager, the receptionist turned around walked to an ajoining room, picked up the phone, and called her boyfriend.....  Needless to say, she had a 30 min. personal conversation!!!  I could not believe this was happening!!!!  Not to mention, there was another hotel guest there asking for a space heater, because the heat had gone out in his room.... and they kept giving him the run around.   I felt so sorry for him!!!  These people were freezing, and they could care less!!!  I have never stayed in a hotel like this...  It is SO BAD, that it seems like it is a practical joke;1
Iâve been waiting a while to write about this place, working out how to write this without becoming absolutely infuriated. This place is an absolute joke, actually, I lie, itâs worse than that.  Travelled from New York to Los Angeles, arriving at approximately 11:30pm, after trying hard to find their hotel shuttle which is a story for another day. Arrived, walked up to the counter, gave them my name and typical details, only to be told that our booking had been cancelled hours earlier. Shocked and absolutely furious, I ask how was I not informed. They claimed that as I had booked it through Hotels.com, they had no access to my private information including my phone number. Where the lying begins is when they tell me that my booking was cancelled due to my card being invalid.;1
After reviewing the Empire Hotel for a long -anticipated pleasure trip in New York, upon check-in we could see that building itself was old. Still, the lobby looks comfortable though dated.  The room I had reserved for the two of us was not at all like the same type pictured on the hotel site. It was dark, small, had no dressers and a bathroom no bigger than a telephone booth. What made matters worse, we soon saw that the room was not fully cleaned, with debris still on the old carpeting and the decorative bed pillows stained.  After we found no coffee maker in the room, we inquired at the desk if we might have one and weâre told that most rooms in this highly-rated (and expensive) hotel no longer had free coffee or tea availableâeven though itâs depicted in their site.

I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE if it was just about the service.   The staff was professional to a tee, and really went above and beyond the call of duty.  HOWEVER, the problem with this hotel is not the people, it is the absolutely ATROCIOUS standards of upkeep with the essentials of maintanence.   During my weeklong stay, I would say there were at least 4 (FOUR!!) during which the elevators did not work properly.   There were two days where the elevators did not seem to work at all.    No amount of smiling or free breakfast vouchers can make up for the fact that I was late to important consultations with by business partners.  It reflected poorly on myself and my reputation in my professional life.    I was offered 50% off of my room rate for the last two nights of my;1
First we arrived there early in the morning and the man at the front desk told us we could check in early since they were slow (that should have been our 1st clue) for FREE.  Their elevators were out for repairs so we had to carry our bags up the stairs and one of the men that worked there actually broke my collegue's bag. Then we get into our room the bunk bed room, which we knew was small but it was just too tiny for 2 people, but the worst part was the smell that was in the hotel, it was just unbearable and hard to describe.  Due to the small room and the fact that we were going to be there for a week we decided to upgrade to the Captain's Cabin, which still was smaller than a normal size hotel room.  To be honest, to some this hotel was probably ok for them, for us it;1
"Extremely over represented on its website. Location very poor, you wont step out at night for a bar or restaurant, and while we were there there was no bar or restaurant in the hotel.

The rooms are very basic, the shower cubicle is prison like ( no bath ). No safe, and only a mickey miuse latch to secure the patio door Despite paying for a week , We spent three nights in other hotels close to what we were doing on certain days to get a holiday feel. We made the best of our holiday as we always do, but would recommend you give this";1
Great location, WORST service ever. We had 2 8 year old daughters with us and neighbors that were partying until 3am. When we called the front desk, they sent security up the third time. They were still loud. I got dressed and walked downstairs to explain they needed to move the guests and all 4 employees were standing around talking about my last call to complain and LAUGHING about it. I explained I was a Hilton Diamond Member and that they could expect a conversation between me and the GM and the night manager became completely defensive and belligerent. I suggest a course in customer service. Worst lack of hospitality ever!;1
Iâm a Hyatt Globalist member who requested early check-in and used a suite upgrade which was confirmed by the front desk a week before my stay.  My wife and I arrived in the morning after a long overnight international flight to find that our suite was not available despite the confirmation and the upgrade being removed from my account.  We were told that a suite would not be available until 4pm, which was useless to us.  We were told we would be given a king room so we could get in right away.  This room turned out to be a queen room.  In short, a total fail!  Not how anyone, let alone a Globalist, should be treated by a Hyatt property.  And to think I used 12,000 points for this âexperienceâ.  Never again, which is a shame, because the hotel is convenient to LAX.;1
I paid $650 / night for this suite and it was disgusting. The room was dirty, the bathroom was filthy (crap in the shower), no coffee maker, and there was no control over the temperature in the room. I couldn't get out of there fast enough.;1

We booked our stay a week in advance and when we arrived to the hotel they said that our room was taken and the hotel was overbooked. They also did this to the man i front of us. Then they had us walk a few blocks down to a different hotel that wasnât as nice and made us stay there. Also the hotel they made us walk to had a cheaper rate and the Ameritania is refusing to give a partial discount for the price difference. I will never book at this hotel again. Stayed in over 100 hotels in my life and this has never once happened to me.;1

"If you value your life, stay away. This is the WORST. The hotel only has 2 tiny elevators. You ride up and down after long waits with hotel trash. Two larger elevators are inoperable - the staff says they're being repaired. They have been inoperable for longer than the elevator in The Big Bang Theory. The Internet has been largely inoperable for years. When you ask about it, you're told ""it's being fixed right now"". It's also been broken for years. The cable has fewer channels than we had in the 50's. When you ask about it, you're told it's being repaired. For years.

Turned up at this hotel in early December 2014 for a two night stay but immediately checked out once we saw the room!! (Looked at another room too). The hotel is very tired, the rooms are dirty with lots of damage to furniture and bathroom fittings. The lobby, entrance, stairs and elevator were filthy and very very tired too.

BEWARE OF BEDBUGS AND ABSOLUTE FILTH!  This is the NiGHTMARE of ALL hotels and you will have them for months after staying here. I am not particularly fussy. I have stayed in hostels and low budget hotels in New York but Hotel Riverside Studios is simply the worst slum hotel I have ever stayed in. (I had no idea that it was a hotel for residents, God help them). Neither human beings nor animals should live in such filth and dirt. I changed rooms 4 times during my 5-day stay. I saw bed bugs on the walls, changed rooms once again, only to find a couple of bugs in one of my books one day later. I switched rooms again and checked out 1 day early. The hallways are filled with decades of dirt and filth, vomit and cigarette butts. The hallways smelled of cigarettes and urine. If that;1
Here to get some peace of mind after staying with a friend. Unfortunately what they don't tell you beyond whatever rate that you got online, is that it's under construction. So what that means at any moment you will hear noise. So I check in at 5 PM to take a quick little nap I find that I am awoken within 10 minutes because there is drilling going on. I then calling their kind enough to move me to another floor which I really appreciate right away. But of course a few hours later I find some noise going on and I open my door to find a thorough cleaning in the evening around 730 or 8 PM. This is not normal housekeeping time. Anyway, I then go downstairs to let them know what is going on and the person that was cleaning was nice enough to stop however why would this be happening?;1
Location good if you want to catch a bus to Hollywood, Santa Monica or Universal Studios. Room needs make-over carpet old and stained as is the bedspread.  Request room over looking the dingy little pool, its not quite as noisy.   Apart from friendly information given by the nice gay couples walking outside our hotel, we wouldn't have known where to eat or get to places as the hotel staff were mainly rude and too busy.;1
When I first arrived, I was greeted by a young doorman who talked for the next five minutes about how tired he was and that no one was tipping him. They told me they validate parking but when I went to the garage, the folks there told me they have no relationship with the hotel, aka no validation. Went up to the eighth floor which smelled like piss. Woke up at 5am because my four year old daughter had to go to the bathroom. When I pulled the covers off her, I noticed THREE insects IN the bed. That is when we decided to check out. My left arm has at least eight ot nine bites from bed bugs and my left forearm is swollen from what appears to be a spiderbite or something. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!;1
Checked into this hotel on 20thfeb 2017 for 3 nights. The guy behind reception was so disinterested in us checking in, literally got us to sign a piece of paper and as soon as he wacked the keys on the desk, he shot off into the office opposite. I work in customer service for a well known airline, and if I treated my customers like that, there would be a lot of complaints coming forward.  The hotel has no lift, so 4 flights with cases, but in a small hotel I expected this.  The room itself was no larger than a storage cupboard. No hanging space, 1 bedside table, and a bathroom from which you could touch each wall at the same time.  This I can deal with, but not the infestation of small flies in the bathroom and the dirty floor and skirting boards. The window had a clear plastic;1
I understand that running a hotel in a city like New York involves a lot of difficulties and compromises, so I'm willing to put up with a lot. In recent months I've been staying in a lot of different NYC hotels, and they vary wildly, some have tiny rooms looking onto airshafts, others are insalubriously located, etc.   None of that was a problem at the Empire Hotel. I checked in and was given room 418, a lovely room with two big windows directly overlooking Lincoln Center. Sure, the carpeting was a bit grubby, and the front desk could have been a bit friendlier, but hey, this is New York, you can't get everything.   But then when I got into the room it turned out that the blinds were stuck in the closed position: for all that the room had a great view, it was not a view that I;1
The mattress had a hole in the middle and I was unable to sleep. Besides that the noise from the people, the doors etc was unstoppable especially during the night. The tiny room is like jail with a small window.  The stuff wasn't polite. If you want a place to sleep during the night, like a normal person, this is not the right one. If you are vampire this is it!!;1
"I stayed at the Morningside Inn for 3 nights in Oct 2012. Firstly they gave me a key to a room where somebody was sleeping and had all their belongings. After that error they ""upgraded"" me to a new room and assured me that nobody would have access to my room key. The upgrade wasn't exactly special; and it probably meant that the person who booked that room got downgraded.   The beds are almost unsafe; they have springs poking into your body and make a noise whenever you move. Impossible to sleep.   I was woken on the second morning to the sound of my room heater blowing steam from a small piston that could not be turned off. I thought it was going to blow up. My room heated up so much that I had to go outside and I feared for my belongings. It happened to all the heaters in the";1
Awful hotel old fashioned and would never stay there again i have left a review with the hotel and hope that others see it before booking its not at all deco as advertised its more run down and stuck in stone age;1
I was looking forward to my visit to NYC and my stay at the Ameritania, but ended up having a death in the family and am unable to come. The hotel refuses to cancel my reservation. How heartless can you be?;1
Hotel says non-smoking, but the whole hotel smelled of pot and cigarettes... The bed was so hard. It's in a shady area and no where near tourists attractions. The service was also terrible. Just stay away from this place !;1
Place looks good until you get to your room which is dirty with really dirty bathrooms and fridges and old fashioned tv. Really needs a good overhaul. Was originally staying at the Hilton but changed to the Empire because it was the Gossip Girl Hotel. Big Mistake!!! Expected so much more;1
With high expectations, we arrived to a 2 night stay at the new Yorker just to find out this hotel is far from being a place you would want to stay in new York. Itâs noisy both from inside (constrictions where being made on the floor above us and we called operator, they promised a manager will call us and guess what, no one called) and outside (windows are very thin). The serve from the stuff was lame, slow and very cold and unappreciative and the decor of the hotel, the lobby, the halls and the room are from the 60âs or something. Rooms are with discussing rugs and flees are everywhere. We wouldnât believe what we saw. It looked like nobody saw the ugliness that going on there. Stay away from this hotel;1
Was awoken by what sounded like gunshots directly in front of our balcony. We crawled to the closet at called 911. Social media posts confirmed that other people in the hotel heard shots as well. I texted my family I loved them and got fully dressed in the dark. Iâve never been scared for my life until I stayed at hotel Hollywood.  . BUT THATS NOT ALL Crusty hard towels Dirty mat stain in bathroom Mold behind flaky wallpaper Balconyâs all connected Fan canât be turned off Dark rooms/ little lights Front desk issue made us cry Hard bed and uncomfortable pillows Overwhelming chlorine smell even though pool is outside Couldnât get into sauna. But could get into tool shed Had to call police on 2 of the 3 nights there No continental breakfast Dirty gross coffee machine Cold and hot;1
My daughter had an audit we made it an extended vacation.  When looking at the website this looked like a kewl place.  It needs a full on LA face lift!! The place is old, run down, not what the website portrayed.  Unfortunately we were without power, heat, hot water for almost 2 days.  I would not recommend this Hotel.  Spend your money elsewhere, where the staff is concerned about the safety of their guests!  They were in sympathetic to the needs of the guests during this time, all they could say it's an act of God, as a Christian I felt offended.  I understand they didn't have control over the weather, they also didn't have control over their hotel!;1
My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon  The staff were rude at check in we advised them it was our honeymoon and got the response âso whatâ We got up to the room which was unbelievably small, I went for a shower and the fitting coming out of the wall was leaking and sprayed all over the bathroom, We went down to the tick Tock cafe in the lobby for breakfast we ordered and they got my wifeâs order of pancakes with bacon wrong they brought her pancakes with burgers and when told the server he said âwell the burgers are nice everyone likes burgersâ obviously she said no I would like bacon please and the server through us a dirty look and stormed off  The hotel is very dated, dirty and you are made to feel very unwelcome   I wouldnât stay;1
This is by far the worst Hilton I have stayed at in all my years of traveling. My sister and I arrived after a long day of traveling. First off they did not have our room ready and the parking was $30 even though we were hotel guests. The night we were there was extremely crowded and noisy all night. When we told the front desk they did nothing. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.;1
No manager to address issues. Booked refundable reservation, but wouldn't let us check out without charging us for the duration of our stay. No breakfast, TV channels old. Not happy. We will never sta;1
Although the staff is friendly, the room I was assigned had a 24â landing with a 9â drop. I entered the room and went flying. Very dangerous.   The next day the cleaning staff when they left the room left the door ajar. I had to call security to make sure I was safe and my belongings still there. I will never return.;1
I stayed in this hotel last December luckily just for one night.  I was not expecting big rooms, new rooms or rose petals on my arrival but at least a little bit of costumer service was what anyone would expect when you pay 370 dollars for one night. We arrived around midday and the room was ready. The guy that checked us in was nice and polite, he asked me for the passport and the credit card. He gave us the keys for the room and that's it . No explication of the area or information about facilities,breakfast time (I did not have it included but I would have bought it if somebody was promoting it )  maps, help with the bags( even If I am perfectly able to carry my luggage but at least  the question could have been nice..)..I don't know something to let you fell welcome.;1
"I normally hesitate to rate a place as terrible, (since i have stayed in sme pretty bad hostels in NYC) but this is the first time I feel it is justified. My boyfriend booked a room for two nights over spring break and when we got there that night, I noticed that the beds were not made. On closer inspection, there were stains and crumbs all over the sheets.  We went to the front desk, but the man there was ""just filling in"" and had no access keys to get clean sheets. He picked the lock on the linen cabinet, but ther was nothing in there.  Also, he would not call the manager in front of us, saying only that he would give him a message from us. We were out of  place to stay that night. He told us to come in to speak with the morning staff lady and she would ""work it out."" The next";1
Check in was friendly and efficient. Our room was pleasant enough in bright colours but has signs of significant wear and tear. It smelled strongly of cigarette smoke as did the area of our floor. The hotel was full. We were informed by hotel staff that the guest who had been smoking has had to pay a fine and leave the hotel but as the air conditioning between rooms was shared that it would take some time for the smell to go away. It remained for our one day stay. Although the website noted the restaurant as a feature it was closed for all but breakfast. Food at the bar was of a very poor quality. Both courses were cold, the fish in the taco's was unpleasant and the chicken wings merely deep fried with little taste. The Champagne we ordered was not in stock, we were told that it;1
We have a long history with this hotel---dating back to the time in the 80's when our children were at Columbia.  Although it was old at that time, the location was perfect.  This is our second experience in the 21st century.  It is obvious that they have tried to make this into a boutique type hotel. Frankly, it fails miserably.  For the first time ever we had to ask to change our room. The bathroom configuration was such that there was no way that an adult could stand in front of the sink to brush your teeth.  After about 4 hours they changed our room although the desk staff was not very pleasant. Now we were in a room that was smaller (if that was possible) but at least we could go into the bathroom and stand in front of the sink. Hard to imagine but our stay went downhill;1
Watch out for the manager. HE charged my visa several times. After a while visa contacted me and took the case to court. Watch out: the hotel can only reached by phone. NO FAX/NO MAIL/ .. If you have a complaint they hang in the line.;1
From being a globalist top tier level member I did not expect to be treated like a peasant and imbecile. The sole purpose of our stay was to be closer to the airport for an early morning flight and we booked the nicest suite they had in the entire hotel. Normal check in hours are 3p and 10am for globalist members. I was allowed to check in at 6pm. Just terrible communication and will consider a different property outside my rewards program next time;1

Let me start by stating I never write reviews. I travel often since I work as a reporter. I can hands down say - worst hotel I ever stayed at. Very rude staff. They are very inflexible. Rooms are like closets - small and very poor lightening. I had no closet to hang my clothes and the shower has no door.  I didn't care much about the room but the rudeness of the staff. Not willing to help with anything, baggage storage, directions, etc. So if you are looking for inviting and friendly hotel, forget it. Only nice thing about this place is the lobby so don't be fooled!!!!!!!;1

Due to Government restrictions, we could not fly to New York and the Ameritania was also in lock down, so not accepting guests and yet we have been unable to obtain a refund for services not provided.  The Credit note offered was too restrictive, as while we would love to be travelling prior to the end of 2021, the impact this pandemic has had on us, like so many other people, financially, means that travel within the foreseeable future is unlikely, especially to the U.S.A.! A full refund would give us confidence to be booking with this hotel again.;1
We got ripped off by this hotel. We booked and paid for a superior room with aircon but we are given a budget standard room without airconding. I do not recommend this hotel.;1
I left the hotel at 4am to catch a early flight home after being bitten by bed bugs. Room was not very clean. Old outdated furniture. One bed was a twin size, the other bed was not quite a full size. No matress cover on bed and thin sheet. Other bed had dirty cover on top. Shower fixture was loose. I had to get my own face cloth from the basement after I had asked the front desk for one. Window blinds were broken up and curtains soiled. After reporting this to the front desk, I was told to call back later to speak to the manager. I got the run around and never got a response. I will never stay here again! The only good thing: Good location to subway and China Town. Not worth the $200;1
OMGGGG it was the worst hotel I have ever been to. To be honest, the only good thing was the location, near the subway station and a few minutes to times square. Elevator extremely slow ( you might wait 10-15 minutes to get it), rooms are very dirty , lobby has 6 or seven chairs and most people sat on the floor while surfing the net. The staff hardly smiles.  It was baaaaaaaaaaaad;1
I visited with some friends on a 6th form college trip, our total number being 29, so we had alot of rooms, but the group were spread out over all floors.  When we first arrived our eyes were immediatly drawn to the 'danger' tape in the corner of the lobby where the plaster was falling off the ceiling. I hoped that things would get better, unfortunatly they did not. One of the lifts was out of order, so rather then wait around i choose to use the main stairs. These were fine till we reached 5th floor where there was all kinds of rubbish and cigarette ash along with flammable liquids with lids of ect.  My room was shared with 3 others yet only 3 keys were provided and only 3 sets f towels ect. The bed was not terrible but when i first arrived we had to remove the top cover and;1

We were put I a small square box of a room.  The room was so small, my fiancÃ© and I could not stand in the same space together.  The bathtub was dirty and the tub tile and caulking full of mold.  The room was not clean.  The sheets had beard hairs in it and other hairs as well.  The comforter was covered by a duvet.   When we removed the duvet to change the linen ourselves, we were welcomed with blood stains on the comforter.  The floor in the hallway and bedroom was not vacuumed.  The rail in the stairwell was sitting on the floor and had been rigged previously.  The mattress was hard as a rock.  It was awful!  Don't waste your money.  You get what you pay for.

I'm from Florida and have never been to ny. From the outside I was excited to stay there, we walked in and I thought I was in a horror movie. It literally smelled like murder and hookers. The elevator was a joke and the hallways were disgusting and scary. 5 seconds of being in the room we saw 2 roaches. I've never seen anything like it. My friends and I were laughing histerically as we sat in the room looking for another hotel, then left the key and walked out the front door. Don't bring children here.

The room I paid good money for was small and uncomfortable.  The tiny window was covered with cheap, bent aluminum blinds.  The view from the window was a wall of an adjacent building.  The overall appearance was shabby at best.  It smelled like cheap cleaning fluid.  Even the TV was substandard.  The TV does not include regular broadcast stations. Most of the stations were in  languages other than English.  This place is more like a youth hostel in a second or third world nation.;1
"Recently stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in November 2015 for 3 days on a business trip. The guest in the room next to mine was smoking during my entire stay and the smoke was permeating into my room.  I have Reactive Airway Disease and cigarette smoke is a trigger.  I phoned guest services daily and reported this.  They sent security up and I was informed they could smell the smoke however, there is nothing they could do unless they are ""caught"" smoking.  I stopped at the front desk on several occasions and again no attempt to correct the problem.  I was only able to stay in my room to sleep and had to leave the room and complete my computer and administrative work elsewhere.  The day I was departing I left 5 hours prior to my flight   because I could not tolerate the smoke.  I";1
Location is good, hotel was ok BUT when we arrived, we had 3 rooms booked and the receptionist insisted that we had 5 and that they were paid for. We had informed him that should only have 3 but he said that they would go waisted and insisted that we should take them. So we took one so our son would not disturb his partner who had arrived before us considering it was after midnight. We checked out after 3 nights with a ZERO bill and 2 months later received the bill for 2 rooms. They admitted it was their mistake however still charged it to our credit card without our authorisation. We didn't even want the room. I can just imagine what my customers would say if I made a mistake, gave them a product they didn't need and 2 months later insist they pay for it!!;1
"This hotel was a train wreck from the minute I walked in. The lobby, elevators, hallways, and room were filthy, with broken furniture, peeling wallpaper, and broken blinds. The heat didn't work. When I asked for an additional blanket, the one delivered to my door, after two calls, had stains on it. The front desk staff were helpful in helping me find an alternative hotel; they had clearly dealt with this kind of issue before. When I tried to get  a refund through their corporate service line, I had one of the worst customer service interactions I had had in many years, and it was with a supervisor!";1
I cannot review the quality of the hotel but simply my experience dealing with them. I decided to make a last minute trip to NYC this weekend and got a red eye friday night flight with a sunday return. I booked the hotel and purchased theater tickets. Unfortunately, my flight got cancelled due to plane malfunctions and the next flight was not till Sunday. Since it was just a weekend trip that was not an option. Despite an official policy that says no refunds, ALL three of the theater tickets were refunded as they understood my situation and that it was out of my control. Hotel Riverside Studios however refused to refund me. I called them immediately (Friday night) to tell them I would not be able to make it because my flight had been cancelled. They cancelled the booking but;1
Room stunk.  Wifi did not function.  Bed unsleepable.  Window shades in tatters and did not keep out bright light at night (I rigged sheet to cover them).  ONLY hot water in shower--so being scalded was only option.  Taxi driver who took me to airport next day told me he hears similar stories from others who stay in this place.  They offered me 20% off final bill.  They should have charged me nothing or paid me to be there.  Don't be fooled.;1

The hotel and it's facilities were good, and it is well located near subway station. We booked through expedia and got the spa suite which advertised it slept up to 4 people and an infant. We'd stayed in similar rooms and assumed it had a sofa bed. It was paid for and closer to the date we arrived we were told that we would need to pay extra for a roll out bed. When we queried this they advised that the room only had a king bed and although it advertises for up to 4 people we would need to hire the extra bed.  Expedia were very helpful and eventually refunded that amount to us, but their advertising and charging left a sour taste.

I don't really know where to start! We have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel. From the check in process to upgrading the room the whole stay was a disaster. Virgins photographs and descriptions of the hotel are very misleading. After checking in and paying for an upgrade ($172) we made our way to a room. The lobby is the best area in the hotel. After getting out of the lift you are met with dark, dirty and dated corridors. From that moment I knew there was going to be a problem. The first room was no bigger than the bed itself. The room was absolutely filthy. After speaking to reception and changing rooms we were moved to a slightly bigger one which was a bit cleaner. However it was very dated and the bathroom is in real need of repair as the tap was constantly;1

Poorly lit. Ugly decor. Atmosphere of entrapment to spend more. Even ice required a call to room service. Room stuffed with things to buy including the morning coffee. Refrigerator stuffed with purchasable items. No room for a wrapped sandwich. No response to a call to the desk. Just rang for five minutes. Bathroom small and ill-equipped. A shower that could only be described as bizarre. Great location if, as we, you are going to concerts at Lincoln Center.;1

I stay in a lot of hotels all over the world -- and this experience with Hyatt was one of the worst ever!  Problems encountered: 1) Front desk hung up on me 5 times the first day after I was put in a room with screaming children next door!  Finally had to call guest relations to get front desk to call me. 2) Second room had a shredded window blind -- wouldn't go up or down. 3) With window shade unable to be closed, early next morning window washers showed up and parked at my window while I was not dressed and unable to open or close window shade.  They stayed staring in at me! 4) Next day window shade not fixed until later in the afternoon after I called and texted again.  Front desk would not answer a call. 5) Room was not cleaned that day as of 6 PM, so I decided to leave;1
"On 19/07/2017 I booked this hotel for 3 nights (after we were let down by Airbnb with the host cancelling our stay 3 days before we were due to arrive there) through Agoda ( reservation number 202863187) and paid in full 656.90 dollars (I was charged Â£503.52 on 20/07). When we got to the hotel on 22/07 I realised we had a big queen size bed for the three of us and asked if they could upgrade us; unfortunately they did not have a bigger room (with two double beds). They offered me a folding bed but I said no: I felt the price they quoted me for the bed was too high, especially considering that those beds are rubbish anyway.  Internet and breakfast were included. I left the rental car on the road outside, paying the meter when I had to and I didn't use their garage. When I checked";1
Book this hotel at your own risk!  My favorite part was when we left.  Not only is the staff unfriendly and incompetent, the hotel was under construction the entire time we were there and the place was a mess.  The last day there, the numbers on the doors were taken off so we didn't even know which rooms were ours.  We rented a rollaway bed and the front desk clerk charged me $479 for it instead of the $15 it should have cost.  When I brought this to their attention, there was no apology, as if this sort of thing happens quite often.  The rooms were small, the air conditioning didn't work, and there was a strange smell that we never could figure out.  Reading the prior reviews, I thought people were exagerating because the place couldn't be that bad....I was wrong, it was worse!;1
I stayed there for 2 weeks because I didn't have more money.  But it was kind of scary, our room was next to a room where a man with mental problems lives. The guy didn't clean the room and it was full of cockroaches.  The staff is dodgy and kind of rude.  The kitchen and bathrooms where all right.  I would recommend stay away from there if you can afford something better, the hostel is in a very good location and very convenient to get to know london but is crap.;1

For the rate of $117 per weekend nite, it was way overpriced!  The room was the size of a storage closet with a bed that was smaller than a twin bed.  Moreover, the bed was not comfortable at it: the mattress about  4 inches high and is  filled with foam and is placed on top of a wooden frame.  Moreover, the staff is very unfriendly.  Furthermore, when I asked for a late check out of only 30 minutes more, they said that it wasn't possible and I had to check out at 12 noon on a monday.  When I did check out at 12 noon, I saw at least 20 rooms that were available at the front desk (the room keys are stored in room boxes behind the check-in desk), so it wasn't as if the hotel needed my room immediately!    You are better off staying at a hotel outside of Manhattan that is right by;1
They gave me dirty room after dirty room! It's so disgusting to find tons of hair all over your bed that looks as if it had just been made with brand new sheets, and to turn your towel over after washing your face to find makeup all over the other side. The housekeeping is obviously playing a trick in which they make the dirty beds to seem as they were freshly made. The next night they gave me a new room which was also dirty yet had a made up bed. This time I was not exhausted and called the front desk. Sarah at the front desk is always there and is So RUDE! She stated that since her roommates makeup stays on towels at her place after washing them that my towels were clean. This hilton must save a lot on water bills from not having to wash anything!;1
I've used Premier Inns for business for many years - probably 6/8 times a year - and found them fair and basic ie good value for room.  Recently, they have added a new way of ripping off customers - a Â£10 early check-in  charge.  When I arrived at around 1.30pm I was told that the room was ready but I'd have to pay Â£10 to access it 1 and a half hours early!  I didn't pay but at 3pm, the queue to check-in ran out of the lobby and into the street!  Checking my emails it is mentioned in the small print of the confirmation email received a day out but, having used the firm for so long, I don't bother to read it.  As a change of terms, it should have been highlighted.  No-one expects an early check-in, but if the room is ready, it is usually give. In these difficult times, shame on;1
I have booked a suite with the Jacuzzi for 5 night back in September. It was so horrible that I have left the hotel next day...First of all, the room smells musty, and secondly next to the room there are 2 big vending machines...making continuous noise. I could not sleep at all!! I went to the receptionist complaining about the room and she wasn't helpful at all. She was very rude and it seemed like she did even like her job. Anyways, I had a very bad experience, i have paid fully in advance through Expedia, which meant i did not get any refund and I have left the hotel the next day.;1
"On May 21st, when I returned to my room at around 5.30 pm, I found that the it wasn't done, and there was a bag of garbage on my bed, that of course I hadn't left there.  This situation was not only discomforted, but totally filthy and unhealthy.  All I got was, ""We are sorry"". Imagine  how sorry I was! Off course the cover wasn't changed, and I had to sleep on that bed. I really doubt about the housekeeping management at this hotel, and I believe they do not follow any regulations concerning the cleanliness.  I will not return to this hotel again. This was a very disgusting situation and hadn't been attended as it should've been.";1
The woman at the front desk is horrible. She yells at anyone. No one is wearing masks I donât feel safe in the lobby or building The rooms are not good either If you want a stress free experience go somewhere else This place sucks;1

"Yes, the price is good but the hotel is awful. It's a good example of ""you get what you pay for.""  I called in advance and was told I could possibly check in early so I took a chance figuring I'd check my luggage if I couldn't then come back later. I arrived at noon on a Saturday. The lobby was mobbed. The line to check looked like more than 20 people. The line to check luggage looked even longer like more than 40 people. I waited about 15-20 minutes in the check-in line and made it to the desk. I was informed I could not check in early. I didn't have time to wait in the luggage check-in line so I left with my luggage.  I returned at 10:30pm and checked in without delay. I went to the elevator and while there were many cars they were very slow to arrive. There were more people";1

I would not recommend it to anyone. It is dirty, toilet is disquasting, there is no towels and service is just below bad...i hope everyone who reads this wont stay at this property.;1
Close proximity to Universal Studios is the ONLY positive thing at this hotel. Rates are too high for such a tired, old hotel. ZERO water pressure in the shower. Faucet would not stop dropping when off - yet the tacky sticker on the mirror promotes water conservation. Front desk rep thought it was my responsibility to inform the hotel of these problems. I don't work for Hilton. That's their job to ensure the accommodation expectations are met before they book the room. Garage elevator drops you off in the middle of a buffet in a hallway on lobby level. Very classy.;1
Overall I enjoyed my experience but the ending soured it for me.    Being told itâs $15 to leave my bags downstairs for half an hour while I ran an errand before going to airport ruined my experience.  The cheap comes out expensive.    I would have been happy to til the attendant $5 but paying $15 is insulting to me as a guest who stayed here for 3 nights.and needed to leave my bags for 30 minutes.    Been travelling for a long time.  Never was extorted money to leave my bags for a short period of time.   Not cool.  At all.  Bad form.  Bad customer service.  The baggage attendant wasnât exactly nice.  And the hotel clerk didnât seem one iota interested in my plight. Or in helping me.;1
"I recently stayed at the Empire Hotel, and during my stay, my friend's laptop was stolen, as well as her purse. I also had a small side bag stolen from me, as well as having one of the maid's throw away one of my keepsake travel blankets.

They don't just vaporize into this air, and the card tester for the door is a complete joke, as well as the ""door checks"" that they do in the middle of the night. The police said that this is a common offense at the Empire Hotel, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.";1

First off, staff were fantastic and friendly, and went out of the way to give us information, offer service etc.  The hotel however... no hot water flask, paper cups in the room, unreliable water temperature in the showers, terribly outdated furniture and designs, television from the 1980s, mineral water not provided, dusty hairdryer, starchy bedsheets... the list would probably be longer if I stayed more than a night.   Only stay if you are a Nikola Tesla fan.;1
My title pretty much says it all. I was so repulsed by the room upon entering that I immediately called Marriott and booked a room in one of their midtown hotels (using my points). I took me a year and a half to earn the points to cover the cost of two nights in the Marriott (60,000 points), but it was well worth it. To be fair, I do take some of the blame. That is, I should have learned by now that if something seems sketchy, it probably is. That is certainly the case with this hotel.  Do yourself an enormous favor: pay an extra $50 and stay in a good hotel. When it comes down to it, you usually can't go wrong with a Marriott, Hilton, or other major chain. Me? I'm sticking with name brands from now on.;1
Im a 26yr old male that has been to nyc many times. As soon i arrived there were problems. The front desk was extremely rude. It took 2 HOURS for my room to be ready (i arrived at 5pm). Then we got our room and they literally stuck a bed and a bathroom in a closet and called it a studio. The place was filthy, all the furniture was messed up and old. Seriously messed up my little getaway with my fiance. Thi splace is a total dump and anything you want including the smallest things like a simple room cleaning will cost you a min of 50.00usd. Trust me just go to a hotel with a more creditable name. Dont even both trying to call there main office , there even more rude and place you on hold for atleast a half hour before you speak to the manager. Hell in nyc should be the name.;1

Stayed here on honeymoon and was very disappointed - room size not as described so had to fork out over $330 over 5 nights to upgrade to a small suite! Standard room not big enough for more than one person. Hotel charges extra for everything including wifi and coffee in the room! Pool tiny and roof terrace closed for private events more often than not! Erratic water temperature in shower and aircon noisy. Not worth the money which is a shame as location is great.;1

"I am not someone who writes bad reviews, in fact I am probably tolerant to a fault, HOWEVER: You may have read about the blackout last night.  Certainly not the hotel's fault, BUT, when the safety director sounded panicked over the loudspeaker, telling guests every minute or two for a half hour, something along the lines of, ""The fire department is here, there is a situation, the elevators are down, they are investigating, stay in your rooms,"" it didn't instill much confidence that we were safe.  Throw in a few announcements such as ""folks in the lobby, please go outside if you need air"" just made things more confusing and uncomfortable, especially for those of us on a high floor.   Why couldn't they just say that there was no fire, everyone was safe and the situation was just a";1
I booked this hotel for the last week in June starting on June 23rd. I canceled the hotel on June 17th. I received a confirmation email stating I would not be charged and the cancellation was free. However upon review of my credit card, it showed that they still charged for the full week $1600! I called their reservation department and it shows I cancelled and should not have been charged. I was transferred to the front desk, and their it says they marked me as a no show! Neither people could refund the charge. My husband spent 2 hours on the phone yesterday and they still wonât refund us the money. They said the issue is the reservation was done through a 3rd party - booking.com, so they canât fix it.

Something should have told me to run when I saw an elderly gentleman shuffling his way through the hallway with a cigarette hanging from his mouth heading to a telephone booth in the hall.

I would advise not to go to this place. While it is relatively cheap and has a good location, it is dirty, to go to your room you have to go a long way with long solitary corridors, and sometime you would see people just walking around that makes you wonder if they are also guests of the hotel or what...I am a female and went alone and did not feel safe at all. In addition, the receptionists are not friendly. Also, I still have bites from the bugs in the bed. I would consider spending a little bit more or going to a less expensive neighborhood.;1

Stayed here 7/9/16 for a week.  The room, overall, was a grade F.  I may have gotten a better room staying at a Motel 6.  The carpet looked dirty and had fibers coming out of it.  The tub was disgusting - had stains in it. Some of the towels had stains on them.  The outlet in bathroom looked like a fire hazard/code violation.  The area around the sink was so tiny and barely had any room for our toiletries.  The porcelain sink itself had two dings in it and every time I looked at it, it appeared dirty because of the damaged porcelain.  There was no clock on nightstand (which with our phones wouldn't be a problem but it was a problem due to lack of outlets in room),  and only 2 outlets to plug in our phones, chargers, etc.  Extremely old, outdated room, not well situated, not fit;1
Unfriendly staff.  Nickel & dime you for everything.  For $300 a night I got air blowing at me while trying to sleep. The bathtub paint or enamel was chipping. The beds were very old and squeaky.

I made a reservation at the Empire Hotel for 2 nights for over 100 people. Although in the contract we agreed on a check in time at 3 p.m. a lot of rooms were handed over to us more then five hours later. When I complained to the receptionist, the only thing she said was: âI am only a human being and I cannot work under a pressure. And now I am working under a pressure.â Till our departure there was nobody responsible who I could discuss and solve the problem with. When I wanted a written confirmation to be able to solve it later, I was always promised to get it, but in the end I have not received anything! Still not mentioning that although in the contract we had superior rooms, our people were given rooms with a view of tiny and dark court yard with terrible noise from air;1
If my expectation wasn't pumped up by the price and appearance, we would've stayed at a cheap motel. Walked into the room to find long black hairs on our bed & the chair. The room is maybe 150 square feet at the best & I was NOT prepared to share my balcony with a random stranger. I paid an extra $50 (NOT WORTH IT) to check out at 2 & housekeeping began knocking on our door at 10:45am.  Room 321 was trash. Light in the corner of the room, doesn't work. Light to the side of the bed, doesn't work. Towel rack comes right off the wall & if you're not careful, it'll hit your foot.  Scratches all over the TV, made it hard to watch our $22 movie. Some type of sauce on the wall above the bed? Signs everywhere offering free appetizers in the courtyard between 5 & 7, but nobody really;1

I stayed in this hotel for one night. It was really not a happy experience. I'm not satisfied with the cleanliness and service.  At first, I found some small stains on both the switch in the bathroom and the table in the bedroom. I just cleaned them myself, because I thought it was not that bad.  Then, I found something really terrible. There was a huge stain on the quilt. I'm sorry to say that, but it was really disgusting. It was a big brown stain which looked like some blood or something more disgusting. I will attach a picture of the stain to this review. My husband tried to use the landline phone to contact the housekeeping, but the phone did not work, so my husband had to go downstairs and ask the front dest to call someone to change the dirty quilt. Forty minutes after my;1

The walls were moldy, sagging- the ceiling was stained. Windows filmy with filth, stained and worn carpet- and from the smell, not everyone made it to the bathroom.

The first room was spacious, bath in the bathroom, Room 822. No bed!!! Are you kidding me, a pull out sofa bed, is this a hotel or a hostel. Second room offered has a bed, very small but that's okay, downside is that could here the aircon outside, constantly. Too late to bother a third attempt but don't ever accept 101 either if you prefer less noise.   Lobby showed great promise but let down by the rooms.  I have yet to find a decent hotel in New York!;1
The place was nice and clean throughout, I'll give it that. But the rudeness of the staff was disgusting and they didn't give us the room we booked on the first night. Then we had 3 other nights booked and wanted to cancel the last one because our flight was moved. The staff member at the desk said that he couldn't charge for only two nights because he didn't have the information! He said we had to pay it and could get a refund in the morning. To which I replied that we would like a receipt to prove this. He said he couldn't issue one because he wasn't the manager and kept arguing and refusing to give us the keys.

You can check against my profile. I donât offer many reviews. But I will make an exception for this place. I really cannot stress enough: DO NOT STAY HERE. You WILL be disappointed if not nauseous.  It is terrible. It is dirty, it smells bad. It smells really bad. The rooms are stained and the bedlinen is musty. It feels unsafe. Whilst I did not see any bugs, you felt that they were there.   The rooms are tired, yellow, peeling, and you feel as if the entire building should be condemned. None of the guests make eye contact with each other because you are all ashamed to be there.  It is a hole.  I consider this a public service to post this review. Do you not go here. You will be disappointed and you will come away feeling like you need a deep clean and that you need to throw;1
"I have NOTHING positive to say about our stay at Yourstay Central park. We encountered a string of disappointments. We were promised a large one-bedrom apartment with a queen or king size bed . . . but we received a TINY room with a full-sized bed. I would say that this company is not far from being fraudulent. I complained to the London office, but they denied all claims. The New York property manager (David Liebovitz) is a fraud. He claimed the unit was 650 square feet, but by my measurements it was well under 450 square feet. The ""free"" internet access wasn't working, nor was the cable TV. I was asked by the the property manager to call the internet company myself to sort out the problem, and was surprised to learn that internet service had been recently  suspended due to";1
Worst stay in NYC ever. Had to wait over 15 min for an elevator and ended up walking down the stairs. Shower pressure had no water, could barely wash my hair. Waited for bellman for 30 minutes to help me with my bag and never came. Had to lug 10 pieces of luggage down to the front door myself. When staff saw me instead of feeling shame and helping, they were rude and chastised me. How can you have only one bellman working who is also getting people cabs. Long lines for checking and out and getting packages from the bellman. They don't have enough staff to handle their guests. Overall horrible stay. When I complained, they offered nothing. Terrible experience.;1
I booked 3 rooms for 1 night and the hotel charged my card as well as my brother's card for 3 rooms. I called from the UK multiple times and left voicemails. I also sent them email to query. We checked out on 29th May.   I called again today I.e. 4the June. Spent almost 1 hour and over Â£20 in phone call. Hoping to get the amount refunded and not having to chase.   It will be nice if the front office staff charges the correct card & only once.  it is very frustrating, time consuming and expensive to chase & follow up.   I can't choose the service rating for service. Poor experience.;1
There are so many better places to stay ( such as the great Magic Castle Hotel ) than this place.  We stayed here because the price was low, and now I know why.   You get what you pay for.   Tiny bugs near the washroom sink.   The fridge, microwave both didn't work.   I complained to the manager and she seemed like she didn't care.;1
I cannot believe how bad a hotel in midtown can be. Not quite sure where to start: dreadful bed - mattress down to the wire. No cleaning for a 3 day stay. Front desk staff who would rather be on their phones than helping. No coffee in room, no fridge in room, no bar in hotel, no breakfast. Frankly its a hostel with 3* pricing. Just an unmitigated disaster from start to finish;1
This hotel sucks, do not stay here, service is rude, rooms are dirty, location is ghetto, bar and lounge does not exist, parking is 22 dollars per night, hotel smells, it's not classic, it's noisy, walls are thin, beds are rough, pillows are not pillows, sink clogs, tub clogs, vending machines are broken, overall, its ridiculous here.;1
Before i booked this hotel, i saw those reviews on this webside. But i believe, what i have experienced in this hotel was much more horrible than anyone else.   My friend and i are realitively slim and small, and when we checked in that day, the receptionists gave us a room in the corner. When we saw the room, we were astonished. The room was the smallest hotel room i have ever seen. There were only one bed(barely enough for two slim girls), one old television, one tiny bathroom, and an old closet. The room was kinda stuffy and the air-conditioning was really noisy. Furnitures were old, and they used tape to conceal some broken parts. We had hard times even to turn around in this room, and there wasn't enough space for our suitcases(two small ones).The room was faaaar different;1
The location is very good but so loudly! I mean you really have a hard time getting some sleep. In fact you will find ear plugs beside the bed which are obviously helpless. The thing is that two main avenues are right beside the hotel which is only 11 stories high. Further there is like a lounge discotheque at the top floor which is very loud until early in the morning. So the higher you get the louder it gets. Best floors are 7 or 6 but still noise is very annoying. The decoration is sort of tired which gives the aspect of not being clean at all. I also had some trouble with the shower which apparently did not surprise anybody at the reception. I was traveling with my kids which made everything more difficult as the room had plenty of items for sale at a very expensive price. I;1
The location of the hotel is perfect however it ends there. We paid for a executive double with a view and were told the day before it was fine but when we arrived it was there's a burst pipe. We were given a room on the 7th floor which looks into class room/ training room. We tried to complain but got no where. The carpet was bumpy and if i was unsteady on my feet I would have tripped. The shower leaks regardless of the towels on the floor to stop the water flooding the room.  The room was a lot smaller than what we paid for.  When I returned home we emailed to complain which seems to have been ignored.;1
"During the reservation process I was told that the AAA rate was better than the military and that it even included parking and breakfast (which was too good to be true in NYC); none of the three things proved to be true and accurate. During the checkout I told the frontdesk that I felt tricked about the rate (AAA vs. Military - being active duty myself) and the rude response from the lady was to call the accounting department and complaint to them, without giving me any real solution...  I had a problem with the bathroom, the toilet was DIRTY outside from previous owners (not going to what was on it) and even though I informed immediately to the frontdesk, it took more that 24 hours and a second complaint to clean the bathroom. If that is with the regular cleaning, I could not";1
I'm writing an update to my glowing review of the Empire. I just checked out this morning and while I was upgraded to a corner suite for my continued patronage, I must be truthful about the experience I have had here with management. Last year, I stayed at the hotel for work and my room was burglarized.  My iPad, my wallet, house keys and other items were stolen.  They were less than helpful when the incident actually happened (I called the police) but were super helpful when they realized I had a large number of people following my social media accounts.  They offered me free nights and said, please come back, which I did.  I stayed at the hotel in May and again in July with no incidents.  For some reason, when Fashion week rolls around, they kind of lose their minds over;1
rip, price pay night stay week hostel better time, nice things say hotel clean breakfast area nice,  ;1
Paid 600$ for 5 nights here. On arrival got charged a further 550$ in taxes security deposit and compulsory service charges for electric water and internet.. Reception doesnt look bad. Staff smile as you get ripped off.  Lifts antiquated corridors dirty and scruffy looking and rooms so small like tiny boxes crammed in together. No kettle so cant make a drink. Bathroom like something out of the 1920s old fashioned and out dated. No breakfast allowed so have to go out all the time to eat. Wouldn't reccomend this dump to anybody. There are a lot of better hotels than this place;1
Hi.  Spent a February weekend in a three BR here.  First, it is now run by Woogoo, not YourStay.  Secondly, they do not know basic hospitality.  We had to ask for towels, and you get one per person, no handtowels, no washcloths.  There were not very many lights in the apartment and a third were burned out.  The bedside lights are so small and weak, you can not use them for reading.  There are no top sheets on the beds, only mattress sheets and I bet the quilts are not washed after every guest.  There is room for 8 people in this apartment, but only one couch for sitting and only three kitchen chairs.  There are no tables or lamps in the sitting room.  The remote for the TV did not work . . shall I go on?  beware,  seduced by the website, but not again bill;1

This hotel was recommended by my travel agent. I told him I wanted a clean, comfortable hotel, with high standards. My first impressions walking into reception were good. When I went to get the lift it changed. This hotel is filthy dirty. Desperately needs updating and attention. The rooms are tiny. The door couldnât open fully without touching the bed. The room accessories and furniture were awful. The shower was terrible. The tiles had been painted over again yet there were bits of the original tile showing. The silicon around the bath was black, the grout in the tiled floor was filthy. There was a plastic covering stuck on the bathroom window which was pealing off and very messy. The net curtain was grey with dust. My fiancÃ© was getting into bed and a big ball of hair was;1
Their computers were down.  I arrived at 11:45pm and there ere about 40 people in line already waiting to be checked in.  At 1:30am, I could no longer stay awake and slept on the lobby floor.  At 3am the line had not moved.  At 5:30am about half the line had been processed.  At 7:56am the couple in front of me who had been waiting since 8:45pm was finally checked into their room.    I decided to change my clothes and brush my teeth in the lobby bathroom.   I asked the hotel for a refund since I had prepaid.  They said they would see what they could do.  I have not been refunded.  Hotels.com has not been helpful.  I paid $203 to sleep on a dirty lobby floor.    Take my advice â spend the extra $50 and go to a nice hotel instead.  One where the staff cares about your experience.;1
I refer to trip advisor a lot as I stay in hotels all round the world for work but I have never had to write a negative review like this which has left me incensed still sat in my room. I arrived on Friday at 4pm, reception was busy but I was patient, the service was rushed and not very personal although the receptionist did spend time asking me to fill out a trip advisor review which I thought was strange at check in. I went almost immediately out for the evening and returned to my room at 11.45pm, the room was hot and the air conditioning wasn't working. It's August in New York so the room was hot so I phoned recption to ask for someone to take a look at it. The room I had faces inwards looking at other rooms so it is very dark in the day and you have to have the blinds down;1
I would not stay if I was you. when I got to the room there was a used condom on the floor. when I called to the front desk the manager had an attitude at first. he assured me that he would refund one night for me. that never happened when I called back he said he was going to look into it and call me back, well its been over a week and still no call. the rooms are very small and if you try and have any food delivered to the room you cant. the security at the hotel said u have come down and get it. pick a different hotel and you'll have a better trip.;1

Just been there for a few days ago for a couples of days visit. Booked the room through hotwire (for around 160usd/night) and this could possibly be the biggest mistake I've done.   The hotel itself was small and fairly runned-down, located in end of upper west side. The room DOES NOT include free wifi (10 bucks a day!) and is much below average. the only upside with this place is the distance to Central park and subway. Dont expect anything more than that..and no, I'm definitely not going back to Astor after this stay;1
For the amount that I paid, I had high expectations for excellent quality customer service. The parking was awful, taking advantage of customers to bill us with even more feels charging tremendous about each half hour. Checking in was even more horrific, the front desk did not even direct us towards the room, we had to figure out which way the elevators were ourselves. The bed sheets smells like someone had already slept there, it did not feel fresh at all. In room service waiters were unpleasant. They look like they are expecting a big tip and when I was not fast enough, they're attitude changes in an instant from bad to rude. Bathroom did not have any soap. Very unhappy.;1
I attempted to call the New Yorker with some questions and to hopefully make a reservation. Unfortunately the call was outsourced and I couldn't even get to the front desk. Instead, I was transferred off to some half-assed timeshare schpiel. Oh, and then a 2nd half-assed timeshare schpiel where the people on the phone tried to trick me into giving them all my info, including credit card - just so I could get a $25 gift card, wow! After trying to call and complain about this I was transferred to at LEAST 9 different #s and people none of whom could help me. I finally just got in touch with the hotel themselves, and was told to send an email. Well wouldn't you know it I never received a response to that either. Don't stay here, not that you could if you tried. Some of the most;1
if you value your life stay well clear its mostly for men who spent more that 25 years  behind bars so when they get parolled they get ticket to call here, im trying to find words to describe it but cant really. it really is safer to sleep in central park but if you like watching naked over weight cons walking by your room by all means enjoy the view;1
I normally donât write reviews but this has to be acknowledged.   When we arrived at 6am, it was not time to check in yet so we understood that we had to wait until 3pm. The front desk staff was not friendly at all but Jeffrey from bell desk was super KIND and treated us with RESPECT. Shout out to Jeffrey for that.Being that it was our first time in New York and was exposed to this type of behavior right away, It set the tone for the rest of our trip. She had an attitude and was very snappy when providing us more info. When we came back around 1:30pm, there was another front desk person working and was hoping to get a better experience. Unfortunately, the same staff from that morning appeared to have just came back from her break and proceeded to call me up. I was hesitant since;1
The room smelled a little, not sure if it was because of a filter on the in-window unit. It was a musty faint smell. The carpet had stains all over the place as if it hadn't been shampooed in  while, I didn't feel comfortable walking around in my socks, let  alone barefoot. Lighting was horrible the room was not inviting and dark even with all the lights on. The bed was old, so old that you could see clearly the indentations of where people sleep. It wasn't comfortable at all definitely needs to be upgraded. Another much needed upgrade would probably be the TV it was an old CRT(tube) tv that was hard to watch because of the grainy picture. The bathroom door was broken, a clear glass shelf was being held in place with paper to secure it properly and there was screw holes and;1
"Actually this hotel is a dump. The unskilled personnel will not do anything without asking ""THE MANAGER"" first. This manager had with a mocking humor slightly on the edge. I was afraid of him instantly. He promised us Internet would be installed in the following days. None of his staff knew even a computer existed in the house. The TV-room resembled a cell in an airless cellar only accessible by an old elevator. To change the channel you had to ask the staff upstairs at the reception, cos only they could change it.  The""newly renovated hotel"" is still in a state of renovation. Especially in the common zone. There is a strange smell in the room and no way to open the window, because of air-condition. The toilets are dirty and often clogged. The ""Manager"" charged us the booking";1

Dont do banking on this connection. 6. Target for scammers who call you at night posing as hotel staff and ask for your credit card number. When reported to the reception an excuse is even found for this; ""they tap into our system"" 7. Noisy and too touristic. 8. Elevators are awful.

I will put this as one of the worst hotel stays in my lifetime. This dump is literally a small notch above a hotel/motel located in a third world country.  Let's start off with the misleading booking of the room. Not at any point in my conversation with the agent was it disclosed that there was an additional $26.00 charge for parking in there lot. I was not happy about this. I get into the room and the A/C is on full blast in the month of December with the temp being in the 50's. I called the front desk staff and asked them how to adjust the temp, was told they would send someone right up, no one ever showed up. Avoid any room facing the main road as you will hear ambulances and street traffic the entire night. Finally wake up to hopefully enjoy a nice hot shower. Towels;1
Unfortuanetely, my friends and I stayed at this disgusting hotel for my birthday. It seemed great at first, until the morning we were checkin-out. My two friends were both sick (it's December...) and they both had a bad cough. That morning, a man from the front desk knocked on our door and said someone had complained we were smoking....None of us smoke and the room didn't even smell. My friend told him we weren't smoking and he just left. How rude! We were quickly getting ready and suddenly we saw a cockroach crawl across the room. EW!!!! We all screamed so loud. My one friend jumped on the bed, the other jumped in the bathtub, and I jumped on the chair. 3 girls 1 cockroach, real classy. I called housekeeping after waiting for front desk to pick up for sooooo long (fantastic;1
The room had NO CLOSET. Very inconvenient for travelers. Shower heads weren't functioning, soap would dissolve into a slimy mess when wet. Pillows were flat and cheap.

I stayed at the Empire Hotel last week.  A few days after I checked out an unauthorized charge appeared on my credit card.  The charge was not on the invoice I received when I checked out.  We didnât take anything from the room.  So there shouldnât be any extra charge.  I called the hotel.  Nobody there seemed able to tell me what the charge was about.  I was transferred around and mostly nobody answered.  I had to call again.  After six calls over two days I was finally told that I had to send emails to their accounting department and the customer service department.  And emails are the only way to contact these department since they donât have phone numbers.  So I sent the emails, twice.  I received no reply whatsoever.

My experience in the New Yorker has been deplorable. It is a dirty old fashioned hotel that does not deserve a single night on. The stairs used to accede the bedrooms smell horribly (attached photo of the condition of the stairs) and it is definitively not a friendly place.

Noisy, overpriced, bad service. You name it. This hotel was one of the worst in a very long time. Even the rooms were nothing special and not that clean.

Bad experience and too much negative things to list here.;1
We stayed for 4 nights in October, booked as a package holiday with Virgin, on arrival at the hotel we were told our reservation couldnât be found, we stood there for a long time while an abrupt woman on reception disappeared with our passports, eventually came back and said they had booked us in for last year same dates and we were down as no shows. We booked a package holiday and our flights were correct so clearly this wasnât our fault however we were treated as though it was. We were advised they needed to put a $300 hold on my credit card for a new room and for the inconvenience we would be upgraded. Went up to our room on the 25th floor, if that room and floor was an upgrade I would have hated to see where we were originally booked, as soon as you step out of the lift the;1

We stayed here on our Honeymoon this month.  Having stayed here before we had reasonable expectations.  Sadly, it was an awful experience from the moment we checked-in.  Originally we planned to stay here for two nights as part of our road-trip.  However we changed this to three so made an additional booking for the third night.  Upon check-in this seemed to confuse the agent Benny.  He spent ten minutes trying to tell us why we may have to change rooms due to having two bookings.  Once this was resolved he then told us we only had a full breakfast for the new one night booking, the breakfast was 'continental' other wise.  This was a surprise since we had booked exactly the same package both times.  By the time check-in was done we were drained, having already explained to Benny;1
We gave the Empire a try for two nights and were appalled. While the lobby is nice and the staff polite, staying there is not pleasant. Our room was a somewhat shabby hole in the wall with barely enough space to walk between the bed and the wall to what passed for a closet, a niche in the wall with a curtain over it and little space to hang clothes. The promised queen bed was a double, the ventilation varied from nothing (stuffy air) to full blast (loud and clanking through the night, when you got the hotel to get it up and running), but you get little sleep in either case. The bathroom has no space to put anything nor enough room to shut the door from the inside, unless you stand in the shower. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was chaotic, with no host or hostess to tell you;1
The hotel is well located on 8th Avenue, a short walk to Times Square. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel and a 24 hour diner. The gym is sensational for a hotel and the staff are excellent. Rooms are very small, don't pay extra for a view as all you see is the building next door.;1

We opened the dorm door and it smelt like something had died in there. We booked the 4 beds the room had (room 409) thinking we would have our own room. Unfortunately we were not alone as the room had rats crawling around the ceiling space. We think the smell was rat urine. Showers were filthy, with a smeggy film over the floor. We felt cleaner before we showered. I've stayed in dumps, in third world countries and nothing compared to this. Absolute health hazard.;1

I frequently visit NYC Hotels, and this was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever received.    When I asked for a private place to pump breastmilk while waiting for our room to be available, the woman at the front desk offered the bathroom (not a comfortable, nor private place to pump) or the mezzanine lobby (not at all private).    I could not believe the woman at check in would suggest those places for someone to pump at, when I specifically requested a private space.    The hotel pool was extremely misrepresented in photos.  When the woman at the front desk asked what I thought of the pool, I told her that at this price point, I would not expect broken lounge chairs around the pool.  Instead of sending someone to fix it, she responded that they sometimes;1
If you actually want to sleep don't come to this hotel. It's 1:30 am and while the staff is very nice they haven't been able to find us a room that isn't next to a blaring dance party or the inconsistent rumble of motorcycles along the west side highway. Not to mention the temperature control is awful. I would never come here again.;1

We had issues to check in to the hotel as the first name showed on the booking confirmation is not matching my legal first name.   The front desk officer, Ali and his supervisor didnât try to help us solve our problem. Just told us to call Agoda and change the booking name. We felt he is unhelpful and we are very disappointed with this type of service.   We had to call Agoda multiple times to resolve this issue and finally we asked Agoda to give the hotel a call to explain the situation.  So, at the end we are allowed to check in but we are extremely unhappy with Aliâs behaviour!  The worst part during our stay was the power was disconnected at the middle of the night, and I had to run to the front desk multiple times and asked for assistance. Ryan, the front desk officer told;1
Whatever you do - wherever you stay - please, make sure it's NOT this hotel. It's popular among European travelers (maybe because it reads like a hostel?)  FILTHY. SMOKY. DISGUSTING. GREASY. These are words I would use to describe the hotel.  There were pubes and dust/dirt in the corners of the shared his/her bathrooms. The water temperature did not come up fast, leaving you standing in a puddle of water in the shower (the drain is apparently set to not drain until you are done completely. Gross.  There isn't a place other than hooks on the back of the door to put your stuff. Hello? Toiletries? Shoes? Whatever else you may have brought with you that needs a place when you are showering in a public place ?  The Halls stunk of stale smoke. Like thick, overwhelming pipe smoke. We;1
We had a Room with View right to the main Street. We double checked if there are really Windows in the Room becaus it was loud as they weren't. We could not sleep at all. The curtain was ripped as well the carpet, the Hook ups in the Bathroom were rusty and old. The Hotel was fully booked and the complimentary Breakfast was terrible. If you had a chance to get something. Because the Staff was overhauled. Glad that we stayed only this one night. Never ever again. I contacted the Ramada Company and I got just a Aplologies Letter from the Manager. Thats it!  If you want to stay cheap you can do this better in any other Motel.;1
Terrible terrible place. Door locks don't work so every time you want to re enter your room you call for assistance! People are completely indifferent to your discomfort. Our bath was clogged up! The person who came to fix it used the hotel towels to dry the place and left the towels in our room. When asked, said the house keeping folks will come at some point to clear it!! The rooms were not cleaned properly when we checked in. There was waste from previous guests still in the room! We were told there was parking for a $ 35 charge. On reaching we were told to go find our own! On asking where we could find one, we got almost no help!! Th wifi is extremely weak and erratic.  So why would someone stay here? For the location? At such a price?!!  Strongly suggest look for somewhere;1

Not recommended. Booked this room through Expedia and feel completely disappointed and scammed. The facility is in complete disrepair with some random updates throughout. The first night the water pipes inside bathroom wall burst @ 3am flooding the room. The next day I asked to speak with the manager about the incident. The desk clerk was rude and refused to reimburse any charges. She advised me that they had taken care of me by moving me to a new room (really?!). She also told me that my parking fees would be comped for the inconvenience, however I was still billed at checkout. The parking lot would have been secure but the automatic gate was either broken or out of tickets every time we went in/out. The phone in both rooms did not function. There was no house keeping service;1

"Booked this hotel through Thomas Cook in Deal Kent. This trip to NYC was supposed to be a birthday present for my partners 65th birthday But ""That"" was a mistake to start with as the agent recommended this hotel to us but she had never stayed there, yes it's central to all attractions and right next to Penn Station and Maddison Square gardens but after you admire the outside of the building you expect great things, and to be honest the main foyer to the hotel is full of Art Deco beauty but that's where it finished. The front of house staff were rude and arrogant also we were not told we would be stung with a $220 compulsory bill before they would give us our keys, this was to cover cleaning the room, use of conference facilities, wifi and use of the gym. Why the hell do I want";1
i just returned from the whole summer vacation in US and wanted to tell about my experience of staying in WooGo Central Park accomodation. It started up not so great when i mixed up the dates and booked the place a day before my arrival. But i didn't know that till i got there. It was a first surprise when i found that the room had been waiting for a whole day wasn't even made. We took a walk in Central Park with my wife and 6 year old daughter from 8 a/m till 2 p.m (the check in time). What a service, specially when you get off overnight flight. After we got into the room i found ripped sheets, dirty sticky floors and army of roaches, hunting for the food. We are not talking about 1 cockroach we are talking about an infestation.  The staff was told about this, and they promised;1

We are not picky what we want it is just a clean room, a good night sleep and polite service from the staff, nothing more. We stayed at this hotel only because we booked it as a âSecret Hotelâ using Latminute.com, otherwise we would have never stayed at this hotel considering the bad reviews that you can read on Tripadvisor, and I am sorry but I have to say they deserve every single bad review. Ok the room was big and clean but that is the only positive thing about this hotel. We woke up at 7:50 with a very loud noise of drilling and banging coming from the room above ours. They were obviously refurbishing the room and no one at the reception had the courtesy to tell us that when we checked in. When we told the receptionist she did not even apologise, she did not care a bit and;1

This was the most disappointing hotel during our three week trip to the USA.   Letâs start with one positive point. Itâs location on the doorstep op the Metropolitan Opera House is maybe itâs only redeeming feature.   The staff at reception is not very helpful of friendly. Upon arrival at our hotel room we found the electronic card reader out of order. The security officer had to open the room. Please note that this procedure had to be repeated later the same day. Maintenance only repaired the lock that evening. No apology ever offered.   The aircon in the room was noisy and not very effective.   They do not even offer a complimentary coffee station in the room.   The bathroom was also in need of a maintenance overhaul.;1
Bed bugs, it's all I need to say!!!! I though I would save some money by booking into this budget accomodation but at the end of the day I spent a fortune in drycleaners, buying new bags and new clothes because all my stuff was infested.  Also, from my room in 3rd floor, I could hear very well the music coming from the night club at ground floor.;1
No idea why this place has such high ratings! Upon initial check-in, the bunk room my son and I were given smelled like horribly smelly feet! I went and requested another room and found that this one also smelled like feet. Guess that's just the general smell of the place. Settled in to rest after walking six hours or so around the city. Realized something was biting me! Told the person downstairs who acted like it's not a big deal and said there's nothing she can do other than move me to another room and hope that they don't have them. Wow, really? And don't ask for a manager, because there's no one on duty! I happen to be here at a bad time with the UN Assembly going on and the cheapest room I can find in Manhattan is $400! So we moved at 10PM to a $400 room... we were lucky;1

Great Location, great soft beds, fantastic bells and parking service, great breakfast and service, the first room we were given was not clean we even found a used bandage in the wardrobe, they changed our room, small rooms, need upgrading.  On the 25th we had dinner in the hotel, 30 min before they took our drinks order, 40 min for the food order, water and a diet pepsi order never arrived we asked 4 times, after  55 min I went to star bucks and bought drinks, the food was served cold, rude waitress 10 person dinning and we were told sorry very busy.

"This place is such a disaster, it's hard to know where to start.  Here's a short list:  1.  They charge for everything:  parking is $60/day (no in and out); wi-fi is $18/day; the coffee in the room is $3.00 a cup; business center computers/printing--per minute charges; bottles of Evian left on the bedside tables are $8/bottle. 2.  2 of 4 elevators broken causing long waits to get upstairs or down; 3.  Threadbare carpets, etc., etc.Pretty dumpy feel--a facelift long overdue 4.   The ""pool""--you'll walk up two dingy flights of stairs past the top elevator floor to the pool deck to find a the sorest excuse for a pool you've ever seen--it's more like a single lane lap pool, but half the length.

It was extremely hot in the room but don't open your patio door, because God knows what might come crawling in!. I am very sorry I ever booked this hotel and will never stay here again.;1
Not a real fan of Regency Hyatt hotels for their general spartan quality, this was chosen for proximity to LAX. Cordial arrival, however upgrade request was declined for lack of availability from a basic queen room, which was false, witnessed by request to another receptionist, readily granted.  Hotel has no real restaurant. Just a bar and 7/11-style cafeteria they call Unity LA Restaurant. Left room for an hour to get snacks at Sheraton next door and my computer was stolen right out of the room. It had a vast amount of valuable data on it. Security and other hotel staff were useless, only urging me to file a police report.;1
I think they must be going to sell or convert this place. Itâs TOTALLY neglected worn out carpet,missing grout, patched but unpainted wall areas in the rooms and hallway TINY coffee pot 1) First they gave us a key to a occupied room with luggage and a used bed 2) Reserved a queen deluxe with convertible couch in a separate sitting room.

They gave us a miserable folding bed and nothing to sit on in the sitting room 3) The shower handle fell off and water ran out the handle, the drain plug in the tub was broken, the sink cabinet door was broken and hanging Some Elevator buttons donât work, they told me now to use the snack Mechines they were broken to go down the street.

Firstly when we arrived to check in we were advised the card machine wasn't working so we had to go find and take out cash, very inconvenient and impractical. Next we were shown to our room with a private bathroom which we got but the room was located next to the reception area and across the narrow hall the kitchen, so an ideal place to guarantee lots of noise and little chance of sleep due to the very noisy guest and rude staff.  Next the sheets on the 'double bed' (two singles which hadn't been zipped up) were dirty and full of hair....see attached pic. Upon requesting they be changed the receptionist asked me why? Isn't it obvious that we want clean sheets to sleep on? So eventually we got some cleaner sheets but still didn't feel 100% clean and comfortable. Only saving;1
Our big problem was the beds.  They were terrible.  My wife spent 6 out of 7 nights sleeping on the floor.  The beds were way too soft and hurt our backs.   We complained to house keeping and they put a board in the bed but that did not help.  Pillows were way too soft which did not give you proper support.  Towels in bath room were rough.  Further house keeping said that there is nothing else that they could do to help us with bed comfort.  My question to the management of the Hilton is,  would you expect your guests to sleep on the floor especially after spending so much money on this hotel? This stay at the Hilton was very disappointing.  When I think of the Hilton I think of excellence.  But this particular hotel failed to deliver on this.  We have stayed at other Hiltons;1
I booked this hotel on the position that it was close by for my daughter's pick-up point for camp. My daughter travelled solo for 2 nights in NYC and I trusted that this hotel would be a safe and clean location for her to stay. Quite the opposite! Shortly following my daughter's arrival, I received a phone call from her in tears. The welcome on arrival was far from friendly. She was told 'try this key on this 2nd floor room, if there are other people's belongings in it then come back and ill assign you to another room' - which she was left to do alone with her heavy luggage. Luckily for her it was an empty room. The corridors on the 2nd floor smelt like cannabis and the hotel had an overall gloomy feel. The shared bathroom was beyond disgusting (see photos) - surprised my;1
We have just had an amazing week in New York, the only negative was our hotel room it was tired  and worn, the bed was made of faux leather and was in a very bad condition the material was all peeling off of the  head board and the frame surrounding the mattress, the bathroom door didnât close and the toilet has not been installed straight so make things somewhat difficult,not sure who did the grouting in the bathroom but boy it is bad,the two drawer chest of drawers had a very worn faux leather top on it and two drawers which were another problem the top one had dropped so every time you opened the top one the bottom one opened to and you couldnât open just the bottom one , we were never offered the key to the fridge or told you could get breakfast all you get is a bottle of;1
I have stayed here twice. The first time last August was fine. The hotel is old and needs updating, but I liked the staff and the lobby is charming and the rates were fair. The room was small and old but good, and location to my family was good so I booked again. Last weekend the check-in for a 3 night stay was fine and the staff competent and friendly. My 1-star is for after night 2: THEY DID NOT SERVICE MY ROOM!!! (This has NEVER happened to me before anywhere!!!) When I returned at 10 PM and alerted the desk, the desk person kept asking--3 times--whether I was sure I did not leave out the do not disturb tag.  NO I kept repeating, I was out by 8:30 AM I kept repeating. They did promptly bring clean towels and emptied the trash on request, but did not follow up with a garbage;1
Read this review and stay away! Family of 5 booked the 6 person apartment. Stung by local taxes immediately on arrival, full payment up front because if they let you see the apartment first, you'd leave and find a good hotel for the same price or less. We should have listened to the other negative reviews. This place is dirty, noisy, unsecure, and staff are unhelpful and disinterested. The accommodation is uncomfortable and poorly laid out with very small living area and dirty bathroom. This is not Luxury! It is overpriced poor quality budget accommodation and yet is marketed as luxury. The image of the foyer is quite different to the apartment you get in every respect.;1
A club which used to be great. You'll now find over there disgusting cocktails, bad dj and a staff considering you as dumb... No doubt, I would prefer a dirty dive bar to this place. That's too bad for this beautiful old fashion hotel. The direction should change all of it soon in way to preserve the Hotel from this kind of disappointment...;1
I am still at this hotel right now, but after two nights I have to share my experience.  This hotel is in a good location, which is why I decided to stay here with my teenage daughter, the rest is bad.  I just fell in the shower because the anti-skid stickers are worn totally smooth, then when I step out of the shower there is no bath mat and I have to step onto slippery wet tile.  Our toilet has clogged, twice!  There are four elevators and at any given time it seems that only 1 or 2 are operational.  The air conditioning unit vibrates so we have chairs wedged against it to try and stop the vibration.  Yesterday when we got back to the hotel neither of our keys would work so we had to find a working elevator, return to the lobby, and talk to the bored people at the desk to fix;1
Vastly overpriced.  A basic premier inn with a premium price.  No phone in room. No hairdryer.  Breakfast was mayhem. The cheaper premier inn waterloo uses this one for breakfast resulting in chaos.

OK yes the staff are friendly, the location is great & one of the bathrooms on the floor I was on was almost brand new, however that's about all that's good about this place. The description on a number of travel websites sound good for a budget place, esp in Manhattan. However, where do I start when describing this rabbit warren... firstly I made a reservation, I rang to say I was on a late flight-all OK apparently but when I arrived I was listed as a no-show. So did they sell my room? Were there any vacancies? No! But it took them over 45 minutes to check me in & in the process they showed me to 4 rooms in different parts of the building (each building has its own unique 'shabiness')- all unmade, dirty(sheets and rubbish everywhere,including an old airconditioner just ditched;1
My young daughters and I wanted to see a show and I booked a room with two Queen beds. Upon arrival they told me that they didn't have a room with two Queen beds and instead they are upgrading me to a room with one King bed. I told them this wasn't an upgrade since the three of us couldn't fit in one Kingsize bed. They went back & forth and finally gave me a double King bed. The room was really average. Once I left they charged me for everything they could, a charger and the whole content of the minibar! I fought it for 5 months, finally got my money back but will never stay there ever again!;1

"I'm new to NYC and picked this place based on booking.com reviews (it had 8.0 score at the time of my booking and sounded like a very reasonable deal). I though the tiny rooms and shared toilets and showers accounted for the lower price... Well, I was WRONG.  The best one-work description for this place I can come up with is ""erratic"". See for yourself: I arrived around 8pm after an overnight flight and a full day at the office, was warmly greeted and shown into a tiny and perhaps a dash smelly, but reasonably cozy room with a bunk bed. I pretty much went straight to bed only to wake up at 6am next morning itching from bed bug bites and shivering from the cold -- apparently during the night some guests complained of it being too warm, so the staff decided to switch the heating";1
We had stayed at several Hilton hotels in different cities, but we were very unpleasant by the quality of Hilton LA Universal City.

We stayed at The Jane for one night and woke up to a 54 degree room.  I had to wear my winter coat in the room while I waited for my boyfriend to finish showering in the morning.  I discovered there was duct tape on our window attempting to stop a heavy draft- could feel the wind blowing!  The hotel let us know the city regulates their heat but they would have moved our room, given us a space heater, or had an engineer look into the issue when I called the front desk / provided feedback upon check out.  None of these options are conducive while getting ready for a day of business meetings at 7am and sound more like a convenient protection for the hotel for future repercussions.  From reading other reviews it appears they have had several complaints regarding AC and heat.  I;1

When I checked in I was told the extra fees were included in the $211. I even asked for a receipt, but they couldn't give me one. I wanted the bill so I could divide it in half so my friend could pay her half. I come home and I was charged an additional $69. Talk about cheating a guest!;1

"JustNewYorkHotels passed this one off as a 3 star. Dreamers. A 1 star would be generous. Two positives: 1) Good location, 2) good housekeeping in room. For the $225 per night that I paid, I felt cheated. Any complaint that I had would be met with ""We'll send someone up"". Never did see this mysterious 'Someone"" Phone didn't work but that was a plus since it cost 89Â¢ a minute. TV didn't work until the last two days when I was able to pull in 4 channels not counting the Spanish channels. Any complaint was met with an offer to change rooms.

Things seemed OK, but I awoke with SEVERAL bedbug bites. I cannot begin to describe the nausea and disgust I felt when I realized I slept in an infested room, and that I was attacked by bedbugs.

I was TOTALLY grossed out, and may NEVER stay at a Wyndam hotel again because of this.;1
We stayed at this hotel in June.  I can say our room look absolutely nothing like the pictures on the web.  The room was small but we expected that in NYC.  The shallow sink that wouldn't drain, the shower without a door and pieces of the shower head lying on the floor, no place to hang dresses as well as being dark and gloomy were some of the features we found disappointing.  The bathroom was so small there was no place to put hair and makeup items except on the closed toilet lid.  The feeling in the lobby as well as the hotel in general was shabby and worn out.;1

I picked the Hilton due to its close proximity to Universal Studios. It was a little more per night than I usually like to spend (359.00) but due to it being during a holiday I was willing to spend that amount. The first screw up from the hotel was giving me 2 double beds when I booked and paid for 2 queens but we checked in late at night and didnât care enough to complain. The room was large but the bed skirt was ripped on the one bed, the comforters smelt old and dirty, used soap was left in the shower from the previous guest, there was trash left under the TV stand and something had been split and left to dry on the nightstand.  I figured a Hilton would have better oversight of their housekeeping staff and should try harder in the future. I will never stay at that hotel;1

We had SO many problems at this hotel. STAY AWAY AND BOOK ELSEWHERE. Location may be good but it is NOT worth it.  Many other guests had similar problems to us and staff DO NOT CARE.   - Room not ready upon check in, no one could tell us how long we would have to wait (ended up being able to check in one hour later) - Room was DIRTY when we checked in. There was a NEW and WET coffee stain on the floor. We tried to call down to have this clean but after five tries we gave up as no one would answer - Bathroom is tiny, can barely fit in there.  - Draws in the room will not stay closed - TV constantly gets âno signalâ - People are the front desk are SO SLOW with any kind of request - Key card constantly stopped working  - Wifi did NOT work our entire stay. We were told by front desk;1
"Electrical power in the room depends on plugging in your room key so forget about charging a computer, phone, e-reader or iPad while you're out touring the city. Multiple doors between your room and the shared bathroom mean an all night symphony of banging doors keeping you awake. When I asked for a ""top up"" of my morning coffee, I was not advised that the coffee was neither bottomless nor included with the breakfast ... $7.00 for coffee on day 1! Last straw ... Just walked out of the hotel bar having been told in no uncertain terms that photos were NOT allowed. I won't be back in this lifetime!";1
My husband and i checked in on 9th August and checked out this morning (14th). We are HH Gold members and booked an Executive floor room. Our room 2471 (24th floor) from the check in it was a disaster. We asked for an upgrade as Gold members we are entitled to but the check in agent without even  blinking she said the hot is fully booked.. we were given 2 bottles of 2ater for the entire stay.  We had to pay USD10 extra to have the full breakfast buffet which is very average and the coffee sucks! Our room was not cleaned on the 2nd day and sleeping is impossible ad noisy children people talking loud and playing music in their rooms till late.. oh and they love to bang their doors 5 nights of suffering without sleep is finally over. Water stoped while we where in the shower..;1
Empire hotel sits right across the street from the Lincoln Center and it is my preferred place to stay when we come to see an opera. I arrived at Empire around 2:20 PM and was told I had to wait until 3 PM to check in.  When I returned to the hotel around 3:30 after a visit to the Met opera shop, the room was still not ready.  I waited in the lobby/bar area for the next 2 hours, and not a single time did a staff come to give me an update.  I only found out there was a room available upon my 4th visit to the front desk and was able to get into a room around 5:30.  I barely had enough time to prepare for a pre-opera dinner with a friend and opera at 8.  A relaxing and enjoyable experience was ruined by a stressful and not helpful check-in at Empire.;1
I was going to stay at this hotel for a week with my kids. I discovered the bathrooms had sliding doors that not only donât lock but they donât even close all the way. My teenage kids, like me, thought it was weird and couldnât stay in a place like this!  Stayed went to Marriott and asked if the bathroom doors locked and they laughed and said of course. Itâs not an LA thing. Just Hyatt being cheap.;1
My bad.  I should have read all of the reviews.  Particularly the ones that warned of odor.  I was prepared for a 50 square foot room and even prepared for the bath down the hall.

I will never stay in this disgusting cesspool of a hotel ever again!!! I am no prima donna but have basic standards of what I expect from hotel acccomodation. Water is one of them. Awoke on second day of stay to find there was no water. Only discovered this after having used the toilet. Disgusting!! Went to front desk and complained. Front desk staff gave bad attitude and lied about not knowing the water was going off. It wasn't hard to catch them out as the three people behind the desk all gave different answers and contradicted each other. I asked to see manager and he only added to the lies as in he promised a refund for the nights accomodation due to no water....guess what...no refund to date. The hotel is very run down. At home we would say the furniture should be left out;1

"Very rude staff.. I Tried to go and visit friends from the city who were inside, and was told by the bouncer very rudely that ""not everyone is welcome, and I'm just not one of them"" because I didn't have a guest list. He proceeded to make fun of me and told me to ""turn around, and get out of his bar""  I wasn't offended that I wasn't allowed in, I understand the concept of guest list.. But his condescending tone was unnecessary and a total turn off. I was very polite the entire time (I mean, I'm showing up late without a guest list, I have to be nice) but the entire staff there wasn't worth anyone's breath.   I am happy to not waste my money at this place. All my group left at this point and will never return... Gladly.";1

Travelled to US on holiday with our 3 children. Had to book two rooms to accomodate 5 of us. At time of booking requested interconnecting room, and to ensure that rooms were on same floor.

Before leaving on holiday emailed and rang total of 4 times and each time advised the same, was advised to check again when we arrived in US.  When arriving in USA rang the hotel and requested interconnecting room /room on same level.

We stayed at this hotel in September 2013 and it wasn't too bad, so when we decided to return to New York for a further short break we booked it again as it was certainly one of the less expensive hotels that we found through an internet search.   The good points last year, and once again this year, were the very close proximity to a Subway station, the excellent Manhattan Diner which is just a similarly short walk away around the corner, and the fact that Central Park is only about a 10 â 15 minute walk away.  Now for some items from the depressingly long list of negatives â    Unfortunately the train we were travelling on to New York (from Boston) broke down and it took 3 and a half hours to get the problem fixed. Therefore we were much later in arriving at the hotel than;1

First I should say this review is not about my stay in the hotel-it is reservation phase.  I was searching online to find a hotel to stay in my LA trip on 9/27/16 and I was looking for the special offers to see if I can find a good deal. So I saw Hollywood Hotel's offer saying '35% off room rate Was: $179 Now: $116'  and 'Valid for Redemption: Apr 5, 2016 - Dec 31, 2016 Offer valid any day of the week.'  How to redeem Use code: LH35  Also there is a link below 'Redeem Online' which directs me to Hollywood Hotel's webpage. When I put the promo code and check availability it says the hotel is full but when I go without the promo code bunch of rooms are available. And then I tried to call them and make the reservation through the hotel by phone - same thing, I explained them and;1

Dear fellow travelers, donÂ´t believe the name of this accomodation, itÂ´s not a hotel! The state of the rooms, the bathrooms, restrooms and the dirtiness just reminds me of one of my former student homes and thatÂ´s not a positive memory!

I arrived at Woogo Central Park at 10:30 at night with confirmed reservation in hand for two nights - a confirmation number, a pin number, and proof that Woogo had my credit card information AND that they accepted the type of credit card that I had given them.  I was told at the reception desk that I had to pay in cash upfront for two nights - over $800.  They said that after 10 at night they don't accept credit cards - this was never mentioned in any communication, not on the website, not on the confirmation.  With no other choices at that hour of the night (I did try to find another hotel but after two calls and no success gave up) I gave up and went to an ATM and got the cash.  Another guest was at the desk with the same problem.    When I did get up to my room, it was bleak,;1
This hotel is really showing it's age. The check in lines are long and Mr. & Mrs Johnny didn't get the room type we reserved. Also the toilet leaked all over the floor whenever you flushed it.

I have to qualify my review to state that we were given a heavily discounted rate (I think it was $350 for 3 nights) if we agreed to sit through a Wyndham Time Share sales pitch. We sat yes.  We arrived at the hotel around 11 am and waited in line to check-in for over 30 minutes - a true inefficient front desk (only 3 customers in front of us, but we still had to wait 30 minutes). Not surprisingly our assigned room was not ready. No worries, can we store our bags and come back around check-in time of 4 pm? Sure - FOR $5/BAG!! That's right, luggage storage costs $5/bag. No tipping allowed, but at that rate, I would not have offered one anyhow. The desk clerk promised that they would call us as soon as our room was ready. Fair enough.  I will interject here that the New Yorker is;1

That little pat on the back ended as soon as we stepped through the doors. The service was not only a joke but the accomadations nearly gave me an ulcer! The carpet smelled of urine and had fleas. Our room did not have a bathroom. Instead we had to share a bathroom with everyone else on our floor. Granted this is my first time here however don't most hotels offer bathrooms for each room???

We decided to come to the Hilton for our trip to Universal Studios. During our stay the first thing you notice is that on the main floor you have to walk through a buffet with your bags to get to the checkin area. The food could be coughed on or touched by anyone passing by, which is absolutely awful. You could also little kids grabbing and playing with the food. The price of the buffet was $54 for 11+ and $25 for 3-10. This pricing is awful, but a lot of people pay for it. From parking garage too food, just why? When we checked in we asked about senior discount which we had accidentally not clicked on and they had to make a big deal about senior discount being based on availability and how they couldn't give it to us for a list of reasons. Near us other people were mad at the;1

The property is in a good location and I like the shuttle to Universal Studios. The hotel had a Starbucks in it but itâs no longer there which is unfortunate. Itâs nice to have a less expensive option than the restaurant in the hotel. I have stayed at this property several times in the past so I was really excited to have my son experience it. I had never had a bad experience here before so I was really caught off guard when my son, daughter and I were returning from dinner in West Hollywood. Our Lyft which had picked us up at the lobby, was not allowed to come onto the property when we returned from a late dinner. One of the parking attendants that I noticed when we originally arrived on the property earlier stopped our driver when we first turned from Universal Drive to the;1
There was no toilet paper or towels when we got in the room. We ordered $120 worth of room service and they didnât give us everything. The front desk didnât give me any info about dining or accommodations. It was hard to get ahold of anyone.  It was just overall disappointing for what we paid. I will not be returning. To top it off I booked a room with a city view and got put on the 1st floor. I didnât even bother them with it cause at this point there was no point.;1

Tiny rooms. Rooms and hallways smell of stale cheese. Pillows smell like someone farted in to them.

Stayed for one night and that was more than enough.  Dilapidated rooms with antiquated HVAC.  My room was not refreshed and had no cups or glasses with which to make coffee from the in room keurig, and no one answered repeated phone calls even after 20 rings.  I finally gave up.  Lesson learned.;1

Absolutely nothing was good at all. The service was horrible the staff wasn't friendly. No room service. No hot water. No telephone in the room. No amenities like toiletries. AC doesn't work well. The wifi didn't work even after paying for it. Not worth it at all.;1
"If you care about service and cleanliness, this is not the hotel for you.  While the lounge was nice and the restauant looked great, the rooms and service fell incredibly short.  Our entire trip was an inconvenience.  We reserved a non-smoking room and were put in a room/floor that smelt so strongly of smoke.  Then, they moved us into another room for one night, which they called an upgrade but was clearly not an upgrade, for one night only.  At that point, they moved us to another non-smoking room that wasn't an ""upgrade"" for the remainder of our stay.  The shower and sink were clogged.  So after 5 minutes in the shower, I was standing with water up to my ankles.   The worst part about this hotel was the way they handled the issues.  We told management and several people at the";1
It looked good online and that is almost where the positives stop.   Cynthia in reception was helpful. The breakfast staff were friendly.   I was initially given a room which must have last been refurbished in the 80s.   Extremely worn out and dirty fittings. Very noisy even after I switched off every electrical appliance / item in the room. Just horrible. Did not get any sleep.   They changed my room and that was much better but still nothing special.   Poor housekeeping, rude reception staff who refused to make eye contact or listen to my concerns. The bar was never open.   My credit card statement shows an overcharge and is yet to be rectified.   This is an old, worn out property with staff who donât realize that they are in the hospitality sector.;1

If I could give it a 0 I would. Where do I start.. they obviously spend all their money on the lobby and the roof top bar. Although the lobby does offer free Wi-Fi it cuts out after 5 minutes. The rooms are so small you have to squeeze past the bed to get into the bathroom which by the way don't go there. From the mould in the shower, the disgusting drain in the shower, to the dirty toilet it was a disgrace. House keeping need to be fired, They don't even vacuum and even if you place the house keeping sign out AND double check with reception they still don't get done. Their staff are a disgrace and deserve to be fired.

First of all, the room smelt like weed and looks like a dive - very dirty and not maintained at all. Upon arrival, check-in was quick but after unpacking and settling in we could hear very loud scratching/squeaking coming from the radiator (we were on the 7th floor so the whole hotel MUST be infested). Went straight to reception to say that there's a rat/ mouse in the room and they changed the room immediately (even though during check in they had told us there were not any other rooms available). Without any questions asked - clearly this is a problem that they must have a lot!!! The new room stunk of cigarettes constantly. The cleaners didn't mop or change the sheets. The windows didn't open so the room was constantly stuffy and the air vent was so dusty and blew out dust when;1
Ordered for a city view top floor room received a parking lot view despite paying extra. Rooms were average as to the price that was being charged. Overall quite disappointing experience to say the least;1
"Where do I begin?  OK, location is very inconvenient.  The west village is so beatutiful, true, but the hotel is all the way over at the west side hwy.  If the weather is not beautiful, you're going to spend a fortune on taxis, which are scarce.  If you have great weather, its at least a 20-30 minute walk to Soho, the Village, etc. So, you really don't have a good ""base"" during your trip.  Next, the staff - generally ok, but not at all polished.  I hate those weird monkey suits they all wear.  The rooms (I had a deluxe with privte bathrm) are small, which is ok, but lets just say weirdly furnished with tiny little $100 window AC units that are noisy. The bathroom amentities are not graciously replenished or replenished at all for that matter.  The cafe staff is nice and";1

This was a horrible experience. Although, location is prime, that is it! Checked in and went to our room. It smelled. When I went to pull back bedding, there was food stuck to pillowcases, food stuck on bedside table and popcorn under bed. All the furniture was extremely dusty. Front desk âupgraded â (lol) to another room. It was dusty and smelly too. Had a crappier bathroom that had a torn sticky bathtub mat and hair in the tub. There was a bottle cap on shelves. They gave us a view of universal but the window was so filthy. Coughed and eyes itchy because of dust. Mattresses wee sunken in and super uncomfortable. Went to restaurant. It was overpriced and food was terrible. The lounge food was wilted lettuce and overcooked chicken. There is no coffee or tea station in lobby and;1
I had one of my worst hotel experiences at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel. The only positive aspect of that hotel is the very nice housekeeping staff. The front desk has very poor customer service and does not seem to care for the guests needs or requests at all.  The rooms also vary considerably. There is a part of the hotel that has not been remodeled which has absolutely awful rooms. Although, there were two of us, we were given the smallest room in the hotel, just over 100 square feet.,with a tiny bathroom. Looking at the floor plan on the door, we could see that our room was 1/2 the size of all the other rooms on the floor and was the only one that size. When I asked the next day to change the room, I was told that if there was another room, it probably wouldn't be available;1

This is the seventh time l have been to the Empire Hotel. My room was so humid it took my breath away with the smell and all my hanging clothes stank. To add insult to injury l had a lot of money stolen from my case. It was investigated l was told and the upshot was lit was my fault and l mustâve lost it somewhere else. Great no ? The staff was interviewed l was told and big surprise no one came in my room, well actually they did and when they saw my case opened where the money was they closed the door!  Obviously!!! So there we are ! I let you judge for yourself ! Honesty is not the culture of the Empire Hotel and the client is far from being king! Very sad indeed!;1
My stay at the premier inn London County Hall was unpleasant. Great location but shanty town environment. It didnât worth the money . Out of my 15 days stay, several days no hot water. I spoke to front desk. I am as told to go next door and take a shower. I had to pay to go to another hotel for two days to take a shower. I complained to guest relations and nothing was done. The breakfast was horrible. I had to cancel. I wouldnât recommend any to stay there. My rating is 1. The hotel never notified me that there was hot water. After my 15 days I checked into another premier inn the hub on 21 Tothill St, my stay there was awesome. It was welcoming and worth it. London county hall workers are unprofessional and there is no inclusiveness in hat establishment. They only pretend that;1
Arrived a couple of hours ago, check in was quick and efficient but everything has been downhill since then, given keys to the smallest room I have ever stayed in on the bottom floor next to the noises from the main road ten feet away asked to be moved but told the hotel was full , it isnât! Asked about the complimentary breakfast to be told the restaurant is closed so no dinner or breakfast decide to go for a drink instead only to be told bar is closed since covid ( thought that was 2 years ago Still awake due to outside noise !!;1
The service was really bad and awuful.  The internet was very weak and I couldnÂ´t get through. I got locked up twice in the room. The telephone room never worked, I told the supervisor though. Unfair charges;1
I chose this hotel because of its excellent location, and because it was a Wyndham brand so I expected a certain level of service. Unfortunately, this was the biggest mistake of my vacation. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 and there was an extremely long line to check in. A gentleman behind us mentioned that he had stayed here before and seen similar lines even at 9 p.m. so this was not unusual. When we finally arrived to the front, the woman at the desk was extremely rude. She rushed through everything she was telling me without looking at me once, so it was hard to understand her mutterings. I realized I agreed to the dreaded hotel fee everyone on TripAdvisor mentioned without the desk agent even mentioning that she was charging my card. She then, under her breath,;1
The Newyorker may have seen better days in the past, today it is a tourist trap where tour groups arrive by the busload. Almost no business travelers and no frequent visitors. Reality is far from what you see on the website.   Two women at the rewards desk (just before check in) were making fun of a guest as soon as he left the counter, because he was overly polite and spoke spoke with an east asian accent.   Website says breakfast at TicToc diner included and then the fine print reveals that only on weekends, on weekdays you go up to the Sky lounge which is a dull, empty room with a few tables and chairs where the pastries, breads, fruits weren't refreshed throughout my week long stay.   I have stayed at several other hotels in the vicinity as I travel to NYC  few times every;1
It was my first trip ever to New York I chose the empire hotel because I heard it was a 4 star hotel, it has been used for movies. So I felt safe by choosing that one and it was very well located. When I checked In they gave me a first room, the carpet was dirty, dusty, the room was on with a street view and badly insonorated so you I was hearing everything from the streets in my room it was horrible. The bathroom was old dirty with no towels. I went at the reception asked for a second room.Then the second room I had was dirty, had moisture and there was hair on the sheets. I asked to check out immediately,and they didnât let me. They said I couldnât check out before my end of the stay. I asked them to refund me they didnât want not even compensating.I left the hotel without;1
We stayed the night before an early morning flight.  The blackout curtain didn't close all the way so we were awake most of the night.  When I mentioned this to the desk clerk when we checked out there was no reaction, no response, no apology, no concern.  She didn't make a note about it, so I'm sure it won't be repaired. We will be staying there again on our return and this time I'll check the blackout curtain before we unpack and settle in.;1
Feces, mold and temp control dont work.  We checked in on Sunday the 11th.  Checked in went to room left luggage and went out.  Set temp control before we left to 65.  Came home at 12:30 with two small children after Christmas shows and walking and the room was 77 degrees...  kids exhausted and put to sleep / tried.  Woke up tired hot and miserable.  Go to shower and find mold in shower, sheets I fell into being so tired had feces on them, and heat was still 77!  Mentioned this to the front desk and hey said they would investiagate and get back to me.  Long story short the essentially called us liars, everything worked, no mold and feces were not there when we checked in.   Thanks no thanks.  Donât stay here.;1
The hotel was the worst hotel I ever stayed in, the paint was peeling from the walls, curtains had big stains. I had to sleep in my clothes. Don't go there! I booked through priceline.;1
It was a nightmare for staying in this Hilton property!!!  Check in: My families and I had stayed in this hotel from Dec 24th to 26th. Once we got there around 4pm (their check in time is 4pm), we had to wait for more than 10 minutes to check in due to the volume of guests which was understandable. The front desk agent (Melissa) didn't greet us as a high profile guest. She just threw the waters to me and here you go there is the keys. That was it. Well! She didn't even mention about the shuttle bus to Universal Studio.  SO, we had to walk to the park into the rain. At this point, I didn't feel empathy at all.  Rooms: We checked in to the first room(Rm #1559). I found the hair on the bed after I flipped over the duvet. I called to guest service right away regarding to room move.;1

It was our first visit to New York and we wanted to stay somewhere close to transit, and not too expensive.  We just planned to sleep there.  I will give it a plus for proximity to Subway, just steps away.  That was the only good thing about it.  First off, they provide discounted parking around the corner at a Hertz rent a car garage.  This place does not have ample parking and attendant told me that they never have sufficient parking for the hotel.  Ended up parking across the street $31/day.  Room was very dingy.  It smelled.  Very cramped.  Poor selection of TV channels.  Couldn't watch Monday night football on TV, not available, in New York I might add.

My flight was delayed by 3 hours and I checked in after midnight or I would have looked elsewhere.  Only reason I was in this inn was an error in booking my next accommodation  was made and this place was given as an option.....they have been informed of the state of this inn. It is a lower cost place  ($105.00 per night) - but I would not recommend it unless there are no other optionsavailable (  WIFI is only available in the front reception area - other guests sitting on the stairs on their computers - poor WIFI signal from conversations with these people) OK - to begin - I had trouble finding the room within this Inn.  After getting my luggaqe up to the 4th floor in the tiniest elevator I have ever been on I searched for  412 troughout the whole 4th floor.  I had to go back;1
I stayed here with my teenage daughter as her first trip to NY!  Someone had recommended this hotel to me however I was really disappointed:(  The hotel is out dated and over priced for what it provided!  The only thing it has going for it is that it is in an ideal location!;1
The room was very small, dark, and freezing when we arrived. I tried switching the delapadated unit to heat, but no hot air came out. The room was very dark with not enough light. Hi he next morning I took a cold shower. The dial was loose and it wasnât until the second day when I realized I had to push forcefully while turning the knob to get hot water to come out. There was no bottled water in the room, no room service, and the mini fridge was on the floor in the middle of the room.;1
Bugs all over the bathroom- this is very disturbing. And personal items removed from my room- staff did not help with this and did not follow up this for me. Wonât be returning. Very disappointed. Location is not great you need an Uber to get everywhere.;1
This has been the worst hotel experience I've ever had. This is also the first negative review I've ever written. I only booked this hotel for the pool they advertise on their website. The pool was closed indefinitely and they never mentioned that on their website. To make up for the pool being closed they gave me free internet...the internet doesn't work! They also upgraded my room...the rooms A/C is incredibly old and the engineer said it really doesn't work. The manager initially offered me free breakfast to make up for the experience. This 4 star hotel is an insult to 2 star hotels. UPDATE. Literally, as I was writing this review the hotel delivered a fan to my room because my A/C doesn't work. It took them 30 minutes to deliver the fan and IT DIDN'T WORK. Words can't;1

Although we stayed here following a night at the Montage in Laguna Beach, we are hilton honors members so understand what a typical hilton should be. Hopefully we hit it on an off day but the first night we had zero hot water. They called at around 10:00 pm to say it was resolved but it wasn't. So the next morning we turned on the shower and it was scalding and wouldn't cool off. So I used that water to make my tea and headed off to Universal...sans shower. At about 3:00 pm we returned to see if the water issues were resolved.  It was back to tepid so we decided to check out early.   The manager said that she would offer us a free night due to the incoveniences but we never received a letter and now it has been almost 4 weeks since our stay. The only positive is location but if;1

We got woken up by some noise, it was rodent eating our food! Place is a disaster, bathrooms are totally disgusting. We preferred not to shower then use their facilities.   Location is good if you like hostel like accommodation, except that you will pay four times more then for the hostel. If you decide to rent it, check the room and bath first - you will look for something else!  WORST hotel EVER!!!;1

"Based on the other reviews about this dump of a hotel, I obviously got lucky and had a ""good room"" - a junior queen suite or something like that. $880 for 4 nights.  The location is great - there's a 1-2-3 subway stop a minute or so walk away. That's the only positive thing I can say.  The furniture in the room looked like the hotel bought it as a job lot from the demolition of a seedy motel in the worst part of some town. Two air conditioning units were so deafening it was hard to speak let alone here the sounds of the city. ADVICE: if you want a quite room, this ain't the place.  For the fours nights my wife and I were there, we were given exactly one 10ml bottle of shampoo - between us!  I was surprised that there was a disposable razor. For the first time ever I forgot mine.";1
"After planning this trip methodically to include a carriage ride in central park, broadway show, shopping on 5th Ave and seeing the sights, I was beyond excited.  This excitement was short lived.  On returning to our room after an amazing day out I discovered my handbag ( Loius Vuitton ) had gone missing.  I immediately informed reception who sent a security guard to our room.  In fairness he asked all the necessary questions and said it would be treated as a serious incident and dealt with accordingly.  I spoke to several managers over the course of the day as I was extremely upset, mainly because the handbag had been a gift.  I was assured that the handbag "" would be made whole "".  I returned to the UK, and rang on a daily basis. I was left on hold for long periods of time or";1
"Sadly, the only reason I am giving this hotel 1 star is because of the location.  It is located directly across the street from Lincoln Center.  Outside of that, the entire experience was terrible.  The receptionist was very rude when I checked in, the room was fine - nothing spectacular for the price you are paying and clearly very old.  Things were broken and the room was in poor shape.  The air conditioning unit under the window was very loud and cooled very poorly.  We had two double beds so the person next the ac was frozen all night while the person on the other side of the room was hot.  The ""fitness room"" was a joke.  Located in the basement where no one could see or hear you (kind of like going to a dungeon), dark, hot, and all of the equipment was broken.  The";1
For the price of this room, I expected way more!! We got there after a long day, so the app check in was nice. Only hotel around us to not have an airport shuttle, front desk told us to call Lyft. Said online it had airport shuttle but not to Universal studios because of covid, fair. No airport shuttle and we called a Lyft for universal studios and as we are waiting the shuttle for Universal studios shows up and leaves before we could get on! The front doors and doors by the restaurant all leaked when it was raining. They had towels out and a machine sucking up the water out of the carpets.  You have to pay for every little thing!! Internet $20 a night, contenental breakfast $15. I got this hotel because I wanted to surprise my mom with somewhere really nice. Wish I would have;1
If you are staying here for a night or so. You can get through. For a longer stay where you have a lot of luggage and items for the bathroom, thereâs very little storage. Suitcases are all over the floor with a tiny closest set quite high. And it is not that cheap. Maybe stay at the YMCA if money is a concern or at Trump Tower if money isnt and you are planning to go to Lincoln Center.;1

This hotel is aesthetically nice, but the service is TERRIBLE. I reserved a suite with 2 double beds months in advance for myself, one other bridesmaid, and the bride to share the night before her wedding. I also made sure to add the bride's name to the reservation so that she could access the room prior to my arrival. I called to confirm the double bed suite and the additional name on the reservation prior to the arrival. The bride showed up and was told her name was not on the reservation, and she was not granted access to the room. Additionally, they put us in a suite with one bed. They were able to move us rooms after we complained, but not without giving us attitude and using the excuse that their reservations are outsourced. We did not receive an apology or any;1
This hotel is not for the faint at heart. My colleagues and I booked three rooms to extend our stay following business meetings in NYC. The neighborhood near this hotel is wonderful but the accomodations are nearly nasty. The lobby and staff are pleasant enough but the journey to your room is dirty and smelly. Our door locks did not lead you to believe you were secure. The rooms are spartan and less than sanitary. Ours came complete with roaches, towels that were not clean and even contained hair balls. If you need your luggage held after check-out they stuff it in a janitor's closet and ask you to leave cash on each piece for an unidentified keeper. It's just creepy.;1
I mean the place is rundown and it smells, bottomline.  If you are young and just looking to party in NYC, then it might suffice.  If you have a girlfriend then skip this dive.  The maids do their best (they do actually clean well), but there is only so much they can do.  It is one of those places you feel like you are dirty again after stepping out of the shower.  It is a great location though.;1
Stayed here from the 3rd till the 7th February,the hotel stunk of cannabis and the rooms were not nice or what are advertised,wallpaper hanging off the walls and rubbish on the floor!!

Room in the hotel is tiny (even by NY standards).  The room smells and the bathroom has mildew on the wall.  They charge extra for everything.  Even the business center charges you to print tickets.  We went to a bar for a drink and couldn't get service for 30 minutes.  The AC is insufficient for the room and it isn't even summer.  It was 45 degrees outside, we had the AC on max cold and it was still too warm in the room.;1

Yes this is a Hilton hotel in name, but certainly not in quality.  Let's start with the obvious issue...   the elevators.  They are broken and appear to have been broken for some time.  You actually have to call down to the lobby for them to send an elevator if you do not want to wait 5-10 minutes for one.  And during checkout times?  Forget it.  Scores of angry travellers desperately trying to get onto an elevator, luggage in tow, so they can make their flight or other obligations.  Sounds hellish?  It is.  Next:  Their management policies.  $5 to send up a fork, even when the issue was their mistake.  $35 a night for extra blankets.  Nickel and dimed even though the room cost > $300 a night BEFORE taxes.  Let me back up a second and explain.  We returned from a late night at;1

The quality of the Days Hotel Broadway on W. 94th St. in Manhattan was deplorable.  I booked through hotels.com in advance and that was unfortunate.  I had little leverage with getting any money back while staying at the hotel.    When I arrived on Dec. 7th I was in a room where the wallpaper was peeling, the A/C had parts missing and operated poorly.  The TV was from the 90s and the remote did not work.  Both sides of the mattress had metal prongs sticking out that jabbed your skin as you got in and out of the bed.  The night table had a drawer with a missing handle.  The carpet had major stains and tears in it.    I requested another room the following morning as they were booked fully the night I arrived.

You had to run the hot water in the sink for a long time before it got hot.   There were strange looking individuals (in my opinion) checking in and hanging around the lobby. I came downstairs one time and I saw a man laying down on the lobby seats with a women sitting right next to him.

I just read a review from another member with a surprisingly similar experience.  My family and I confirmed our two-day reservation with Days Broadway two days before our scheduled arrival.  At that time I was told that the room was fully paid, and I was given information about location and parking.  Upon arrival, I was told that there was no reservation and that the hotel was fully booked for the night - we were left stranded in NYC at 8PM without a place to stay!  Fortunately, we were able to find a tiny room at the nearby Newton for $230 for one night (they were booked up the second night) and then a room at the Alexander for the second night. The employees at Days Broadway were unprofessional, cold, and rude.  Even though the Newton and Alexander are far from ideal, they are;1

We could only reach the manager by phone and she did not want to collaborate. They refuse to give us our money back. We had to leave the hotel one night earlier because we did not feel safe in that environment and did not want to leave our things alone again. They havenât given us the stolen money back neither what we paid to stay there (they stole more than what we paid for 3 nights at their hotel)!! We are waiting for a position from booking.com.

We booked this hotel almost two months prior to our upcoming visit after researching hotels that could accommodate families of 5. TEN DAYS before our trip we received a message that the hotel overbooked by 200 rooms! We were given two choices: a room at a nearby hotel with two twin beds or the option to cancel without penalty and receive 25% off for a future stay at the New Yorker. We called for clarification and were told the same story. Offering two twin beds at a lower level hotel when we're a family of five?! Absurd. And what good is 25% off a future stay when we're traveling from out of state? After this fiasco, they think we'd even consider visiting their hotel? Not a chance. We travel frequently - at least once a month. We have never had this happen and can't imagine any;1

"Worst hotel I've ever experienced!!!  Staff is rude, arrogant and unprofessional. Booked the hotel because they had free parking but when we got here, parking for one night was $24. I therefore asked the receptionist about the free parking, and she said we could park in the street if we wanted to risk a fine. Served in a unnecessarily rude tone.  We then continued to check in, where you have to agree to ridiculous terms and conditions such as that the hotel is not responsible for any insects or insect bites during your stay. Both of our credit cards got declined - we asked for a reason - got none. We then asked the receptionist if they didn't take foreign cards and got another silly, arrogant response: ""Yes, ALL THE TIME"". We then continued to find an ATM in order to pay with";1

I explained that wont really work for us she got a guy who came out after some back and forth he looked like a manager he seemed quite rude and aggravated and was exasperated.

First of all, I am a frequent business traveler to NYC and stay in a variety of hotels depending on the location of my business meetings. Uptown, midtown, downtown. I usually try to stay close to where I am going for the convenience.   Although the Empire Hotel is close to Lincoln Center and the upper West Side DON'T STAY HERE!! As previous reviewers have stated, spend the couple of extra dollars and go elsewhere.   My husband accompanied me on this business/ pleasure visit this time and so as a treat I upgraded to a superior room. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!  A dark interior room with a view  of air conditioning units out the one window that was broken and could not be opened.  A bathroom so bare and spare with a small, broken  pedestal sink, cracked old tiling and an annoying fan that;1
This only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location.   The hotel is truly awful, from the minute you step up to the doors the staff are uninterested and unhelpful,  the rooms unappealing and tired.   NEVER AGAIN!;1
Dusty old room with no kettle, coffee machine or fridge. For the price we paid you would expect these things :( staff were the only highlight. Invoice kept growing from original price i Isidro in booking.com. (Still awaiting answers in this 2 weeks on).;1

Worst place Iâve ever been. Tried to go to the bar with a group of 8 and was told that weâd have to buy multiple bottles to get in, despite the fact that they were letting many groups of 2 or 3 into the bar without a drink commitment. If you want to go with a large group pretend that  you are smaller groups of 2 and you will get in no problem.;1
We stayed 5 nights at this hotel, and I regret every minute. I decided to booked it, as it had some ok reviews, and the price was reasonable. I wish I would have spend a few more dolars and stayed at better place. Staff were not friendly at all, and not very helpfull. Our room was on the first floor, close to entrance and the elevator.. We were awake really early in them morning, as it was very loud outside of the room, people talking in the reception area, by the elevator. I asked at the reception if they had any other room available. The guy was not friendly, and told me that were no rooms available and our room was one of the quiet room in the bulding!!!!! I can not imagine the other rooms then!!! I was really surprise by his lack of customer service. The room was old,smells;1
Tub faucet belches brown water when you change the hot/cold mix.  Shower kit was random.  Instead of shampoo/body wash/conditioner I got 2 shampoos and a body lotion one day and 2 body lotions and a shampoo the next. Open shower idea in a tiny bathroom is a bad idea.  Couldn't help but flood the bathroom and they forgot to bring a floor towel one day.   I travel on business and been in many hotels and never really rate them or complain. I focus on why I'm there and don't care much about the hotel unless it goes out of its way to get in the way.;1
I was there for an event at Lincoln Center...conveniently located, but: Room was so small that there was no space for shoes (had to be on top of fridge, which was inside the tiny cupboard), and the bathroom door wouldn't open completely as it hit the toilet. Archaic A/C-Heater system, manual and noisy. Humidity stains on walls. Safety deposit box was not tied to anything, so it was useless. Last day, water boiler was broken, so no hot water in the morning...in New York in November... For $300+ a night, worst experience ever.;1
Have to say most service was pretty decent, however, the hot water was unavailable in the morning of checking out, it was impossible to take a cold water shower in such a cold day. The checking out staff did not even mention the fact and apologize, instead, trying to hide out. For that reason, I just don't like the experience.;1
We booked in may this year this hotel because it has an swimmingpool on the roof. This was key for us. Payment was directly made 1260,- euro for 6 nights.  When we arrived in the early Morning our checking lady told us that the room wasn't ready yet. We said No problem we just wait at the pool and Enjoy our stay there.   She was a bit shocked and said: You did not know but our pool is Already out of use for quite some time. We told her that we Where not been informed any way because of this matter. She apoliced for this and we said that this was an key reason shy we made the booking for this hotel. If we had known this we had cancelend the booking and booked an other hotel with an operational pool!  We made the proposal that If we find an other hotel with an pool the hotel;1

This hotel has only three things going for itâ¦location (right next to Lincoln Center and close to Central Park), good beds, and it appears to be fairly clean.  We just returned from a four night stay in late November 2011.  We stayed in a âDeluxe Roomâ paying approx. $540 a nightâ¦hardly a cheap room, even for NYC.  There was just too much wrong with the room to be satisfied with the Hotel.  There are hotels that disappoint and hotels that simply leave a foul taste in one's mouth...this one is the latter.  The bathrooms are small, about 7âx7â with the walk-in shower only half glassed so that when taking a shower it was virtually impossible to not flood the floor with a significant amount of water.  The bathrooms had virtually no counter space due to a foo-foo stand-alone sink;1

My wife and I went to New York for our two year anniversary. We booked a room at the Astor for the 3 nights, because of the price deal we found ($189 for all three nights on hotwire) do yourself a favor and pay a little more for something nicer. The main problem was the noise that started up at midnight on our first night. This was the 6th floor. It sounded like something (or someone) was hitting a metal pipe with a hammer right above our room in the ceiling. It was loud and wouldn't stop. About 1:30 we had enough.  I went downstairs to the front desk and asked the two guys working about what the noise was. One of the men was on his personal phone and turned his back to me. The other man had a crappy attitude and seemed bothered I was addressing him about the noise.  He said he;1
Would not EVER stay here again, or recommend it. However, if you enjoy grumpy, rude staff, boiling hot rooms, the heady & constant waft of illegal substances being smoked inside and outside rooms, groups of men smoking & shouting at each other outside into the late hours, having food stolen from your room by someone with access to your room key while you're out, and Reception staff who don't care when you raise illegal drugs & theft issues, then you've hit the jackpot!;1
We have just returned from a trip to the 'Big Apple' and stayed at the Astor on the Park.  Do not be fooled by the other reviews - this place stinks!!!  It is filthy dirty, the toilets overflow, the staff are surly and downright rude, the concierge gives you false information - ie $65 to the airport - flat rate guaranteed - when we got there the driver said 'no - $83 - he always says that!!', beetles crawl the walls, the carpet is so disgusting I wouldn't walk on it without my shoes and the lift ensures you say your prayers and ensure your family know your last wishes before you get on board.  It was a terrible experience and one I would not like to repeat.  This place should be drummed out of business.;1

Aside from not having amenities of common standards to hotel across the country,  THIS hotels methods of unethical operations as ot pertains to erroneous charges to my credit card for room service and restaurant meals that were in fact never had or received to my credit card is despicable.

"I was sceptical after reading the reviews on here and then though to myself ""people only bother writing about the bad stuff"" right? Wrong! I wish I'd listened to what people were saying!  You are lured into a false sense of security when you arrive at the hotel, the lobby is nice and makes you think the rest of the hotel will be but it isn't.  My first room was like something out of a 1950s horror film. It was old, dingy and very very dirty - as in inch thick dust around the skirting boards, curtains that didn't close, tape around the windows etc - everything I'd read about previously and decided not to believe! We decided we only had to sleep there and would just deal with it. We went out but on retuning found water pouring through the light fitting in the bathroom from the";1
Not worth the price!  Hotel staff only accommodated a change of rooms.  They made no effort to apologize for poor conditions which leads me to believe they are well aware of the situations.  Juilliard should be aware since they made the original referral.;1
The lounge of the hotel looks great, but when you go up to your room you will soon see that that was the best place of the hotel. No room for parking your car, you have to pay for the Wifi which is really bad, the rooms are small and not so great, the elevator makes noise just like the airco and the people that clean the rooms.The pool was out of use. Very expensive breakfast. The only positive of the hotel is the location, near metro and Central Park. But I would never book this hotel again.;1
I did a lot of research to find the best hotel to stay at while we went to Universal Studios.  It is a great location, but the rooms are not clean and the level of customer service of the management is appalling. Most of the staff is helpful and our check-in was smooth.   However, the bellman ripped us off and gave us incorrect change (I didn't notice until he was long gone-prob my stupidity for not checking right away).  The room was not  clean and our fridge did not work. We didn't realize it didn't work until late the first night and had busy packed days that I did not alert the hotel staff. I did tell the house keeper that the room need to be cleaned better because it was not acceptable.  After, we got home from our trip I was asked for feedback on my stay via the Hilton;1
Walked in to check in, the lady at the desk didn't even acknowledge us and when we got up to our room it had a horrible smell, the lights in the bathroom didn't even exist and when we asked for it to get fixed, they said it would be done straight away but it hasn't. So we have had cold showers in the dark, and have paid $700 for a 4 night stay in a room the size of a shoebox. I don't recommend!;1
"I returned yesterday from a break with my daughter and mother and unfortunately stayed here. At the front door they have 2 security guards, one on an external door and one on an internal door, with a space in the middle.  They have a system with people queuing to get in/out. There was a revolving door, but of course that was out of order. The lady at check in was impersonal to the point of rudeness.  She typed stuff into the computer and said, ""credit card"". I asked how much security was to be taken and she said 4 nights, $140.  I felt as though I shouldn't have asked her. We waited for around 15 mins for an escalator as only half worked. They said they are due to refurbish them sometime never. We were in one room, two queen sized beds.  I know New York rooms are small but this";1

The whole experience was terrible.  So I booked this because Iâm a gossip girl fan and all I have to say is chuck bass is a liar lol. Hotel made us wait hours for the room to be ready, they were unapologetic about it.  Got to the room with a view of a brick wall and it was filthy dirty.  Bad smell and we wouldnât dare shower.  Overall just a huge disappointment.  Booked for 2 nights and checked out after the first night, wouldnât stay there again if it was free.  One positive is the location is fantastic.;1
I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with friends.  No problems with check in, or finding our room, which was spacious and had everything we needed!  Had to pay for parking, but I think that was a good idea as the area that the hotel is located in wasn't very friendly!  Had a day of sightseeing and when I got back to the hotel I noticed that money was missing from my bag.  We made sure that our passports and money were securely locked away, but I had some english money in my hand luggage back, which was not locked away, I noticed this straight away, as I had a Â£20 note wrapped around two Â£10's and one Â£5, I noticed that the Â£5 and Â£10's had been seperated and the Â£20 was missing.

There arenât any restaurants in walking distance & if there were you sure donât want to walk there with your family.....itâs a very shady neighborhood. You have to Uber or Lyft to get to any kind of restaurant or bar.....or anywhere. I was able to look past that until the rest of the amenities fell through. Every single vending machine on every floor was either empty or didnât work......we couldnât even get a water or snack for the kids. They also advertised they had a bar/lounge. Upon arrival they informed us it wasnât open till Wednesday, when Wednesday rolled around they were still not open. The people walking around once the;1

rooms looked much better in photos. In actually they are old, poorly lit and dirty.  We found hair in the bath tub, a clogged sink, a lumpy bed upon our arrival. The front desk service is a hit or miss. Housekeeping is lazy.  The bathrooms are old with chipping and stained bath tubs (i've never experienced this before). Shower pressure is great but the shower curtain can't handle it.  The hotel is miserly about lighting in the rooms and it's all white dim lighting at night.  They were also terrible about honoring a complimentary breakfast included with our stay add per our booking confirmation - even though we had it IN written. Considering it was a long stay, we therefore spent a lot on breakfasts out.  Lastly the hotel does not have any  plates and provide only plastic glasses;1
Walk the few extra blocks from Lincoln Center and stay at a nice hotel.  Front desk bad.  Room bad. Service rude.  Room service non existent.  Way too little for its full service price.

We booked three rooms for a party of 5.  Only one, 205, was acceptable.  On two nights the room cleaning was late and on one day we had no room cleaning at all.  Room 222 was absolutely dreadful - trumpet being played in room next door at any time during night - 2am, 4am etc - plus strong smell of cigarette smoke from that room.  After two nights we had to request to move room, staff clearly knew this was a recurring problem but were unable to do anything about stopping it as it is occupied by a long-term resident. The new room (508) was OK.  The third room (216) was smaller than the other two and had a small, dirty, non-opening window looking onto a fire escape covered in dirty rags.

Terrible services!!! Terrible concierge!!! Dated room!! The fourth floor to the eighteenth floor are dorms and small schools, not a hotel! And we were put on the 19th floor! We reserved the room with king size bed but was given the twins instead without any explanation. The receptionist just said it would be more comfortable for you two. But I wanted one King size bed and she could not make the decision for me!! The concierge's manner was really bad. When we asked for the cheapest way to get to the airport, he offered the most expensive choice first, which is  to get there by taxi! We had to find the information on our own until we got to know that there s a shuttle to the airport. We bought the ticket from the concierge, who was not really pleased with our choice. Our flight;1
Myself and my family stayed here at the end of October and I have to say I agree with the negative reviews below. The hotel rooms are tired the shower is nearly impossible to work and broken pipes means your shower to be flooded. I also found some of the reception staff to be particularly rude and arrogant towards us. The drinks and food are astonishingly high, especially as the bar/restaurant next door was fantastic and at least half the price. All in all a disappointment for us. We will be returning to New York but not to this hotel.;1
The room was dirty, very small, outdated TV, very Foul smell on the hallways. The customer service gave us 2 rooms that were supposed to be connected when we had the reservation. When we got there they don't even have rooms connected or close to each other, we had our girls with us and that made the stay a little bit tough. The location is great but that's it nothing else.;1
This was truly the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.  Just stayed there in december 04.  The rooms were filled with mold and the carpets were wet from the condenstation on the windows.  The drapes were ripped.  It is truly in a very scary neighborhood not convenently located close to anything.  The staff are incompentent and very rude.  The pool was green and the fitness room was a joke.  Scared to walk around there at night.  Stay away!!!!!!!!;1

This place needs a major facelift. 80's decor, filthy carpeting, malfunctioning elevators...just some of the highlights.  This place is all about the weekend buffet. Empty tables, plastic bins, hoses and display pieces litter the main floor.  Kind of creepy.  Most Hiltons would set up and take down these eye sores.Someone needs to strp up and clean up.  There is no elegance to be found anywhere here.  feels like a leftover convention travel lodge from a different era.  Convenient shuttle to Universal city walk.;1
After travelling for 24 hours with my family including 2 children. When we arrived at hotel we were told they didnât have the room we booked available and that they could put us in a room with 1 bed and 2 roll up beds. We didnât have much choice as it was 10pm. As we went into the room there was literally no space to put the roll up beds (if we could have put beds up it would have 100% blocked the door- causing a fire risk) I went back down to reception to explain there is no room to put up the beds. The hotel staff did not show any empathy and stood in silence shrugging their shoulders. Eventually they found us another room for the night but still roll up beds for the kids. As an apology the staff offered us not to pay the service charge for our stay.  We were told to check out;1
Extremely old hotel with original old (sometimes grubby) everything.  Hard to get to and what is more they have a shuttle just to Universal that stops at 9 pm so have to rush back from dinner etc as otherwise have to climb a steep hill that takes at least 15 minutes minimum.  So much went wrong but the two things that should make one stop and not book this hotel is still after 3 weeks we are trying to get back our money as they charged as an extra night and we cannot get a refund even though we did not stay this night.  Also it is not a safe hotel as when we got out of our lift a person pretending to be security told us we were not staying at this hotel and to get back into the lift.  After at least five minutes of him trying to get us back into the lift we pushed past him to;1

15th till 20th December 2017: It was my first ever time visiting New York with my 2 work colleagues for a break. Overall I found New York to be an amazing city to visit and most majority of people there so lovely and welcoming. However my experience at the hotel was the worst I have ever had especially for a 4 star hotel. I was totally disgusted. First of all the rooms were so small and did not get cleaned properly as we found a previous guests sock in the corner of the room. Also there is no kettle in the rooms which is pretty poor for a 4 star hotel. Room air conditioning thermostat was rubbish, the setting is either too hot or too old and cannot be adjusted to comfort your needs. Bathroom was also tiny and so cold as the windows did not close properly. Water in taps and;1
There wasn't a day that went by that I could walk out of my room and smell fresh air. It was either the smell of cigarette smoke or marijuana, mostly marijuana so bad it knocked you down once the elevator opened up. The rooms were extremely outdated and left in the 90s. Bathroom was dirty and molded. I wish I could say the service was great but sadly that isn't the case either. When asked what could be done about the smell the first time they just brought a can of air freshener. The second time, hotel security came up to our floor and said it was because a window was open that there's no way there are actually people smoking marijuana in the hotel, pushed my concern to the side and left. Also asked for new towels and wash cloths because they didn't bring any during maintenance.;1
This is not an upmarket or middle class hotel! the best thing about this hotel is the staff were friendly thats it!  checking in there where dirty towels in the bathroom and the room standard is extremely low!. thankfully the bedding was clean. bathroom makes you cringe. Was winter and no heating and a cold draft flowed through the window/AC unit. Window was sealed with duct tape. was an emergency booking and thankfully I only had to spend 1 night here.;1

I was booked into this so-called 'hotel' as a two-night interim stop-off as part of a package including two cruises either side of the New York stay.  Thank goodness that it was only for two nights, as it was so grim and depressing that I could not wait to get out of the place within 15 minutes of setting foot in it.  The staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms were relatively clean, and I was offered the option of a 'smoking' room, which is quite a rarity in these authoritarian times.  However, these were the only positives which I could find in favour of the place.  The Astor is situated right at the northern tip of Central Park West, so it is by no means conveniently or centrally sited.  The subway ride into central downtown N.Y. took 15 to 20 minutes, while the transfers;1

"This was by far the worst experience I've had in a hotel.  During check-in the employee was rude and discourteous. When I got to my room I found out the AC was not working properly and that the Internet connection, an important feature for me that the hotel supposedly has, did not work. I called the hotel desk and received no help. I decided to go down personally to look for a solution. When I suggested a room change the girl reacted aggressively raising her voice and not looking me in the eyes and after I stressed for the second time that it was impossible to sleep in a room with a malfunctioning AC and needed the Internet connection to work she reluctantly switched me to another room, scolded me and told me that ""if I had any other problem I would have to suck it up.""

After reporting the theft to the NYPD and speaking to a detective, my robbery was the 5th robbery this month so far from that specific hotel!

My mom, stepfather and I stayed here June 7th-June 13th. Rooms are small, but appeared clean. Our room had a double bed and an extra-long twin. The mattresses were very firm. The wi-fi worked very well throughout our stay. The hotel is located very close to the subway, and within Chinatown. We did have a couple of issues with the cleaning of the room (for about half of our stay, the staff neglected to give us clean washcloths, so we had to ask for them each day). The safe was a nice feature. Our room keys would randomly stop working after a day or two, I don't know how many times we each had to go to the front desk to get them to fix it. The desk staff seemed nice enough, however.   I checked my mattress the night we checked in for bed bugs (I do this everywhere). I did not see;1

I had to exercise extreme patience just to get service to check in.  When I was finally helped (after listening to the complaints of several other guests ahead of me) the host thanked me for being patient and 'upgraded' me to a King bed on the 'premium' floor.  The room I was given had a small queen bed with a pink neon light behind the headboard (assume for the 'premium' ambiance).  There were no towels or any soap/shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom.  There was no coffee packets to put into the coffee maker and the cabinet for a fridge was empty.  I think this place must be used to renting rooms by the hour...;1
I believe you just need to look at a hotels towels to tell you everything you need to know.  Their bath towels are tea towel size and mean.  No shower gel just soap - tells you everything.  $389 a night.  Cramped damp, or too hot, ugly, battered and unpleasant.  The bathroom looks like it was last renovated in the 70's and the shower is a basic scalding or freezing mixer.  The bedroom is cheap and dated.  The staff are pleasant.    Just don't.

I had a problem with the bathroom, the toilet was DIRTY outside from previous owners (not going to what was on it) and even though I informed immediately to the frontdesk, it took more that 24 hours and a second complaint to clean the bathroom.

I've always found the reviews on tripadvisor very helpful, whether they are good or bad especially the tips other travellers provide, hopefully this one will assist.  I booked 2 junior suites at the Empire for my 40th birthday, these were booked in 2011 for an April 2012 trip.  On arrival, I was told I'd been downgraded to a smaller room but was receiving a discount for the 'inconvenience'.  The room was very small but I was so tired after a long trip, I advised the desk I would sort the room out the following morning.  When I entered the room, I could hear music but didn't think much more of it, until my head hit the pillow.  There was lound music with a heavy base played until 4am in the morning, at 3am I couldn't stand this any longer and called the reception to be told the;1

I recently had to travel to N.Y. to enroll my son at Columbia University.  A friend of mine booked this hotel because it was close and seemed convenient so a booking was made.  When he arrived in the morning he was informed that he could not check in until 2:00 P.M.  This was no problem, he was told that they would hold their bags and to return after 2:00 to check in.  He returned at 3:30 P.M. and tried to check in. I accompanied him to the hotel and this is what happened.  We were told that their computers were down and that it would be anywhere from 4:40 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. before he could expect to get checked in.  We asked if there might be a way to ask maid services which rooms might be ready as he was only going to be there overnight.  We were told that this was not;1

I reported a water leak in the toilet and after my 6 night in the room nothing had been done. But the icing on the cake is that I received a delivery and three times the staff denied having it despite having signed for it to Fedex. I had to call Fedex and get them run an investigation, I also had to get the security of the hotel involved, which after reviewing the cameras found my 13x11inches package! Finally at check out their system was down and they promised to send it to my email, but again that didn't happen.;1
"The first words out of the clerk's mouth were ""the room doesn't have a bathroom"". I believe that he says that if you look like you have any kind of class. Since the room is non-refundable, they make money either way. We'd just come in from LA and didn't want to go looking for a room at night. So we get the key (when did you last see an actual hotel room key) and go up to our room (in the dingy elevator) with the intent of just staying the night. The hallways are really narrow and confusing. After finding the right hallway, we went through a fire door. We were hit with an overpowering stench of urine. Holding our breaths the rest of the way, we got to our door. Wait, what's that on the door of the room next to us? It's a notice from the police not to enter the room. Must have";1

I would give this zero stars if that was an option! I travel weekly for work and don't have the time to write reviews but I feel I must warn anyone considering staying here to find another hotel.

When I took a shower my entire bathroom flooded. The drain wasn't working and there was about 5 inches water pooled. (see photo) When I called the front desk no one apologized. They didn't care that I could have slipped and hurt myself. I had to get ready for my meeting with a man in my room with a snake trying to fix the drain!! How is that acceptable?

It's a shame that the Empire Hotel is so poorly run.  It is an ideal location for a visitor - very convenient to shopping and restaurants and easy access to transportation.  However, the hotel is not well managed and is challenged to offer even the basic accomodations.  It has been removated with a hip look but the upgrade is all superficial.  The lobby is dark, cramped, and uncomfortable.  The staff at the front desk seem disorganized and distracted. The night my son and I arrived at the hotel at 5:30pm the small lobby was overwhelmed with guests and luggage.  The line was long to check in.  I could hear the angry tone from many other guests so I wasn't surprised that I was told that my room was not ready.  I was told that it would be another 30 minutes to an hour before the;1

Having stayed at the Empire before, we decided to make this our base for our NYC wedding. We booked a deluxe king room.   The room we got given to us was dominated by the huge bed which meant we had no space to do anything else, including walking round the bed! The wardrobe had a fridge and a safe in it so we had no room for shoes or clothes let alone wedding attire. When we spoke to reception, they said they had complimentary upgraded us to this room. We corrected them to say that was the room we had booked and paid for. We were offered another room but not Til the following day. The room was much better with 2 beds and much more space.

The arrival experience was nice, friendly staff greeted us and the service was swift. Internet was complimentary, the king size bed was comfortable. So much for the positive impressions. Our room was so small, I would say not more than 11 sqm, with a bathroom the size of a broom closet (a small one!). The windows have nowhere close to European standard (double glazing?!?) and the noise level in our room, facing Broadway/63rd was so loud, that sleeping without ear plugs is impossible. The a/c is very loud, so we had to switch it off for the night too, then again, I guess the outside noise might actually be just as bad. In winter, with the bad sealing of the window, I could imagine it gets pretty cold! The maids did not do a good job, one day after a supposed cleaning of our room;1

On arriving after a long haul flight from Ireland we were given 2 tiny rooms with 2 double beds there is 6 in our party. This includes 2 adults and 2 teenagers.

In 1 of the rooms roasting hot steam was bellowing from the radiator.  The maintaince enginer informed us this is normal?? My husband has been with a large burn & blister on his hand which he got trying 2 turn the air conditioning off as it was extremely nosiey.

The worst hotel!!! Now, I am inside hotel 10th floor and no electricity more than 4 hours already. I cannot contact anyone no telephone work, no electricity and no water!!! The most Terrible hotel that I had been in my life. Even I called from my mobile but no reception to pick call. Why you don't tell the guest what is going on? How long I have to wait!!! I want to go to toilet but no water. I didn't take shower and now inside the room is very hot.  Unbelievable!! When I came back from outside, no maid clean or make up the room but I put the signboard in front of the door to request make up room. But she came and give me only 3 cups for coffee!!! No trow away the waste, no set up!!!  Even the first day I arrived I have to carry my luggage to the room by ourself.  And.... how;1
The number one priority for a hotel for me is a clean, comfortable place to sleep. If you also get a good price, a handy location and helpful staff these are added bonuses. None of the above apply to this establishment. The noise continued all night, from the road, the elevators and the chatter of reception staff. I cannot believe there were no internal doors seperating reception from the rooms or double-glazing to block out traffic noise at a supposedly superior hotel. I have had far better sleeps in my car at truck stops. This would be the most over-rated and over-priced hotel i have stayed in for a long time. The location is also far from ideal as it is over 5 milles from the Hollywood attractions. To top it off all but one of the reception staff were rude and made you feel;1
We stayed here for 1 night with children as it was close to a scheduled appointment in the morning. It was beyond terrible. The entire hotel was very smokey and lots of people hanging out in the lobby. The pictures on the site are not close to accurate. The room was gross, wallpaper peeling off the walls, dirt and whatever else just piled on rug and walls, beds unsleepable as they snuck in the middle badly. Not a place you want to take your shoes off for sure! Bathroom had a leak and the smell of weed was insane! Overall extremely run down and absolutely not a place to stay at with children.;1

"I was attracted to Riverside Studios for the same reason as everyone else here - the price.  As a first time New York visitor I didn't know that this also meant an EXTREME sacrifice of quality.           The hotel is made up of four different buildings, ""glued"" together. As you walk through the front hall to your building, you pass all kinds of colors, odors, and people (who live there mostly.) The elevator must be years older than the building itself - very slow and very unsafe (you could open the door while it was moving.) The outside of the rooms have no uniformity - it seems like they shoved a room into every single piece of space possible, no matter how unproportinal the rooms became. The lock was extremely flimsy - you could push the door open a crack even if it was locked";1
Was supposed to get a preferred rate with the LiDestri group weekend of 11/9-11/11, was told to call Emily Antin, and given a phone number. Tried for 3 weeks to call and left repeated voicemails, never got a response. Eventually someone picked up said 'Executive Offices' and transferred me to Gianna. Gianna's voicemail said 'this is the desk of Emily Antin'?? Left two voicemails, never got a response. Also during this time I called through the main number a dozen times to the awful voiceprompt system. With the voiceprompt system one of several things happened: - the voice prompts didn't work OR - I dialed 0, got the front desk, was transferred to leave a voicemail that was never returned OR - after supposedly transferring me to 'Group Events' it would ring non-stop and then hang;1
"It's a big, old hotel in a great location, and it is also a rip off. Yes, it's close to a many great things in NYC, but it's expensive, very expensive for what you are getting. But worst of all, they have a hidden Facility Charge of $30 which is automatically added to your bill if you book through a 3rd party site. When asked about this, the clerk at the desk  said,, ""It covers your free wifi and the gym."" I didn't use the gym and if I am paying $30, then the wifi isn't free. She also said, ""You should have read the small print..."" Well, when a room costs hundreds of dollars a night, seems to me those little extras should be included. Long story short, I said I'd never stay there again. So, beware when you book, and read the small print, if you have an extra five hours to";1
We booked the hotel through hotwire for three adults and a child for two nights. To start with, the hotel had no place to sit not even a chair near the front desk. We got the keys and were shocked to see there was no bathroom inside the room,only a shared one located outside the room. We were totally unaware of this even after booking. The room was very small for three people and suffocating amd no mobile signal. We called up the front desk to ask for a room with private bathroom and they charged 130$ extra in addition to the 200$. Now coming to this room, the door had no proper lock. Even this room was very small, just a TV and a small fridge,no microwave. The beds were very hard. There was a phone but no connection. It was not fixed even after reporting. There was a bedside;1

Worst Experience EVER! They ruined our Honeymoon!  Reservation was done via Booking.com (with a good offer/price) over 1 Month ago. Upon arriving at the Hotel they told us that the price given by Booking.com is not acceptable by them! They insisted that it was a systematical error by Booking.com and the Hotel but they told me that I SHOULD SOLVE this issue with Booking.com!!! Booking.com apologized and only did cancellation free of charge â¦ After that we had to find a new hotel -last minute-. The cherry on top is that they increased the prices nearly to a double-price and after 2 days they made a special offer via Booking.com.  Be alerted and DONâT make your reservations in this Hotel.  - Rude staff - Staff that could hardly speak English - Non-Professional;1

First off my son had an allergic reaction to something in the room and required us  to call the doctor.  He typically has no allergies so we thought how strange it was.  We got medicine in the gift shop and what should have cost 7$ cost $15.99.   Terrible!   Secondly the restaurant menu was a joke.  I ordered gluten free pancakes for breakfast since I have celiac disease and I got two small pancakes , they were paper thin and didn't fill me up and they were 15 dollars. So I left there hungry.  The prices were too high for breakfast items.  I think Hilton is ready to charge you for everything.  Not sure I will stay here again. Location was worth it but amenities were not.  So Disappointed;1

"Since some time they charge you a so called ""Ressort Fee"". For 29 $ you can use their Fitness-Room (i never do), you can make international calls (i use modern ways of communiction - so I never use) and you get access to their Wifi. What I don't understand is, why they do write everywhere, that they have free Wifi. So additional 29 $ if you stay a longer time you quickly have quite a lot money to pay for things you don't use or are supposed to be free. This is an absolute no go.   Although I really like the location of the hotel in the middle of Manhattan. Their rooms are clean but sometimes just a little small for what you pay. If there wouldn't be the Ressort fee, I would recomend this hotel to others. But with the Ressort fee, I don't";1
"We received an email from the hotel reservation department in June cancelling our stay for July due to closing for COVID (understandable). The email stated we could keep the price of the stay as credit for a future stay or take a full refund.  We opted for a refund.  Since then, after countless emails over the past fifteen weeks the decision is still with ""upper management"" whoever this may be.  Absolutely no update on timescales other than the above reply to each email. The hotel have cancelled the stay and offered the refund, so provide the refund.  Absolutely horrendous customer service, wont be going in future out of principle. Looking online it appears there's plenty in the same boat as us.";1
Bunks are ridiculously small. And this is coming from someone who lives and travels in Europe all the time. There is no space to do anything other than sit on your bed, much less open your suitcase on the floor rather than the bed. Additionally, the heat is building controlled so our first room was so hot we had to open the window and blast the air conditioner while the second room I had to sleep with a sweater and scarf on. I can safely say the charm that Jane is trying to win people over with is not nearly great enough for the discomfort.;1
The front desk staff was rude. The room was very old, with saggy uncomfortable beds, very old worn out furniture and filthy carpeting.   I would not have stayed, but the room was prepaid so I had no option but to remain.   Do not stay here, you will be very sorry.;1
I'm used to travelling a lot, and I'm used to the New York prices too.  So, the price we paid was reasonable if we had a room of a decent size, which we clearly didn't. First, because the room was not ready at noon, we could actually get in at 4PM. Travelling with my wife and 2 young children, we booked a room with 2 beds. We barely could put our 2 suitcases + the baby stroller in the room... and when we did, we had to walk on the beds to go from one side to the bathroom. The beds were small (140cm) and basically: no place at all on the floor. We had a small portable baby crib for our little one, for which there was absolutely no space at all.  The sound isolation is catastrophic: you hear your neighbors go to the bathroom or take their shower, and there was no way to adjust the;1
The rooms desperately need money spent on them to bring them up to an acceptable standard for the cost.  The air con is old, very noisy and inefficient.  The tiles in the bathroom were cracked in several places, the enamel on the bath heavily chipped and paint peeling off the door.  It turned out the advertised complimentary wi-fi is only available in the lobby, that should be made clear.  The charges for the wi-fi in the room was ridiculously high at $10 per day.  We won't be returning.;1

After staying in Manhattan for 2 days on business, I decided I'd like to visit Harlem and the infamous Central Park. Deciding to extend my trip on a whim, I didn't invest the normal time I do in finding a hotel (normally up to a week!).   Man oh man--was I suckered into thinking this place would be nice--located across the street from Central Park. It's a hostel at best and a dump at worst! The rooms are so tiny (AND OLD) that you can't even fully turn around. If there's more than you and a suitcase forget about it! Has a very unsightly radiator in the room, paint chipping, mildew smell and horrible view of other crappy rooms across the way.  You'll be fooled by the lobby--it's modern. But baby, once you hit that elevator that looks like the Shining and try walking through the;1
Do not stay at this hotel. It is dirty and overpriced.  Room numbers are etched in or taped on to the doors.   The elevator was sketchy, the phone was broken, no plug in sink. I slept in my clothes. No wifi. You can stay at other hotels nearby that are much nicer like On the Avenue - only $50 more.  Do not stay here.;1

Choose another hotel.  We stayed at the Empire Hotel on April 9th.  After checking in to our room, I went to the front desk and indicated the wallpaper was peeling, paint was chipping and the bathroom had several spots and patches of rust.  They responded they would notify housekeeping.  We were not moved to a reasonably maintained room. I called to speak to the General Manager on April 11th and was only able to leave a message in his voicemail.  My call was not returned and I called again on April 19th.

Elevators were gross, even had a smashed banana in the door all day. Carpet stained all over, and the corners had a thick layer of dust built up in them. Understanding that renovation is costly, there is still no excuse for FILTH!!! I would not even recommend this place for my dogs. Don't waste your money. The only upside was the location & a wonderful cafe/bakery across the street - the Europan CafÃ©.";1
I feel the hotel did not meet requirements one can expect: - 2 out of 4 elevators out of order: you can wait up to 15min to get in at rush hours - terrible noise from outside even on 9th floor - ripped towels - $12.5 daily wifi! Lobby wifi with speeds of the 90s - doormen getting cash from taxi drivers when you go to JFK... so unprofessional (and illegal)! - bath room is dirty, clumsy, things needs to be fixed, there are no flow ventillation - $7.5 for a small bottle of water is a ripoff, $12 for nuts is outrageous - rooftop was closed on Sunday and Monday - the room (923) needs to refurbished fully: it is in poor condition and smelly. If you take out the sheets, it is simply dirty! - 923 is a double bedroom, how can you advertised that for 4 people? Imagine 4 suitcases in such;1

In December I read the reviews for this place and though it only had one bad review, my husband and I decided to stay here. One because there were no hotels available the week before Christmas and two, being in a band you don't have alot of money to spend on a place to sleep.We arrived on a Friday and were met by a friendly front desk person. We were shown to our room in the non smoking section of the hotel. The building is old, and looks like it, but hey, it was warm and and the doors had a lock. The bed was clean, the room was clean and the shared bathroom was cleaned. We were to leave on Saturday but decided to stay an extra night. This was not planned but they put us up with no trouble at all.So why not stay here? BECAUSE MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER WAS STOLEN!!!! Along with;1
Overall I enjoyed my experience but the ending soured it for me.    Being told itâs $15 to leave my bags downstairs for half an hour while I ran an errand before going to airport ruined my experience.  The cheap comes out expensive.    I would have been happy to til the attendant $5 but paying $15 is insulting to me as a guest who stayed here for 3 nights.and needed to leave my bags for 30 minutes.    Been travelling for a long time.  Never was extorted money to leave my bags for a short period of time.   Not cool.  At all.  Bad form.  Bad customer service.  The baggage attendant wasnât exactly nice.  And the hotel clerk didnât seem one iota interested in my plight. Or in helping me.;1

Very very little room, very little bathroom without a door, old, not very clean, we could hear to much sound from the neighbor's  quarrels in the night, extremely noisy water pipes when other guests were bathing, also in the middle of the night.

This is the worst hotel in this price bracket I've stayed in.   We booked a suite with a view.  Initial impressions - the room was a good size but quite run down and with a tiny bathroom (the cupboard in the room was bigger).  Second impression - loud noise from building works in the rooms directly underneath us.  We spent over 2 hours trying to change rooms - not what's needed after an international flight.   Reception staff told us on different occasions that no building works were scheduled (despite the fact that we could see workmen on the terrace below, and could hear loud drilling, banging and clanging).  We were then told that the building works had been stopped - they had not.   Staff ignored our questions about whether the works would carry on through our stay.   We;1

Horrible hotel. Super old. Heating did not work in the room, it was extremely cold. When the engineer âfixed itâ it was turning on and off and every time it turned on it was so loud that we thought there is a rat inside, we were waking up at night from how loins it was. Dirty room, dirty bathroom and so tiny that the sink is can only be used from the side, shower was leaking. Outlet in the bathroom was not working so I had to dry my hair seating on my knees and had hair dryer plugged behind the night stand. The hair dryer died in a few minutes I had to wait for 45 mins to have it replaced .;1
Cable box was useless! No signal on the TV at all. I asked the hotel staff to check the cable service and they said there was nothing they could about it (?) until the following business day (I was there Friday to Sunday!).  The room was tiny and the drain in the shower was clogged so the water would easily spill out into the restroom floor. They also said I would get a 10% refund for not having cable service but after three months I haven't seen a dime. My advice: AVOID this PLACE - not worth the money. The only positive thing is the location, that's all.;1

Stayed here for a business trip recently because of its proximity to Columbus Circle. Itâs located in a great neighborhood close to restaurants, shops and the park. From the point of check-in, the staff was friendly and helpful. However, the room was in disrepair and felt quite dingy and dirty. I saw some reviews reporting bed bugs, so I did a full check first thing when I arrived. I didnât find any, but luckily I was in an ADA room and since the bathroom was large, I was able to keep my luggage in there just in case. I didnât mind the ADA room until it was time to shower. The roll-in shower was backing up and I could tell it would flood, so I had to be quick. This explained the completely rotted baseboards, swelled wood and moldy caulking. The bathroom did have a very strong;1

We booked this hotel so that we could walk to Universal Studios. If I had it to do over again I would have booked a nice hotel nearby and just taken an Uber to and from the park. What can I say?

This hotel was just horrible. Besides the fact that it needs renovation, the elevators take forever to come, and move very very slow. The rooms were HORRIBLE. There was no cable at all only basic channels ( the news mostly), out of date tube televisions, the bathrooms were mediocre, the AC made a loud disturbing noise though out the night as well as the heater that real across the floor. The bed was OK. The pictures on the hotel site shows beautiful king bed sized rooms... where are they? Also, the entire hallway smelled like cigarettes and other substances.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, it was not worth $116 a night.;1
Firstly I am giving 1 star as I cannot give zero! We stayed here as nothing else in an ok location was available. We stayed here in 2009 and the decor has not been refurbished so the hotel now looks even more tired than 13 years ago! I do not know how this is rated as a 4 star hotel? I have stayed in 3 star hotels in NYC far better than this hotel and the fact we stay in 5 star hotels around the world including the USA (Las Vegas) this hotel is a million miles behind them! I do not trust the 5 stars reviews on this hotel as genuine either that or the people leaving them have never stayed in any hotel before! You will also notice the hotel only comments on the good reviews! Right from the start this hotel experience was awful! Starting with the rude check in staff who tutted at;1

Would give a zero if I could, the lobby and position of the hotel is lovely.... and misleading the reception area was filled with guests complaining, the expensive rooms were tiny, dark and unclean even toilets had not been flushed, hair-clips on window sills, carpets old worn and grotty not at all like the pictures on the website.   Its noisy (not the usual noise from New York City Streets or even other guests) but the  humongous cluster of ancient AC units outside the windows that were so earsplittingly loud they sounded like aircraft engines and literally shook the rooms.   The hotel is very aware of the problem which looking on this site it was reported in 2017. It is now 2019.   They thoughtfully use the tiny rooms and noise problems to scam unfortunate guests into paying;1
"Google Street View this place before booking it!!! It is in East Hollywood and is not a family friendly neighborhood. The picture of the hotel show on the website is actually the back of the hotel, viewed from the parking lot. Hello - False Advertising? The front of the hotel is not as aesthetically pleasing as the photo magic makes it out to be.  The staff were very rude (except for the cleaning ladies, they were nice). We tried desperately to get a hold of the General Manager, which of course, was never on duty, never on site. We asked the front desk several times to speak with the GM and they said ""Oh we will email him and ask him to call us back."" Lies. Why would the staff have to email the GM? Why don't they have his/her home phone, business phone, and cell phone on speed";1

The nearby Sheraton is equidistant from the Universal Studios resort. I booked through a non-Hilton booking service and they said that it couldn't count towards my Hilton reward points!

How does a hotel get away with operating a nightclub and not tell those who pay to stay there that this happens every Friday and Saturday night?  The hotel website makes no reference to it and there is no mention at check-in. The noise and vibration from the music make it impossible to sleep - especially if you, like us, are unlucky enough to stay on the second floor. The check- in and front desk staff could not have been more disinterested in guests if they had tried. This was my second stay at The Jane Hotel. I returned as my first stay was delightful but the hotel has turned into an absolute dive over the past four years. Do not stay there !;1

We started to enquire about this hotel in January - we needed three nights towards the end of April and found very reasonable prices on booking sites. We checked with the hotel direct and were given a low price.  We had noted the high regard in which Patrick was held and that influenced our decision to book. We received and returned a credit card confirmation that clearly gave the price and the correct dates.  However, when we arrived the desk staff denied having a reservation for us but found a room for one night saying that Patrick would be there the following morning. When we spoke to him Patrick denied that we had been given the price for three nights and said we had to leave. He flatly refused to look at the document he had sent us or at our email correspondence. His ground;1

Incredibly bad service at your reception. No friendliness, no smile, nothing. I had booked a junior suite with only 1 queen bed (it's our travel agency fault) I asked if we could upgrade to a room with 2 beds. We could do this at an additional cost of 50 dollars per night. But all of a sudden you didn't have this room after all. Now you could only offer a fold-out bed, for the same price! I called my travel agency in Denmark and they could also see in their system that you had a room available that suited our wishes. But you kept claiming you only had a roll out bed for $50 a night!! I looked up our overnight stays on booking.com and here I could also book the desired room. Your reception kept saying you didn't have that room available. In my many travels, I have never;1

On check-in, the room type we reserved was sold out. We were downgraded the first night and our son had to sleep on a makeshift bed on the floor. On night two, the hotel upgraded us to a corner suite. After a day of walking around NYC, we returned after 10 pm to find the sofa bed had not been made. Two hours and three trips to the front desk later, housekeeping arrived to put a sheet on the bed but no comforter. Our son slept night two at the Empire Hotel under the throw from our bed.   The Empire kept us awake 2 nights in a row while waiting for staff to do a very simple job -- provide a bed. If a hotel fails at that, and it has, there is a lot wrong.;1
I have been in this hotels for 5 times now. This time will be my last one. I checked in for two days and received a room outside the emergency exit. It's one of the rooms (I guess there is one on each floor) which is only accessible from the exit stairways. The door could be opened without keys because the lock is very old and broken. I went down to the reception and complained. They gave me another room which was not outside in the stairways but it was almost as terrible as the room before. Because it took me more than 30 minutes to get another room, I did not go down and asked again. I slept there for a night but decided to check out a day earlier and stay at another hotel. When I told the woman from the reception that I'm going to check out a day earlier because my room was;1

I recently went to this hotel with my husband and two small children. We arrived at 11pm after a longhaul flight only to find the person at the front desk with no manners. We didn't get a lugage cart or anyone for that matter to help bring the suitcases upstairs to our room. The room itself was dark, carpets dirty and to top it off the toilet had pooh in it. I didn't want to walk barefoot on the carpet or sleep in the bed without covering it with the blankets I got from the plane. The only good thing about it was its location for the metro but the transport system is pretty good in New York and I'm sure there are plenty of other hotels near metro stations. The pictures on the hotels website makes it look a lot nicer than in reality, it is old, dirty and in need of major;1
I have just returned from a 10 night stay in Astor on the park and it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We arrived on the Friday night and was shown to a room that was just big enough for the double bed and had a view into another persons room. The room was freezing cold and then about 5am the radiators came on and all we could hear was banging and whistling from the radiator. The next morning after complaining  we were moved to another room that was abit bigger and had a view over the park so thought things were going to get better, how wrong we were!!.   The TV did not work in the room, the toilet overflowed twice and the heating was only turned on about 4 times throughout our whole stay and this was always about 5am so again we was woken up by the banging and;1

The sight of a run down lobby and bad smell did not fill me with confidence as I entered the Hotel Riverside Studios and as for the name, it is indeed by the river, right on the edge of the river, but this does not make for a good view or good area. After a long and confusing walk around the hotel to our first room we were greeted by cockroaches leaping around as soon as we opened the door. This quickly led to us getting our second room which was on the seventh floor , which was a pain because the lift was not something you wanted to risk using. The carpets all had stains  and the buzzing from the fridges and clunking of the plumbing went on all night. As soon as we could the next day we escaped to a better hotel after an awful nights sleep, not sure what was moving at the end;1

Great location. Thatâs about it really. Hotel upgraded us to a city view room, unfortunately between dirt and broken seals around windows the view was disappointing.  Found medication packaging behind  bin in room, a mans sock at side of bed, skirting boards window sills filthy. Sheets not ironed, curtains looked filthy. Bathroom so basic and tile ridges filthy, overall a very poor standard. Then hit with a $30 per night  tax $120 and $5 per case $25 to store luggage after checkout. Bed, toilet and bath where clean and after being travelling for  20 hours we  where just glad to get our heads down. Reception said we should of informed them on arrival, think their missing the point the room should  be cleaned properly at all times. When leaving the lift (certainly where room 3322);1

Stayed here for a wedding- unfriendly hotel staff especially at check-in.  Would not stay here again.  This was the worst Hilton experience I've had, and I've stayed at several Hiltons throughout the country.  The room keys did not work, lines at check-in were long, elevators weren't working, and the staff was completely unhelpful.;1
The only thing positive about this hotel was the staff. I feel sorry for them having to represent. The on line photos are beyond flattering. The rooms are dark, gloomy, outdated, lack storage, counters and any functionality at all. Only place to sit is on the bed. There was no coffee in this hotel anywhere. No vending machines. Zero amenities. Window air conditioner, loud and not conducive for a good night sleep. Never stay here with children, they would go crazy with the lack of space. Hallways are narrow and dark. Same with stairway. Floors are uneven and slanted. Yes, itâs across from Central Park, but there are hundreds of options that offer that. Itâs a neighborhood location, so not a walkable area for shopping, eating, etc. This is a place that you leave early in the;1
Stayed for 3 nights, where do I start, after coming from a stay in Vegas and San Francisco we found the rooms tiny/ cramped to say the least! We complained and were  told this is normal for New York?  If we required larger it's 75 dollars extra per night! As per previous review the art deco lobby is nice but always full of people. We were charged 5 dollars to store our case's after checkout having spent over 200 dollars per room x2 for 3 nights I would expect this to be free? Great location next to Penn Station in heart of Manhattan. Very disappointed !;1
The computer went down and the 12-14 employees that milled behind the desk took over 30+ minutes to realize they could check us in manually... unreal.  They provided $30 vouchers that were later not accepted by room service.  There are other options and brands out there.  Hyatt doesn't get it and won't get my business in the future.;1

I have to stay at this hotel every year when attending a customer event held at the property.  My previous stays have never been great...but this time was the worst!!!  I had problems with the A/C in my room, as did others in the group I was with, and the hotel staff was more concerned in making it our fault for not complaining enough times....but how many times should a customer have to complain?  Obviously more than twice according to the front desk staff.  The food and drinks are tremendously priced too!!!  Not a place to take a family to eat.  There's nothing that special to command the prices they charge anywhere at this hotel.  I have never really enjoyed this hotel...but this stay was a test in my fortitude!!;1
I booked this inn direct and subsequently checked in because I needed a place to stay near friends. I figured it was a trusted Franchise as a Days INN.  So you expect a three star quality.  Days Inn needs to remove their franchise from this immediately.  When I went to the room the hallway was very narrow dingy carpet and walls and not well maintained.  It looked like it has never had a paint job in 20 or 30 years.  I got to the room opened the flimsy door (not encouraging in NYC) The Wall paper looked fifty years old the faded prints matched the dated wall paper.  The carpet from the 80's with stains all over, the bathtub porcelain work large patches with rust in the tub. The chair on the desk used to be a desk chair it is a rocking chair.  The tv armoir was from the same era;1
unfriendly staff at reception - we requested room at higher floor & got dirty , noisy room 128 at first floor - wallpaper hanging loose - spot of water leaks in the room - hotel located at 2 busy crossroads - all windows are single glazzed = very noisy , like trucks driving into your room Swimming pool on pictures is in reality a joke (big bath tub) Room not ready at 3 pm when checking in - late check out only granted when checking out - noisy party going on at roof terrace (nice for youngsters);1
I am just back from New York today , if you want to waste your money this is the place to stay .The apartment was like a building site it had roaches crawling around, not clean at all, very dangerous if you have kids with you. I would rather stay in a gas station toilet than here. The staff were very rude when I tried to get a refund, I could not stay here because of the dirt and there was no refund. Stay in a hotel with a good name.;1
Horrible experience. From the room to the staff to the elevators to the cleanliness everything is overpriced, overrated, and a basic lie. Staff including managers are rude. Never again. The overall experience traumatized me;1
This hotel is cheap and is close to the subway which is great but it was so horrible and dirty! Their 'free Wi-Fi' didn't work in our room so we had to go stand in the stairwell two floors up. Their cooking facilities include a microwave only that didn't actually work properly.  But the worse thing was seeing they had taken $100 US off our credit card for no reason a few days after we'd left. When I called I was told it is a mistake and will go back into my account. This didn't happen so I emailed and called again and again and always got a very defensive manager. I ended up having to go to my banks dispute department and eventually got it back 3months later. I wonder though , if they do this in the hope that every so often they get away with it?? Anyway, I would recommended;1

Upon arrival at the hotel the reception theythought we had arrived a day late and said we were a no show!! Thankfully we had our original booking paperwork to provide evidence that we had arrived on time - the member of staff didnât like it that we had proved him wrong and his entire attitude changed towards us. He then left us standing at the reception whilst he seemingly worked wonders to find us a room. This is when it got interesting, the so called room, more like a cupboard with 2 double beds for myself, wife and 2 kids. The room window was a small single window facing a brick wall, so much for beautiful views eh!!!

In short lines:  Just got back from this hotel. Whole building is old. Rooms are smelly, dirty and there are a lot of cockroaches in room and in toilets (didn't have the courage to use the kitchen).

I stayed here from December 6th_9th. Hotel website advertise a renovated rooms. City was booked and prices super high, so I booked this place for $242.00 a night. My first night I had to switch rooms, not happy with my penthouse room but was better than firts room. Carpets are dirty with bad odor. All furnitures over used with trashy look. Hot water takes over 20 minutes to come out the pipes. Elevators disgusting. Front desk customer service lazy, Unprofessional, rude. The management of that hotel is a disaster. Never again!! I saw at least 7 guests complaining at the front desk while I waited for an email to get print out. The worst part is that no one cares.;1

We stayed here for memorial day weekend, and we went to universal studios and the city walk. When we came back to the hotel later that night, the room was still dirty, music was put on real loud, THEY WENT THROUGH OUR STUFF AND TOOK A BAG OUT OF MY SUITCASE, and left a dirty robe on one of the beds. When we talked to management about it, they were super rude to. I definitely won't be staying here ever again.;1
You only get what you pay for. Very cheap end of market and it shows.  Staff work hard for a poor hotel. Needs demolishing and rebuilt.  Actually may be better if it was knocked down and left. I would advise if yo have a bit more money to go somewhere else/;1
The Location of this 'hotel' is excellent, near Riverside and Central Parks and in a great area of the Upper West Side. When we arrived the lift was broken so we had to get our cases and bags up the narrow stairs with no offer of help from the staff. On entering our room, there was no toilet paper in the room, and there was something dead and crusty but unidentifiable on the floor covered with ants.  Halfway through our stay, without warning, the bottom half of the window, the heavy metal and glass part, crashed inward into the room. Minutes before my 13 year old son had been sitting in the place where the window crashed down. The window was not able to be properly fixed for the rest of the stay and was propped open by a toilet roll by the guy who came to temporarily fix it!;1
The manager was the rudest person on earth and yelled at me bathrooms were not clean and showers were broken. Really unpleasant stay which is a real shame for such a beautiful city. I think better places can be found, as affordable and more polite.;1
After travelling for 24 hours with my family including 2 children. When we arrived at hotel we were told they didnât have the room we booked available and that they could put us in a room with 1 bed and 2 roll up beds. We didnât have much choice as it was 10pm. As we went into the room there was literally no space to put the roll up beds (if we could have put beds up it would have 100% blocked the door- causing a fire risk) I went back down to reception to explain there is no room to put up the beds. The hotel staff did not show any empathy and stood in silence shrugging their shoulders. Eventually they found us another room for the night but still roll up beds for the kids. As an apology the staff offered us not to pay the service charge for our stay.  We were told to check out;1

My relaxing night away was completely ruined by the Empire Hotel and staff.  I arrived slightly after the check-in of 3 PM and as I entered the lobby I saw an extremely long line with very minimal staff at the front-desk attending to guests.  The Concierge stood along side the front desk looking extremely stressed out and doing nothing to assist with the growing line in the lobby.  Eventually I was somewhat coldly greeted by Romeo who offered no pleasant conversation, asked how many keys I needed and sent me on my way to my first floor room, room 114.  Although I was concerned about the noise I would experience being on the first floor I had a more disturbing issue to deal with awaiting me.  I entered my room, dropped my bags glanced around quickly to notice the worn and chipped;1

We began the first leg of our honeymoon in New York.  The Empire was recommended to us as a good hotel in a very convenient location.  We can say the latter is true, but the form was a huge disappointment.   On arrival, we were checked in and asked the staff whether there were any rooms available with a view.  The staff member was rude and proceeded to tell us there wasn't anything else available. In addition we were not offered any help with our suitcases.  We had checked in to a Queen size room and upon entering knew we would not be able to stay another moment in the room.

Having a less than stellar experience right now at The Empire Hotel.  First off, Wifi charged at $10 per day per device.  I thought for sure this was a joke, but nope, this is the case.  My first room reeked of smoke, so I called down thinking they put me in a smoking room.  They don't have smoking rooms apparently just this one smelled that way.   Got a new room, quick.  Went to the bathroom, toilet doesn't flush completely.  Now sitting in my room waiting for someone to come service.   Room is typical small NYC, lobby is nice, location decent.    Would not recommend, all for $300 per night.;1

"This Hotel is extremely over due for a renovation. To be located right on 34th street in NYC this hotel is very old and dirty. The hallway and room smell like a football team lockerroom. The room carpets are not  kept. Found another person hair on the ""clean towels"" and toilet looks like it has't been cleaned in days. But is not actually that is dirty is that it's old and stained and full of splashes from God knows what. This place is very disappointing.  I asked for a room upgrade and I was willing to pay for it. I was advised they have nothing available.";1
The hotel stay itself was okay it's what happened after we left that was truly awful.  My boyfriend and I were in Hollywood to see my favorite band play and I purchased a record at the show.  The record somehow slipped behind the desk in our room while we were packing and we accidently left it behind.  I called the hotel as soon as I realized it was missing and was told to call back -- after two days of calls I was notified that housekeeping had thrown it away!!! I'm completely devestated.  I realize that housekeeping can't hold on to every little thing that gets left behind but who throws away a wrapped, obviously new LP record?;1

Artived here for a 5 day stay.  Firstly the travel agent misled me a put the hotel if you could call it that. Secondly the mouthy receptionist smiled when she charged me an add Â£550 in security deposit ....not a good advert....then room wasn't what was booked.  A view of the Empite State building....in reality review over a derelict building site. Room was like a wardrobe and you had to close the door to use the bathroom. No food no coffee and charged $30 per night for the privilege of using the tv or internet even if you didn't.  No seats in reception because they were to idle to turn them round for people to sit on whilst they decorated the Xmas tree a day late as Thanksgiving was the day before . I sat on the back of a setee and was ordered to get of it even though I am;1
Check other hotels. Too noisy, small rooms, terrible internet connection, bathroom was not clean when I moved in, staff does not have the right skills, the promised me a free night but they finally charged me for it, and many many other things. Worst hotel experience ever!!! I had to cancel an online course that I teach due to the bad internet connection;1
We stayed at this hotel only 2 nights out of the 7 planned. Let me mention the good things first. The coffee machine was new and working.   It was the smallest room I've ever stayed in during my 20 years as a travelling businessman. It was not even possible to have the suitcase open the floor, simply not enough floorspace. The was a TV in the room, and a cable-box. But no channels could be seen on the TV...when we complained about the missing channels, we were told that this particular didn't have cable?? Why the cable-box then? As no other channels were availiable, we were told that we could use the DVD player...too bad I forgot to bring my DVD's on vacation...BTW...the remotes were out of batteries. Guess that the last guests wanted some value for their money.   But the worst;1
I stayed for a weekend. The room was old and in a VERY bad shape. I understand why the check in was so quick. Who would want that terrible room? The hotel needs serious maintenance. It was also extremely noisy and it was impossible to sleep. I called the front desk and the guy hung up the phone. I had to call again and he said there were no more rooms available. The following day I went to talk to the front desk again and I had to speak with multiple very unfriendly people before I got to the manager who finally changed my room. Terrible experience. The new room was supposed to be an âupgradeâ but the it was also in terrible conditions (lots of mold) and still noisy. Mold everywhere. I am never coming back.;1
"Why did we choose this hotel? The location was great , the price good and we had used Days Inn previously. As soon as we arrived, I knew we were in trouble! The lobby looked dingy. One elevator was marked ""out of order""and the one we used was small and musty. We discovered later a third elevator was broken. Neither was repaired after 3 days. The wait for the one small, working  elevator could be 15 minutes!  I won't continue my rant, but I'm through with Days Inn!";1
"Easily the worst hotel Iâve stayed at in at least two years â as a New Yorker, I was familiar with the lobby and rooftop, which are nice, but the rooms are far behind in terms of quality and badly in need of an update. To start with, Iâve stayed here for almost a week now and the heat has not worked properly a single night. The staff provided a space heater for me because none of the 4-5 engineers that were sent have been able to fix the heating unit; the space heater doesnât have a thermostat, leading to many nights where Iâm woken up by it being either too hot or too cold in the room. There is also a strange smell in the room, sometimes of chlorine and sometimes as if someone had been smoking in it before. The bathroom door wonât shut without hitting the toilet. Not worth the";1
OK it was the height of summer when we stayed, but the pokey little room was like an oven.  A little more familiarity with New York would have meant that I would have spotted that as the place is built right where Broadway narrows into Columbus Ave and that this was unlikely to be the most tranquil spot. But it was noisy noisy noisy!!! We had the option of being deafened by the air con (1950s style window mounted tractor engine powered contraption) and gently roasting, or turning off the A/C and boiling to death and being deafened anyway by the equally loud incessant traffic just below the window.  The first, awful night we also had parties of what sounded like dozens of loud, Spanish speaking (shouting, rather) people careering up and down the corridor, pausing periodically;1

Horrible, horrible, horrible!  We booked our wedding here and guess what?  They found a larger party that will make them more money and booked on top of our date!  And this is not the first time either!  I heard stories from friends, and its not the first time they've done this!  On top of that, they won't even compensate us for what they did to us.  They treated it as if it was our fault.   Me and my fiance were so mad.  They don't care about the customers, they only care about their profits.;1
The hotel itself is nice enough, staff are friendly and great location. Despite these positive attributes that is where the positives end. I was horrified and a number of unauthorised charges to my credit card after checking out. I paid in full for my stay (3nights) before checking in yet I was charged in excess of $1,000AU ($820 US) which could not be explained with any degree of certainty by the hotel staff. After a lengthy, inconvenient phone conversation to resolve this error with a front desk attendant (although they seemed unwilling to escalate the call to the manager) eventually the charges were reversed. I would NOT recommend staying at this hotel. This ordeal throughly soured an otherwise great trip to NYC. I am still to receive clarification on $437.78US worth of;1

We stayed here for 5 nights, and the housekeeping was horrible. They never changed the linens, nor did we have clean towels, hand towels, and for the last couple of days there they did not even give us wash cloths. We did not have hot water for showers 3 out of the 5 days and the bathrooms are so small you really can't even turn around in them. We come to NY twice a year and have for about 5 years and this is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.;1
Well to say the least they screwed up. I was given a room that I realized in the end had not been cleaned (from the last person who stayed there). The shower curtain was covered in mold, the sheets were not very clean, we found a dog toy under the pullout sofa explaining the hair all over the sofa bed. The dish sponge looked like it had been eaten by germs and to dish towel wasn't happy either. The resolution by the London office was very unsucessful so I suggest you stay anywhere but here.;1

Had to pay $24 a night to park your car these even though you are already paying $300 a night...;1
I am so sad and embarrassed at the hotel experience that I just had. I have spent the past two days apologizing over and over again to my out of town guest that I convinced to stay in this hotel over others. The rooftop and pool deck experience were nice, and that's all I had known in the past. I assumed that the hotel experience would mirror this.   It is quite possible the worst hotel stay I have ever had. We checked in to very rude staff who made it clear we were burdening them by taking questions. We had spent a lot of time in advance reserving the perfect suite - and when we walked in it smelled so terrible of chlorine that we couldn't sit in there for more than 10 minutes without a chemical headache. The front desk told us there was only one other suite in the entire hotel;1

My family of 4 booked a 2 queen family terrace suite. While the view from the terrace is stunning our actually family suite is 290 sq Ft while the description states varies between 420 and 460. The front desk knows they have to soften the blow of âyes we know but your view is the bestâ I know some of the reviews state that they have been given different rooms that are bigger so I know they have different size rooms available in the same room category. I get that this hotel is old but how about being honest. Biggest pet peeve of mine. Offer discounts for the smaller rooms. I paid a premium for this room for my family. My husband and sons birthday celebration on the nice room was a bust. We have 3 more nights of sleeping in this tiny room. Incredibly disappointed.   The lady that;1

Just returned from three weeks touring USA. Stayed in five hotels in all. This was the worst one we stayed in we hated it. It's huge which means big queues for everything. Check in queue took 25 minutes just to reach the desk which was a nightmare when you've been travelling and you have little ones. Checkout I had to queue again for 15 minutes as I needed to speak to someone about the facility fee charged, 31 dollars for one night stay. They said it included phone calls in your room, use of business centre, wifi access and fitness facility. Nowhere else I stayed made charges like this they gave these facilities except phone calls in your room for free! When I tried to use the business centre and phone calls in room neither worked.

"We booked our reservations on the phone through hotel. My husband and I were traveling with my two children ages 4 and 1. We were promised a suite connecting to a room. When we checked in (after waiting over 2 hrs for our room to be ready) we found rooms were on opposite ends of the hotel. After speaking with the manager his very rude suggestion was to say ""well can't you split the children up?""- I cannot believe this was their idea of a fix. The wasn't the only problem, but the worst of them. Will NEVER stay here again. DO not stay here with a family. Apparently there is a night club we were not told of and heard booming music through the walls until the wee hours of the morning. Ridiculous!";1
This was AWFUL. Everything you've read about roaches, dirt, unhelpful staff, small rooms, tiny bathrooms, kitchen badly equipped and out of use because of roaches, dirty sheets, dirty towels, dirty stained sofa, renovating work going on making noise and more dust, it's all true.

The pictures of this hotel are misleading.. It's not in a very good neighborhood. It is a smoking hotel even though it says otherwise, all you could smell was smoke.

This is my first review ever, about anything, but I strongly feel I have to share this experience with other potential hotel customers so that at the very least, they are not sourly surprised like we were. First, I'd like to say that the hotel's location in Midtown Manhattan is very good and it is a historic hotel with a very nice Lobby. Stayed at this hotel because it is a Wyndham hotel and I had never had a bad experience like this one, under the Wyndham flag. There is a musky smell once you get off the elevator that really turns you off as you are led to your minuscule room. My family (13yr son, 16yr daugther, wife and myself) literally had to take turns and coordinate ourselves to move about the room.  This room is aprox. 10'x11' with two full sized beds, counter for TV set;1
We were given a very small, noisy room next to the elevators.  When I asked to have the room changed they said the room was booked through a third party and this is what you get.  We will not be returning and will not be booking through third parties any longer.  They should not list their hotel as an option if in fact they do not want third party reservations.   When we checked out I said the hotel should be ashamed of themselves for even considering this a hotel room and they didn't seem to care at all.   Disgraceful!;1
bad hotel really awful place dirty room rude staff desperatley bad breakfast, not stay,  ;1
Overall, I was not satisfied with my stay. When I was reserving the hotel, it showed a price of 220 per night and I was so excited to try this out. After I reserved and got the final receipt, I saw a slew of taxes + a facility fee of $30 each day for stuff I did not use! The facility fee should have been included upfront in room rate for sake of transparency. The breakfast at $20 was below average at best, and there was no amenities in the room - No microwave, no fridge, no bathroom counter to keep stuff on. Heck - not even a shower cap and shower gel (who uses soap cakes now, really?). The flush didn't drain properly and adjusting the shower head to get medium hot water was sucha task! I called the reception desk to request an iphone charger (since the lobby and the 36th floor;1
We booked this hotel for 7 nights from mid July 2017 our main criteria was the pool and this was also the reason why we could accept not being in midtown BUT the pool was closed for indefinitely.

Advertised to have wifi in room but only lobby wifi.;1
Worst customer service ever!!!! Gisel hernandez and the kitchen staff provided the worst customer service. The breakfast is terrible. They watch you like a hawk and you get only one omellete, even though it says breakfast buffet. The rooms looks better on pictures but in reality its like a motel.;1
There is no way this is a 4-star hotel, probably not even a 3-star.  While the lobby is encouraging, your heart will sink when you see the state of your guest room.  Dirty, dingy, smelly - and the bathroom is HORRIBLE.  So small the trash can is shoved inside a cupboard.  The door and cupboard are warped from humidity - chipping paint all around.  Rusty and leaking bathroom fixtures.  Toilet seat was melted (I don't even want to know why), and toilet bowl scratched up.  Toilet paper = sandpaper.  WiFi dropped continually.  Was dinged with an additional bill for mini bar after the fact although it was NOT used and this was established and agreed at checkout.  Not only was the mini bar not used, we couldn't even get our free tea and water replenished after multiple repeated;1

We choose this hotel due to its proximity to Lincoln Center and the location was excellent.  However, our reservation was lost several times and upon check in we were told we were being upgraded to a junior suite.  The room was tiny so I cannot imagine what a standard room looks like, furniture was chipped, wallpaper was peeling, shades were hanging crookedly and the noise from the HVAC system (and the street through closed windows) was quite loud.  Every time another guest turned on water or flushed a toilet the sound could be heard in our room - all night long.  The bellman and valet parkers were the most courteous during our stay.;1
I had 0 min sleep the first night! so much noise, those people next door slammed the door loudly  in and out their room since middle night, talked loudly in the hall way, other people couldnât stand and yelled out: shut up!, the noise continued at 1am,  front desk was called at 3am for security to come, same noise happened at 5am, absolutely 0 sleep for me. Complained to front desk, they offered $75 compensation!! It is not acceptable!!  I donât what to expect for my 2nd night...;1
The hotel is within walking distance from Universal Studios. They have a free shuttle bus also. Those are probably the only positive things about this hotel. The room we had was very smelly and we had to call for maintenance immediately upon entering for them to change the batteries in the constant beeping smoke detector. The bed was the absolute worst. It was incredibly uncomfortable. My hubby and I both woke up with back pain. We decided not to stay the second night. We checked out a day early so we didnât have to torture ourselves for another night. It is an overpriced hotel. We will never stay there again.;1
Unlike every other hotel I stayed in on a recent two month business trip, at Hyatt LAX  I was asked to pay $75 for an early check in. One must also pay for a late check-out, and virtually every minor service or courtesy has a fee attached. This is not an inexpensive hotel, but it sure feels like one. Most of us have suffered financially during the pandemic. However, it seems that this big corporation that can well afford it, must turn everything into a profit center and pass on its losses to its customers.;1

Whoever was on the desk gave my Husband the wrong postcode (Ambulance Crew told us this as they had difficulty finding us), didnât ask for any details and definitely did not fill out any Accident Form.  During the 7 hour wait for the Ambulance, not once were we checked on and my Husband, who was really upset, was never offered a second room key, so every time he went to Reception to see if an Ambulance was there, I was left on my own, in agony, in the dark. Even the ambulance crew were;1
I have stayed at this hotel several times, and although it is a lovely hotel, I had decided not to book again after my last visit, due to the level of outside noise that made it impossible to sleep at night.    However, my daughter stayed in the summer and had a room on the 11th floor, which was both quiet and had a lot of natural light. I therefore booked a deluxe double room at  the hotel, and emailed them (three times!!)  asking for a room on the 11th floor or above - so i good get a good nights sleep, prior to travelling home the next day. I had no reply to any of the emails - but hoped that my request would be adhered to. Sadly, i was given a room on the 7th floor, and given an assurance by the reception that it would be quiet! This was not the case - As well as the usual;1
DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL!!! My 6 year old nephew found an ecstasy tablet on the bed when we returned from a day in Universal. I dread to think what could have happened if he had taken this. The hotel couldnât have cared less when we told them. The hotel is not in a very nice area. The photos on the website look nothing like website. The bathroom was disgusting.;1

I was here for a one-night stay.  My room, which was small, was poorly designed.  The wall-mounted television interfered with the light meant for the desk, making it somewhat unpleasant to work at the desk because of the insufficient lighting.  But here is why I gave the hotel a bad review.  At night I noticed that the sink drain was partially clogged, resulting in a backup of water when I tried to use it.  In the morning, I discovered that the valve for the overhead shower did not work, which resulted in requiring the use of a hand-held shower head.  This would have been okay except that part of the shower enclosure was designed to be open and the hand-held shower head resulted in water going all over the bathroom.  So I barely used it.  Because of the timing of when I;1
I can confirm the power/water incident this weekend. I am saddened and disturbed that the hotel has yet to respond publicly to the safety concerns that multiple reviews mention. Could have been tragic outcomes.  Would not feel comfortable/safe returning to the Empire.;1
Do NOT be fooled by the location. This is one of the worst run hotels in the entire city. Here is what you can expect. The hotel is rundown to the point where it's laughable. The air conditioning units are from the last century, very loud and have a very loud clanking noise. So if you like sleeping you won't get much of it done at the Empire. They sell tiny bottles of wine for $29, but don't expect any glass glasses. They only supply you with coffee cups to enjoy the overpriced wine. Ordering in, don't bother asking for a fork or a knife. The empire does not have any silverware at its location. Bring your OWN. If you don't mind the hallways littered with huge bags of trash stay here. If you enjoy walking by toilet scrubbers left in the middle of the hallways stay here. When we;1
I stayed here at end of Sept not out of choice.  The hotel is only two star quality. Firstly they put me in a room on the top floor that smells of chlorine coming from the pool on the roof. Then I get moved to another room - paint chiped etc.  Towels, bath mat never replaced during week long stay.  I had only one bath mat once during a full week's stay.  Wardrobe only hung mens shirts eg not long enough to hang a dress. I put dry cleaning out twice early and called to advise in the AM.  TWICE I returned to find the dry cleaning still in my room and they hadn't collected.. and they still CHARGED by bill for this. Front desk not helpful and I asked for an umbrella one day and was happy for it to be charged to my room - they just said they don't have any period.  What type of hotel;1
This is my third time here and despite its numerous short comeings (mediocre small rooms, with no view and uneven housekeeping, $3 for keurig coffee that is usually free, $7.50 for a $2 bottle of water you can buy downstairs at Duane Reade-, bouncer who would not let me up the elevator to the bar because I was wearing sneakers) I came back and encountered the rudest reception in any hotel I have ever stayed in by the clerk at the front desk. Needless to say I will not be back.;1
"This hotel has been amazingly, misrepresented on line. DO NOT BOOK THIS.  It has NOT been newly renovated  as touted. As a matter of fact, it was a dump.  We arrived to a room that had a moldy bathroom; hair on the furniture; the entry overhead light switch that did not work; rust and peeling paper on the wall and banister and topped with a  loud, broken ice machine across the hall.  We could not stay and immediately went down to lobby to check out.  The desk clerk,  although pleasant, was unable to refund our 4 night booking. Expedia did not help either ( beware).  We were able to find another hotel for the night- Hollywood Thompson- which was amazing.  When I returned the next day to talk to the manager, Dena Morehouse, she was going to pass the issue on to 'accounting'.";1

The Windsor Hotel just gave me the single most skin-crawlingly disgusting hotel experience I've ever had.  Two words sum it up:  BED. BUGS.  I booked two nights here because of the price (cheap) and location (LES).  The first night passed uneventfully.  The next day I started noticing bumps on my arm - many of them.  I dismissed them as, perhaps, mosquito bites (I'd spent the previous evening near the water).  I was in for a rude awakening.  I woke up the second night with a distinct feeling of something crawling on my arm.  I brought my phone up to my face and illuminated the scene - three bed bugs feasting away.  I knocked them off and smashed them into the pillow, where they EXPLODED (my) blood onto the cheap white cotton pillowcase.  Horrified, I flipped on the overhead;1

Other than one concierge who helped us with reservations and the friendly Bellmen/Doormen, my experience at this hotel was very poor. Staff seemed  lost. Rooms poorly maintained. Shower had no hot water. Many minor disappointments that added up to a poor review and experience.;1
Just like any hotel we have ever stayed in this hotel had its pro's and con's unfortunately there were more pro's than con's lets start with the pro its pretty central to the city and not far from Central Park, well that covers the positive.  Now for the con's, there doesn't appear to be any bellhops at this hotel as when we arrived we had to lug the baggage in ourselves, the hotel lobby looks very grand but the piped music was Christmas music which was a bit strange as it was February when we arrived, the room we were allocated was grubby and badly in need of an update, the window overlooked the back of the hotel which I have subsequently found out means it was an interior room, the glass on the window at first appeared to be frosted then I realised it was filthy it looked like;1
Possibly the worst hotel we have ever stopped in. We paid for an upgraded room which was awful. The room was tiny, the toilet had feaces marks in it, the skirting boards were rotten and falling off. We reported it to the reception who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. A great city with an awful hotel carrying it's name.;1
This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. It felt and looked like a homeless hostel. I do apologise to homeless people I don't mean to sound rude. Do not believe the statement that it has received a refurb we saw no evidence of this. The sheets were old and ripped, the bathroom had mould in the silicon and grout and rust in shower/bath, which it looked like they tried to cover up, radiator was propped on blocks of wood. The double bed was not large enough for the both of us - we are both of average size. The decor was dull and poorly finished, doors didn't fit the frames, the lock was loose, the room was tiny and felt grubby. Staff were unhelpful in this respect. The lift felt unsafe, the stairs were narrow and uneven flooring. Do we have anything good to say;1

Front Desk Employee gave access to a stranger to my room and the guy stole my Mac Book Computer, Watches and Cash Money. I arrived late that night and noticed what was missing during the morning of my checkout. Hotel doesn't answer my emails anymore nor my calls. They even tried to call me a liar about what I said. Hotel employee showed me the videos about the guy entering the hotel, going to my room, knocking the door, going back to front desk, ASKING FOR A KEY, going back inside my room and leaving with one of my bags with all my belongings inside. STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY RESPONSE FROM THE HOTEL for a PROPER NEGOTIATION. Initially, they offered $500 that I refused because thats not even close to the total of my loss.;1
Sadly this hotel did not meet any of my expectations. The price looked reasonable but the hotel took more than the quoted price from my card! The room was dirty and the whole hotel is really run down and dilapidated!  The staff are helpful and that is about the only redeeming feature! .;1
"Besides the fact that hotel is still being renovated and is basically a hyped-up dump,  the staff is made up of actor wanna-bees that feel they're doing you a favor by granting you permission to spend your money at their hotel.

She is telling her fellow staffers that she's going to throw them out if they don't get out by 12:00PM.  The bar/lounge is apparently very popular.  It must be why the bar manager thinks Barack Obama reports to him.  Dude, you run a bar, get over it.

CONS: The rooms are not clean or maintained - some rooms are newly renovated, but I have stayed here twice and always end up in the worn down ones. So keep this in mind when reading reviews. The rooms are very poorly lit, the ceiling has cracks, the wallpaper is falling off and the floor is dirty. The carpets in the hallway have a lot of stains and it is in general not that nice. The housekeeping will not respect if you don't want them to come into the room - they will enter anyway - even if the sign is up and they do not keep their hands to themselves. I had several items thrown out which was not in the trash or meant to be thrown out. Also, the hotel has a lot of ants inside the room, when we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room but as we;1

We were then far away from the theater district and everything we had planned.   We were ""allowed"" to come back to the Empire the next night to finish out our reservation.  However, we were put in an awful room with no A/C and a view of a brick wall.  Their solution to our AC problem was to bring us a box fan.  The only reason we booked this particular hotel was because they had a pool.  The pool was closed for repairs indefinitely.  They never once";1

Bathroom dirty with something red on tiles and soap dispenser, asked to clean but although someone had been in room nothing had changed.  Very poor customer service;1

The sour smell of carpet which had been wet and not dry cleaned was apparent.  I should have known something was amiss.  But I simply poked my head into the room, saw two beds with clean white linen and said ""thank you"" for the attendant who checked me in.

Who needs free international and domestic calls these days??? This is upselling to the superlative degree! I am a frequent NYC visitor and stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and the Wyndham New Yorker is nowhere close to being a 4*.

When we checked in the hotel, the room was supposed to be ready at 3:00 and we were told it would just be 15 minutes because they were upgrading our room to a really nice large one.      Maybe it was just my luck to get the three worst rooms (or) maybe the rest of the rooms are the same.  At 3:45 , the first room was finally ready and it smelled heavily of paint in the hallway and the room.  We refused the room before we put our luggage down as the smell was so strong.  The second room provided to us was on a different floor and smelled of bleach (as though someone dropped a bottle of bleach on the carpet) we couldn't even walk in the room (neither did the bellman).

I really try to give fair reviews on Tripadvisor.  Hotel Riverside Studios is the most disgusting place I have ever stayed. Someone described the lobby as resembling a ""crack house"" and I would agree with this. The hallways are mouldy, carpets peeling, wires hanging everywhere. The general state of cleanliness is well below par. The entire hotel is dusty, dirty and smelly.  The room my friend had booked was a double for two.

He could not help. During the conversation with him, he aired two to three times to threat to call in the police if we did not go to our rooms. We were very badly treated.

We stayed there 3 nights- which were 3 too much. At first we did not get the shower to work, and once we did, the whole water was everywhere but in the shower. Secondly, there was some trouble with the safe. The room was not worth 3 stars at all, it was all in all in used condition. We missed the check out at 11am, for which we apologized a couple of times, as we did not do it on purpose of course. we were told âdont worry that happen, just make sure you check out in 10minsâ which we did. Finally we found out, that we were invoiced 60 bugs for that and were told we should be thankful as standardly they would invoice more.

Stayed at the hotel with my wife for 16 days and it was kind of a disaster. It all started in the first week, the hotel was going through a remodeling work and guess what? They did not tell us that before we booked and pre paid for the room. At first I gave the front desk a call, and they lied saying it would only be for a couple of days. After a week the loud noises kept on bothering us, how about waking up on a Sunday at 08am with a few construction workers hammering stuff 01 feet from your door room ? I had an argument at the front desk and demanded they gave me a new room, but they said I would have to check out and wait on lobby for 4 hours before getting a new room. After insisting they told me I did not have to wait and they moved me to a new room. In the both rooms I;1

Seems to be the only hotel in NYC that hasn't bothered at all with decorations. No lights outside, no Christmas tree, just one menorah and a couple of flowers in the lobby. Really depressing returning here after seeing all the other hotel frontages and lobbies, would not recommend for a festive vacation.;1
We checked out the Hiton Universal City Hotel around 9:00 and left 2 suitcases and 1 luggage bag (all locked) with bell service. We returned to the Hotel around 18:30 to pick up luggage. The side pocket zipper of the luggage was found unzipped and a cut was made from the inside of the side pocket. I reported this problem formally via the Hilton Guest Assistance 6 days ago. The hotel is supposed to respond in 3 working days. However, I haven't heard from them yet. I hope they will not take this problem lightly!!;1
For starters calling it A room would be stretching it it. Dirty sheets, furniture that looks like itâs been taken out of a charity shop basement. Staff donât care. Any problems seem to be your fault. Even a door sticking after 5 minutes of you getting there. It says a two start hotel. Itâs not even a one. Communal showers and toilets, Covered in mole. Avoid at all costs.;1
Stayed here for two nights.  Seemed fine on the first night, however, on the second night I was bitten by bed bugs.  Packed up my things and checked out immediately after reporting the situation to the front desk staff.;1
I was ignored since Tuesday night about my missing nightgown This hotel forgot how to treat a CUSTOMER. I will ensure I never EVER spend a cent in this hotel and also at any Wyndham hotel chain ever again.  And it is not because of MY nightgown missing from the room I PAID for, but for the lack of accountability from ALL the parties from this hotel that were involved.;1
Arrived in the evening and the room was not available. After more than 1 hour was not ready yet. Finally got the room, but it was a room for 1 person instead of 2. There was only one set of towels and although asked at the reception the additional towel, it was not delivered. We also had cold water and we had to change room again. It was the worst experience in a hotel i ever had.;1
"We stayed at the Hilton Los Angeles / Universal City in February of 2012.  We had a $1000 iPad that was in a case, in a bag, stored under a bench in our room that was stolen.  Security checked the lock on the door and the only people in and out were us and housekeeping.  After 10 phone calls to them, this is the final word:  We have taken care of it on our end (which means to me they found the thief, but it is ""confidential"").  We submitted a claim to our insurance and it was denied because there is a safe in the room.  Hilton is sending us a check for $200, which is better than a sharp stick in the eye, but nowhere covers the loss of the iPad.";1
Went to NY for a fun family weekend. Woogo has a great location, unfortunately, the rest of their experience is severely lacking. After check-in, a tragi-comedy of events ensued:   We put our kids to bed on a mattress on the floor because the pull out sofa bed's metal mattress supports were broken. At 4 AM the next morning, two men entered the apartment using keys and turned on the lights. Seems they saw our children sleeping on the floor, cursed, then ran out of the apartment.  This was followed by a security guard knocking on our door looking for someone who apparently worked in the building.  We suspect it was the aftermath of the building staff holiday party.  In the morning we spoke with both the WooGo staff and the building security about the incident and all claimed;1
After probably hundreds of hotel stays, this hotel was the was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only redeeming factor is the proximity to the subway.  They rent most of the hotel out to a college for dorms or vacation stays. This means that the hotel is extremely loud and filled of drunk students. Every night I was woken up by kids screaming up and down the hallways.  As for the rooms, they are extremely small and filthy. I had to buy flip flops for the shower like a true college dorms. I had a leak in the bathroom that I complained about everyday and after day three nobody had come to look at.   Please please do yourself a favor and book at any of the other hotels. This hotel is listed at 3.5 stars but thatâs only because of its lobby. The rooms are not better than;1

I just recently finished a brief stay at Hyatt Regency LAX and wanted to drop a few notes on things I wish they could improve on. As a fan of the Hyatt brand, I always feel that the gift of feedback could further elevate guest experiences going forward. Here they are:  1. Include basic amenities as part of housekeeping. When I checked in, I was surprised that there were no water bottles, no hotel slippers and no dental kits. The bottle containing body wash was also almost depleted as if it was never filled in time for a new guest to stay in. I would understand if not all amenities are available in the room - I believe that is quite standard in most Hyatt stays and they are available upon request. But for these basic amenities, housekeeping must make them readily available to;1

All I can say is this: It never even crossed my mind that someone in the hospitality industry getting paid to interact with customers would hang up on me, and then when confronted about it, lie to my face.   And the room was in very poor shape. Wallpaper peeling from walls, stained carpet, and a very worn out shower (with a broken showerhead). The wireless internet service did not work in the room.  I will never stay there again, and will actively tell friends they should look elsewhere.;1
"We arrived for a 2 might stay on 12/6/13.  As we walked in, we observed an angry guest throwing his keys at the desk clerk and yelling at him because there was no hot water.  We asked about that. The man at the desk identified himself as Patrick, the manager, and told us that the hot water was being fixed ""as we speak"".  So, we decided to check in anyway after looking at the room, which was small but clean and adequate for our needs. Patrick told us he was going to give us a discount because ""we seemed like nice ladies""  So, he took 10% or $30 off the rate and we checked in. We went out for the day, came back in the evening and there was still no hot water.  We asked the desk clerk about it and she said they had called someone and they were gonna come and fix it.  Hmmm...";1
Itâs located in the heart of the ghetto. The management team and front desk clerk are rude. They can care less if you are comfortable with your stay. Pictures look nice, but they are deceiving. Beware of their policy that they will stick to even if you show up to the hotel and are very displeased with the condition and area where the hotel is located. They will still charge you for the first night.  Despite the fact that they told me they would not credit me my money back, I could not still stay there.;1

After having recieved the confirmation email which repeatedly stated that I had paid in full I arrived at the hotel to discover in the small print of the email was a hidden additional cost of over $30 per night.

We decided to save our money for the experience of New York so were reasonably pleased to pay Â£550 each for flights from Heathrow and 5 nights accommodation. Wow- were we ripped off!!! The location is great- very close to Columbus Circle and Central Park. However, the hotel was disgusting- we found two cockroaches and it always stank of smelly food! I really don't know how this hotel got the one and half stars that it has been awarded. Try avoid this hotel at all costs. We did not spend much time in our room as we were out and about all day, but this is the kind of room you definitely don't want to go back to after a long day of sight-seeing. After a fantastic trip to the Big Apple our accommodation was by far our biggest low light!;1
Booked this hotel via Hotel.com as I was looking for a 4 star centrally located. This is NOT a 4 star hotel. We were very disappointed when we got there. The room and bathroom needed urgent updating. The carpets are tired and wore, the bathroom had mold and cracked tiles. We didn't feel comfortable or clean at all. The corridors are dark and feel dirty. And on top of the all of this there is a compulsory charge of $29.00/night for the use of the Gym, Business Centre and Wifi. Looking at the guests I would assume that most of the guests were tourists so why do we need to pay for a business center and gym if we don't use it?? This is probably the worst review I have ever written on TripAdvisor.;1
Absolutely awful experience. Reception staff rude and unwelcoming from the moment we entered. We had sent an email previous to our stay with some requests which had been ignored completely and the lady at reception smiled when I asked if it was received.   We were so excited for our stay here but the coldness from the moment we entered ruined it.  Room we were given had no light fixture at all and was on complete darkness. Only a standing lamp present for some light. Staff offered an additional lamp but simply not good enough!  Room damp smelling and old. Random fridge in the middle of the room and no space for suitcase. Asked if we could switch rooms but apparently hotel was completely full.  Ended up having to get a full refund and finding another hotel on NYC last minute.;1
We stayed at the hotel from the 20th to the 26th November 2018. I was so disappointed with the attitude of the hotel manager that dealt with our issue. We received an invoice from our booking partner and when our credit card was billed we were billed extras when I questioned what these were I was advised that there are facilities charges wifi that to be honest did not work in the room or in the lobby this is a compulsory charge, whether you use the facilities or not, it should be added to the cost of the room as it really felt like a sneaky extra at the end of our trip. these charges were not factured into our spending for the few days we were there and these hidden charges were added at the end of our holiday please be aware of these hidden charges.  Also Tick Tock diner on the;1
These soul-less white boxed rooms with very poor beds and a bad smell om super-strong detergents was an experience I could have managed withouth. THere was never any toilet paper, and the water pressure in the showers was so bad you had to squeeze up against the wall to get a little bit of water on you.  The place was very noisy, it had lots of swing-doors which would open and loudly shut throughout the night. There was no elevator. The fire escape stairs were open to the street outside, and people were constantly using these for going in/out, smoking etc. The receptionist never smiled, and were just not friendly or helpful at all. They accepted cash only, and gave a useless receipt - which makes the whole thing seem very dubious. I don't wish to contribute to whatever fishy;1

we stayed in this hotel for 4 days. the shower had no door or tend available resulting in the bathroom completely wet after taking a shower. I asked at the reception and I was told that the customer were braking the doors and due to the risk of injury they decided to remove them all. only 1 shampoo and 1 shower bath available in room even if we were a family of 3 lodging in the room. only paper cups available even if the minibar included wines and spirits, I had to ask twice for regular glasses. remote control was missing and we had to ask for it. the day in which it was raining I asked for an umbrella at the reception and before asking me if I did not find the one in the room they told me that I had to pay for it. I explained that I did not have any umbrella in my room and;1
Possibly the worst hotel we have ever stopped in. We paid for an upgraded room which was awful. The room was tiny, the toilet had feaces marks in it, the skirting boards were rotten and falling off. We reported it to the reception who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. A great city with an awful hotel carrying it's name.;1
"A few days before arriving I called the hotel to confirm they had a crib we could use, they said YES! I said, ""Are you sure that I will get one when I check in?""  Yes, you will, they said.  Well, I thought, ok, I will leave my portacrib home.  When I arrived I told them I needed a crib, they said, ok we will bring on up.  And hour later I called and told them I needed that crib.  Well they said there were none.  I said, ""I was assured I would get a crib when I check in!"", Then they continue to tell me that hotel has ZERO cribs, got rid of them all.  I was very upset about this, since I was staying there for 10 days.  Funny though towards the end  my stay I saw a hotel crib in the hallway, so the front desk lies.  Room was small of course and breakfast got old quick, but at least";1
Watchout for housekeeping. Keep your door locks. If you stay ask for the housekeeper name. Its located in a central area, thats it. Plenty of other hotels nearby. Watching your items is critical at this hotel. I travel international, this was the first time we have something stolen. The walls are very thin, you can hear people having sex next door. Not a good stay for us. Looks great with the advertising was great to drive you in. Not what you should expect. Nice decor, thats it.;1

Stayed here as part of our honeymoon visit to New York and felt compelled to write a review. The location of the hotel is fine and the rooftop bar and lobby area are good however would never stay here again. Our room and bathroom were tiny, our AC didnât work and when a member of staff told us he would get it sorted, we were greeted to a knock at our door an hour later and another member of staff holding a tiny heater - no explanation given and he just walked off! We were also in a room that had what sounded like a generator running constantly and it was unbearably loud. We decided, at 12.00am on our first night in New York, that we couldnât stay there as we knew it would likely ruin our entire trip so we arranged to go to another hotel that night.

In an apparent new policy, this hotel now charges for early check-in.  I arrived early on my flight and decided to check-in to my hotel before heading to my meeting.  I was advised there were rooms available, but check-in was 3:00pm, and an early check-in fee of $100 would apply if I would like to check-in now.  I declined, and will make sure I never stay at a Hyatt property again given this policy.  I have traveled for nearly 30 years...this was one of the craziest fees I've heard.  Great way to push customers out the door.;1

If there is zero star, I'll prefer that, the good thing is: the location is nice. But I have a bad experience, I booked a room for one day on Kayak and it was pre paid. When I checked in, they asked me my credit card( which is normal), but after checked out there is an unreasonable charge for $170 on my bank, I call them and they said I have to call The website I booked, and I figured out the charge is not from the site, and I call the hotel again, the front desk girl said I have to call Ortiz....while I was talking to the front desk they always put me on hold the reason is they r busy, which I think is untrue~ they give me very hard time, I am not from here and English is not my first language, anyways, I don't recommend this hotel.

When you walk into The New Yorker expect a 10-15 min wait to check in, not including the people who have been waiting even longer. No apologies offered just them in the back chatting. (March 5th 9:30 PM)  When you arrive at the elevator if youâre  on floor 20-40 expect there to be only 2 that actually work and are over crowded so you may end up waiting an additional 15 min to even get to your room. (March 5-9th ongoing)  When you arrive at your room at the 33rd floor have the expectations that your room will smell like kitty litter and cat peeâ¦ they chalk it up to âthe hotels hauntedâ yet those smells are USUALLY associated with meth soo.

My partner and i recently stayed at the Empire hotel for 7 nights. This was a surprise trip for my partners 30th birthday. Months before we arrived at the hotel i emailed them to ask if there was anything they offered on arrival as a special touch as it was a special holiday, a few weeks later i had no reply from them so forwarded the email again saying i would appreciate if someone could acknowledge my email and return an answer- still no reply! When we arrived at the hotel nothing was mentioned about my emails and we were allocated our room which was a bit on the small side but nice enough and clean. The only problem was when you had a shower there wasn't a full door on it just a glass covering where the shower head was so each time you had a shower the bathroom floor would;1
We booked the room on Booking.com for 3 nights they asked no money in advance. When the room was booked, we had a message that we have to pay  20% of the booking amount to confirm our booking. O.K., we had no problem in it and paid the amount. when we reached, the person on the desk asked us our identity and the whole balance amount in cash only,  even he didn't show us iur room. we had no enough cash, so he asked us to pay  whatever cash we had, and to pay remaininng amount later in cash only.  when we reached in the room, it was smelling lik hell. we asked to change the room, but were told that the hotel was packed. We contacted helpline on booking.com, but he was helpless to change iur room as he offered the room at double the price in the same hotel. Now we felt really;1

Donât stay here. There are much nicer hotels within a block or two that are worth the extra few dollars. The only nice thing I can say is that front desk people and the bell staff were polite. Thatâs it. The manager I had to talk to was not at all polite. In the first room they put me in, the shower had no water. I had to move at 6.30am to a second room. In both rooms, the ancient a/c wouldnât clunk on until it was sweltering, the sheets were threadbare, the fixtures were loose, and the wallpaper was peeling. The first room had an Ace Hardware power strip on the floor, but the second had just one available plug. When going to check out, I got stuck in the elevator on the sixth floor, and, after jumping out through doors that were slamming shut like something from an Indiana;1

Gone are the days that Chuck Bass would have been proud to own the hotel, paying over $1,400 for 7 nights is expensive but New York always is, my issue came from the room. I do not expect to spend that sort of money and have to straddle the toilet in order to enter the bathroom! Neither do I expect to have to hurdle over our suitcases as there is not enough floor space for 2 people in a double room! We decided to go to the advertised 'outdoor swimming pool' I have seen children's paddling pools which are bigger! Upon asking where the swimming pool was the staff laughed and said 'that's it' clearly understanding it was a joke! Although the 'pool' area has a bar the actual roof top bar was shut in January for renovations and has not been reopened, to the dismay of many guests...;1
The hotel needs to spend a little money on cleaning the furniture and a lot of money on soundproofing the rooms. I literally heard every sound the people in the next room made which is surprising considering how loud the aircraft was all night long. Perhaps if the bed wasnât like sleeping on a Boulder with stones for pillows I could have drowned the rest out somehow. Instead I spent the whole night miserable and awake. To add insult to injury I had the pleasure of spending $55 on parking.;1

There is clearly a scam on here that targets overseas travellers so beware!!!! Was charged a minibar bill that was simply a lie. And the hotel said that there was no way to verify. I think this is ridiculous. Later I realised on sharing my experiences that it is clearly a regular scam here.;1

I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in December, i had called the hotel previously to my arrival to ask if i can have the two rooms i booked on the same floor, i was on the phone to them for 40 minutes as they could not locate my booking, i received my bill from my phone company and i had been charged Â£67 by the hotel for this call. I arrived at my hotel and was told our rooms would not be on the same floor and that if we wanted this we would have to upgrade for $125 per room this meant a better room with a view. The VIEW we had in our room was not a good view at all for an extra payment it was terrible especially compared to the room that my mum had her view was amazing. We complained and asked for a refund on the room but we were told this was not allowed so they relocated us;1

"I was excited about the hotel because of the photos I saw through Internet but when we arrived we got scared as soon we entered to the ""concierge"" or front desk. The elevators are awfuls very super old style, everywhere it is so dirty, you have to share the bathroom with all the floor, and the worst, your can hear other guests steps in the upper floor all night long!!! It was like a scary house! I would never stay there again! It was a shame for me because I reservated this for my family (8 members). We have 2 rooms, you can feel the bed springs and the warmer keep making noises all night. It was a nightmare!!!  And taxis don't know the address until I show them my GPS...     :(";1

"We recently stayed at the Empire hotel in NYC and were shocked to wake to bites all over my body as well as my young Childs face. When we reported this to reception the manager asked me ""what it could be""  they decided to send 2  burly males to my room after I requested a female member of staff to come and witness the bites on our bodies to document it for a report but was made to feel intimidated & stupid for even suggesting that this could be bed bugs.  They have the worst service &  I constantly complained that the room was not being cleaned properly. The housekeeping staff seemed to come to the room  and replace the towels & make the beds & then disappear. On 2 occasions the bins were not emptied and food trays were either left in the room or on the floor outside  until we";1
I arrives at the hotel tired and ready for a hot shower. 45 minutes later I was still waiting in reception trying to work out what had happened with my reservation. The hotel Manager (Mr Hernadez) was not only unhelpful, but was also rude. He did nothing to help the situation, which was extremely frustrating. In the end my work collegue who had booked the room had to come from the other side of New York to confirm the booking. After receiving my room key, I was shouted back to reception to be told they had mixed up the keys and someone had just gone up to my room with the same key. 20 minutes later they said I was able to go up to my room, by this point I was very stressed and annoyed. The receptionist did not even appologise for the delay. Once in my room I realised I only had;1

The ONLY thing that was good about this hotel was the location - close proximity to the train, and reasonably-priced (for NYC, anyway) parking a block away where we could leave our car ($80 for 48 hours). That was it.  The room was REALLY dingy - cracks in the wall and ceiling, peeling walls, the works), the carpet was dirty, and there was literally a large SQUISHY spot on the floor that I could feel under the carpet outside the bathroom - I thought I was going to fall through to the floor below us.  And NOTHING WORKED in the room. The TV wouldn't even turn on - AT ALL - and there was no remote to be found for it anyway. Even trying to turn it on from the button on the TV itself didn't work. It was dead.  There were ZERO blankets (just two thin sheets on the bed, which;1
I purchased a few nights at this Hotel from Hotels.com. I usually book on my own but when I saw the number listed, thinking it was the hotel, I called. I was not told that I called Hotels.com, but as soon as they asked for a credit card payment, I knew I called the wrong people. Nevertheless I prepaid for the room. My husband had an emergency job in L.A. and we needed a room the very next day. I saw that there were no cancellation fees through Hotel.com but that the hotel would charge a one night penalty if I cancelled. The cancellation time was 4 P.M. on the day that I made the reservation, even though I made it 3 hours later. I was emailed this information after I booked. No big, I wasn't planning on canceling. We have been working in L.A. for quite some time now, traveling;1

I stayed while some renovation was going on but that is no excuse for the condition and the lack of concern for the conditions. The room was nice albeit small Dry wall dust covered the hall and was tracked into our room by ourselves as well as room service. Hairs in the bath area. Trash in trash cans.. However when I found a used condom on the floor under the chair I was disgusted. I repeatedly asked for a manager but got no where. I would never stay at this place and could never recommend it to anyone. With SO many wonderful hotels to stay in NYC and at these rates why in the world stay here.;1

Staff just so rude and made my Boyfriend and I feel very uneasy. There was no need for their attitude which came across and lazy and as if they didnât care. Considering the prime location in London where this hotel is situated it is really shocking. Woman at front desk upset me asking âWhy are you staring at me, is there something on my face?â When we were in full conversation during check in, so where else would I be looking? Made me feel small and had a dampener on the stay then. When retrieving our luggage, we were ignored by two staff members who just walked away, when we had a bus to catch. Just really disappointing and staff just had a couldnât be bothered attitude.;1

"Beware! The Jane Hotel has a bed bug problem. I was attacked on my first night - the front desk clerk moved me to another room straight away, and seemed to be quite rehearsed in the experience. The new room had a worse infestation! I spent the night in terror and demanded to speak with a manager in the morning. ""There is no management on duty!"" is what the response was.  I asked what would happen in the event of an emergency, and the clerk said he would try to phone the manager to come in. The desk agent tried phoning someone, but ""she was not available"". I checked out and stayed somewhere else in Manhattan.  The building has a popular, hip nightclub and the lobby and rooms have a smart design and cheap rooms. It seemed too good to be true, and it was! Do not stay here!";1
"So after reading more good reviews rather than bad on yelp I decided to stay at the Hollywood Hotel for a three day conference in Brentwood. The Hotel itself is visually appealing and the ""Hollywood"" theme is done well. The only other aspect of this hotel that was pleasant was the breakfast and the Gentleman preparing it. He was very polite and eager to make you a good breakfast.   Now on to the disappointing. Have had more than one bad experience of items ""disappearing"" from my room on various other trips at other hotel. So I now make it a point to not have any turndown service, Makes it easier for both parties. Which is why I left a ""no maid service"" on my door prior to leaving. So what do I find when I come back at the end of the day? Yup, they came in anyways. Called the";1
After much scrutiny on cost and standards, I decided to make a reservation for my 3 night stay in NYC at the Morningside Inn as it seemed a resonable balance between the two, despite some negative reviews.  However on arrival I queued behind a couple trying to check in. I overheard that there on-line reservation was not received by the hotel, and thy had no rooms available. Back luck I thought.  When I was greeted at the desk, I was informed that there was a problem with the room and they could not honour the reservation. So we faced the prospect of having to find alternative accomodation on a freezing NY night, at a time of year where xmas tourism is at its height.  Fortunately ( if that is the right word ) - The West Side Inn was right next door. I remembered this place from;1

As a globalist for over a decade who has stayed at Hyatt properties around the world, this property was the worst!  Starting from the horrible check-in experience with rude front desk staff to the lack of connecting rooms that were confirmed prior to check-in (due to need to have two rooms for young kids under age 12) to the world's smallest room with the thinnest walls possible, I would recommend EVEYRONE avoid this property.  Really a huge disappointment and a real shock given the fact that the property physically looked new/refreshed but the soft product was completely lacking, the helpfulness of the staff was zero and even when ordering room service they continuously missed items (sadly kid's food) that just made us want to go home.;1

I really don't understand why people rate this hotel positively.  I was not expecting a big deal, considering the price, I was expecting a simple place, but this is an awful place.  The halls smell, all the towels and sheets smell like cigarette. We asked for a non-smoking bedroom, but they probally wash the sheets and towels of the non-smoking and the smoking all together, so it all smell like cigarette. The mattress was really really bad. The only good thing about the bedroom was the bathroom, that was clean and wide.  The wi-fi is NONEXISTENT, They shouldn't even advertise that they offer it.  As vistors, we needed the internet to search how to get to the places, restaurants and buy tickets online, but we couldn' t do it tonight at the hotel , we had to go to Starbucks, that;1
The hotel is located in the busiest part of Manhattan. Very noisy and unsafe. The pictures from the hotel are not what you see at the hotel. The lobby has almost no furniture and the rooms are a lot tinier than the pictures. The hallways are very very old. The carpets are ripped and smelly. The bathroom is super old and rusty. The front desk staff was the rudest people ever. Very unhelpful with even the simplest of questions such as direction or suggestion. The location is very unsafe specially at night. There was a person stabbed right outside of the hotel when we stayed there.;1

Bathroom flooded daily due to terrible half shower door design. Cockroaches in the bathroom.  Rude staff that think they own the place.

I recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and would never stay there again due to the standard of the bedrooms and the situation of the hotel. The rooms are very very dated and seem as if they have not been updated since the 1980âs. The corridors are very shabby. The area in which the hotel is situated is run down and not an area you want to be walking around on your own at night time. The positives about the hotel are the staff, every member of staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to assist you. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel.;1

The overall experience was not a good one. The Hotel is very dark and the rooms are not maintained to any reasonable standard.The pictiures on their website makes it quite misleading.

I was highly disapointed with the overall experience and would certainly not  be a returning guest. I would not recomend this hotel.;1

I really wanted this to be my go-to hotel in NYC since I travel monthly, but unfortunately it is not. The hotel is on the edge of Harlem and is pretty safe, although I recommend going home on the early side. The rooms are very, very small - but that didn't bother me too much because the bed was comfortable. All essentially was going well until the ceiling started leaking...rapidly....at midnight. We called downstairs and it took about 10 minutes for someone to come up. They had nothing to offer us, and did not try to stop the leak, so I called to ask for a new room. The new room was even smaller (it only fit the bed, no walking space) and was very, very uncomfortable. I went to the desk to tell him this is ridiculous, and he cared more about texting than my complaint. We barley;1

Book in & Concierge staff were terrible. Offhand, unhelpful & rude. They should all apply for a job at Starbucks - would fit in well there. As we didnât want to book in to an organised tour - they didnât want to know us when we enquired about main New York attractions.Asked a guy at one end of the concierge desk for a map. He said he had run out of them & sent me to cue up with many other guests at the other end of the desk - he couldnât be bothered moving 3 metres to get me the map. Donât use this hotel.;1

We stayed at this hostel for 3 nights, but please do not book here. The rooms where aful (dirty sheets, mold on the bed, moldy showers with hair,..). The doors are very loud and so are some people that also stay there. Woke up from the noise of someone throwing up twice. The staff is very rude and made us feel very unsafe. Itâs not at all like on the pictures! The morning we where packing the staff knocked on our door, accusing us that we threw water out of the window and they where going to call the police if we werenât gone in 30 minutes. They ruined our citytrip, please do not book here!!;1
"I get it.  NY hotels are expensive. But one expects a certain level of comfort for that $$. Days Inn is a run-down %#*& hole that hasn't seen any fresh paint, carpet, maintenance, or real cleaning in a long time.  Odors abound (there was likely mildew under that nasty carpet, and no amount of cheap perfume could mask it or the previous smoke - in an otherwise non-smoking room).  Bathroom fixtures were wobbly and at least 10 years old.  Bath tub needed a good scrub.  They definitely need to invest heavily in a serious face-lift, if they continue to charge anything over $100/night.  frankly, I think $79 would be all the place would be worth.  I read the reviews, and figured one night won't kill me (I had to stay in the area) but not again.  ""Location"" (or rather proximity to the";1

The electrical panel was constantly popping circuit breakers, the bathroom had enough mildew to choke a horse and the service was atrocious. You had to beg for towels and toilet paper. Paper towels? ""We don't provide paper towels"". The ceiling in the bathroom was falling apart, the doorway into the bathroom was rusting and was jury rigged from it's original use. The main door coming into the apartment was the least secure door I had ever seen and was obviously jimmied on multiple occaisions. Every door in the place rattled";1
When you assigned to floors 1-3, even though you pay almost $700 for 2 nights, you canât get a morning coffee in your room. No room service/coffee pots. However, the 4th thru 11th have Keurigs.

To use the bathroom, I needed to embrace my inner Olympic gymnast, no kidding (to open the door from the inside you either have to stand in the shower or place your legs on either side of the toilet). The room was next to the elevator, so I could even hear the ""bing"" of the elevator when going to sleep.

In total it costed is 35min just to check in... See foto of queue...  Staff are working under pressure. Service without a smile. Didn't feel welcome at all. Rooms are mediocre.   Location is brilliant. Despite this, will never come back and definitely will not recommend this hotel to anyone.;1
The hotel's location is terrible. It claims to be in a super, convenient location, but the various blocks around the hotel are practically desolate or if inhabited, by no one you would like to be approached by. We booked this hotel on expedia. It cost almost 200 dollars, so you would assume it's got to be decent. we drove to the driveway of the hotel, got in and immediately we wanted to leave. The lobby was ugly (startling for a $200 a day stay). The surrounding area filled with riff raff, no place for a vacation. But we were going to put up with it. After all, it's a pain to have to move to a different hotel. But the interaction with the front desk clerk did it!!! I considered it a stroke of good luck that the clerk was so disgustingly rude. Obviously he doesn't realize he's in;1
You get what you pay for I suppose, and this room was rather cheap for the location, but claimed to be 60% discounted because I booked at the last minute. If that is true then it's not that cheap at full price. The location is good and the lobby is impressive but the room was grotty with stained walls. At least the bathroom seemed clean and new but the room was not. 4 stars evidently refers to hotel facilities and not standards. I expected the room to be tiny but not grotty. I will not return.;1
My partner and I stayed at Park West in early December for two nights, and if we had another option it would have been none. From the road (and online photography) it looks like a nice, trendy hotel. It is well located on 106th St. There is a very lovely doorman who went to a significant effort to be friendly and helpful. The lobby is tastefully decorated and well-warmed in winter. Unfortunately, that is where the positive attributes of this entire experience ended.   At check-in, the staff were uncertain if our room was ready - despite us being delayed from a 4pm check-in until 10pm. They had to physically go up to level 4 and see if the room was ready before they gave us keys.   We then jumped in the minuscule, incredibly slow elevator - barely fitting our two bodies and two;1
Do not put anyone in that room. The door is not to code, bathroom is not to code. Ceiling was leaking and paint was coming down. Keurig was complimentary but had to wait 45 minutes for coffee, should it be prestocked in the room if itâs free? When it finally came, housekeeping didnât bring water. I guess they expected us to use bathroom water. Pool is tiny, pool deck waitress forgot my husbands order and he waited almost an hour after I received my food. Overall very disappointing experience!;1

I found this one of the most horrible hotels I've stayed in. The lobby looks amazing but once you enter the room corridors it looks dated and shabby. The room wasn't much better. We were in a standard room and stayed here in total for four nights in a standard room, two before a cruise and two after and both rooms were as bad as each other. Barely any natural lights gets in so the rooms are dark and gloomy. Also really ill thought out in terms of placing of electrical sockets, i.e. none near the mirror for plugging in hairdryers etc. The shower in one of the rooms had a constant dripping. The rooms are so pokey and there's no obvious place to store cases. In one room the desk and chair was even right next to the bed, meaning I then had to find a place to move the chair to so I;1
We just came back from NY and stayed at the Hotel Riverside Suites aka The Dumps. For $160 a night, we expected it to be something decent. The hallways smelled like poop and sewer mix. The carpet was disgustingly stained. You can feel the coils on the bed. The little refrigerator did not even make our sodas cold. (And yes, it was plugged!) The supposedly laundried towels had hair on them. (I know it's not ours, because they were blond.) The lamp did not have a shade. The blinds fell with one pull. The bathrooms were dirty. And the phone....NO PHONE! On our second day, there was a posting on the hallway on our floor about how bad the hotel is. The postings multiplied during our stay. So it's clear that there was someone or even more who share the same feelings. If you don't care;1
We booked this hotel based on bring  a 4 star hotel. We got very disappointed upon our arrival. We not even greeted properly by the staff and the reception. Our room was shockingly small and looked dirty and old. Our bedsheet and pillows were very uncomfortable. Bedsheets felt like toilet paper. Pillow were too uncomfortable and high that we had to take the ibuprofen on daily basis due to neck pain. I called the housekeeping and asked for a another type of problem pillow. She said this is our standard pillow and we do not have other options. We could hear the people next to us when they talked or even coughed. We also heard water running through the pipes. We approached the front desk with our concerns and the lady at the desk started with saying that she âhas 20 years of;1

Absolutely horrendous place. The rooms are small, smelly, noisy, nothing works, and the service is plain and simple awful. They just do not care. Had issues with the shower, parking, the bathroom, you name it. Don't bother complaining since the staff simply doesn't care. Didn't have hot water in the shower in the morning, no cream and sugar for 4 days during my stay and if you call the reception, you're told that they have no one in the building to bring it. To make things worse, the majority of rooms face the exterior AC units of other rooms so that's all you can hear at night. Cannot get a good night sleep at this horrific nightmare of a so called hotel. Will never never return to this awful place.;1

We asked if we could have a nice room and we're told she would upgrade us. That was a pleasant surprise, until we got to the room. It was very small with a bath about 4ft long with a poorly functioning shower head fixed to the wall. The room was very dated, although I must admit the rather small double bed was comfortable. The wardrobe had a very bad smell so we didn't use it.

Boy was I wrong about what I would be walking into. I literally think they put us in a janitor's closet. I understand NYC is strapped for space, but the room was so small that you could barely walk comfortably around the bed without jamming your shin into the bed frame and could not get into the bathroom and close the door without straddling the toilet or getting in the shower. Topping on the cake was the fact that the thermostat was broken so it was a sweltering 90 degrees the entire night. So for someone who is an asthmatic and has major sinus issues the sleep was the furthest from a dream that you imagine when you;1
"I was in NYC for a large family event.  We booked this hotel based on the photos on line and the location.  The only redeeming quality about this hotel is it's location.  The pictures on line LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE REALITY OF THIS ""HOTEL"".  My room (#402) was disgusting - dirty, tiny, and broken.  The handle in the shower was broken, the shelf above the bathroom sink was broken.  The window shade had a thick layer of dust on it.  The TV worked, but I could only get a few stations.  They gave us a teeny tiny bar of soap and 2 very small bath towels.  There was no bath mat or extra towel to put on the floor.  The worst part was the customer service.  At the front desk we were treated like a nuisance.  Sorry to be so harsh but I have NEVER stayed at such a disappointing property.  I";1
I know this is considered a cheap price for Manhattan, and the location was very convenient.   Due to a mid-week trip elsewhere I stayed in two different rooms.  The first room I stayed in was ok though shabby looking (worn carpets and curtains. not very appealing). The second room I stayed in was horrible - hairs all over the bathroom, wooden board lining the sink stuck with gaffer tape.  However, the main horror was BEDBUGS. I was bitten all over my body, and am still recovering (after three weeks!). I told the receptionist about this and he said that they would check the room and refund me if there were bedbugs in the room. I never heard back from the hotel, even after sending several emails, with photos showing the pattern of the bites that is typical of bedbugs ('three in a;1

We checked into this property on 12/26 for an after Christmas Vacation with our son. On arrival at the Property there was problems after problem.. The TV in the room didn't work, The Windows were so dirty you could not see the City the blinds were broken and OLD. The desk service could only be worst if i had gone to the front desk at the neighboring hotel. The Bathroom was outdated and the fixtures did not work. They charged an extra 900plus Dollars on my Credit Card and Expected me to get it corrected. There housekeeping was second to NONE. Could not even leave you clean towels. Asked the Desk to call an Taxi and was told to go to the corner and hail my own Taxi at 5AM.  THIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ITS in need of being Condemned!!!!!!!;1
Small rooms, with 1950s style showers and leaking windows, no hotel would decently rent rooms that have ânaturalâ air conditioned rooms with windows that leak in every room , and a heating system that can not overpower the cold air leaking intothe room.  This is truly horrible place to stay at. The bedding is so outdated and incomfortable. The bed linens and duvet are so thin, thanks to the natural leakage of every window, you just almost freeze for your entire stay duration at the new yoker Hotel. The fridge in the room is very noisy,  The air conditioning unit is working full time to try to prevent the room temp from falling below 40F at night with the wind blowing through the windows.  The hotel management is incapable of providing extra bedding or a stand alone heater unit.;1

"We indicated on our initial booking we would be arriving after 9pm but when we arrived we were told our booking had been cancelled due to an issue with our card payment. They found us 2 rooms for that night after much pleading and we paid with the  same card they had had ""issues"" with earlier. We were left with no where to stay for our second night and the staff kept telling us to come back in case something came up which wasnt very helpful as we had plans for the saturday. The staff were really unhelpful and the hostel itself is really noisy.";1
"This hotel is horrendous. We had a confirmed reservation for a double room for three people. When we checked in the hotel was ""sold out"" and all they had for us was a ""room"" with two twin beds.

Where do I start , I see a lot of good reviews but frankly speaking I think you need glasses ! This is the first hotel in the world I have ever checked out of immediately after arriving with my wife from Uk .Prior to arriving I had emailed on several occasions ahead to try upgrade and place something special in the room for my wifeâs birthday! No reply to any email at all . Night before we flew I eventually managed to get through on the phone to someone who was apparently working from home and helped with a room upgrade to sweat / balcony etc . A credit card was given to secure the upgrade and a email confirmation. The email was wrong as stated 1 person and a total value of over $2,700 for 4 nights . I had already paid fir a standard room but charged this for a upgrade! We;1

I've never been in such a horrible place, please avoid it! Firstly we came and the receptionist was rude, and gave us a room in 5th floor or something, we had to walk through tiny nasty corridors and the room was next to a room with open door and there sat a group of junkies. The room was terrible, no bath, looking old and horrible. We saw no emergency exit, and went back to reception, on our way a man opened his door, and inside we saw lots of stuff and garbage, HE LIVED THERE! And it stinked urin and garbage. Then we said to the receptionist we wanted a better room on the ground floor, because we actually were too afraid to sleep there, firstly because of the nasty people we had seen (we are 2 blond girls), and secondly because if there is a fire, you are dead, you can't;1

My mother, aunt and I stayed in room 704 of this hotel this past weekend.  The roon we were given was completely unacceptable.  The room was hot, although it was only in the 20's and 30's at night, even though we ran the air conditioner all night.  There was an abundance of mold growing on the ceiling in the bathroom.  The carpeting by the window of the room was wet, frayed, dirty - gross.  We complained about the room but were told that another was not available.  The next afternoon, after a failed attempt to clean the mold, we were given another room that was better, but still not what I would consider adequate.  I would definitely not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.  I probably would not stay at any Days Inn anywhere because of this experience.;1
"The room is very small, has bare white walls, no pictures, mirrors, nothing. Carpet is dirty and worn. The bed is small and hard. The room has a small sink and small table, that' it.

The halls in this ""hotel"" are nerrow, have bare white dirty walls, and dirty, worn carpet.";1
It's a hostel not a hotel. Poor value for money. No elevator. No lobby. Rooms are tiny (marginally bigger than the bed itself). Bathroom is smaller than a typical hotel closet.

"If you are looking for a rude and threatening checking in please go to the Wyndham New Yorker. It was definitively the worst reception I ever had in a hotel. At our check in, the staff literally took the credit card off my hands, charged me twice the amount and then when I asked him he started to yelling with us, threatening us in a way I have never seen in any hotel. I had to call my bank to cancel the one of the double charge. Despite the rude and threatening reception, I would also mention that the hotel charge you a ""resort"" fee of U$ 39, despite absolutely nothing is offered for this service (not even a small fridge or even a single coffee). Overall, I would never recommend this rude place. It will ruin your beautiful and nice trip to NYC.";1

During this pandemic, I had to go to new york and I decided to stay at the new yorker hotel. Everything it's very disturbing with the pandemic situation that the last thing that you need is that the employees of the hotel treat you badly.  I got the worst experience ever with a lady working at night time as a security and taking your temperature every time that you go in and out of the hotel. very annoying. she wasn't nice or kind. she treated me badly, she was very mean. There is another guy that works at night, Asian. He wasn't professional at all. Neither of them was.  they shouldn't treat clients badly.  I won't ever come back and I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. plus, in these pandemic times.;1
The hotel is dated but the experience was okay. Until I received my car back from valet and the molding down the side of my car was completely missing. Poor response from management of a blurry picture that showed the molding there when it arrived. Still no follow up from management. Nice area. Little over priced for the quality of the rooms. Donât recommend parking a car here at all.;1

Read the reviews and picked the Hilton for our Universal Studio tour. Wish I would of went to the Sheraton instead...just 1/2 block down the hill. Coming from the Grand Californian in DisneyLand, which is a very nice hotel, showing some age, but clean.  Family of 2 adults, and 2 children 7 & 10, stayed one night (thank God) 2nd week of August 2006. This stay was the worst, capped off by NO WATER in the entire hotel early morning until check out the next day....finally COLD water at 10:30am next day!!  I understand problems arise, but it goes to more than a lack of water issue. Just plain dirty and a lack of upkeep. The following is what we found at this hotel, the good and the bad.  THE GOOD  1. Close to Universal Studios, walk up the hill or take a free bus that comes every 15;1
We did not get a single hour of sleep because of the bugs and the fear of being bitten. I could not take a shower because of the rust and the mold on the walls. This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever had. The front door was very difficult to lock, there were bugs in the room, the windows did not open and one window pane even has a crack in it.   There were four of us staying the night at Chelsea Central Apartments (208 West 23rd Avenue Chelsea NY).When my boyfriend and I got to the room we dropped our bags as well and left to go meet them in the city. When we returned we stayed in the room for about and hour before leaving to go out for the evening. It was not until we returned that night (around 1 or 2am) that we found the mold and rust in the bathroom. We got into the;1

I booked it and paid for 3 nights in advance, and i checked out in total 20 Mins. i had to book another hotel as soon i saw the room and my whole prepaid booking for this hotel got wasted. Please please please dont book this hotel, total waste of money and time.;1
"This hotel is NOT a 3 star hotel. It should be a 2 star Motel and that would still be a high rating. The lobby is the only nice thing about this Motel. We received a ""deluxe room"". As we were walking to our room- we could actually hear the people in their rooms as we passed by- talking, singing, laughing, music. Once in our room- there were cracks in the walls, holes in the love seat fabric, cigarette burns, holes, and stains in the carpets, mold in the shower tiles, holes in the blue blankets on the bed, peeling wall paper, the bed mattress was sunk in the middle, all the furniture was cracked and chipped and the desk had not been dusted in many, many days. This was just at first glance and the things I took photos of before we backed out of the room and walked back to our car";1

On our arrival the check in clerk could not find our reservation. So he asked us to stand aside until he sorted it out. Finally solved it after 20 minutes. We arrived early @ 9.30 and asked if our room was ready as we had travelled all night from Australia. He said it would cost us extra. If the room is ready, why pay extra?? We then left and came back @ 3pm. On our reservation we had a room with a city view booked, we ended up on the second floor which is BELOW the lobby overlooking the pool which is opened till very late at night and was noisy. There was no fridge in the room, so they delivered one to us. The room we were in was quite nice. They did say they were doing renovations, but they were working on the lifts at 11pm at night  it sounded like they were drilling . It was;1
I used to travel to NYC on business almost every month for five years, and always, ALWAYS stayed at the Empire Hotel. The staff was awesome, the doorman knew my name--to me, it was a 5-star hotel.  Now it is a hell-hole. I had a reservation in February and it was the worst hotel experience of my life. I love this hotel, and it crushed me.   Upon arrival, there were the typical Gossip Girl fans all over the lobby, as well as some non-appropriate folks, just hanging out. There was one line for check-in, which was very awkward. The woman in front of me was treated rudely, but I assumed it was justified. Boy, was I wrong!  It was 3:15 when I checked in--after waiting in the SINGLE LINE for ONLY ONE PERSON who was handling check-ins. He called housekeeping to make sure the room had;1

Stayed at the Windsor Hotel with my 15 year old son for 3 nights and can honestly say that in all my travels this  was the most awful place I have ever stayed. The area is rundown and there were guys on the street hanging out and drinking beer. It is not the place for a woman to stayalone with her child but i had never been to new York before and the travel agent told me it would be fine!  On arrival there was no bell boy and we had to hump our cases up to our room ourselves which was unacceptable as I have mobility problems. The safety deposit box is not fixed to the room and can be carried off by anyone entering the room.  The room was small and clean ,but shabby. We had been informed that the hotel had been recently refurbished but we did not see any evidence of this. there;1

I went to this place after having read reviews so I thought I was prepared.  I know these places are old, but when the bathtub looks like 100 years old, how bad would it be to replace it? The bathrooms were really gross.  Saw a cockroach in the hallway... where there is one, there are lots more and a friend saw a few scatter in another bathroom when she turned the lights on. But if you can put up that, the rooms were fairly clean, staff were pleasant enough and the location and price are good.;1
My friends and I were going to stay for one night and they had booked here a month or so in advance. It looks decent from the outside, but once inside the lobby I realized that it was going to be less than what I had anticipated. Walking down the hall to our room, my hopes faltered even more. Stepping into the room, I had just about had it. I nearly cried. There were large pits in the flooring that are covered up by the carpeting. They were large enough to give you an ankle sprain if you aren't careful. Next thing I noticed was that the ceiling was completely covered in stains. I told my friends NOT to sit on the bed or put their things down on it. There was one small sink in the room and an old dresser missing all but one of it's knobs. There was crust on the walls and a funny;1
I booked here on a whim.  I stay in NYC every week and honestly usually stay a few blocks up at the Nylo most of the time.  I lived in the neighborhood for years until May and had only been to the rooftop bar in the past.  The rooms and hallways are just beaten down and old.  The hallway smells like cat urine.  My main complaint was there was no heat.  I had a window that you saw the curtains blow and it was closed.  My room was freezing and it was low 50's outside.  I was told that it had to dip into the 40's to have the heat turn on.  Never, ever had I ever run into this at any hotel in NYC in my life.  If my window was sealed it may have been easier but I was basically staying in a room with a 5X5 foot open window.  The staff was unbelievably rude.  I tried to check out;1

I arrived at my hotel and was told our rooms would not be on the same floor and that if we wanted this we would have to upgrade for $125 per room this meant a better room with a view. The VIEW we had in our room was not a good view at all for an extra payment it was terrible especially compared to the room that my mum had her view was amazing. We complained and asked for a refund on the room but we were told this was not allowed so they relocated us;1

This past weekend, we traveled to New York City with our 80 year old aunt and 86 year old uncle for a family celebration.  At 6 a.m. on Monday morning, Auntie realized that someone had come into their room as they slept and stolen all of their cash, a debit card, a couple of checks and a credit card.  However, the robbers were kind enough not to steal their driver's license, which would have prevented us from being able to fly home! (Our room was two floors down.)  Auntie called the front desk and was told the manager wouldn't be in that day, but would be informed later. Also, Auntie was told that it was up to her whether to call the police. They expressed no interest in Auntie and Uncle's safety and well-being or concern in determining whether other guests had been robbed.  The;1
My sister and I booked here through a discount website. We knew the neighborhood and wanted a safe and quiet quarter. The hotel was some weird low income rental village where people in duct tape shoes meet European tourists. We booked for three nights but checked out after one.

Worst customer service I've ever encountered, nothing can be worse than this. Everything has a price, every single thing, very annoying.   The guys at the counter are very rude, they don't appreciate their customer at all, and didn't look like they are willing to improve at all.  Other than the location is near to Hammersmith station, there is nothing else good about this hostel.  Totally not recommended if you want a pleasant stay in London.;1
My husband & I recently stayed in the Morningside Inn. We had originally booked a double room but had a friend who decided to accompany us. My husband emailed the given email address 4 times and did not receive a response, I then rang and spoke to Patrick, the manager, who agreed we could stay in a triple room and 'amended' our booking.  When we arrived, we were told that we had to stay in one specific room overnight and to change the next day, by another staff member (not Patrick). After a 7 hour flight and 1 hour train ride into Manhattan, we were all looking forward to a hot shower, but as per the previous reviews, no hot water.... My husband made a complaint to the lady at the front desk and was told they were 'fixing the boiler' and it would be fine tomorrow. Needless to;1

"I stayed at this hostel for 5 days. My friend and I arrived at the hostel at night. The workers were quite unfriendly and didn't make us feel welcome at all. The hallways were dark and sketchy and seemed dark and luminous to walk through at night. The showers were so bad. Firstly, the water stayed on for 5 seconds before it automatically turned off. Secondly, you couldn't set the temperature for the water so pretty much took cold showers. Thirdly, there was no hooks place to put your clean clothes in the shower so you had to either put everything on the ground or drape them over the shower door. So the room itself was okay; however, the hostel was super loud because every little noise made in the hallway would echo. I've stayed at a different on a previous trip to London for";1
The hotel is quite old, it has no drinking water in the room, The fridge is emtpy, the furniture also quite old. The bathroom needs upgraded.  Basically, with the price we paid we can find somewhere newer and closed to downtown. Another thing is that it is quite hard to navigate back to the hotel due to road work around the area.;1
I expected a bit more from the Hilton, being a Hilton. We paid for a view plus breakfast. The view was amazing, but that's it. There is no cleaning service during your stay due to covid. They do not tell you this at booking or online. You have to ask for towels because no one will come to your room. There is no where to hang your towels after you shower. No command hooks or anything. Then, we paid for breakfast with our stay but the vouchers they give you is for a la carte breakfast only....they only serviced buffet so our pre-paid breakfast was no longer available so we got a discount but no refund. No refund on our pre-paid breakfast that they are not serving. They use covid as an excuse for everything, yet they serve buffet food. We paid a lot of money to stay here and no;1

"I was there as part of a wedding party, and there was no running water or electricity. I was on the 11th floor.  I had to walk up and down the stairs 4 times!!!!!  People were passing out in the pitch dark, boiling stairwell.  The lobby looked like a refugee camp, people huddled around generators trying to charge their phones.  And, although the hotel claimed they weren't responsible for the grid shutting down, they should have been better prepared for the inevitability of everyone checking out.  He tried to charge us for the room!!!!  He asked if we ""needed a recipe"" and when I protested, he admitted he couldn't even give us a recipt as the system was still down.  Um, ok?  So why did you ask us if we needed one?  Apparently the manager is going to call everyone and ""sort this";1
I arrived the hotel late. When I checked in, the front desk told me they do not have my reservation. I definitely have my reservation at the right day! But the hotel refused me to check in. They had available room, they asked me to pay extra $200 to stay. I called the customer service. The customer service was not helpful, she asked me find out by myself. She is the most terrible customer service I have ever met. I called again and talked with the manager. I got my stay finally. It took me an hour to get my stay.;1
I stayed with three girlfriends for 3 nights.  When we arrived at the check in desk, other guests were complaining, so this did not bode well. The hotel is very dark and in need not only of refurbishment but of a very good clean. I had to launder all of my clothes when I got home - including those that I had not worn - as they all smelt of the dirty hotel. I cannot comment on the food as we chose to stay out of the hotel as much as possible during our trip and did not sample it. Avoid this hotel at all costs.;1
Booked a business room (Premier Club) with two separate beds but got a room in the unrenovated part of the hotel where wifi didn't work. They tried to give us three different rooms the first night and no one had two beds. We slept in a room with no heat turned on and with only one bed. They promised us the room we booked but the next day we got a standard room. We never got the type of room we paid for for the enture 5 nights stay. There were old beds and furnitures++++ and staff wasn't very friendly or serviceminded.;1
