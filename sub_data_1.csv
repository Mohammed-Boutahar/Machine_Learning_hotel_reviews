was there for wobi conference across the street at lincoln center didnât sleep a wink as the street noise from the 7th floor was as if we were actually on broadway and not in an expensive hotel woke up to shower and get ready for the big first day and there was no water called the front desk but they never picked up the damn phone went down to complain and they said they had no idea as they hadnât received a complaint no kidding you didnât answer the phone had to go to battle with management to get refunded no one wants to unpack and then change hotels but that is exactly what we did the place is small dark and in need of maintenance front desk and door staff were polished but it seems like they know the place kind of stinks too bad as itâs a great location the;1

do yourself a huge favor and do not stay here i dont even know where to begin the vast majority of the rooms are tiny smelly outdated and unhealthy we had two rooms one was too hot the other too cold regardless of the thermostat setting the heatingair conditioning system itself is extremely noisy and the windows are very cheap and drafty so if you value any sort of tranquility definitely look elsewhere in addition to all this half of the elevators dont work at any given time the staff are extremely unprofessional and nasty and the management is completely unresponsive there are so many other hotels in ny that are so much better where you can at least get a good nights sleep that there is absolutely no reason to stay here youll most likely have an;1

myself and my family stayed here at the end of october and i have to say i agree with the negative reviews below the hotel rooms are tired the shower is nearly impossible to work and broken pipes means your shower to be flooded i also found some of the reception staff to be particularly rude and arrogant towards us the drinks and food are astonishingly high especially as the barrestaurant next door was fantastic and at least half the price all in all a disappointment for us we will be returning to new york but not to this hotel;1
i am writing in regard of our stay earlier in november 2015 the hotel was okay but we were very upset at the way the car rental place in the lobby worked they charged us 150 for some extra fee that we never agreed on asked them to email us a copy of the receipt and it never came through either the advertisement that said car rental 25day is a big fat lie after we signed some paper they told us about a bunch of other hidden fees ended up paying heaps for one day worth of car rental also got scammed 150 without any explanation whatsoever this is an absolute disgrace your hotel should discuss this with the car rental service you provided i had a pleasant stay at the hotel but would never recommend this to anyone 010;1

i just recently finished a brief stay at hyatt regency lax and wanted to drop a few notes on things i wish they could improve on as a fan of the hyatt brand i always feel that the gift of feedback could further elevate guest experiences going forward here they are 1 include basic amenities as part of housekeeping when i checked in i was surprised that there were no water bottles no hotel slippers and no dental kits the bottle containing body wash was also almost depleted as if it was never filled in time for a new guest to stay in i would understand if not all amenities are available in the room i believe that is quite standard in most hyatt stays and they are available upon request but for these basic amenities housekeeping must make them readily available to;1
as iâm writing this review i donât even know where to start it started on the day of our arrival our reservation was canceled while on the plane so we arrived early evening with a very big surprise the reception told us it wasnât a problem and checked us in and guess what the price just went up the fees went up and till our surprise we had to pay more and more about 1200 more than the original booking price surprised super tired and annoyed we checked in and decided to take this up with the manager the next morning and paid 23 of our stay next morning we noticed the blankets we slept under too tired to check everything cause you donât expect that had blood stains to us thatâs pretty unforgivable and disgusting for a 4 star rated hotel as everything wasnât bad;1

while the hotel overall is nice and located in a good area we were dissatisfied with the size of the room and the air conditioningheating the hotel is old and the pipes are old this is the excuse we heard from the front desk for our entire visit we even recorded how loud the noises were in our room from the pipes and we were told nothing could be done if you want a good nights rest after a busy day in new york this is probably not the place for you when i say the rooms were small it was the smallest room ive ever stayed in and it was supposedly a deluxe king room wont be back to this hotel unfortunately;1

today is our first day in the hotel from the begining we were really bad receptioned a couple of weeks before we askedfor a crib as we are traveling with the whole family and our 11 month old daughter the receptionist had zero sensibility with my wife carrying the baby and was really stupid with her in the end of the day we are still without the crib we completely lost our first day of vacation trying also to find out an inflatable tub for giving the baby a bath the baby is now slapping on the floor in a bed sheet no security and filthy floor;1
i stayed at this hotel for a conference and initially was quite pleased with the rooftop bar there definitely were some drawbacks the pool is more like a narrow wading track my room was tiny and the hall smelled like ganga the first night and my bed was very hard with lumpy pillows but for the price and location i thought i had gotten what my company had paid for the real problem came at checkout i was confronted with a bill for 91 for residency fees of over 22 a night i had not been informed of this fee when i checked in i was told very rudely that i had signed something to this effect but when i looked at what i signed it essentially seemed like i was signing for incidentals which i was careful not to rack up while i was there and the fee was completely;1

frankly one of the worst hotels iâve stayed in ever upon arrival the hotel staff almost seemed put out to check us in our room was spacious but not the cleanest we found a pair of socks from a previous owner under the table and the bathroom was looking pretty shabby breakfast was included so donât be conned by buying rooms with breakfast as extra unfortunately the breakfast wasnât up to scratch and the staff were the rudest people around in particular the chef who had something against anyone who asked for anything despite it being his job the worst thing of the whole stay was coming back to find what looked like an ecstasy tablet on my 6yr olds bed luckily he didnât put it in his mouth but this made us feel extremely uncomfortable and the attitude of the staff was;1

this was my second time staying at this hotel and i can safely say it will be my last before arriving i noticed the hotel had charged my card with extra charges i contacted the hotel and they did sort this out very quickly arrived from a red eye flight from los angeles my room was ready at 10am which was a bonus room was extremely small no issue for me however this hotel has gone down hill since my last stay in 2016 room was very grubby and even the lamp shades were wonky and dirty hair in the bathroom sink and i noticed the hotel does donât provide sanitary disposal bags for females only stayed one night so wasnât the end of the world was woken very early by house keeping banging down my door and unable to get back to sleep as they were extremely loud in the;1
the heating system didnt work couldnt control temperature we complained at front desk but all they told us was using a portable heater other customer was complaining that their room was cold too but their response was the same we asked the hotel to check other rooms but all heating system didnt work my son and husband caught a cold over the first night by sleeping in the cold room we went to la to enjoy a vacation not to get a sick we booked this hotel through expedia so we called the customer service to get help but they didnt help us at all we ended up spending a day to look for a different hotel by ourself and paid an extra fee for the hotel;1
dreadful we had to ask for our room to be changed twice the first room had dirty peeling wallpaper and a filthy floor the second had a bathshower where the tiles were coming off the wall and a strange substance in the bath the third and final room had peeling wallpaper a filthy carpet dirty curtains no handles on any of the drawers but at least the bathroom was clean the hotel is in an old building and would be charming if it was clean and renovated which it isnt the carpets throughout were dirty the walls were dirty and although we had a room for four people we were only given sufficient towels for two people on the postive side the hotel is in a great location and at least the sheets and towels were changed every day would we stay here again not in a;1
on the plus side the beds were comfortable and the room was clean downside it took 10 minutes of groaning water pipes to get hot water the temperature nozzle for the tub was very loose so your choices were scalding hot or lukewarm the towels are threadbare forget taking a bath because the tub drain would not close forget drying your hair because the blow dryer did not work forget eating leftovers because there was not a refrigerator nor a microwave and plan on living our of your suitcase because there was no dresser in which to put your clothes the worst thing however was when we asked the lady behind the desk to hail us a cab to jfk we had researched it and cabs are not allowed to charge more than 52 to take you from anywhere in manhattan to jfk;1

we booked this hotel from bookingcom months prior when the day finally came for us to checkin we were greeted by the rudest man at the counter not only did he try to charge us 800 more than what we reserved from bookingcom our frustration only grew when we were forced to call bookingcom to have them speak to the rude man to allow us to stay at the hotel for the inital quoted price we arrived at the hotel after a long flight at 12am and it was not 130pm we had so many issues with the hotel which forced us to take it up with the manager giselle who agreed to compensate us 50 for the trouble caused who then blackmailed us and wanted us to leave the hotel and find another place to stay at mid holiday not worth the hassle this was a hotel i was looking forward to;1

a friend and i went up to los angeles to see hamilton and decided wed splurge and spend the night i researched trip advisor for a nice hotel that was somewhat near the theater we stayed one night on october 14th our room was on the 2nd floor of the 4 lamps in the room only 2 of them worked the mini refrigerator was turned on but wasnt cold there was a metal cover on the ceiling of the shower that was rusting the room definitely needed to be refurbished the next morning we got up and there were ants in the bathroom coming out from beneath the tub to say the least we packed as quickly as we could and got out of there when i checked out i mentioned all of these items to the clerk who wrote them down i dont understand why this hotel got such positive reviews;1

the property is in a good location and i like the shuttle to universal studios the hotel had a starbucks in it but itâs no longer there which is unfortunate itâs nice to have a less expensive option than the restaurant in the hotel i have stayed at this property several times in the past so i was really excited to have my son experience it i had never had a bad experience here before so i was really caught off guard when my son daughter and i were returning from dinner in west hollywood our lyft which had picked us up at the lobby was not allowed to come onto the property when we returned from a late dinner one of the parking attendants that i noticed when we originally arrived on the property earlier stopped our driver when we first turned from universal drive to the;1
i recently stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine date of checkin was 9909 separate rooms it started out just fine until we tried to sleep after both having very long flights the newly opened hotel bar really should be called a club and it really should not be in this hotel it kept both of us awake at all hours of the night remember that nyc bars dont shut down until about 4am when we complained to the front desk he tried to give us the excuse that all the rooms are soundproof nice try but i dont think so the bags under my eyes are proof my friend has her own handful of complaints with this place they didnt stock her room with clean towels and they didnt clean her room until we specifically asked and requested them to do so this is probably;1
i havent stayed at this property for over 20 years only to discover that it hasnt been well maintained since ive been gone from the self parking garage there are no clear signs to direct you to the lobby reception desk so you have to do a lot of walking to find where to check in upon checkin i inquired about a hhonors gold upgrade and was granted a complementary upgrade to the executive lounge level the room seems like a typical hilton room nothing special to indicate an upgrade in the morning i inquired about the location of the executive lounge and was informed that this hilton property closed the executive lounge 5 years ago so i have an upgrade to the executive lounge level with no executive lounge next i asked about where i get my free breakfast;1

this hotel is advertised as 4 how the rooms are tiny seriously small aqueen room had 5 hangers and nospace for anything else literally no space people found a new insect crawling in the bathroom the toilet kept on blocking for both reason at all they also advertise free wifi which is a lie you have to pay i went ahead an paid for it anyway only for it to not work anyway and im still waiting for my refund as i type ok so the location is good if you want midtown hotel but the edison on 47th street is the same price and 100 better if you were thinking about booking here dont if you already have tough look;1
i am not sure how this hotel was rated as a three or fourstar hotel they are clearly a two star hotel this place is not what is shown in the pictures released by the hotel this place is dilapidated on top of that they have very very bad customer service and they do not pickup the telephone i had to call four times and each time the telephone continuously rang the front desk staff all say they are the onsite manager to derail you from complaining to the manager the housekeeping staff talk loudly in the halls as they clean i reserved a queen bed and was vehemently told there were no rooms other that two double beds i later asked a women who signed in after me an hour later if she had a queen bed and the women said yes they have very small rooms not electrical;1
beware when they offer you a room on the 11th floor im writing this at 250am and the party in the rooftop bar is still going on i rang down 20 minutes ago to ask how much longer it would be going on and was told he would ring up and ask them to turn it down and that it would be ending soon fat chance it would appear on both counts i always travel with earplugs but here they are useless so if you want a room where you stand no chance of sleeping choose the 11th floor of the empire hotel new york;1

easily the worst hotel iâve stayed at in at least two years â as a new yorker i was familiar with the lobby and rooftop which are nice but the rooms are far behind in terms of quality and badly in need of an update to start with iâve stayed here for almost a week now and the heat has not worked properly a single night the staff provided a space heater for me because none of the 45 engineers that were sent have been able to fix the heating unit the space heater doesnât have a thermostat leading to many nights where iâm woken up by it being either too hot or too cold in the room there is also a strange smell in the room sometimes of chlorine and sometimes as if someone had been smoking in it before the bathroom door wonât shut without hitting the toilet not worth the;1
given its handy proximity to the centre of new york i was going to err on the positive when it came to writing this review even though i have stayed in more impressive 2 hotel so i had planned to emphasise that the fact that the public areas and room were kept lovely and clean some of the staff were friendly and helpful however the additional unexpected charge of the equivalent to â£20 per day called a facility fee totally overshadowed the few positives i had already pre paid in a package deal for my 5 night stay i had no extras in the very small basic double room which had no mini bar or drink making facility but on check out got an equivalent to â£100 bill when i questioned this i was told in a very abrupt manner that this was a facility fee for use of the business;1

we arrived january 10th in the morning our room was not available which we expected however we were told we would be notified via call or text when the room was ready that never happened when we came back to the hotel at 430 we were told that we had an upgrade to a higher floor room for an extra 36 dollars i asked to have a lower floor room and not pay that extra money and front desk said we had to take that room once parking 28 and taxes were added in this increased our room to 325 this is a ridiculous amount of money for that price we could have stayed in a theme room at the disney hotel we arrived in our room and there was an issue with the heatingcooling system which made the room smell like burnt substances we did inform the front desk but no solution;1
bored and uninterested staff trying to be too pleasant all the time long uphill walk to universal studios tiny rooms for the price bath and shower combo in a tiny bathroom with pathetic water pressure no free wifi no protection against children buying 20 dollar movies to watch on a small tv very expensive onsite parking the nearby sheraton is equidistant from the universal studios resort i booked through a nonhilton booking service and they said that it couldnt count towards my hilton reward points perhaps change the name to the scrooge below universal studios;1
i am not sure if i just ended up getting a horrible room because i price lined this hotel but i got a double bed room for four people during new years first the beds were a tad bit bigger than twin beds smaller than fulls my husband is a big guy so that it was very uncomfortable what turned me off most about the hotel room was the bathrooms they were disgusting the toilet is a small 1970s toilet my husband and our friend joked that only one of their butt cheeks would fit on this my husband isnt fat by any means hes a body builder so hes buff second thing about the bathrooms there isnt a space next to the sink vanity its literally just the sink so you cant put your makeup productshair products let alone get ready in the bathroom at all the bathroom can;1

this is the seventh time l have been to the empire hotel my room was so humid it took my breath away with the smell and all my hanging clothes stank to add insult to injury l had a lot of money stolen from my case it was investigated l was told and the upshot was lit was my fault and l mustâve lost it somewhere else great no the staff was interviewed l was told and big surprise no one came in my room well actually they did and when they saw my case opened where the money was they closed the door obviously so there we are i let you judge for yourself honesty is not the culture of the empire hotel and the client is far from being king very sad indeed;1
overall the rooms are clean and have not experienced problems i paid for a captains room with a king bed the thing that is unacceptable is when arriving back from a evening out i noticed the jane ballroom was open and thought i would check it out and maybe grab a night cap before bed i walked up and i see them letting in several other people into the lounge and when i attempted to enter series of rude people running the door and a particularly rude tall woman said the lounge was closed for a private event no sign no list nothing i indicated i was a hotel guest but all that got was rolling eyes based on that treatment and the overall disregard for their guests i recommend not staying here ever i certainly wont and i travel to nyc over 30 times a year ill go;1
i tried really hard to like this place i left the courtyard marriott across the street in search of better food options my body time clock was on east coast time so i was ready to eat at 430 pmthe lobby restaurant was not crowded rather than having assigned stations the two servers alternated between guests based on their arrival order so the friendly gent that greeted me yelled to his coworker that i was his 810 mins before a menu appeared after drink arrived i waited another 15 to give my orderonly after asking several times meanwhile i witnessed 4 different people approach the bar for service because they were mid meal and not being attended to one guest actually apologized for bothering the staff people came in and out for the pool deck looking for;1

we have previously stayed at this hotel twice before for one week at a time and absolutely loved it after a long flight the same as everyone we couldnât wait to get into our room and settle upon arrival the room was extremely cold it felt like a window was wide open when they were all shut the room was very small we had previously stayed in a suite for more people so we expected it to be smaller but this was tiny the âdoorsâ joining the bedroom and the living room were not sufficient and they may as well not have been there we decided to seek assistance at the check in desk and see what the hotel could offer we first spoke to miguel who was very polite and could clearly understand our concerns he then went to fetch the manager jason who was polite at first jason;1

we chose this hotel for its proximity to universal studios unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with the hotel our room and service the double room on 22nd executive floor was very small with outdated furniture and uncomfortable beds there were large holes on the wall above our bed probably from a missing shelf or picture the bathroom had old tiles and a leaking shower with mouldy corners the continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs which was included was very mediocre overall it was a disappointing experience it felt like motel 6 but we payed close to 400 a night we would not recommend this hotel to anyone there are so many nicer places to stay for half the price just take the shuttle to universal;1

unless you plan on living in the lobby which is truly gorgeous and love the bad 80s music dont stay here the rooms are super overpriced for what you get i am from nyc and was blown away by the nastiness of the rooms the room amenities are literally falling apart the beds are uncomfortable the wallpaper is peeling off the walls the bathroom frosted door was drawn on and covered in mold not to mention the handle broken and toilet runs constantly the ac rattled and was covered in water and mold the coffee make didnt work the carpet was shredding and had crazy sticky stuff on it that stuck to your feet like gum the internet also when in and out and was as fast as old skool dial up i know the hotel is old and that is fine but for over 400 a night the rooms;1

i stayed here for three nights and while the location is great and the hotel is ok not great the service was very good however on checking out they charged me 3710 per night for a âfacility feeâ thatâs for wiif and gym and business centre i objected and told them the features had said free wifi and i hadnât used anything else but the desk manager said that this charge stated on my booking we searched and sure enough there it was buried on the third page below all of the bits that said i had paid everything in full already this was a sneaky âstealthâ fee and i will never book this hotel ever again the booking was already expensive â¬71728 for just me for 3 nights but this is just punitive and if i had known iâd have to pay another 120 iâd have found somewhere;1
we actually checked this website before booking this hotel but i can only assume the reasonable reports at the time were written by people on another planet the place was filthy there is building work going on which we werent told about which just added to the mess our room was small and in dire need of decorating just like the rest of the hotel the staff were helpful and friendly but that was the only plus point avoid this hotel at all costs;1
first off staff were fantastic and friendly and went out of the way to give us information offer service etc the hotel however no hot water flask paper cups in the room unreliable water temperature in the showers terribly outdated furniture and designs television from the 1980s mineral water not provided dusty hairdryer starchy bedsheets the list would probably be longer if i stayed more than a night only stay if you are a nikola tesla fan;1

this was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in the pictures of the hotel look lovely but when you actually get there it is grotty grubby and rough the lift was broken and we had to drag our cases up the narrow stairs without any help if that wasnt bad enough our ipod was stolen from the hotel room while we were out when we complained to the manager he smirked and muttered at the other staff in spanish without even offering an apology or help he said that it was our fault and we lost it even though the maid remembered leaving it on the bed never stay here it is a waste of money;1

stay away from this place at all costs i had the misfortune to stay at this place for a week it is dirty grimy roach and rat infested and the staff is very very unprofessional and verbally abusive the staff was very unprofessional especially the manager patrick i was verbally abused for asking for a towel and when i finally got a towel from the cleaning lady 3 days later it was dirty with hair and brown spots all over a very sexist and verbally abusive manager he would get upset at guys asking general questions and would reply happily to the same questions asked by a female if you catch him on a bad day then good luck to you the stairway is dark and really dirty and grimy the carpetting in the hallway is very old and extremely dirty i understand that a hotel has;1
have to say most service was pretty decent however the hot water was unavailable in the morning of checking out it was impossible to take a cold water shower in such a cold day the checking out staff did not even mention the fact and apologize instead trying to hide out for that reason i just dont like the experience;1
3 check in desks and no organized line some of us waited in a line and were ignored while others walked right up to the desks and were helped immediately horrible customer service should have apologized for the wait and allowing others to cut in line at the very least;1
every time i have stayed at this hotel 3 rooms total i have not felt confident of the cleanliness there were stains on the couches in all 3 rooms the shower had hair on the floor not just one strand of hair and the overall presentation of the room was unexceptional there wasnt even complimentary lotion on the bathroom counter not that its necessary to provide that but it is generally anticipated at an establishment like this there was only one bath towel and the lamp glared on the television overall i felt very hesitant to touch anything from the elevator to the inside of my room;1
the only positive i can describe about this hotel is the beds that were very big and comfy cons the area is awful rough scary whatever you want to call it very unsafe when we checked in a junkie from the street made their way into the lobby screaming which was very unsettling the receptionist gisele had a bad attitude bearing in mind were british tourists who had never been to americala and simply asked if the subway was safe to use she went on the defence immediately for some reason and was also very snappy and unhelpful about explaining the deposit there seems to be a lot of bad reviews about her particularly on here lose the attitude it doesnt look good beautiful view from our room of a family clinic small pool which is next to the car park;1
when we arrived they said we dont have a room because they tried our credit card and it got rejected strange on the same day we paid with this card and everything was fine after they found a room for us there was a problem with the water and they blaimed us saying we broke the tap i wonder how can one do that never heard about it they shutdown the water in our room for a day and still charged us for a room with a private bath terrible;1
this hotel is the epitome of american greed imagine a dump like this demanding rates of 28900 for my first night and yes 49000 for my 2nd and 3rd nights stay the carpets are so filthy you dont want to even put your feet down and you are afraid to touch everything else the furniture is overused filthy and just despicable and they pay absolutely no attention to details beyond swiping your cc engaging usury practices based on the greed of increasing reservations as they choose to forget that they are renting you a room and unconcerned as to what one is paying for as they prey on the vulnerable traveler;1

hi people if you are planning for this hotel please give it a miss because the staff at the reception is horrible they just want to loot the customers and remove more money from them by telling them to book private taxis and shuttles through them by charging them a higher price they never suggest the train because they do not earn anything while i travelled in the train to universal studios and it is the best and convenient way to universal and the station is also just 2 blocks away from hotel when i was leaving the hotel they charged me additional access fee for using the phone when i had already spoken to them before calling and they told me that phone calls are free of charge but the access fee they did not mention so it was a pretty bad experience for me so i suugest;1

i had one of my worst hotel experiences at the new yorker wyndham hotel the only positive aspect of that hotel is the very nice housekeeping staff the front desk has very poor customer service and does not seem to care for the guests needs or requests at all the rooms also vary considerably there is a part of the hotel that has not been remodeled which has absolutely awful rooms although there were two of us we were given the smallest room in the hotel just over 100 square feetwith a tiny bathroom looking at the floor plan on the door we could see that our room was 12 the size of all the other rooms on the floor and was the only one that size when i asked the next day to change the room i was told that if there was another room it probably wouldnt be available;1
when we saw the hotel and the area we were initially excited until we had to deal with the customer service first of all i would highly recommend not booking a room at empire through one of the cheap hotel sites or pricelinecom or hotelscom first after booking a room for 3 people we were told that we were reserved for a queen standard room with one bed we told them that we needed double beds and the worker informed us that we would have to pay an extra 100 for our room if we wanted a room with double beds because they had nothing available after realizing that we were not going to budge she then said we do have a double bed room in the smoking area we suffer from some breathing issues but in order to be comfortable we had to take the room we were told that;1

the hotel is very nicely appointed with charming rooms and a very nice staff for the most part the problem is that both the downstairs lounge and the rooftop bar were rented out for private parties each of the three nights that i was there with a group of friends the parties were actually a nightclub venue that was run by an outside vendor we stayed in four rooms on the second floor we couldnt get in to either bar and the lobby and sidewalk were packed with people all night music blasted until 400 am the hotel manager was not sympathetic at all and although it was not her fault we felt we had been mislead about the atmosphere we wanted a nice hotel not a nightclub and we couldnt even get in to one of the bars for a drink ourselves;1
iâve just finished a 10 nights stay at this hotel and i decided to write a full review in english language so that itâs understandable to everyone if you think you can sleep in this place you are wrong the temperature of the room is either too hot or too cold it is impossible to open the windows by yourself so when you die of heat at three oclock in the morning you will have to call someone who comes to open it with a chisel going up with their feet on the heating every single time that happened to us the temperature problem is solved by switching off the radiator and getting dressed a lot but its not the biggest problem the hugest problem is that there isnât any chance of sleeping at night because as written in other reviews thereâre hot water pipes that produce;1

this was rated a fourstar hotel by priceline the true quality of the room hardly larger than a queen sized bed is truly two stars but the fact that i was given a smoking room after requesting a nonsmoking room and the evening manager was unwilling to change the room earns the empire hotel just one star when i called to complain about the smell of the room the evening manager nicole said there were no other rooms available i then said that i would leave my review on tripadvisor and she threatened to send hotel security to my room if i did that obviously this is a case of poor training not institutional bad behavior but i would never risk a decent nights sleep here again;1

i am an experienced budget traveller i am happy to have a room not expect more than a bed a bathroom as long as its clean i paid approx â£800 for 6 nights here my first impression of the room was wow this is big i opened the blinds nearly choked on the dust immediately noticed that they had not been cleaned recently the wall paper was peeling off there were dirty marks all over the walls the carpet was tatty all the way round the edges looked like the room had been self catering at some point as there was a random sink in the room empty kitchen cupboards there was a big uncarpeted tatty square which i assume used to be space for a fridge as mentioned above i budget travel so had a bit of a giggle at the shoddiness but was a bit miffed this was the most;1
it needs better services and a microwave to heat up the food and is very expensive and i didnât appreciate how the front desk was calling for check out and sending someone knocking on the door every 5 mins;1
saw online reviews thought it would be nice so booked a stay for 6 nights was put into a room which was so small and worse than a 1star motel and everything in the rooms is 20 years old reasons for checking out of the hotel hotel is dirty hallways are filthy and smell of smoke rooms are cramped up and too small and no where same as pictured everything is old and musty my wifes allergies started to act up feels as if we were scammed as we were showed great pictures and hotel was too shabby no coffee machine couldnt spend any more time there and immediately checked out next morning on 29th jan i talked to the hotel manager and we were not offered any other room and were told you booked the cheapest room in our hotel so this is what you get politely asked;1
where do i start we arrived at 3 in the afternoon for a 5 night stay the receptionist was watching porn on his phone as we tried to check in we eventually got his attention and got are keys for the room if thats what you can call it the towels was filthy with stains all over them as were the bedsheets the room smelled like it hadnt been cleaned since it opened filthy carpets stains on the wall cigarette burns all over the bathroom the window didnt shut properly so you could hear everything going on all night but that was nothing compared to the amount of bites i received from the first and only night we stayed there firm bug bites we had to spend another 600 booking another hotel for the remaining 4 nights and guess what the receptionist was watching on his phone;1
we gave the empire a try for two nights and were appalled while the lobby is nice and the staff polite staying there is not pleasant our room was a somewhat shabby hole in the wall with barely enough space to walk between the bed and the wall to what passed for a closet a niche in the wall with a curtain over it and little space to hang clothes the promised queen bed was a double the ventilation varied from nothing stuffy air to full blast loud and clanking through the night when you got the hotel to get it up and running but you get little sleep in either case the bathroom has no space to put anything nor enough room to shut the door from the inside unless you stand in the shower breakfast at the hotel restaurant was chaotic with no host or hostess to tell you;1
we booked three rooms for a party of 5 only one 205 was acceptable on two nights the room cleaning was late and on one day we had no room cleaning at all room 222 was absolutely dreadful trumpet being played in room next door at any time during night 2am 4am etc plus strong smell of cigarette smoke from that room after two nights we had to request to move room staff clearly knew this was a recurring problem but were unable to do anything about stopping it as it is occupied by a longterm resident the new room 508 was ok the third room 216 was smaller than the other two and had a small dirty nonopening window looking onto a fire escape covered in dirty rags these two rooms were totally unacceptable and i feel that room 222 should not be offered at;1

i have stayed at this hotel several times and although it is a lovely hotel i had decided not to book again after my last visit due to the level of outside noise that made it impossible to sleep at night however my daughter stayed in the summer and had a room on the 11th floor which was both quiet and had a lot of natural light i therefore booked a deluxe double room at the hotel and emailed them three times asking for a room on the 11th floor or above so i good get a good nights sleep prior to travelling home the next day i had no reply to any of the emails but hoped that my request would be adhered to sadly i was given a room on the 7th floor and given an assurance by the reception that it would be quiet this was not the case as well as the usual;1

we began the first leg of our honeymoon in new york the empire was recommended to us as a good hotel in a very convenient location we can say the latter is true but the form was a huge disappointment on arrival we were checked in and asked the staff whether there were any rooms available with a view the staff member was rude and proceeded to tell us there wasnt anything else available in addition we were not offered any help with our suitcases we had checked in to a queen size room and upon entering knew we would not be able to stay another moment in the room it was unbelievably loud which is why i assume they provide ear plugs and next to an airconditioning vent of some sort there was hardly any room for us to move in the room decor and lighting was;1

unless you think that sleeping on the streets is too good for you then you should avoid this nightmare on central park west once you start looking there is no end to the grime the broken equipment the dodgy repairs and the lack of fire safety measures such as exit lighting or fire detection on top of that the service at the front desk was just dreadful and lacking any common sense avoid at all costs and generally speaking make sure that your hotel booking is not firm inspect your room and the amenities before you let anyone charge your credit card;1

upon arrival at the hotel the reception theythought we had arrived a day late and said we were a no show thankfully we had our original booking paperwork to provide evidence that we had arrived on time the member of staff didnât like it that we had proved him wrong and his entire attitude changed towards us he then left us standing at the reception whilst he seemingly worked wonders to find us a room this is when it got interesting the so called room more like a cupboard with 2 double beds for myself wife and 2 kids the room window was a small single window facing a brick wall so much for beautiful views eh i called reception to complain and the rudeness of the member of staff baffled me basically we were told he could not get us any other room and to call back in;1
worst hotel ever and ive stayed in some dumps in my uni years the lobby was covered in building material the staff were rude and unhelpful we were trying to book flights for the next stage of our trip to chicago and no one would help us locate the nearest travel agent we ended up asking the concierge of another hotel the heating was broken the room was so cramped you had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom the smell in the halls and lifts were horrible ill be going back to nyc many times in the future but never ever will i go near this hotel again;1

disclaimer this is not a review of the rooms or other accoutrements of the hotel which are likely just fine i attended a large business function at this facility the parking was validated included included in the price negotiated for the event i am assume however their underground parking height max is about 2 inches lower than the top of my truck i do not have fancy wheels lifts or 4wd so i needed to valet their valet lot is a couple of inches higher so my truck fits had this same problem last year and my parking was covered by them with zero issues this year they charged me and an associate in the same predicament 22 we were there for approx three hours i spoke to hotel manager thomas cook who was the absolute opposite of;1
this is the worst hotel i have every stayed at upon checking in behind us was a homeless person trying to get a free room my children were terrified while we waited for our keys to our room the front desk people were rude and unfriendly we went to our room and it was disgusting there were holes in the blankets and sheets the bathroom was beyond small and had mold in the shower no tub there was a missing cabinet from the wall and bugs crawling around it if you look out the slding glass door you will see the homeless and and the hookers on the street after 45 min we checked out and went to the hilton to a real hotel the front desk did not care about any of our complaints since they had a flood of 50 rooms and wanted to give our room to someone else we still;1

weve made a reservation months in advance and weve never been notified about the rooftop pool being outofuse we found that out when we actually tried to go to the pool room furniture was rather old and squeeky it didnt feel clean at all smelly and torn sheets etc the ac in the room was the loudest piece of machinery ive ever seen including a v8 engine when we told this to the front desk we were told that they will be transferring us to another room so they told us to pack and they would transfer the luggage however after we packed up and leave we were told that there was a mistake and they wont transfer us to another room wo we basically spent 4 hours to packup and unpack again the staff was not friendly at all so i regret every moment staying there;1

worst hyatt ever booked 2 nights from july 20 to 22 over the phone used my 2 free night awards arrived and the first night went by with no problem in the next morning i went out to the city and came back about 7 pm i pulled out the card key to open the door of my room but the key was not working i called the front desk and explained whatâs going on the guy i talked to said the key shouldnât be working as i checked out which i never did he said i need to come down to the front desk i came down to the front desk the guy at the front desk looked very unpleasant and was clearly showing no interest in making an apology he made me a new key i of course thought that was the new key to my room but it was not he made a new key to another room and told;1
this was the worst hotel iâve stayed in in years yet one of the most expensive the room was run down uncomfortable and felt overall dirty because of its state even though we were on the 24th floor the windows may have been the original and we could hear all street sounds the sheets were scratchy and beds felt like a brick i would not recommendfar better hotels in nyc for the same price i thought wyndham had a standard but if this is it i wonât stay at one again;1
the room is 50sq ft it includes a single mattress on a wooden bunk with two drawers underneath and a space to put your luggage also underneath there are two shelves that are not even a foot wide there is no closet and no hangers only small hooks there is no sink in the room unlike most other hotels that have bathrooms in the hallway there are more than 50 rooms per floor all sharing a total of four showers two large sinks and four toilets not surprisingly there is a strong smell of mildew that was almost overpowering especially when brushing my teeth they charge your credit card an extra 50 a day for incidentals which is supposed to be refunded afterwards but there are no apparent incidentals to purchase i have never had any hotel do this before;1
we went to the jane on the 4th for some drinks we were told to wait in line which was odd because there was no line and the place did not seem overly busy usually you can hear the music and the crowd from the st we waited for about 10 minutes while the bouncer and his friend possibly another bouncer casually chatted after about ten minutes they looked at us surprisingly and asked âcan we help youâ as if they had just noticed us when we said we would like to come in they informed us that to get in tonight you had to be on a âreserve listâ as patrons who frequent the bar and hotel regularly we called management and asked if reservations were needed and he informed us none were needed and anyone could walk in we explained to him what had happened and the manager;1

the empire used to be a great place to stay our most recent stay changed our minds on that check in took an hour when we asked for rooms 2 on a higher floor than the second floor rooms we were given we were told no our room did not have heat no coffee maker no working frig one was present but wasnt working and hadnt been properly cleaned hair in the sink and shower drains etc overall very unpleasant in addition on checkout we were told that there is a 20day fee for wifi and bottled water we didnt receive the water and the wifi is pretty bad in any case we didnt have to pay this because we booked our room before this additional fee went into place something to consider if you plan on staying here we were told that this is the new thing;1
the hotels good location is the only thing going for this place i requested for a room with a decent view and i was assured that i was given one but when i entered my room it had the worst view the front desk operates like a train station the staff is least bit interested in talking to you they sometimes even appear disgusted when you approach them flimsy plastic cups in the room 1 accessible charging point in the entire room however they added a time clock with charging on my last night who charges for keeping bags 30 mins after checkout overall a very bad experience completely avoidable;1
i am still at this hotel right now but after two nights i have to share my experience this hotel is in a good location which is why i decided to stay here with my teenage daughter the rest is bad i just fell in the shower because the antiskid stickers are worn totally smooth then when i step out of the shower there is no bath mat and i have to step onto slippery wet tile our toilet has clogged twice there are four elevators and at any given time it seems that only 1 or 2 are operational the air conditioning unit vibrates so we have chairs wedged against it to try and stop the vibration yesterday when we got back to the hotel neither of our keys would work so we had to find a working elevator return to the lobby and talk to the bored people at the desk to fix;1
the empire hotel is well located which is about all it has going for it the bathrooms were the most surprising i have seen in decades of travel and certainly at this price the water never got hot every single shower was freezing cold i tested the temperature 34 times a day over our 4 day stay and never got a hot shower or even hot water to wash up the junior suite had a tiny bath with a crazy shower one ceiling bulb shower light broken the railing was for a normal sliding shower door but had the near side anchored and the far side removed this makes it hard to turn on the cold shower and leads to water all over the floor see photos what were they thinking also why put a soap dish to jab into your thigh they put faucets on the sink too low to wash but;1

we stayed one night prebooked thru our travel service since it is a 3 diamonds hotel we expected at the very least better than average we were at universal studios all day checked in later in the evening my daughter was having problems with asthma so we were anxious to settle her in the lobby at first glimpse was very nice on the way up to our room we realized that the hotel was less than clean huge stains on the ceiling and hall carpeting on entering the room we very disappointed at how shabby and worn it was the carpet was soiled and rippling the furnishings well used the bed coverings were lumpy bedding thin and well used at first we thought the beds hadnt been changed after checking to make sure the beds were fresh my daughter was going to;1

hotel is in a good location and kept in good condition the lounge in the rooftop was nice however ladies at the reception desk were not very friendly or accommodating we went when they were quite busy and rates where high but customer service was extremely low we paid about 400 a night to wait in the lobby after a tired trip room was not ready until 1 hr checkin time i guess they were double booking rooms since we paid upfront for a suite and got a standard room facing a wall and no refunds were offered since we booked thru a travel site all they can say is contact the travel site have them resolve your issue we can do nothing so be ware of paying upfront or thru travel sites as you will be treated as second class citizens;1
there are a few things you might want to considerask yourself if youre thinking of staying here are you comfortable walking through a maze of doors and hallways that smell worse than a frat house after a night of binge drinking are you ok with taking a potentially temperature challenged shower every morning are you prepared to befriend bed bugs they have a no refund policy which should have been the first clue buyer beware however at 100night for a room in manhattan its easy at first to forgive a dark dingy room that smells like a combination of vomit and air freshener combined i understand that hostel living means that you have to walk down the hall to a bathroom but i didnt expect to find filthy bathrooms with roaches and trash on the floor while there;1
this is probably one of the jankiest hotels i have ever stayed in and would not recommend it to anyone for context i was traveling for work for two weeks here is what bothered me no deadbolt on the door no safe in the room no chair at the tiny desk no mini fridge room was minute there was no shelf or counter space no drawers and the closet was a half closet so all of my dresses and pants had a wrinkle in them where i had to fold them to fit the floor was uneven and had holes where it seemed like someone stomped through the floor and they just covered it up with carpet the carpet also felt dirty cold showers for probably 10 of the 15 days that i was there didnt matter what time of the day i showered before 7 am after 9 am 10 pm all of them;1

the sight of a run down lobby and bad smell did not fill me with confidence as i entered the hotel riverside studios and as for the name it is indeed by the river right on the edge of the river but this does not make for a good view or good area after a long and confusing walk around the hotel to our first room we were greeted by cockroaches leaping around as soon as we opened the door this quickly led to us getting our second room which was on the seventh floor which was a pain because the lift was not something you wanted to risk using the carpets all had stains and the buzzing from the fridges and clunking of the plumbing went on all night as soon as we could the next day we escaped to a better hotel after an awful nights sleep not sure what was moving at the end;1

this is the worse review i will have given to a place in a long while the first requirement of any hotel is a good nights sleep impossible here the rooms are steaming hot with no way to lower the heat other than opening the windows and letting all the broadway traffic in which made it impossible to sleep well the room furniture is worse than a college dorm rooms the bed sinks in the middle and is very uncomfortable the bathroom is as large as a hall closet the lobby is ratty just a bad bad experience and i usually give places the benefit of the doubt one nice thing it is near the subway so you can make a quick escape;1

the empire is in a great location that is its only redeeming quality and one that the hotel staff seem to rely on to cover up a multitude of other sins this was my second time staying at the empire the first time i encountered a very large cockroach in my shower while i was showering that was two years ago and i was hopeful that things had improved not so much the empire has very small rooms which is not surprising given that its in nyc what is ridiculous are the bathrooms they are microscopic even by nyc standards a normal size person cannot sit comfortably on the toilet the shower has a fixed half glass wall for what effect i do not know since as a result of only a half door water spills out all over the floor every time you take a shower there is no;1

we stayed at this hotel in september 2013 and it wasnt too bad so when we decided to return to new york for a further short break we booked it again as it was certainly one of the less expensive hotels that we found through an internet search the good points last year and once again this year were the very close proximity to a subway station the excellent manhattan diner which is just a similarly short walk away around the corner and the fact that central park is only about a 10 â 15 minute walk away now for some items from the depressingly long list of negatives â unfortunately the train we were travelling on to new york from boston broke down and it took 3 and a half hours to get the problem fixed therefore we were much later in arriving at the hotel than;1

this hotel is centrally located which is an advantage and the owners know it this is probably why they do not bother about complaints the room and the bathroom were large enough but with no comfort at all 4 nails directly in the wall were the only supposed means to keep clothes the hotel was not able or did not want to provide coat hangers there was not even basic furniture as in proper hotels the room on the gound floor was very poorly soundproofed with a public wifi station on the sidewalk outside the window used to listen to music all night long the price more than 1000 for 3 nights is totally unjustifiable even in manhattan is it useful to add that we would never recommend such a place to our worst enemy;1

try another hotel for location of the lincoln center and columbus circle honestly it seemed as though every employee was unhappy and did not want to be there the incredibly rude front desk and concierge ruined a birthday surprise for my husband days before i called and asked for a bottle of wine to be waiting in our room for him i confirmed that again the morning of our stay no problem they said when we arrived 3 persons denied i had spoken with them with an attitude their solution was to send a bottle up later in day for a charge of 8600 or we could walk to 67th street and buy one housekeeping we kindly asked for more pillows and towels 2 in room and again attitude that we were bothering them reviews on having to stand in shower and turn it on are;1
at the start of the trip things seemed fine we checked in an hour or two early and the front desk person told us that she could put us in a room in a slightly higher floor that was a little larger than the one we reserved for no charge we thought why not when we woke up the last morning of our stay we saw that the bill in fact did have a higher pernight charge than the one i had booked the room under it took about 30 mins downstairs with the front desk person to get the charge reversed as he needed to get his manager unfortunately that was not where the story ends upon receiving my credit card statement i saw that in addition to the charge for the hotel room there was an additional 90 charge on the day of our checkout on march 4th since i or my finace;1

everything sucks at this hotel rooms are dirty beds are very uncomfortable plus they make a lot of noise electricity outlets didnt work furniture is extremely old and dirty there were hairs on pillows towels and on the floor front desk people were rude and didnt seem to care about my concerns and to top it off their chef is rude and racist and he discriminates elevators are extremely slow and the halls are dirty carpet looks filthy and the room had a terrible smell their location is ghetto and their 22dlls a day parking lot spaces are designed for compact cars only overall this hotel has been the ugliest hotel ive ever been into pictures on website are just a bunch of lies plus they ended up with extra fees during check out after i was given a price;1
first we arrived there early in the morning and the man at the front desk told us we could check in early since they were slow that should have been our 1st clue for free their elevators were out for repairs so we had to carry our bags up the stairs and one of the men that worked there actually broke my collegues bag then we get into our room the bunk bed room which we knew was small but it was just too tiny for 2 people but the worst part was the smell that was in the hotel it was just unbearable and hard to describe due to the small room and the fact that we were going to be there for a week we decided to upgrade to the captains cabin which still was smaller than a normal size hotel room to be honest to some this hotel was probably ok for them for us it;1

dear friends please avoid as much as you can the worst place to stay unless the price with tax is less than 70 its more like a motel rather than a hotel the front desk does not pickup calls no matter what timehow many times you call if the operator picks up pretends like transferring but hangs up i saw this first hand when i was waiting to checkin and the phone was ringing and no one at the front desk i arrived late tired after my travel but no one was there at the front desk no bell to call them either so i had to wait around standing for a long time the front desk person was very unfriendly the room key didnt work the first time and i had to come back down it was tiny clean but extremely old and not like the pictures shown narrow corridors the wallpaper;1

unlike every other hotel i stayed in on a recent two month business trip at hyatt lax i was asked to pay 75 for an early check in one must also pay for a late checkout and virtually every minor service or courtesy has a fee attached this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure feels like one most of us have suffered financially during the pandemic however it seems that this big corporation that can well afford it must turn everything into a profit center and pass on its losses to its customers;1

having had to suffer this hotel for my past visit some of the previous reviews are indeed true however one thing i will say straight away there was no evidence of bed bugs at all the lobby is great and alas thats where it all ends it seems that any money spent on the renovation is only done in the lobby area the lifts are okay and small however one of them i was in constantly kept self adjusting its self and took longer than normal to get up to my floor so i used the stairs the stairs are tacky and unclean complete with tumbleweed on them i kid you not the so called gym is just three machines 1 bike 1 treadmill that wasnt working and another machine they have a business centre wow its just a machine selling overpriced telephone cards and overpriced;1

the hotel itself is cute and full of oldworld features this unfortunately stretches to bed bugs we woke with sore red bites on our legs and when we reported this we had to change rooms and give all our belongings to staff to be treated either blasted in heat or wiped with alcohol the issue is obviously rife because they have a code word for the problem bbs and a set procedure they follow the staff were rude and made us feel like we were causing an inconvenience to them we were also given contradictory information from various members of staff about how long the treatment would take after the process my spectacles came back to me broken and when i reported the problem at reception all they would say is we just wipe them with an alcohol wipe and wouldnt accept;1

this is probably the worst of maybe 3 dozen hotels ive stayed in nyc over the years besides the peeling wallpaper the mold on the ceiling the thick brown water coming out of the bathroom faucet the window that wouldnt shut and the accumulated filth on the windowsill missing knobs on the ac heating unit housekeeping not answering the phone front desk not answering the phone the room was one of the smallest ive ever been given took three different rooms before i was able to get one that was minimally acceptable the location is perfect for lincoln center but there is just no way i will ever stay there againand it was more than 400 unbelievable;1

im not the most seasoned traveller but ive managed to stay in quite a wide spectrum of places from youth hostels in the australian outback through exsoviet apartment blocks in ukraine through to â£350 per night cotswold hotels in the uk and i can safely say that the empire hotel has given me the worse two nights sleep in my entire history of travelling my room was on the first floor and fronted the busy columbus avenue the window might as well not have been there i heard everything to people shouting to bins being emptied to cars accelerating from the junctions no peace was found when the outside noise stopped for a few seconds as the walls in the hotel are so thin one would assume rubbing a hummingbird feather on one side of a wall would be audible on the;1

stayed at the windsor hotel with my 15 year old son for 3 nights and can honestly say that in all my travels this was the most awful place i have ever stayed the area is rundown and there were guys on the street hanging out and drinking beer it is not the place for a woman to stayalone with her child but i had never been to new york before and the travel agent told me it would be fine on arrival there was no bell boy and we had to hump our cases up to our room ourselves which was unacceptable as i have mobility problems the safety deposit box is not fixed to the room and can be carried off by anyone entering the room the room was small and clean but shabby we had been informed that the hotel had been recently refurbished but we did not see any evidence of this there;1
we stayed at the astor on the park for two days and found the facilities basic but acceptible for the budget end of the market rooms very small very far uptown though for almost any attractions our main problem came when we when we packed for checkout and found that a new bottle of cologne was missing from the room at the reception desk the most they offered to do was question maintenance staff and the maids that had been in the room we never got the impression that they took the stolen item as genuine with the manager away i was told to call when i arrived back home in the uk i did and the manager agreed to refund to my card but i still havent received my money back no in room safes so be sure to watch your valuables if you stay here i would not take the risk;1

on check in we were charged 5000 accidentally which essentially left us penniless whilst in new york we complained to the service manager who kindly agreed to waive our resort fee 3 days after check out this was recharged to one of our two rooms despite this verbal agreement her response was to deny that this was even tabled our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings solely at the responsibility of wyndham new yorker the occurrence of initial error the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check out is the reason for this clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority;1

what started as a fun trip to the city quickly turned bad when we checked into morningside inn after driving through the night and going all day around nyc we were looking forward to getting to our hotel to relax at 2pm checkin as soon as we walked into the building we were greeting by questionable people milling about and or yelling and the less than friendly receptionist we handed over the room fee of 155 in cash along with a credit card to hold as a safety deposit and we were pointed to our room with the exact words just go through that door over there an unmarked door that led to a sketch narrow and short hallway by this point when we even opened the room to the door we were not in any surprise to what we found the radiator appeared to have been leaking for;1

i recently returned from a weekend in new york and a very brief stay in the riverside studios as many have stated the neighborhood was really nice however the hotel left a lot to be desired the room was relatively clean but the the labyrinth of hallways were dark dirty and had strange fumes i was with a group of 5 and all were ready to checkout after having seen the bathrooms which were absolutely filthy we decided to checkout immediately and upon shutting the room door to leave a large piece of wood fell from above and struck me on the head i would not recommend this hotel for solo female travelers given the dark hallways and complete lack of security;1
pros 1 location the location of this hotel is great with 10 mins walk to the universal studios entrance 2 checkin we arrived early before our checkin time to drop our bags but to our surprise we were allotted a room even before our checkin time and we were able to drop our bags and head to the universal 3 rooms spacious neat and clean with a great view cons 1 service we requested for some toiletries at the front desk we called twice but no one bothered to come to the room and give it us the service at the restaurant sucks we asked for a banana for the breakfast in the morning from 4 different waiters nobody bothered to get it to us finally we had ask the floor manager for it and he got it us 2 food my wife and i got food poisoning after eating dinner;1

during my stay there was a loud party occurring all night i called multiple times to have the front desk or security staff resolve the situation or provide me an alternate room on a different floor for flight crew sleep is so important as this hotel canât even provide an environment for decent sleep the security officers were rude and seemed to be buddies with the party room they didnât offer a room switch from literally 15am there was extremely loud noise pot smoking etc i got no sleep hyatt canât control what guests do but they can control how they respond to the situation and they failed miserably for anyone looking for a decent night of sleep or for professional and courteous staff look elsewhere;1

this hotel is one of the worst hotels that i have stayed in lately i am a frequent traveler i would not recommend it to anyone the area is a medical district not for tourism very seedy far away from tourist areas reception are very abrupt not at all helpful the building is old maintenance is ok what you expect for their ratings in the rooms you have soft plastic cups and only one each per stay no glasses available i was told to go buy them at the nearby store car parking is us2800 per night compared to us25 per day for our hire car the last day we returned to our room found the housemaid had locked herself into our room and when we entered our bags had been searched thankfully only a small amount of money was missing the only positive;1

after our fantastic experience at the hilton anaheim we was let down by the hilton universal city the hotel looks great from the outside but very old fashioned from the inside we are hilton honours guests so we went to the check in and was greeted by an unfriendly member of staff who didnt seem interested in anything we had to say also we wasnt asked if we wanted our bags taken to our room even though there was two bell staff who was talking amongst themselves which seemed to be with all the staff i emailed the hotel regarding a room on a higher floor with a universal studios view which we got but the room was tiny and old fashioned everytime we walked passed reception or any other member of staff they didnt even say hello or have a smile on there face and all seemed to;1

i went alone to this hotel in august 2012 i traveled a lot in my life and this has been definetly my worst experience first of all i was in new york to visit the city and i was looking only for a bed nothing more so the room which was around 4 feet x 10 feet did not scare me also the bed which was long about 6 feet did not scare me even if i could not sleep on my back the most terrible thing was the air conditioning infact despite the temperature in my room was always more than 80 the conditioner was very incredibly noisy i slept three hour and then i did check out never again adieu the jane;1
mmmm where to begin i was critical of new yorks pod 51 for its small rooms and even smaller beds but the jane is on another level the room size is just a joke there is no room to get out of the tiny bed let alone open the door to get out of your hobbit hole and the mattress is of such poor quality i still have severe back pain days after checking out i have never had back pain before so i know this was caused by the bed here to add insult to injury due to a computer glitch my debit card was charged random payments several times during my 2 night stay leaving me out of pocket and financially inconvenienced yet despite reassurances that this money would be refunded immediately to date some 5 days later i still havent received a cent an apology wouldnt go amiss;1

many of the reviews about this hotel rave about its location well the location aint great the hotel is situated around about 105th street so thats atleast a 1 hour walk from times sq 60 blocks away the subway station might not be far but there are no barsrestaurants around this hotel so you will spend every morning and every evening on the metro that said when i got to this hotel i did not even stay here i booked a twin room travelling with my father and on arrival was given a small double room the bed was not even a double bed the woman at reception had the cheek to send us up to the room knowing it was not a twin room the room was dark and looked pretty unclean my father did say the bathroom was ok but i never looked at it i was straight down;1
do not get me wrongthe rooms are comfortable and clean the breakfast offers great selection but the attitude of the front desk employee as well as the front desk manager romin baranov is the worst i have ever encountered in my many trips around the world both were extremely rude to us and the worst is that when mr baranov realized that they were wrong he barely admitted to it and never apologized we tried over and over to explain to them the situation but hethey wouldnt hear us eventhough we were in our rights to request our invoice since the room wasnt booked online but directly at the desk i have been in the customer service for 26 years and i have very rarely encountered such rudeness such lack of collaboration over such a simple requestto receive;1
i purposely reserved the ameritania hotel because of the location i had prepaid reservations and when my wife and i arrived they told us that they overbooked the hotel and due to renovations they couldnt accept my reservations they ended up pushing us to their sister hotel which placed us to a 20 min uber ride outside of all our planned events instead of just walking distance the room was filthy water leaks along the window stains in the tub and torn carpets since i prepaid through a third party i couldnt cancel the reservation without losing money due to being sent to another hotel we also incurred additional charges since we had to ubercab to the places that would have been in walking distance i could only suggest to anyone thinking of this hotel or the bentley to;1

we had confirmed reservations for 3 nights but when we arrived we were supposedly on a waiting list they accommodated us in not one but 2 separate rooms because the newly trained staff did not have the authority to have a rollaway bed put into our room for the 3rd person we ended up paying 100 for each room they made us check out the next morning so they could put us in one room but then again made us check out and check back in the 3rd day all this was very inconvenient especially when we had plans to tour the city the nightmare began when we came back at 430pm the 3rd day to check back in there were no rooms available except for 2 rooms that were recently fumigated for an infestation of ants we asked to view the rooms and decided the first room smelt too;1

i stayed here one night before i left for a cruise the next day i paid 280 for a room hardly big enough to fit a queen size bed the bed was pushed between two walls with no way to walk around the bed there was no bed side lamp only the overhead light which was switched on and off by the door there was no dresser or closet and no place to hang clothes the air conditioning unit did not seem to work very well and there were no instructions for it beyond all of this the room was right on a very busy new york street 8th avenue that was very noisy and the room did not have dark curtains to keep out the light i needed to listen to a recording of relaxing music on my iphone in order to get any sleep this room was a rip off at the price the staff was fine but;1

the location of the hotel is okay but thatâs the only positive i can say about this hotel the place is grubby and unfriendly it is in major need of an upgrade the walls in the rooms are paper thin and there was noise for the entire weekend any interaction with staff wasnât pleasant except for the maintenance guy who came to look at our shower it has no atmosphere and i definitely would not recommend this hotel;1
the price is way too expensive our room was not cleaned well there was no attention to detail there was a used empty wine bottle from previous guests multiple key cards in the room from previous guests the windows were very dirty so the view was not as nice one of the vanity lights was out just did not expect to be charged so much for such a dirty room;1
i stayed for a weekend the room was old and in a very bad shape i understand why the check in was so quick who would want that terrible room the hotel needs serious maintenance it was also extremely noisy and it was impossible to sleep i called the front desk and the guy hung up the phone i had to call again and he said there were no more rooms available the following day i went to talk to the front desk again and i had to speak with multiple very unfriendly people before i got to the manager who finally changed my room terrible experience the new room was supposed to be an âupgradeâ but the it was also in terrible conditions lots of mold and still noisy mold everywhere i am never coming back;1
i left some shirts and pants behind i called a few hours later after i had left and the immediate answer was no have without even checking the value was little but the annoyance was over the top when you walk into this hotel and greet the reception with hello the return greeting is zero i called the reception on his lack of response and he just looked at me nothing to say stay somewhere else the phone didnt work wifi was not working half the time problem with the water pressure heater did not work and had to run 30 minutes before it got hot in the winter i made a formal complaint at the lobby and the manger said the supervisor would not do anything i then asked what do you mean they wont do anything cause the phone is broken wifi not working room is;1

super nasty dump we stayed here at the last minute and only for the location the rooms are nasty dirty and the sheets are dirty with holes in them then when i went to get a drink of water in my bathroom no cups or glasses are provided at all when i called the front desk the person who answered hardly spoke english told me come down here and get a cup if you want one which was strange when i went down he was only willing to give me one small cheap styrofoam cup i had to plead to get two later when i couldnt find the icemaker i called again to ask what floor it was on and the guy told me that they dont have one this dump should be torn down run like the plague;1
well it started with more than a 30 minute wait for check in then i had to go back because front desk did not provide any information about location of fitness center or breakfast etc the next day there was no hot water in the shower fifteen minutes of calling the front desk and no one answered i had to go down in gym clothes to talk to them and they told me an engineer would look at the problem sometime in the day so after having a cold shower i went on with my day and came back to find the keys demagnetized front desk fixes and then tells me they donât have a credit card on file for me after i show them that theyâve already taken a 150 deposit on check in they insist on taking another imprint of the card this is the last time i will stay here the only;1
the lounge of the hotel looks great but when you go up to your room you will soon see that that was the best place of the hotel no room for parking your car you have to pay for the wifi which is really bad the rooms are small and not so great the elevator makes noise just like the airco and the people that clean the roomsthe pool was out of use very expensive breakfast the only positive of the hotel is the location near metro and central park but i would never book this hotel again;1
the staff will keep you wait for 2 hours in the room for just a bottle of water the time is about 1am the room key may not function suddenly and you need to go to the front yo get a new one no staff will say any sorry to you the intenet is also very bad totally no speed;1

this hotel is cheap and is close to the subway which is great but it was so horrible and dirty their free wifi didnt work in our room so we had to go stand in the stairwell two floors up their cooking facilities include a microwave only that didnt actually work properly but the worse thing was seeing they had taken 100 us off our credit card for no reason a few days after wed left when i called i was told it is a mistake and will go back into my account this didnt happen so i emailed and called again and again and always got a very defensive manager i ended up having to go to my banks dispute department and eventually got it back 3months later i wonder though if they do this in the hope that every so often they get away with it anyway i would recommended;1
i stayed while some renovation was going on but that is no excuse for the condition and the lack of concern for the conditions the room was nice albeit small dry wall dust covered the hall and was tracked into our room by ourselves as well as room service hairs in the bath area trash in trash cans however when i found a used condom on the floor under the chair i was disgusted i repeatedly asked for a manager but got no where i would never stay at this place and could never recommend it to anyone with so many wonderful hotels to stay in nyc and at these rates why in the world stay here;1

after probably hundreds of hotel stays this hotel was the was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in the only redeeming factor is the proximity to the subway they rent most of the hotel out to a college for dorms or vacation stays this means that the hotel is extremely loud and filled of drunk students every night i was woken up by kids screaming up and down the hallways as for the rooms they are extremely small and filthy i had to buy flip flops for the shower like a true college dorms i had a leak in the bathroom that i complained about everyday and after day three nobody had come to look at please please do yourself a favor and book at any of the other hotels this hotel is listed at 35 stars but thatâs only because of its lobby the rooms are not better than;1
ok it was the height of summer when we stayed but the pokey little room was like an oven a little more familiarity with new york would have meant that i would have spotted that as the place is built right where broadway narrows into columbus ave and that this was unlikely to be the most tranquil spot but it was noisy noisy noisy we had the option of being deafened by the air con 1950s style window mounted tractor engine powered contraption and gently roasting or turning off the ac and boiling to death and being deafened anyway by the equally loud incessant traffic just below the window the first awful night we also had parties of what sounded like dozens of loud spanish speaking shouting rather people careering up and down the corridor pausing periodically;1

i have to say that the experience we had on this hotel was really bad we expected a completely different service the room was way too small when we did the check in the lines were so long and they took so much time just to give us our room the location and the cleaness are the best things of the hotel so if you are coming to the new yorker you better think it twice because the relation between price of staying here and the true experience you will receive will never worth it;1

ive stayed in many hostels in many different countries and have never been so disappointed the room was not only bare bones but there was no box spring on the bed only two mattresses on top of one another i wouldnt even complain about this if the mattress was at least comfortable but instead you would sink in wherever you laid down the dirty mattress was covered by a flat sheet that wasnt sized correctly so it often came undone no fitted sheet this is not the type of mattress you would want to be touching without a sheet to act as a protective barrier although you found some comfort in having a sheet between you and the filthy mattress the sheet provided was also not clean we found several hairs on the sheets which did not belong to me or my boyfriend there;1
iâll start with the positives 1 location of the hotel is fantastic especially if youâre seeing a show at msg well that was quick letâs move on to the rest 1 hotel is super old and outdated rooms beds bathrooms etc 2 it will take forever to get an elevator up to your or down to your room it actually might be faster walking factor at least 10 15 minutes one way into your travel time 3 housekeeping i had a family suite with 4 people there were two bath towels in the room i called down at 330 pm for more at 11 pm i called back down for additional towels as i hadnât received them and was told it might take a bit bc there was only one person on duty by the time i get the towels iâll be back home and able use my own 4 biggest issue i booked this room;1

i stayed at the empire for 2 days my room was very very small it felt like living in a closet the view was very bad almost non existing when you first enter your room you are greeted by the hundreds of things they want to charge you for its very irritating it feels like theres price tags on everything in the room the rooftop is supposed to have a cool bar but i couldnt go up there even though i was a guest of the hotel this is mainly why im giving the hotel 1 star if it wasnt for this id give a better rating i strongly recommend you to book a room at another hotel for the same price you can get a much better hotel i recommend the new york palace it may be more expensive but its a hell of a lot better;1

when i checked in the hotel was very busy and when i asked if they had any quiet rooms they pretty much said i was out of luck the room i stayed in was very small which is expected for manhattan and was also facing the street also expected the windows appeared to be older doublepane and were really not doing much to block out the street noise in the room it pretty much sounded like i was standing outside in the street being a light sleeper this was very much a problem i was so desperate i actually tried curling up in the tiny shower and shutting the bathroom door to get a little shut eye needless to say i didnt sleep at all the night i stayed there if you can sleep with a lot of noise the hotel would probably be fine for you otherwise;1

the hotel is in a convenient location for getting around the sights of new york and accessing public transport even if the neighbourhood itself isnt the most appealing the hotel is rather run down and the rooms fairly small albeit that is reflected in the price generally cheaper than other central ny hotels all this would probably have given a 3 star rating however about a week after i returned i checked my credit card statement to find they had taken a 60 charge from my account which i had not authorised bizarrely the charge was dated a couple of days after we had checked out and was for valet parking we didnt take a car there was no mention of the charge at check out the money was refunded or adjusted to use their words after some email correspondence;1

my fiancã©e and i booked this hotel for our annual nyc trip on priceline the rates were much better than similarly situated rated hotels in the city and it was a last minute trip so we thought we had gotten luckysadly we were sorely mistaken aside from the fact that this place seems thrown together read other reviews about room size bathroom design etc the closing mechanism on our door did not function and our room was broken into on the first day we were there and my ipad was stolen both my fiancee and i have traveled extensively and never had this happen so when we went to report this we were surprised at how awful the experience turned out being upon reporting our room was broken into the security officer gave some vague excuse that he was too busy;1
this experience was not a good one the service was average the hotel leading towards our room smelled musty and mouldy our room was dark and well outdated a queen bed only had three pillows so we had to ask for an additional one we were most disappointed to get into bed on the first night to discover instead of a quilt we had a thin blanket one night we were in bed it was about 11pm and out of nowhere a male housekeeper was outside our door looking into a cupboard yelling and swearing about having walked up 6 flights of stairs to only find one sheet ill leave out some of the choice phrases he used but he then proceeded to slam the cupboard door and every other door he used to leave the floor it was lucky we were both awake otherwise he would have no doubt woke us;1

visited ny for my aunts 90th bday they live walking distance from the hotel this and the bed were the only positives we had two rooms the first room was in the stairwell if you must stay here do not stay in room 409 the room was small the wallpaper was torn and there was a hole in the wall the room was very small and dirty we were able to move to a renovated room the second night which was much larger this room had an armoir that was already warped and broken there was a hole in the carpet and the bathmat looked like it was cut out by a 2 year old the sink had two cold knobs the doors look and feel like they are only somewhat secure even when locked there was an old musty smell throughout the hotel and it looked like any rif raff off the street;1

i letterally could not sleep from these awfully loud heaters they have these old time devices with the sound of a train whistle and if you shut em off you will freeze in this time of year i have no idea how people sleep in this hotel just buy your piece of mind and opt out for a better hotel;1
we handled the outdated rooms but the loud âchantingâ cussing and banging on the doors was horrible not sure what type of company this place keeps our kids were scared by the 230 am wake up calls outside of the room we also were told that our room was fancy compared to some of the other rooms which was surprising since the left side of the bed seemed to have a large rip or gash in it;1
arrived around 1930 local times after what felt like a week travelling queued to get out room key and then was greeted by the receptionist really not the greeting i was expecting very little greet at all just a simple welcome i proceeded to explain that it was my wife and i 10 year anniversary and we had chosen their hotel for our stay no response the receptionist proceeded to talk with her colleague after getting our keys we were collared over to join club wyndham thanks for the offer but honestly id been travelling for hours on end wasnt exactly the right time for that we booked through a travel agent online and it was made clear on the booking that it was our 10th plus i contacted the hotel before we arrived on to that so i tweet at the hotel waits a day;1

i was there for a business trip they double charged me over 500 dollars on my personal card no invoice for that and then obviously no one answers the mails and we never get to talk to a manager what sort of hilton is this i strongly advise not to go there if you are not permanently in the us intentional or not the management of this situation is totally unprofessional;1
thereâs a reason the rate is too good to be trueâ thereâs no air conditioning completely unacceptable for a midtown hotelâ and 4 stars what a joke changed room 3 times to finally be told by a manager âwell itâs an old building and itâs hot outside so all the guests are using the acâ shame because the hotel and amenities are actually nice and the location unparalleled but lack of ac in the summer leading to humid moldy rooms changing hotels tomorrow;1
desk staff were unhelpful and seemed to enjoy it had to end up speaking to the manager now i see where they get it she was very arrogant and condescending enjoyed flexing her authority they charge outrageous for parking i see one reviewer said 35 they charged me 45 i wonder where that extra money went if they will steal from you at the desk they will steal from you when you are out of your room terrible neighborhood lots of sketchy people hanging around the hotel looks like they rent some of the rooms by the hour there were holes in the walls there were scuffs all over the walls that were painted bathroom had holes in the walls this place and the management is a dump;1
this hotel is being used for housing people who appear to be the equivilant of dhss boarders the hotel is very shabby the staff are very sullen the whole experience could easily put the average traveller off of returning to this wondeful city the whole experience was one of feeling that we had been ripped off for a considerable sum of money to stya in a doss house there wewre kids running in the hallways doing thjeir homework the noise was constant day night fromm the fellow guests the only saving grace which is purley coincidental is the proximity to the subway station do not go if you are in any way expecting anything better than a 1 star hotel;1
this hotel does not offer parking at all you need to pay 40 per night not included in your cost of the room not a good deal rooms were filthy dust everywhere mold wallpaper was falling off the walls the staff was rude the worst experience ever;1
the room i stayed in room 712 had a horrific smell of mold the sitting room was dark had a lumpy old multiple iron burned carpet with an equally old couch bedroom was pretty much the same i found myself awake at 2 am with a screaming headache likely due to the mold smell this room should not be used i cant speak to other rooms in the hotel but if i had another option i would have preferred leaving the hotel for another and eating the nights cost cheaper than other hotels in the area but by no means cheap at 300 per night bad news;1
i previously had given this hotel a somewhat positive review partly because for whatever reason they always gave us a free upgrade to top floors that have been remodeled and are ok on our last visit we were offered a 50 upgrade for presumably a nicer room and a fruit basket and few other trinkets and we declined they put us in room 1004 my god the wallpaper was falling off it smelled it was truly disgusting we couldnt wait to get out of there the next morning we stayed in the past in part because of the rate but if we have to pay another 50 a night to get the top floors it isnt worth it;1
myself and my husbandboth in our early thirties stayed at riverside for a 2 night citybreak shopping and partying holiday in august 2007 we found the hotel extremely basic and felt that it wouldnt be rated as any type of hotel or even hostel in ireland the first day we got there we dropped our bags and left immedialty as its not a place you would hang around in getting drunk both nights helped us to sleep in our new abode as we didnt feel comfortable in the place the 1 2 3 subway lines were 2 blocks away on 72nd street the sheets had hairs on them and there was mould under the bed however the floor wash hand basin and fridge were clean the air conditioning was fine but noisy there wasnt a bathroom on to the room so we had to leave the room and walk down the;1

this place is grubby and dangerous the only plus side is that the bedsheets and towels were clean but that was it the towels often had holes clean holes the bathrooms were disgusting with rotten doors presumably eaten away from water damage at the bottom the tiling floors and walls were gross and needed to be scrubbed at least but realistically needed ripping out the carpets in rooms and particularly corridors were dirty and sticky you certainly wouldnt walk barefoot anywhere paintwork was the brown paint which you get when you mix all your left over paint together and then let a child paint the woodwork truly low standards plug sockets hanging off walls curtains dirty and difficult to open close as rails were mucky windows did not look like theyd been;1

this was the third time we have stayed at the empire hotel over a number of years despite a good location in upper manhattan and near central park the hotel needs a good clean and restoration and they urgently need to improve the decor and their service from installing free wifi to cleaning the carpets we encountered problems with check in where a prebooking at not been received and the room rate had been increased staff were brusque and rude it all feels mass market and impersonal now with shoddy decor and some exorbitantly priced commodities such as the bottles water in the room at 750 will try to find a better place to stay next time and we wont be returning to empire hotel;1

we stayed here a while ago it was a dump i never reviewed it then checking hotels for a trip to ny next year it came up on my screen i recognised it straight away although the place has had a bit of a facelift think jocelyn wildenstein though if you are going to stay here the room was so small that we almost fell on the bed when we walked into the room the view from the window a brick wall about a metre away for some reason we paid more than the canadians and americans staying there it is in a really nice part of ny with some really good restaurants and a fantastic deli garden of eden had to google it a few hundred metres away on broadway and a bus that goes to jfk just outside the door stay somewhere nearby;1

check in went smoothly but it was downhill from there there are 2 very slow elevators serving 13 floors and after coming out of the elevator i was greeted with the strong aroma of food being cookedand found my room was located in a stairway the room itself was small as expected for new york and furnished with a double bed two night stands with lamps a desk with lamp and a chair and a combined tv console 3 drawer dresser the desk extended into the room somewhat blocking one of the night stands and was so close to the bed that it was very awkward to be seated which meant that most people ended up sitting on the bed enough people had done this that the top of the mattress had shifted about 5 inches from the bottom of the mattress creating a mattress with an overhang on one;1

i recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and would never stay there again due to the standard of the bedrooms and the situation of the hotel the rooms are very very dated and seem as if they have not been updated since the 1980âs the corridors are very shabby the area in which the hotel is situated is run down and not an area you want to be walking around on your own at night time the positives about the hotel are the staff every member of staff was helpful friendly and went out of their way to assist you this is definitely not a 4 star hotel;1

went to nyc for beauty con and when we got to this hotel we could not believe how we were treated the man at the front desk refused us a room meanwhile we had it booked for months he was prejudiced against us because my cousin asked to be close to an exit it was the worst experience i have ever witnessed we had all our bags and luggage and had to be out in the city streets with nowhere to go it was horrifying and embarrassing when bookingcom called the hotel they said it was because of the exit thing as well the man also spoke very broken english which didnât help his unprofessionalism i strongly advise you to find another hotel disgusting i hope this happens to one of his relatives so he can see how it feels to be left in the street with your luggage for a hotel;1

my friend and i stayed here last spring break we wanted something central and on the cheaper side and thats what we got the rooms were fairly clean we were on the second floor on the back side so quite quiet staff was friendly and helpful breakfast great but a huge negative part of our trip was the neighborhood this hotel is located in there is no restaurant in the hotel so you must leave the hotel in the evening to eat of our 4 nights there was not one time that we were not followed whistled at yelled at sneered at by locals it was awful we made the mistake of taking the subway it was scary sketchy and awful we did not feel safe while staying here and dreaded coming and going we ended up blowing most of our budget on having a trusted cab driver;1

my partner and i had been staying in another new york hotel on holiday when our flight was cancelled due to the volcanic ash from iceland we needed cheaper accommodation than we had and the hotel riverside studios was fairly close by and looked clean and was very reasonably priced i had not read the reviews as we were in a hurry to get somewhere at a cheaper price initially this hotel looked better than i expected but it became clear that first impressions were deceptive the room we had a double was absolutely freezing due to the fact that the shutters on either side of the airconditioning unit which is fitted underneath the window did not shut completely so the window is effectively open all the time i told the man on reception who looked at me like this was one;1

it is old run down dirty and on the verge of collapse seriously our room was 2 floors above the subway that rumbled through our room every few minutes 247 the floor in our room was so bad it had about a 4 differential from one area to the next like walking on an uneven trail but covered with dirty 1960s carpet so you could not even see the trip hazards hidden below with a board or two here and there still at elevation and the rest having dropped inches as young seniors we had to be very mindful to not trip and fall with each step we notified the management they did offer to put us up to the 3rd floor but this room was tucked away without any light so we declined gave notice we were leaving and book another room on a sunday so we paid a premium but at least we;1

i was booked into this socalled hotel as a twonight interim stopoff as part of a package including two cruises either side of the new york stay thank goodness that it was only for two nights as it was so grim and depressing that i could not wait to get out of the place within 15 minutes of setting foot in it the staff were helpful and friendly the rooms were relatively clean and i was offered the option of a smoking room which is quite a rarity in these authoritarian times however these were the only positives which i could find in favour of the place the astor is situated right at the northern tip of central park west so it is by no means conveniently or centrally sited the subway ride into central downtown ny took 15 to 20 minutes while the transfers;1

we booked this hotel thinking it was the best value in la because it had a pool included breakfast cheapish parking it also looked in relatively good decorative order from photos in reality it wasnât very nice our room and therefore all our belongings became infested with ants from their drains pics attached most of the facilities are okay but the rooms are in horrible decorative order and didnât feel very clean this therefore made me not want to use the pool if you get an outside room rather than a courtyard itâs also incredibly noisy the hotel kept turning our electricity off so our phones wouldnât charge over night i rang 4 times to ask them to stop turning it off until they admitted they were via their computer systems very strange;1

ok so we chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in nyc but couldnt afford 500night we paid only 97night here but it was way worse than a budget hotel the room was fairly clean but nearly impossible to move around it tiny was not even the word for it and we had a standard size room the worst part of our experience were the beds the room smelled like smoke which made our stay difficult enough but the beds were the worst beds ive ever slept on we booked two nights and only stayed for one dont bother wasting your on this place stay somewhere in nj where there are beautiful hotels and its close enough to nyc that you can come and go as you please dont bother with this place;1

this was the most disgusting hotel i have ever stayed in it felt and looked like a homeless hostel i do apologise to homeless people i dont mean to sound rude do not believe the statement that it has received a refurb we saw no evidence of this the sheets were old and ripped the bathroom had mould in the silicon and grout and rust in showerbath which it looked like they tried to cover up radiator was propped on blocks of wood the double bed was not large enough for the both of us we are both of average size the decor was dull and poorly finished doors didnt fit the frames the lock was loose the room was tiny and felt grubby staff were unhelpful in this respect the lift felt unsafe the stairs were narrow and uneven flooring do we have anything good to say;1

i was sceptical after reading the reviews on here and then though to myself people only bother writing about the bad stuff right wrong i wish id listened to what people were saying you are lured into a false sense of security when you arrive at the hotel the lobby is nice and makes you think the rest of the hotel will be but it isnt my first room was like something out of a 1950s horror film it was old dingy and very very dirty as in inch thick dust around the skirting boards curtains that didnt close tape around the windows etc everything id read about previously and decided not to believe we decided we only had to sleep there and would just deal with it we went out but on retuning found water pouring through the light fitting in the bathroom from the;1
we just got back from our trip to nyc we waited too long to book our hotel and ended up short on affordable options the only positive i can say is that it was at least a safe place to sleep in thatâs it it was filthy our bed had hairs in it the shower was dirty the carpet was disgusting my husband and i were given two towels and one wash cloth like total for our stay we never did find an ice machine the hallways were dark dingy and very stinky overall it was a disappointing stay but for a last minute booking and a pretty cheap rate i guess it did the job;1
on check in we were charged 5000 accidentally which essentially left us penniless whilst in new york we complained to the service manager who kindly agreed to waive our resort fee 3 days after check out this was recharged to one of our two rooms despite this verbal agreement her response was to deny that this was even tabled our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings solely at the responsibility of wyndham new yorker the occurrence of initial error the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check out is the reason for this clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority;1
if i could rate this hotelâs restaurant as zero i would we waited for over an hour for foodlistening to the family at the table behind us complain that their food was cold on delivery when ours eventually arrived my husbandâs chips were cold steak overdone the worst was our daughter has food allergies and the food wasnât cooked correctly we queried her meal with 2 members of staff who said they would check but of course they didnât we were absolutely disgusted with the standard of service and care and we certainly werenât the only customers who felt the same my son in law has a business account with this chain and will not be using them again;1

i was staying in nyc for only one night and wanted to avoid paying 300 for a hotel room downtown well you get what you pay for the website made the jane look like a chic boutique hotel with fancy amenities and small rooms what they dont tell you is that there are many residents still living there from the buildings days as an sro rooming house for the poor i had no idea to expect this as the website neglected to mention this needless to say there were many unsavory people roaming the halls and when i arrived back at the hotel at 1230am the front desk was empty this made me feel quite unsafe the communal bathroom is also coed so when you step out of the shower in a very small bathrobe you dont know who might be standing there and the shower was;1
first of all i will mention that the only good thing about this hotel is the bell boys they went above and beyond to help the staff at front desks are absolutely dreadful no help at all the elevators are all knackered three times we got locked in them we started taking the stairs to the room which was on the 10th floor the stairs were shocking as you can see from one of my pictures there was loose mains wires hanging out the wall if a child was to even go near the stairs it could have been dangerous the room the room was an absolute disgrace as you can see from the pictures it was filthy every day something new would go missing from our room small items like a pair of gloves then it was a pair of trousers when we checked into the room there was an old pair;1
i was attracted to riverside studios for the same reason as everyone else here the price as a first time new york visitor i didnt know that this also meant an extreme sacrifice of quality the hotel is made up of four different buildings glued together as you walk through the front hall to your building you pass all kinds of colors odors and people who live there mostly the elevator must be years older than the building itself very slow and very unsafe you could open the door while it was moving the outside of the rooms have no uniformity it seems like they shoved a room into every single piece of space possible no matter how unproportinal the rooms became the lock was extremely flimsy you could push the door open a crack even if it was locked;1

i am a world traveler and this was honestly one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in the fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie i have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel the lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent but this is all a lie as soon as you get off the elevator to your room the hallway is dim carpets are old walls need painting and it smells musty the rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned the bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay there was hardly any counter space above the sink and they;1

our stay was awful we reserved by phone and asked specifically about onsite parking we were told the hotel had parking onsite and they quoted a price per day this was a major factor in our deciding to stay here when we arrived we found that the on site parking was actually a hertz parking garage a block away and we had to carry our luggage the front desk had one person on despite long lines and several employees behind the desk laughing and chatting our tv didnt work even after maintenance came the wifi never worked the tub wouldnt drain which made my shower a delight the front desk tried to bill me at 40 more a night than my confirmation email quoted the elevators were tiny 45 people at a time and so the wait was very long we will not return;1

spent a week at this hotel and was really disappointed so much so one of the first things i did was to email the manager but not even had an acknowledgment from her i also completed the online survey early yesterday anyway here is my honest review we arrived early as our original flights had been cancelled when i say early it was a maximum of two hours earlier than we would have got our rooms i had asked for two rooms together via email before we left the uk and was told they would try and arrange it we arrived only to find nothing had been done about my request the receptionist informed me we could have one room but would have to pay 25 plus taxes to have it two hours earlier after a very long 24 hours i agreed he then managed to swap this room with;1
the hotel room was small but the price was right as an aol user i left my computer on for hours believing this ramada offered free local calls as most ramadas do there was no announcement anywhere by telephone in hotel portfolio or on contract at checkin that there was a 10 cent per minute local phone charge the manager roman baranov could not have cared less about my situation and actually said that i should have used the internet the ramada provides at a 10 per day charge instead he could have waived the charge 220 for two local phone calls but he refused the deceptive hidden charges and bad management make me never want to stay at another ramada again too many other hotel choices anywhere in the world to put up with ramadas indiferrence;1

before making a booking with hotwire in the us we looked in detail at the hotwire website information read the testimonials they have on the website and looked at trip advisor hotwire was promoted as reputable company that offered quality travel deals below published prices however we were very shocked to find that the hotel we had booked the windsor hotel supposedly in the financial district and supposedly usually priced at us 375 was a rundown hotel in chinatown staffed by people with very lowlevel english language skills the room was quite dirty smelt funny and was furnished very shabbily there were people in the street outside talking and you could hear every word from inside the room we have stayed in better hotels in rural china as soon as we saw;1

all of the staff could not do enough to help make our stay as comfortable as possible however the hotel thwarted all their attempts the hotel was dark and dismal inside with an uninteresting lounge area the room was very small and cramped but gave a great insight into the statement that new york never sleeps one either stayed awake because of the awful noise of the air conditioning or the extreme heat because it was turned off it is the only hotel i have ever visited that makes a charge for using coffee facilities in the room it was very convenient for central park and there was a bread shop a few yards away that was excellent for breakfast plenty of restaurants in the vicinity not however a place i would be excited about visiting again;1
